The Foundation Kit is one of two frameworks or large collections of classes that comprise Cocoa. It provides classes for dealing with strings, collections, memory management, communication, threading, et cetera. Most of the functionality  in a Cocoa application that is independent of the application's interface can be attributed to classes residing in the Foundation framework.

== Foundation Locks ==
An NSLock object is provided as a less-portable alternative to using POSIX locks in the Cocoa Foundation Kit. A simpler alternative is to used the @synchronized Objective-C directive.

== Grammar ==

I've never heard &quot;punctuations&quot; as the plural of &quot;punctuation&quot;, only &quot;punctuation&quot;.  Same with &quot;casing&quot;. It'd be like writing &quot;informations&quot;. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:03, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

: Referring to more than one at a time might be a rarity, which could be why [[wikt:punctuations|punctuations]] and [[wikt:casings|casings]] is rarely seen. [[wikt:informations|informations]] is also a word, but I think that might be used more often in British English. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:31, 8 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Swedish, only the name of the country is considered a name, and thus capitalized. Nationalities and languages are written with lower case initials. The same word as that of the language are generally also used when referring to female nationals.

The general rule here is [Root]ien (country), [root] or [root]ier (nationality) and [root]iska (language). For example: ''Bulgarien'', ''bulgar'', ''bulgariska''. Smaller countries outside of Europe often have in Swedish the same name as in English, e.g. ''Botswana'', ''Costa Rica'' or ''Afghanistan''. Names ending with -stan are usually the same, although the different way to Latinize Cyrillic letters (''kyrilliska bokstäver'') to Swedish, alters some of them slightly, e.g. ''Tadzjikistan''.

'''Notes:'''
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) For reasons of political correctness, ''amerikansk'' is at times switched to a prefix ''USA-'', e.g. &quot;den amerikanska industrin&quot; becomes &quot;USA-industrin&quot;.
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ''franska'' refers only to the language, a French woman is called ''en fransyska''.
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) ''spanska'' refers only to the language, a Spanish woman is called ''en spanjorska''.
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) ''finländare'' refers to all citizens of Finland, those whose native language is Finnish are called ''finnar'' (sing. ''finne''), those whose native language is Swedish are called finlandssvenskar. ''Finska'' refers to the Finnish language and to a female ''finne'', female ''finländare'' are ''finländskor''.
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) ''Japan'' the country is pronounced with stress on the first syllable: [ja:pan], ''japan'' the nationality is pronounced with stress on the last syllable: [japa:n].

= SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol =
Normally attributed to the TCP/IP port 25 the SMTP is the result of boiling down the following RFCs

* RFC 821 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (Standard)
* RFC 1870 - SMTP Service Extension for Message Size Declaration (Standard)
* RFC 2821 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (Proposed)
* RFC 2822 - Internet Message Format (Proposed)
* RFC 2920 - SMTP Service Extension for Command Pipelining (Standard)
* RFC 3030 - SMTP Service Extensions for Transmission of Large and Binary MIME Messages (Proposed)
* RFC 2487 - SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS (Proposed?)

Technically, some of these make up ESTMP, but I tend to lump them all together. Where I deal with emails, there doesn't seem to be much difference (or I don't know any better).

NB: I'm going to rant a little in this. 

Even though I do provide links to the above RFCs, I haven't taken the time to go read them. That's the job of someone who writes the MTA ;) I just find bugs, fix them if I can, and try to kill off any much junk from getting to my users as humanly, and computationally, possible. My use of should in the following areas is based on personal opinion and experience, not the RFCs. Although they do generally match, I'm a lot more strict on what is acceptable.

You may also notice that I say to reject the mail at certain points in the SMTP conversation. Why not? If the other end is a mail server then it's quite capable of making a bounce message and sending it back to whom ever wrote the email, AND it will be in a format that the local system administrator will know and can deal with. If it's a spam engine or a virus, then your bounce message becomes a spam itself - if you reject before accepting the message, there's no bounce message made.

== HELO/EHLO ==
Allowed - valid hostnames &amp; IP's&lt;br&gt;
[x.x.x.x] - Not likely to find a mail server that does this any more, but I still accept it.&lt;br&gt;
mail.example.com - perfect.

Dis-allowed - The rest!&lt;br&gt;
x.x.x.x   - missing the square brackets&lt;br&gt;
ms_server.example.com - underline is an illegal character! (MS$ puts it in place of spaces - oops)&lt;br&gt;

The hostname provided at HELO time should resolve to IP address of the host connecting. The reverse IP could match the forward, but with the increase in small business on ADSL (and other BB links), many servers don't have access to their rdns records.

== MAIL FROM: ==
Supposed to be the email address to send all bounce messages and any status update messages to. Usually the person sending the email, a script that handles bounces, or something else you can think up. Spam senders make up fake ones (for now) so this is a good way to kill off a lot of it. Verify it with a callout, or whatever your favorite MTA provides. Long live [[http://www.exim.org Exim]]

Email addresses should be in the form &quot;Real Name&quot; &lt;email@domain.com&gt;

== RCPT TO: ==
To whom are you sending your email?&lt;br&gt;
The final recipient of the message. This should be validated at this time with possible dictionary attack prevention. This is a minor mung of the Standards (so I've been told), but has reduced the amount of traffic by at least 50% at some sites. It also stops spammers using your MTA as a host for bounce spamming (Many servers accept bounce emails with a lot less restrictions that normal emails).

See MAIL FROM: for format.

== DATA ==
The meat of the message. Should filter this for spam and viruses and reject here if there's something wrong. Save the world from useless bounce messages.

Format is Headers followed by an empty line, the message body, and then CRLF.CRLF (full stop on a line of its own).&lt;br&gt;
Headers a single line things - Header: content&lt;br&gt;
If wrapping is required, the second and further lines must start with a white space.

Body can be pretty much any 7bit [[w:ASCII|ASCII]] character.

I'm sure there's a million other things to add to this, however, that's why this is a wiki! Contribute away.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Ben, I think this is great!

I'm glad I'm not the only one with these crazy ideas :-).

It would be great if, besides the ambition to translate the Shulhan Arukh, you also could contribute a [[Mishnah]] now and then!

In terms of setting up a project like this, there is probably a lot of background material you could borrow from the [[Mishnah]] project.

Also: you might want to decide if you are doing a ''translation'', or if you also want to include study aids. If the letter, then you are in the right place: Wikibooks. If the former (just a translation), then this probably belongs at Wikisource.

Thanks, Dovi!  I moved my project ot WikiSource, since I want to focus only on translation.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ben. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ben~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

Kirt Walker, MEE, MD, FAAEM   Houston, Texas

I am joining [[User:Paris Lovett|Paris Lovett]] in development of the [[Emergency Medicine]] Wikibook OCTEM, the Open Source Textbook of Emergency Medicine as it gets off the ground in May 2005.

I am a practicing emergency physician in Houston, Texas and long-time health informatician - fascinated with the develoment of tools to assist in the practice of medicine and emergency medicine specifically.

I am a Rice Electrical Engineer (1970) who went to medical school to find something interesting to do with computers. I love programming these machines to do interesting things. Most recently I am finishing another masters degree in health informatics at the School of Health Information Sciences (SHIS)

I can be reached at kirt at hal-  pc.org. (remove white space)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Health Informatics (HI) is the academic field or profession of 1) applying computers to medicine and 2) studying and developing theories of information, knowledge and thought processes of the practitioner-users, that is the cognitive science and cognitive engineering of physicians, nurses and all users of these information devices.

HI is deeply rooted in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_science translational science], a cross-disciplinary practice of analyzing datasets derived from clinic records and clinical research data and translating the results into future decision-making in many health-related disciplines, including clinical practice, clinical research, computer science and engineering, human-computer interaction (HCI), cognitive science, psychology and others.

HI covers a spectrum from applications (getting something to work) to theory (studying how it works or why it doesn't).

There are many special interests within HI which match up with the many particular specialties in medicine, such as nursing, radiology, imaging, laboratory medicine (pathology) as well as emergency medicine.

It is used when the agent of the verb is unknown, but can also be used (as in this example) to put more emphasis on the person or thing which receives the action as opposed to the subject.

# Put each chicken breast in a plastic bag and flatten with a meat tenderizer. Coarsely [[Cookbook:Chop|chop]] the basil, and then throw it in a deep baking pan along with some flour, oregano, and toss the chicken with it.
# Melt 2 tsp of butter in a medium fry pan on low-medium heat. When the butter stops bubbling, add the chicken and brown each section approximately 3 minutes for each side. Once this is done, cover and set aside on a separate plate.
# Drain off most of the liquid from the pan, and raise the heat. Pour a dollop of olive oil in, and sear the asparagus quickly. Remove this and set aside.
# Keep at high heat, add the marsala and 1/4 of the stock. [[Cookbook:Boiling|Boil]] off for a few minutes. Lower the heat, and return the asparagus to the pan. Add the remaining stock and boil off to reduce. Add a tsp of butter, and cover chicken with sauce.
# Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

At various points during this, you may want to grind some fresh pepper and sprinkle salt over top of the sauce or chicken,;do so according to your tastes.

This serves 4-6, depending on serving size.

'''Crabs''' are crustaceans related to [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], [[Cookbook:Crayfish|crayfish]], [[Cookbook:Lobster|lobster]], and [[wikipedia:Krill|krill]].

Crabs are usually [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] whole. Often just the legs are served, along with the portion attached to the leg and the claws. In landlocked areas, often the only way to obtain crab is those previously caught and frozen.  Frozen Snow, King, and Jumbo crabs generally retain flavor fairly well. They are usually frozen right after cooking and then shipped frozen. 

To prepare previously killed and cooked crab, it only has to be reheated, so it can either be steamed or baked. If a sufficiently large steaming basket is available, place the crab inside and steam for about 10 minutes until heated through. It is commonly served with melted butter which can be clarified first and with lemon optional. 

Live crab is fresher and tastier, however. If preparing live crab, you will find two main schools of thought: those who put the live animal into a pot of boiling water and those who, finding this inhumane, kill the crab just prior to preparation. To kill the crab before boiling, the usual method is to flip the crab onto its back and lift up the apron (the triangular flap pointing towards the head). You will notice a small hole. Drive a sharp screwdriver or slender knife quickly through the hole. Do not be shy: you want this to be a strong thrust that reaches to (though not through) the shell on the other side. Prepare immediately afterward.

Whether live or freshly killed, the crab should go into a large pot full of heavily salted boiling water. Extra seasoning isn't required, but adding a spice mix such as Old Bay can add tremendous flavor to the final result. Putting the crabs in will lower the water's temperature, so cover the pot and bring the water back to a boil. Then reduce to a simmer and cook for 12-15 minutes for crabs under three pounds, 15-20 for larger crabs. 

Once done, remove the crab and rinse with cool water to stop the cooking process. Next remove the apron; once it has been removed, stick your thumb through the hole left behind and lift up to remove the outer shell. Pull off the gills (the feathery grey ring) and decide whether you wish to keep the brownish insides. They are called tomalley and are the crab's guts, if you will. Tomalley is edible (and considered a delicacy to some), so scoop it out and serve alongside the crab if you like. But you can also simply rinse it out under running water if you prefer.

At this point, all that is left is to crack open the crab, extract the meat, and enjoy.

== Dairy ==
=== Cow's milk ===
[[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] in cooking provides flavor, moisture, and thickness. It is important to consider the different qualities of the vast array of plant-based milk options in order to decide which will best suit the particular recipe. When using plant-based milk instead of cow's milk, you may want to cut down on any other sugars in the recipe. There is no recipe that can not be made just as well using a cow's milk substitute, it all depends on selecting the right one for the job.  

;Water
:Replacing cow's milk with water can serve to add the needed moisture but frequently the results in less rich foods; there, the alternative is to use plant milk.
;Soy Milk
:[[Cookbook:Soy Milk|Soy milk]] can generally be substituted directly for cow's milk in any recipe, though it does not curdle in the same way cow's milk does when heated.

:There are a massive variety of soy milks available. Soy milk also comes in an unsweetened variety.  There are also refrigerated brands.

;Coconut milk
:[[Cookbook:Coconut Milk|Coconut milk]] is a wonderful substitute for cow's milk and cow's cream in many recipes. It has a thick, rich and sweet taste, which suits some vegan cream sauces and cream soups well. It also doesn't become grainy like soy milk. However, it is one of the few plants that has saturated fat in it.  The fat is, however in the form of MCFA's (medium chain fatty acids) that are easily and efficiently processed into energy and are considered to be beneficial to heart health.
;Rice milk
:[[Cookbook:Rice Milk|Rice milk]] is relatively watery and grainy. 
;Oat milk
:[[Cookbook:Oat Milk|Oat milk]] can be very thick and creamy.
;Almond milk
:[[Cookbook:Almond Milk|Almond milk]] is also somewhat watery, but has a rich flavor. Almond milk also comes in an unsweetened variety.

=== Buttermilk ===
Add one [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] to one [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] or rice milk. Stir, and let stand for 30 minutes.

=== Butter ===

;Margarine
Most  are made with oils, which are generally considered to be bad for human health, as they raise bad cholesterol levels. Margarine is also made by emulsing stabilizers such as protein powder, starches, or gums with oil. This technique may be better for human health, but is not widely adopted. 

It is worth noting especially that many margarines may contain some sort of milk by-product to make them taste more like butter (e.g.; Whey, Lactose, Sodium Lactate, Casein - a milk protein, etc.) so a good rule of thumb is to read the labels and do your research. If you don't know what something is, write it down and do a search for the ingredient later.

Under most conditions, vegetable oil may simply be used as a replacement for butter or margarine for cooking and baking, using the measurement of 1 cup butter/margarine = 3/4 cup oil. Adding a tablespoon of a good vegetable or nut milk will provide more of a creamy/dairy-type taste if desired.

In some recipes, butter is a major ingredient, as in [[Cookbook:Icing|icing]], and margarines often leave a greasy feeling in your mouth if used as a substitute; this is because the melting point of margarine (33-43 °C, depending upon formulation) is often higher than the temperature of the human body (37 °C), while the melting point of butter is below it (32-35 °C). In these situations [[Cookbook:Cocoa Butter|cocoa butter]] can be used, since it has a melting point closer to that of butter (34-38 °C).

;Vegetable or canola oil
If a recipe calls for one stick of butter (1/2 cup), use 1/3 cup of oil. 

;Flax oil
Use it as a topping for potatoes, rice, popcorn, etc.  Used in eggplant or tempeh dishes, some people think that it can create a &quot;fishy&quot; taste for appropriate dishes, but this is not the opinion of everyone.  Not generally heated or used for cooking.

;Nut butter
Nut butter can be made from almonds, cashews, or other nuts. Peanut butter, though technically made from a legume, is also considered part of this category. When replacing butter with a nut butter, use the same amount as listed in the recipe.

;Coconut oil
Raw coconut oil is becoming increasingly available and can be used to substitute for butter. Note that while solid at room temperature, it melts at a lower temperature than butter and is unsuited for making pastry (unless you can chill the room significantly). Raw coconut oil is great spread on baked goods and can also be used in cooking. Note that processed coconut oil is not the same product as cold-pressed raw coconut oil and has been shown to be detrimental to human health.

;Applesauce
Use for sweet baking only. Use the same amount you would for butter. Especially yummy in brownies! For muffins, etc., replace up to 3/4 of the butter with applesauce, using vegan butter for the rest.

;Prune puree
Use in the same way as applesauce: Puree 1/2 cup of pitted prunes with 1/4 cup of water. You will want to reduce the amount used, or the final product may be too moist. If the recipe calls for a half cup use 1/3 cup instead. You may also want to add a little oil, maybe a tablespoon per cup of fat needed, because a little fat goes a long way in taste and texture.

=== Cheese ===
Most substitute cheese is made of soy, though there are also nut varieties. Beware: some soy cheeses contain casein / caseinate, a milk derivative.

Replace cottage cheese or ricotta cheese with crumbled tofu in lasagna and other dishes.  Adding a little [[Cookbook:Miso|miso]] can give a &quot;blue cheese&quot; flavor.

Products marketed as vegan cheese have a cheese-like taste and melt well (including on pizza) and are available in Mozzarella, Monterrey Jack, Cheddar, and other flavors.  Some are allergen-free, cholesterol free, and trans fat free.

Cashew cheese or [[w:nutritional yeast|nutritional yeast]] &quot;cheese&quot; sauce may also be appropriate for some dishes.

Vegan cream cheese is available in various flavors and without hydrogenated oils.

=== Cream ===
Vegan cream substitute has a very similar texture to real cream and tastes quite similar.  Rice-based creams are good for those who don't want or can't have soy, but are allergic to nuts and so cannot have oat-based creams.

Coconut milk also is a great substitute for cream in many baking recipes. One part raw cashews with one part water, blended till smooth, also functions well as a cream substitute - especially because cashews are naturally a little sweet.

=== Yogurt ===
There are a variety of soy yogurts (&quot;cultured soy&quot;) available that can be used in place of dairy yogurt. Coconut yogurt is also available.
Oats can also be fermented to make a delightful and cheap yogurt.

=== Mayonnaise ===
Vegan mayonnaise is available in canola oil (&quot;original&quot;), expeller-pressed canola oil, grapeseed oil, and organic expeller-pressed soybean varieties.

== Eggs ==
Eggs have a varied role in cooking; as a wash they provide a glossy texture to breads, when the whites are whipped they provide volume, sometimes (as in pancakes) they are simply traditional and play no structural role, other times they are used to make mixtures stick together.

Vegan egg replacements are generally not good for washes or where they are a major component, as in [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]].

==== Baking ====
The following amounts are intended to replace 1 egg.

1 1/2 tsp. vegan egg substitute + 2 tbsp. warm water (multipurpose baking)

1/4 cup tofu, add to blender with enough water/ soya milk to blend smoothly

1/3 cup [[Cookbook:Applesauce|Applesauce]] (muffins, brownies, and cake)

1/4 cup Soy Yogurt (Quick breads, muffins, cakes)

1/3 cup [[w:Pumpkin|Pumpkin]] Puree (for pies and baking)

1/2 small mashed [[w:Banana|Banana]] (for quick breads, muffins, cakes, and pancakes)--helps browning

1 heaping Tbsp. Soy flour plus 1 Tbsp. Water (muffins, cookies and cakes)

1 Tbsp. ground flax plus 2 Tbsp. Water; mix well before using

(Note that the strong flavors of some substitutions such as banana or pumpkin will come through in the finished dish.)

==== For Binding ====

To bind things like burgers, use mashed potatoes, bread crumbs (blended), blended tofu, cooked rice/oatmeal, nutritional yeast, flaxmeal, or tomato paste.

For the firmest binding, and if you are not actively avoiding gluten, use &quot;gluten flour&quot; (also sometimes marketed as &quot;vital wheat gluten&quot;).

==== Other ====

The following can be used well in certain recipes, to replace 1 egg:

*'''Tofu''': 1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:Tofu|Tofu]] blended. For dense cakes, brownies and the like, use only 1/2 cup to replace 3 eggs for lighter/fluffier baked goods, and add a teaspoon of arrowroot or cornstarch for cookies to keep the right texture. Bad for pancakes. Leaves no taste.

*'''Flax Seed &quot;Gloop&quot;''': 1 tablespoon flaxseed, finely ground in blender or coffee grinder or 2.5 tablespoons pre-ground flaxseed + 3 tablespoons water (for pancakes, breads, and other baking)&amp;mdash; distinct earthy granola taste great for things like pancakes, and whole grain items, such as bran muffins and corn muffins. It is perfect for oatmeal cookies, and the texture works for cookies in general, although the taste may be too pronounced for some. Chocolate cake-y recipes have mixed results, I would recommend only using one portion flax-egg in those, because the taste can be overpowering. Seed quality was investigated by means of a grain moisture meter. Measurement of moisture in the soil is an important indicator for the growing of grain.

*'''Arrowroot powder'''
*'''Agar powder''': Use with recipes that call for egg whites. For each egg white, dissolve 1 tbsp plain agar powder in 1 tbsp water. Whip, chill and whip again.
*'''Vegan egg substitute''': A versatile, commercially available egg replacer made from potato starch, tapioca flour, and vegan leaveners. You can find it at natural/health food stores. One whole egg = 1 tsp vegan egg substitute powder + 2 tbsp water. Tastes chalky.
*:To make something similar to commercial egg replacers:
*:*Mix together 1 tsp Baking Powder, 1/2 tsp Baking Soda, 2 Tbsp Flour,  3 Tbsp Water.
*:*A heaping tablespoon of soy flour or bean flour mixed with a tablespoon of water. 
*:*2 tablespoons of cornstarch beaten with 2 tablespoons of water.
*'''Baking powder mixture''': 1 tsp baking powder, 1 Tbsp water, 1 Tbsp vinegar; or 1 1/2 Tbsp water, 1 1/2 Tbsp oil, 1 tsp baking powder
*'''Yeast mixture''': 1 tsp yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup warm water
*'''Apricot puree''': 1 Tbsp

== Honey ==
Honey comes from an animal source. Some good substitutes include:

*[[Cookbook:Agave Syrup|Agave syrup]]: a general-purpose liquid sweetener derived from the agave plant. (additional note: agave syrup has a low glycemic index and is appropriate for low-carb diets)
*[[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|Maple syrup]]: a syrup produced by the Maple tree.
*[[Cookbook:Golden Syrup|Golden syrup]]
*[[Wikipedia:Date syrup|Date syrup]]

== Meat ==
Meat can be replaced with varying degrees of success by tofu, [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]], [[Cookbook:Seitan|seitan]], [[Cookbook:TVP|textured vegetable protein]], vegetable or nut mixtures, or a commercially available meat substitute.

Many Asian foods stores have false meat available. False [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]] is especially realistic, but there is also false [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Duck|duck]], and [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]]. These are usually made from [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]], but often also have [[Cookbook:Soy|soy]] ingredients.

== Miscellaneous ==
=== Fish Sauce ===
Fish sauce is made of fish. This cookbook has a recipe for [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce (Vegan)|vegan fish sauce]].

=== Worcestershire Sauce ===
Worcestershire sauce is traditionally made with anchovies. There are many vegan Worcestershire sauces. Some grocery store brands of Worcestershire sauce are also vegan.

=== Broth &amp; Bouillon ===
Chicken or beef broth can be replaced by a vegetable broth or by vegetable bouillon cubes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Being vegetarian, it's hard to come across good examples of local specialities that I can eat on my travels, since most local specialities seem to involve pigs in some way or another. However, when on a trip to Bath, in a lovely café, a very nice chap made me a plate of mashed potatoes with spring onions chopped up on it, which he said hailed from Ireland. It was the best plate of mash I've ever had. Doesn't sound much, but the quality of the potatoes, spring onions, and the massive pools of butter in which it seemed to be drowning all came together to provide something that was almost Italian in its quality and simplicity, and which went down beautifully with a good beer. The best simple lunch I've ever had; am not going to attempt its recreation, to avoid dissapointment. 

My Girlfriend wouldn't kiss me for the rest of the holiday, because she said my breath stank of onions.

Mashed potato with scallion (spring onions) and butter is know as 'champ', and is, as far as I know, particular to the North of Ireland. 



== Black pudding is not Irish ==

I'm from Northern Ireland, and here black pudding is just short of being dispised. It's very much a British thing.</text>

__NOTOC__
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian cuisine]]

This recipe makes enough dough for one 23 cm (9 inch) covered pie. If your pie only requires a bottom crust, use half this recipe. Note: for best results, make the full recipe.  If only a single crust is required, make the full recipe and freeze half for later.

In contrast to [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], pie crust and other pastries should be made in a way that minimizes the development of [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]]. Once the water has been added, the dough should be worked as little as possible, to minimize toughness in the finished crust.

== Ingredients ==
* 310 grams (2 1/2 cups) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 6 grams (1 teaspoon) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 4 grams (1 teaspoon) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (optional)
* 225 grams (1 cup cold) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 95 ml (1/3 cup plus 1 Tablespoon) cold water

== Procedure ==
# Whisk flour, salt and sugar together in a deep bowl.
# Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour mixture.
# Using a [[Cookbook:Pastry Blender|pastry blender]] or two butter knives, cut the butter into the flour until the butter is in small pea-sized pieces.
# Add cold water; cut the water into the flour-butter mixture with the edge of a rubber [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]] until it is evenly moistened and will hold together when pressed.
# Form the dough into a ball with your hands, kneading in any loose flour. This should be done as quickly as possible to avoid melting the butter in the dough.
# Chill the dough for 10-20 minutes.
# Cut the dough evenly in half.
# On a lightly floured board, roll each half out until it will cover a 20 cm (9 inch) pie dish, with about 2 cm (3/4&quot; inch) overhang.

# Lay the bottom crust in the pie dish, ensuring that there are no gaps between the crust and the bottom of the dish.
# Fill the crust with the pie filling.
# Place the top crust on top, leaving equal overhang on all sides.
# Cut the overhang to about 2 cm (3/4&quot; inch) all around the pie.
# Working around the pie, hold the bottom and top crust overhangs together and tuck the combined overhang into the pie dish behind the bottom crust.
# With the forefinger and thumb of each hand, pinch the ridge formed by the tuck into a decorative edge, or press this ridge with a fork.
# Brush the top of the pie with milk, and sprinkle with sugar.
# Cut vents in the top crust so that steam can escape.
# For a fruit pie, bake on the lower-middle rack of an oven at 220 °C (425 degress Fahrenheit) for 30 minutes to set the crust, then at 180 °C (350 degreess Fahrenheit) for 30 minutes to cook the filling. 

Note: When baking two pies at once, rotate the pies 180 degrees at 15 minutes and 45 minutes to ensure the crust does not burn due to its proximity to the oven walls.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
;Vegan: Use a [[Cookbook:Vegan_Substitutions|hard vegan fat]], such as [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] in place of the butter. (used for the images shown above)
;Traditional: Use [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], which is less saturated than butter and produces the flakiest crusts.
;Top Crust Colouring: Brush on lightly beaten egg white to colour crust instead of milk.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motion in One Dimension ==
As physics, at its essence, is the study of motion, we will begin our book with the study of motion, in one dimension.  

To simplify our discussion, we will want to create a model of the real objects we will be discussing.  Thus, we create the concept of a &quot;particle&quot;.  A particle, simply, is a very small object, one whose length, width, and height are negligible.  With this concept of a particle,  we can unambiguously define the distance from it to the origin, without having to worry about from what point we measure the object.



=== '''Position''' ===
[[Image:Particle.png|right|thumbnail|Position, when restricted to the ''x''-axis, can be described as a single number ''x'']]
Consider a particle restricted to movement along a single line.  Its position can be described with a single number, ''x''.  This number can be thought of as the particle's distance from the origin, or the magnitude of the vector pointing from the origin to the particle.  The actual displacement of the particle is actually a vector with one entry (because we are working in one dimensional space), but because the direction is known it can be specified unambiguously by the magnitude alone.

The value ''x'' is measured in meters, and in order to interpret it, a particle and a ''reference frame,'' or coordinate system, must be implied.  If the particle does not remain in the same place at different times, then the value of ''x'' will change in time, and thus we can define a function ''x''(''t'') which returns the position of the particle at a point in time ''t''.    
   
For example, say we have a particle with position function ''x''(''t'')= 2''t''.  Its position at ''t'' = 3 is ''x''(3) = 2(3) = 6 m along the ''x''-axis.   
 
For a particle with position function ''x''(''t'')= ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5, its position at ''t'' = 7 s is ''x''(7) = 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5 = 54 m along the ''x''-axis.

=== '''Velocity'''  ===
[[File:Position Function Graph.png|right|thumbnail|The graph of a position function.]]
Consider the graph of a position function.  Under any known physical conditions, this function must be continuous &amp;mdash; if it were discontinuous, that would allow the possibility that objects could spontaneously jump from place to place.  Furthermore, as we shall see at the end of this section, the position function is also twice differentiable.  Under these conditions, we are able to see that the function has a well defined rate of change everywhere.

Velocity, in one dimension, is the measure of the rate of change position per unit time, and is measured in meters per second.   The simplest way to measure velocity is to measure the time position of a particle at two different times, and divide the change in position (displacement) by the change in time.  As a formula:

&lt;math&gt;\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i}&lt;/math&gt;   
 
where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the final and inital distances respectively and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the final and initial times. 

Notice that since the numerator has units of length and the denominator has units of time, the quotient has units of length divided by time.  In SI, the units of velocity are the derived units of meters per second.  Common non-SI units of velocity include [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_per_hour miles per hour] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_%28speed%29 knots].
  
'''Example 1:'''  A particle starting at the origin has moved 27 m in 9 s. Find &lt;math&gt;\bar{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\bar{v} = \frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i}   

= \frac{27\ \mathrm{m} - 0\ \mathrm{m}}{9\ \mathrm{s}-0\ \mathrm{s}}   

= 3\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt;   

'''Example 2:'''  A particle starting 23 m from the origin has moved to 43 m in 5 s. Find &lt;math&gt;\bar{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\bar {v} = \frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i}   

= \frac{43\ \mathrm{m}-23\ \mathrm{m}}{5\ \mathrm{s} - 0\ \mathrm{s}}   

= \frac{20\ \mathrm{m}}{5\ \mathrm{s}}   

= 4\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s} &lt;/math&gt;   


There is a limit, however, to what average velocity can tell us. For example, it's entirely possible that the speed of a particle varies with respect to ''t'', and we want to determine the velocity of the particle at a certain instant in time.  To do this, we take the average velocity over a smaller and smaller time interval, that is, 

&lt;math&gt;\ v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;   

Expanding this, we get

&lt;math&gt; v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{x(t_f) - x(t_i)}{t_f - t_i}&lt;/math&gt;

And rewriting &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; as t and t+&lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, we get

&lt;math&gt; v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t + \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the definition of the derivative.  Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;\ v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;   


'''Example 1:'''  A particle's motion is described by the equation &lt;math&gt;\ x(t) = 3t^2 + 5t + 2&lt;/math&gt;. Find a) the particle's velocity function, and b) its instantaneous velocity at ''t'' = 4 s.   

a) &lt;math&gt;   

v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}   

= \frac{d}{dt} (3t^2 + 5t + 2)   

= 6t + 5&lt;/math&gt;   

b) &lt;math&gt;   

\ v(4) = 6(4\ \mathrm{s}) + 5   

= 29\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}   
&lt;/math&gt;

==='''Acceleration'''===
Just as the time derivative of a particle's position function has a significant meaning, that is, its velocity, so too does the time derivative of the velocity function. In this case, it is known as the ''acceleration'' of the particle.  You may have heard of acceleration previously, such as when referring to cars or other vehicles.  Acceleration is measured in meters per second per second, or m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, read 'meters per second squared.'  Some old texts use the equivalent phrase 'meters per second per second.'

Average acceleration, or &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}_x&lt;/math&gt; is similar to average velocity in that it is independent of the path taken by the particle; it is simply the change in velocity divided by the change in time:   
 
&lt;math&gt; \bar{a} = \frac{v_{xf} - v_{xi}}{t_f - t_i} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;   

And again, through a similar derivation, we arrive at the definition of instantaneous acceleration:

&lt;math&gt;a(t) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;   

Since the velocity is a derivative of the original position function, we can also say that the instantaneous acceleration is the ''second derivative'' of the position function, which would be written as follows:   

&lt;math&gt;a(t) = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercises ===
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given a particle moving in one dimension with position function ''x''(''t'') = 5''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ndash; 8''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 20:
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine the velocity ''v'' as a function of time ''t''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the acceleration ''a'' as a function of time ''t''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At what time(s) will the particle come to a momentary stop?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At what time(s) will the particle's acceleration be zero?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A particle in simple harmonic motion has a position defined by the function ''x''(''t'') = (80 cm) sin [(20 s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)''t''].
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine the velocity ''v'' as a function of time ''t''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the acceleration ''a'' as a function of time ''t''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the period of the particle's motion?  (That is, how long does it take for the particle to return to the position and velocity at which it started?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excluding the effects of air resistance, an apple falls from a tree with a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the apple's velocity ''v''(''t'')?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the apple's velocity after one second of freefall?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the position ''x''(''t'')?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the position after one second of freefall?  Two seconds?  Three seconds?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Motion in Two or Three Dimensions ==

Describing the motion of a particle in two or more dimensions can be more complex than in one dimension, because, instead of having only two directions in which to move (back and forth along the ''x''-axis) there are an infinite number of paths a particle can take.  In order to properly describe the motion of a particle, we must use vectors.

=== '''Position''' ===

When dealing with motion in one dimension, we could describe an object's position with a single variable, its location along the ''x''-axis. Now that we have two or more axes, we need one variable ''per axis'' to describe a particle's location. We can use a position vector, denoted '''r''', to describe the location of this particle. In the two-dimensional case, the position vector is drawn from the origin to the location of the particle in the Cartesian plane and has two coordinates, the ''x''-position of the particle, and the ''y''-position of the particle. 

'''Example 1''': The position of a particle at (4, 5) on a Cartesian plane can be described as 4 units along the ''x''-axis, and 5 units along the ''y''-axis, or as the position vector '''r''' = &lt;4, 5&gt; = 4'''i''' + 5'''j''', where '''i''' and '''j''' are the unit vectors in the x and y direction, respectively.

From this example, we can see that a position vector takes the form &lt;''x'', ''y''&gt;, where ''x'' is the distance moved along the ''x''-axis and ''y'' is the distance moved along the ''y''-axis.

'''Example 2''': A carbon atom sits 7.0 nm east, 0.5 nm north, and 3.0 nm below the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope.  Its position vector '''r''' = &lt;7.0 nm, 0.5 nm, &amp;ndash;3.0 nm&gt;.  Taking '''i''' to be east, '''j''' to be north, and '''k''' to be up, '''r''' = (7.0 nm)'''i''' + (0.5 nm)'''j''' + (&amp;ndash;3.0 nm)'''k'''.

=== '''Displacement''' ===

Recall that the displacement of a particle is the difference between its initial and final positions. In two dimensional motion, we denote the displacement vector as &amp;Delta;'''r'''. The displacement vector is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; \Delta \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_f - \mathbf{r}_i &lt;/math&gt;

The direction of the displacement vector is the straight line between the starting point and the termination point of a particle's path.

=== '''Velocity''' ===

As with motion in one dimension, we still retain the concepts of average and instantaneous velocity; the only difference is that we now must treat the change in position as a change in the position vector. Thus, the average velocity in two dimensions is

&lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\Delta \mathbf{r}}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

Since, like displacement, &lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} &lt;/math&gt; is independent of path, the direction of &lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} &lt;/math&gt; is along &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

Like its one-dimensional analog, the instantaneous velocity '''v''' is calculated by finding the time derivative of the vector displacement '''r''':

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
COUT &lt;&lt;SAFA;

=== '''Acceleration''' ===

Just as with the one-dimensional case, the average and instantaneous accelerations can be calculated using derivatives and limits.

The average acceleration is given by:
&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{a}} = \frac{\mathbf{v}_f - \mathbf{v}_i}{t_f - t_i} = \frac{\Delta \mathbf{v}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

The instantaneous acceleration is given by:
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Initial Comments ==
As Cocoa is not only the name for a set of frameworks/APIs (primarily Foundation and AppKit but including many more) but also the name for an application environment within Mac OS X this topic will need a clear introduction and careful use of terminology.

I will wait for interested parties to discuss the direction of this book before making wholesale changes but I propose that this book head in the following direction:
=== Book Outline ===
==== Overview ====
* The Cocoa Application environment
* Cocoa Applications
* Cocoa Frameworks
** Foundation Framework
** Application Kit Framework
* Possible Languages
** Objective-C
** Java
** AppleScript
** Others (Python, Ruby, Shell Scripting, Tcl, etc)

==== Beginning Cocoa Programming ====
Creating an example (AppleScript?) program from installation through to compilation to show readers the basic tasks involved in writing an application.
* Developer Tools
** Installing Developer Tools
** The Development Environment
* Starting the Project
* Building the Interface
* Writing the Code
* Running the Application

==== Cocoa Principles ====
Start building an example Objective-C program (refer readers to [[Programming:Objective-C]] if necessary?) to teach Cocoa programming principles and basic features.
* Objects
** Root class (NSObject)
** Basic Cocoa objects
* MVC
** Model
** View
** Controller
* Object Modelling
** Entities
** Properties
* Creating a Graphical User Interface
** Windows
** Views
*** Controls
*** Menus
*** Text Views
** Connections

==== Common Cocoa Features ====
Add some additional features to the program that introduce intermediate features.

==== Completing a Cocoa Application ====
Complete the program and incorporate advanced Cocoa features.

=== Other Comments ===
As this is a Programming Cocoa book (not a programming OpenStep or GNUstep book) I think that in general it should focus on Cocoa. A chapter or part devoted to how the book relates to GNUstep would be helpful for those who are interested but I think trying to make the entire book relevant to both Cocoa and GNUstep programmers is going to add unneccessary complexity and end up confusing both.

Additional topics obviously need to be added to Parts 3 &amp; 4. Splitting features into &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; can be somewhat arbitrary but should help divide the book into more manageable chunks.</text>

[[File:Pupusas.jpg|275px|thumb|Pupusas]]

A '''pupusa''' is a stuffed [[Cookbook:Tortilla|corn-tortilla]], usually served with a spicy [[Cookbook:Coleslaw|coleslaw]] called '''curtido'''. This recipe makes both. Pupusas originated in El Salvador, but immigrants have taken the dish to other Central American countries and beyond. ''Pupuserías'', places where pupusas are sold and/or eaten. 

Pupusas are hand-made and thick. Like all corn tortillas, they are made using [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|corn masa]]. They are stuffed with one or more of the following:
*[[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] ''(queso)'' (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese called Quesillo)
*[[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] pork rind ''(chicharrones)''
*[[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] ''(pollo)''
*[[Cookbook:Refried Beans|refried beans]] ''(frijoles refritos)''
*''queso y Loroco'' (loroco is a shrub flower bud from Central America)
There is also the ''pupusa revueltas'' (with mixed ingredients of cheese, pork, and [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]]).  Pupusas are usually served with curtido and [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]. They are eaten with the fingers.

==Preparing the dough==
There are different brands of corn masa to make the dough. MASECA, which can be found in most large American supermarkets in the international section, is one of them but there are others. Follow the instructions on the bag for making tortilla dough, and make as much dough as needed. (One pupusa uses about as much dough as two tortillas.) Once the dough has been prepared, set it aside while you prepare the filling.

==Three Fillings==
===Cheese===
*3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of shredded [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (use hard and cream cheese mixed together; you can mix frying cheese, [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]] and ricotta
*3 or 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]]
*1/2 to 1 cup of Loroco (this will be hard to find in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|U.S.]] So you can use very finely chopped [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green peppers]] or [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]] instead)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
**Or to avoid all these complications, try find a specialty store and buy queso con loroco( you won't get the authentic flavor from a pupusa if you use American ingredients)

Make a paste with these ingredients. To avoid the paste leaking, it should not be too soft.

===Chicharron (Pork Rind Filling)===
*1 cup cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] (cooked with [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], see below).
*4 - 5 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green pepper]]
*Salt to add taste.

Cook bacon with some garlic (optional). Set [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] aside but do not discard. Once cooked, grind bacon with the tomatoes, 1 green pepper, and salt to taste. Mix with some of the bacon fat until it has a soft consistency

===Revueltas===
Ground and [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] beans (they can be canned or prepared from your favorite recipe).

When filling the pupusas add beans, chicharrón and cheese (or combine two of the three).

==Making the pupusas==
With two tablespoons of dough make a ball using your hands and later clap your hands until you make a round, thin ([[Cookbook:Inch|1/8 of an inch]] thick) tortilla. Continue making more tortillas this way. Put filling over one tortilla, cover with another and push down the sides to close them. This is the &quot;beginners&quot; method.

People who have experience do it this way: make a ball with the dough. Insert your thumb in the ball and make a hole in the center. Fill that hole with the filling, close the hole by pushing the dough on the sides up. Clap your hands carefully so that the filling doesn't come out and flatten the ball.

Cook on a slightly greased [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]], [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|pan]] or electric pancake griddler and cook over low-medium heat ([[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|325-350°F]]) first one side, then the other until they are cooked. Each side will be ready when it no longer sticks to the pan (depending on the thickness of the tortillas, this might take 4 minutes or more per side).

Pupusas are topped with pickled cabbage and tomato sauce. 

==Curtido (pickled colesaw)==
*chopped [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] that has been quickly passed through [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] water
*medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], finely shredded
*cooked [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]], not too soft (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Beet|beets]] (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]] (optional).
*[[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]], finely chopped (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] or [[cookbook:Lime|lime]] juice
*water
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

In a glass or plastic jar with wide opening mix all the ingredients. Add vinegar and water to taste. Mix with a [[Cookbook:Wooden Spoon|wooden spoon]] (never metal). Put the mix in the refrigerator and let it rest for a week so that the ingredients [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickle]].

Oddly enough, '''refried beans''' ''(frijoles refritos)'' are only [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] once. The prefix &quot;re&quot; is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] prefix meaning &quot;very&quot; or &quot;well&quot;, inappropriately tacked onto a non-Spanish word.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]], especially [[Cookbook:Pinto Bean|pinto beans]] or [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (optional) or home-rendered [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] (optional)

==Procedure==
#If using dried beans, wash them then cover with water in a medium pot and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] according to the package directions. You may add onion halves or a [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] bone, which you can remove at the end. 
#If using canned beans, rinse them briefly before use.
#Smash the beans, perhaps with a potato masher.
#Add home-rendered lard or butter, totaling up to 20% of the total. (25% of the amount prior to adding) (optional, or you may use a substantially smaller amount of some other oil or omit entirely)
#Fry the beans, stirring and turning them until they thicken to the degree you desire, which can be anywhere between soupy and parched.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is possible to make your own truing jib. Start by getting an old bicycle fork and finding a way of supporting it. The easiest way is to find a sturdy box, and drilling a hole big enough to accommodate the fork neck. The hole should be tight enough to firmly hold the fork and the wheel which will be supported. The fork is now upside down. It is possible to fashion some kind of true indicator or caliper using a nail or pencil attached on one leg of the fork. A metal strap that can be attached with a screw as a pencil or nail holder works best. I try to avoid using tape, string or rubber band since they have a tendency to move which could affect an accurate reading of the wheel's straightness. Straight wheels tend to turn smoothly without deviation when viewed from the front. I start by bringing the nail as closely as possible to the wheel rim. Turning the wheel by hand, warped wheels will occasionally touch the rim or show a large gap. Wheel spokes work by providing enough pull or release on both sides of the rim so that the rim remains straight. By loosening one spoke, the tension is strengthened on the other side and vice-versa. Ideally the spokes on both sides should be even to maintain optimum rim straightness. A sequence of tightening and loosening both sides of the spokes where necessary is the key to rim straightness.</text>

A '''peeler''' (sometimes '''potato peeler''' or '''vegetable peeler''') is a kitchen utensil used to remove vegetable peels, particularly from potatoes. Often it will have a semi-sharp point that can be used to gouge out bad spots.

Does anybody remember what the Japanese word for ''counters'' is?  That might be a useful one to add.

I think there are certain terms here that need to be in different sections. I guess as the list grows, it will probably separate into phonetics/phonology, morphology, syntax etc.</text>

Do you go to Bar-Ilan university? If so, maybe you could talk to the staff there about this guy.  I know that (s)he used the IP address &quot;132.70.50.117&quot; on 8 May 2005 at 06:53 [[w:UTC|UTC]].  The same IP was also used on 26 May 2005 at 17:06 and 17:29, unless it's somebody acting like the same person.

That information should be enough to find out who he is, that is of course, if they keep logs.

Warm regards,

[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 21:50, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

:By the way, does blocking that one IP actually cause the entire university to be blocked? RIPE seems to show that Bar-Ilan owns from 132.70.0.0 - 132.70.255.255 (I think...). -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 23:57, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

::Yes. I've tried on several computers (some are Windows, others are Linux etc.), and they all say the same thing. Yes, I know that the entire 132.70.*.* block is used by the university, and that they also own 132.71.*.* (this block is one they didn't need to start using). In addition, I know that 132.70.1.6 is a particular Solaris Unix computer (its name is Sunshine), and when I log on to that computer and try to edit I get the same message. 

::For your information, the exact name of the computer &quot;132.70.50.117&quot; is &quot;proxy1.cc.biu.ac.il&quot;.

::By the way, about &quot;if they keep logs&quot;, some of the computers are ones which no one needs to log on to - and if no one sees who's working there and nothing personal is loaded, no one knows who it is. This includes library catalog computers in the libraries here (many departments have their own), all of which are connected to the internet; 4 computers in the student union building for use of the students; a computer room intended for students to use. (I'm a student in the computer department, so I usually use the computers for the students of the department.)

Hi there,

Hopefully you remember me, it's been a while...how are you?

At Wikipedia, there are still issues with whoever is trying to get Bar-Ilan blocked.  Do you still go there? Recently, an IP used by the university (may be the entire university's proxy IP, not sure) was blocked indefinitely.  Could you do me a favour and find out what can be done? Maybe if they took a few minutes to look over their logs they can find out who it is and restrict their access.

Anyhow, this has gone on for way too long, so I don't disagree with a more long-term block at this point in an attempt to get your University's attention.  Hopefully this can get resolved as soon as possible.  If you can get someone at your university to listen, they can email me at wiki [a t] frazzydee [d O T] ca, or they can email the blocking admin [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Emailuser&amp;target=Hall_Monitor here].

Sorry about this- I want a long-term block as little as you do, but it's a little hard for me to argue against it when it's gone on so long and nobody from Bar-Ilan has responded to me.

Kind regards,

Hi User142,

Are you still around? I was going through the templates and there was one ([[Template:PoisonType]]) that I'm not sure what it was used for (it doesn't link anywhere, but that doesn't mean it wasn't used with subst).

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called User142. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name User142~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

[[Organic chemistry]] &gt; [[Organic Chemistry/Dienes|Dienes]] &gt; Kinds of dienes

[[Organic Chemistry/Dienes|&lt;&lt; Dienes]] | [[Organic Chemistry/Dienes/Conjugation|Conjugation &gt;&gt;]]
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Dienes have two or more carbon-carbon double bonds which may be either ''isolated'' (R'-C=C-R-C=C-R'), ''cumulated'' (R-C=C=C-R), or ''conjugated'' (R-C=C-C=C-R).  Each state represents a different stability due to electron delocalization, and the conjugated form is generally favored in organic molecules.

===Isolated Dienes===
Isolated dienes typically show no &quot;special&quot; stability.  Their two &amp;pi;-bonds interact independent of one another and they compete as intermolecular reaction sites depending on steric, kinetic, and thermodynamic factors.  Often, these types of dienes can be treated merely as larger, more complex alkenes, because the two bonds cannot be said to have &quot;communication&quot; (proximal electron delocalization due to location).

Isolated dienes are not considered to be especially useful in common synthesis reactions, although intermediates may often take the form of an isolated diene.bb

===Cumulated Dienes===
Cumulated dienes are typically less stable than other alkenes.  The main reason for the instability is the fact that this sort of diene is a probable transition state for an alkyne's triple bond to move down the carbon chain towards the most stable position.  As you may recall, rotation does not occur around any &amp;pi;-bond, which means that cumulated double bonds can lead to a less stable, higher energy compound being formed.  

Typically, cumulated dienes are discussed only in advanced courses in organic chemistry, and so they will not be discussed in detail here.  Beginning organic chemistry students should merely remember that cumulated dienes are 1) high energy and 2) most likely found as transition states.


===Conjugated Dienes===
Conjugated dienes are dienes which have at least two double bonds separated by a single carbon-carbon bond, and for this reason conjugated dienes are observed to have a special stability due to the overlap of electron orbitals.  The areas of concentration of negative charge (electron density) overlap across the three bonds (two double bonds and one single bond) forming what behaves essentially as a single, continuous &amp;pi;-bond across three carbon atoms.  This delocalization of electron density stabilizes the molecule, resulting in the arrangement of lowest energy.  

Atoms other than carbon which are capable of multiple bonds may also participate in conjugation.  The heteroatoms most often associated with conjugation in dienes and other molecules are nitrogen and oxygen, but theoretically the majority of atoms in the Periodic Table of Elements could participate in conjugation chemistry.  Most often, in organic molecules, heteroatoms participating in conjugation will be nitrogen atoms within a ring structure or a double-bonded oxygen attached to form a ketone or aldehyde.

Conjugation of double bonds is the largest part of what makes aromaticity relevant in organic chemistry, and conjugated double bonds have many other significant impacts on other types of dienes as well.

== Ĉu ==

'Ĉu' is not only for questions of yes and no.  Also it is used for questions with two or more alternatives.  

&quot;Ĉu vi volas teon aŭ kafon?

== Keep it up! ==

I just wanted to say to whoever has been writing this book that as a learner Esperantist (if that is a word!) I've found it useful, and it would be great to see more modules added!

==Tio?==
In this lesson, it defines tio as &quot;that.&quot; Though really isn't it more like &quot;this&quot;?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since the rise of digital cameras, film is not always needed. 
=Types of Film stock=
==8mm==
Amateur film gauge introduced by Eastman Kodak. In the camera, it was the same size with standard 16mm film but with double perforations. At the picture area of a typical 16mm film, four frames of 8mm were recorded, two in the first run and two when turning the film cassette to the other side to expose the other half width, much like audio cassettes are used. When processed, it was slit lengthwise to produce a double length (usually 50ft) Regular 8mm film for projection. A better variant, Super 8mm was introduced by Eastman Kodak in 1965. This had smaller perforations which allowed for 50% increase of the image size and hence more detail could be recorded. The larger frame also allowed for larger projection sizes than were possible with standard 8mm (called Regular 8mm) film. See also respective sections in Wikipedia and Kodak's web site.

==16mm==

==Super 16mm==
Super 16mm film is physically 16mm wide, however, when compared to standard 16mm film one will notice that 16mm has perforations on both edges of the film, whereas super 16mm only has perforations on one side. This allows for a wider frame on the film and provides greater resolution to that achievable with standard 16mm film stock.

==35mm==
35mm Film Stock is regarded as the industry standard when it comes to professional productions. There are a few different types of 35mm film, including:

* Two perf
* Three perf
* Four perf
* Super 35mm

==65/70mm==
This type of film stock is the largest format made, it is generally used for IMAX productions. It is the highest quality film available.

==Buying Film stock==
===Kodak===
You can purchase Filmstock directly from Kodak by calling them. Information is at http://www.kodak.com

===Fuji===
* Consider using cheaper [[Wikipedia:Short end|Short end]] and [[Wikipedia:Re-can|Re-can]] stocks.

==Storing Filmstock==
* Shameless Plug for Kodak... http://www.kodak.com/global/en/service/tib/tib5202.shtml

About the French Fry picture - My mother made the fries in the picture, and did not use a recipe - I read the fry recipe and I think that they would look exactly the same as the ones in the picture.

==Image==
I think you cooked the [[Cookbook:French Fries]] recipe. If so, you might want to make a note of that on the [[:Image:FrenchFries1.jpg|FrenchFries1.jpg]] page and on the image caption. Some people have used generic pictures in the past, not exactly matching up with the recipe.

BTW, nice cookie pictures. (same thing about [[:Image:ChewyGingerCookies.jpg|ChewyGingerCookies.jpg]] and [[:Image:CrispyGingerbreadCookies.jpg|CrispyGingerbreadCookies.jpg]] too of course &amp;mdash; a note on the image page would be informative)

Never mind my earlier comment (see history if you care) about copyright tags; that isn't required for wikibooks. I'm more used to uploading at the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/ Commons], where the image would soon get deleted if it was without copyright tags.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:46, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

So... how were the cookies? Which recipe makes better cookies? Since these recipes are now among the dozen or so with pictures ('''thank you'''), they are likely to end up as featured recipes. Probably the recipe talk pages are a good place to note how things turned out. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:07, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

== Cookbook:Grammy's Potato Salad ==

Hi! Your recipe for [[Cookbook:Grammy's Potato Salad|Grammy's Potato Salad]] has been tagged as needing work for about 5 years now, and all that's missing is a quantity. You list:

*1/4 sweet pickle juice (from jar of pickles)

but you fail to specify 1/4 ''what''. (Cup?)

Can you edit your recipe to correct this, please? Thanks!&amp;mdash;[[User:D'Ranged 1|D'Ranged&amp;nbsp;1]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:D'Ranged 1|&lt;sup&gt;'''talk'''&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:29, 29 August 2012 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Alcinoe. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Alcinoe~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Verbs/]] | [[../Verb Tenses/]]

Gramatically, the subjunctive is called a &quot;mood&quot;. This is differentiated from a &quot;tense&quot; in that it does not express time per se (which is what &quot;tense&quot; really means). Along with the name of the mood also goes a tense. For the subjunctive mood, the tense may be present, imperfect, present perfect, or past perfect (or pluperfect). This article only discusses the present tense.

The present tense of the subjunctive mood, as with the other subjunctive tenses, is used for a variety of situations. This variety can make the subjunctive difficult to understand for English-speakers, and make students of Spanish dread the mood. 

One common situation is to indicate actions which the speaker wishes will happen or wants to happen. It follows phrases such as &quot;Espero que&quot; (I hope that) and &quot;Quiero que&quot; (I want), and always &quot;Ojalá que&quot; (God willing/Hopefully). Similarly, another situation is where the speaker fears or doubts the action will happen. Phrases such as &quot;Temo que&quot; (I fear that), &quot;No creo que&quot; (I don't think that), &quot;Dudo que&quot; (I doubt that). Yet another situation is where the speaker is expressing possibilities or expressing beliefs that are impersonal yet still subjective. Examples here are &quot;Es posible que&quot; (It's possible that), &quot;Es mejor que&quot; (It's best that), &quot;Podría ser que&quot; (It could be that).

Note that the common thread in all these cases is that the action in the subordinate clause is not a factual statement, but something only from the realm of possibility. In some cases you are hoping it is true, in others you are doubting, denying, or speculating about its reality; but in all cases, you are essentially mooting the statement, bringing its reality up for discussion. This mooting is the essence of the subjunctive. You put the action that you are mooting in a subordinate clause, almost always joined to the main clause by &quot;que.&quot; (In fact, this is where the name &quot;subjunctive&quot; came from: you are joining another idea or clause in a subordinate relationship to the main clause.)

There are some other uses of the subjunctive.

In order for the subjunctive to be used, you must have both:
*Expression of desire, doubt, hope, fear, or one of the other situations above, and
*Change of subject between independent clause and dependent clause (''Yo'' quiero que ''Ud.'' me ayude-- ''I'' want ''you'' to help me.)

===Conjugations===

'''Rule''': The subjunctive begins with the '''yo'''-form of the present indicative. Then remove the '''-o''' and append the &quot;opposite&quot; endings.

'''Hablar'''
hablo -&gt; habl-

:Yo '''hable'''
:Tú '''hables'''
:Él/Ella/Ud. '''hable'''
:Nosotros '''hablemos'''
:Vosotros '''habléis'''
:Ellos/Uds. '''hablen'''

'''Comer'''
como -&gt; com-

:Yo '''coma'''
:Tú '''comas'''
:Él/Ella/Ud. '''coma'''
:Nosotros '''comamos'''
:Vosotros '''comáis'''
:Ellos/Uds. '''coman'''

'''Vivir'''
vivo -&gt; viv-

:Yo '''viva'''
:Tú '''vivas'''
:Él/Ella/Ud. '''viva'''
:Nosotros '''vivamos'''
:Vosotros '''viváis'''
:Ellos/Uds. '''vivan'''

It is important to note that the present subjunctive is taken from the first-person singular rather than other stems because of the many verbs that are irregular in the first-person singular.

:Yo '''tengo''' -&gt; '''tenga'''
:Yo '''pongo''' -&gt; '''ponga'''
:Yo '''caigo''' -&gt; '''caiga'''
:Yo '''conozco''' -&gt; '''conozca'''
:Yo '''permanezco''' -&gt; '''permanezca'''

'''Seeming Exceptions'''

1. Even though the present subjunctive takes its form from the first-person singular, you still need to watch out for vowel changes due to stress shifting in the stem. Thus,

:Yo '''pueda'''
:Tú '''puedas'''
:Él/Ella/Ud. '''pueda'''
:Nosotros '''podamos''' (not ''puedamos'')
:Vosotros '''podáis''' (not ''puedáis'')
:Ellos/Uds. '''puedan'''

2. Since Spanish always tries to keep the spelling accurate to the pronunciation, in some cases the ending needs to change because the stem ends in a 'c', 'z', 'g', etc. This change normally happens in the first-person singular of '''-er''' and '''-ir''' verbs also, but it is still something to be aware of because in speaking or writing you're not always explicitly conscious of grammatical forms other than what you're using.

:Yo '''juego''' -&gt; '''juegue'''
:Yo '''toco''' -&gt; '''toque'''
:Yo '''recojo''' -&gt; '''recoja'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure I agree with the characterizations of pastry crusts as &quot;old style&quot; or as &quot;bland&quot; or &quot;somewhat greasy,&quot; though this could be the case for specific crusts. The crust I usually make is not greasy, and a greasy crust is a sign of poor worksmanship (usually due to combining fat into the flour). Bland has multiple meanings (&quot;pleasant&quot; for example), but it's generally used as a pejorative; I usually like my crusts. =) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:28, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:Bland can be good or bad, depending on what you want. A crumb crust made from chocolate cookie crumbs is very much '''not bland''', and completely unsuitable for a chicken pot pie. (well, maybe a pregnant woman would crave such a thing, probably with green olives on top) When you consider how flavorful many of the crumb crusts are, the normal pastry crusts are definitely bland. You could add some herbs and spices to change that of course, but people don't normally do that. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:44, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:I think &quot;somewhat greasy&quot; is accurate. A really greasy pie crust is defective of course. If you rub the bottom of a normal pie, you can feel the grease. A good pastry pie crust does a fairly decent job of hiding this, but the crumb crusts are usually a bit better. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:44, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:Since all the really old pie crust recipes are pastry, I'm fairly certain that &quot;old style&quot; is also accurate. Let me know if you find a crumb crust recipe that is over a century old. Probably I can find pastry crust recipes that go back several centuries. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:44, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:: Fair enough. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:46, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

: I will also dispute the description of a pastry crust as &quot;bland, flakey, and somewhat greasy&quot;.  It is impossible to read this as a positive statement, particularly when followed immediately by fulsome praise for crumb crusts.
: I will also dispute the claim that &quot;many pies&quot; are made with crumb crusts, because I have consumed very, very many pies in my life, and I have never encountered a crumb crust once outside American cookbooks.
: It may be the case that &quot;in the USA, many sweet pies&quot; are made with crumb crusts.  But this page, as it stands, is far too negative about traditional crusts, and far too biased in favour of sweet pies.  It is totally non-representative of pie crusts in my experience.

50 ml is actually about 3.5 Tbsp, or about 10 *teaspoons* but not 10 tbsp.</text>

[[Image:Homemade potato salad.jpg|thumb|Grammy's Potato Salad]] 
This is a classic [[Cookbook:New England cuisine|New England]] potato salad. Chopping the potatoes into small pieces allows more surface to be coated and improves the flavor.

Makes about 10 servings.

== Ingredients ==

*3 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] long white [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] 
*3 hard boiled [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]

*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
*1/4 cup sweet pickle juice (from jar of [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]]) 
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Celery Seed|celery seed]]
*3/4 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*[[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]

== Procedure ==

#Cut unpeeled potatoes in half and cook until they are tender when tested with a knife. Do not overcook. 
#Peel the potatoes by scraping them lightly with a knife and cut them into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) cubes.
#Place potatoes in a large bowl and let them come to room temperature. 
#In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, pickle juice and sugar and stir until smooth. 
#Add the mayonnaise mixture, minced onion, parsley, celery seed and chopped eggs to the potatoes. 
#Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir lightly to combine. 
#Place in large serving bowl and sprinkle with paprika.

{{recipesummary|Cheesecake recipes|8|3 and half hours|4|Image=[[File:New york cheesecake with strawberries.jpg|300px]]}}
Arnold Reuben, owner of Turf Restaurant at 49th and Broadway in New York City, developed the recipe for New York cheesecake in 1929 after eating a slice of cheese pie at a friend's home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/Cheesecake.htm Info on the history of cheesecake]&lt;/ref&gt;

He altered his hostess’ recipe and eventually developed his own version of cheesecake which relies on cream cheese rather than cottage cheese as most other bakeries did at the time. Reuben then served his new creation in his restaurant which became a hit in no time. 

The below recipe makes a firm and heavy cheesecake, nicely flavored with [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]. It is very important to avoid over beating the ingredients in order to avoid cracks.

==Ingredients==
For Cake:

*2 ½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] softened [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] 
*1 3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Corn Starch|corn starch]]
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] 
*5 large whole [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*2 large egg yolks
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]]

For Crust:

*5 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] Barnham and Bailey Animal Crackers,or, Sweet Digestive Biscuits,(but no extra sugar with these).
*3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*4 tablespoons melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==
For Crust:

#Butter bottom and sides of [[Cookbook:Inch|10 inch]] [[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springform pan]]. 
#Crush Animal Crackers into a fine powder. Mix with 3 tablespoons of sugar. 
#Add to melted butter and mix with a fork until blended. 
#Press mixture into the bottom and up about one third of the sides of the pan. 
#Refrigerate 1 hour.

For Cake:

#Have all ingredients at room temperature. 
#Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|475°F]]. 
#Mix sugar, flour and corn starch together. 
#Using a wooden spoon, beat cream cheese with sugar mix, zest and vanilla until it is smooth. Do not overbeat. You may substitute lemon juice for vanilla.
#Add the whole eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating lightly with wooden spoon after each addition. Do not overbeat as this causes the cheesecake to crack. 
#Gently stir in cream. 
#Pour mixture into the pan. Place pan on [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] to avoid leakage. 
#Bake at 475°F for 15 minutes 
#Lower heat to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|225°F]] and bake for 1 hour 
#Raise heat to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|250°F]] and bake for about 15 more minutes 
#Refrigerate immediately for at least one hour, keep covered with a cloth and [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] (cloth on bottom) until condensation stops forming. Condensation will drip onto the cake if you cover it right away with Saran wrap.

̞__NOTOC__
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meat Recipes]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian]]

This is a very quick, easy Pineapple Teriyaki entrée, to be served over rice.  It is listed as both meat and vegetarian because it works around the pineapple, veggies, and teriyaki, not the protein.  Put the rice on to cook first, and the rest will probably be finished by the time the rice is ready.  

A [[Cookbook:Teriyaki|Teriyaki recipe]] is available
for those who cannot or do not wish to purchase prepared teriyaki sauce.

==Ingredients==
===For the rice===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (your choice, but a short-grain white rice is most traditional)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* a little [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
Bring all to a boil in a pot or rice cooker.  In a pot, cover, turn the heat down when it boils.  Simmer for 20 minutes with the lid on, then turn off the heat, fluff with a fork, and let stand for a few minutes.

===For on top of the rice===
*1-2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] vegetable or olive [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*2 c cubed [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] '''or''' *2 c cubed [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] or vegetarian &quot;chicken&quot; (usually flavored, pressed [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]])
*1 yellow or white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1-2 [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], whatever color(s) you prefer. Red and green stand out nicely against yellow pineapple.
*1 14-16 oz. can of cubed [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], drained (Pineapple is often canned in juice, so you may wish to save what you drain.)
* 1/4 c (approx.) prepared [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|teriyaki sauce]].  Soy Vay! Veri Veri Teriyaki is excellent, if available.
===Optional===
If you’d like more or thicker sauce, mix 
* 1/4 c of water or reserved pineapple juice 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] 

You might also like to toss in 
*some sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] 
*1-2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]], depending upon your teriyaki sauce

==Method==

#Put rice on to cook, as outlined above.
#Cut up the chicken/tofu, onion, and bell pepper(s) into bite-sized chunks.  Cut up everything before turning on the stove.
#Heat a deep 12&quot; pan or wok over high heat. 
#Add the oil.
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] everything in the oil, adding ingredients in the following order, so as to cook heavier items longer:
#*Chicken
#*Onion/garlic
#*Bell peppers
#*Mushrooms 
#*Pineapple
#*Tofu
#Add the teriyaki sauce and the cornstarch mixture.  If using cornstarch, heat to boiling to thicken and correct with extra water or juice as necessary.
#Serve over rice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Someone wrote:

 Declaring an array variable without a size is equivalent to declaring a pointer

followed by a bogus example.  This statement is completely untrue.  One declares an incomplete array that, unless later completed, is completed at the end of the translation unit with 1 element.  It takes up the space of the element.  The other declares a pointer, and takes up the space of a pointer.  You really should understand this stuff before trying to teach it...

[[User:207.17.47.140]]

It's a syntax that comes from C's predecessor B. It's still an accepted syntax for function parameters. Look:

 int fn(int a[]){
   a++;
   return *a;
 }

To really understand all this, I think it is good to describe how C evolved out of B. Without that background, lots of stuff just doesn't make sense. C sometimes gives you a &quot;free&quot; unary &amp; operator when you use an array as a pointer; I'm sure that this is a major cause of beginner confusion. It makes sense once you know that arrays in B were really pointers to arrays. The arrays lost this when the language gained structs, because prior to the C++ invention of constructors there would be no way for the pointer to get initialized to point at the data. Thus we get the weird array-as-a-pointer feature that confuses people.

I think that teaching this should involve:

#generic language-neutral concepts of arrays, pointers, and strings (no code examples)
#how B did things
#the big language change
#review
#strings now const. New C99 variable-size array stuff

All through it, the oddities of pointer arithmetic will require frequent reminders.
(the whole 42[array] thing, *array, and so on)

----

Removed the casting of void* to an object pointer type.  void* was introduced specifically as a generic pointer type that does not need casting; such casts are a relic from pre-ANSI C when char* was abused as the generic type.  Also, removed text that stated that such a cast is necessary.  While casting may seem harmless, it can mask the serious problem of forgetting prototypes for allocation functions.  In addition, it simply clutters up code.  One rarely sees code like &quot;char x = (char)'x';&quot; even though 'x' is an int, for example.  The same principle should apply to pointers. -- [[User:67.170.85.37|67.170.85.37]] 04:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

Could anybody explain me that:

 typedef  int (*MyFunctionType)( int, void *);

I thought typedef is used like that: typedef long int* abc; abc variable1; thx

:MyFunctionType typedef'ed to be a pointer to a function that takes two arguments (int, void *) and returns an int.  Read about the syntax for declaring function pointers in C. --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] 07:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

== article style ==

I gotta tell you, this article is really unclear...the problem is changing the way of thinking of someone, especially if they have to wrap their minds around pointers and arrays in quick succession as the article flows.  It's especially hard because my background is Java and Perl...

--[[User:168.105.118.205|168.105.118.205]] 11:10, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

:I agree. What is this supposed to mean? ''When returning a pointer from a function, do not to return a pointer that points to a value that is local to the function or that is a pointer to a function argument.'' WTF? Also, the nonsense examples are distracting. MEANINGFUL examples would be more helpful, even if they're slightly longer. [[User:128.250.37.103|128.250.37.103]] 10:14, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

::It means that, since local variables are deallocated when the function returns, don't return a pointer to any of those variables, or it will be a dangling pointer. Care to rephrase it? --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] 02:05, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

Just as a note, the current external link to a 'pointer cheat sheet' actually goes to a quiz, which I wouldn't describe as a cheat sheet.

Another possibly unclear one: &quot;First one declares a structure having as elements function pointers for the various operations to that can be specified polymorphically.&quot; (In #Pointers to Functions.) I assume it means &quot;First one declares a structure [which has elements which are] function pointers for the various operations...&quot; but then it says &quot;... to that can be specified polymorphically.&quot; I can't make sense of it unless I assume the &quot;to&quot; was there by mistake, in the sense of &quot;various operations ''that are to be'' specified&quot;, but I don't know if this is right. 21:23, 12 January 2010 (UTC)~~

== merge ==

I suggest merging our discussion about pointers into this module [[C Programming/Pointers and arrays]],
rather than talk about them here and again in a section of another module [[C_Programming/Complex_types#Pointers]].
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 15:21, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

== Is the struct example within scope? ==

We're leading off with a discussion involving structs, which aren't introduced until [[C_Programming/Complex_types | C Complex Types]]. We could either reorganize the two sections so that structs have already been presented, or we could find a different example for this section. I might get around to changing things up before long, but I'd welcome any thoughts on the matter before I have time to Be Bold and whatnot.

== Questions from the module-page ==
Can someone tell me why napoleon kept one hand in his tunic in almost every photo?

It has been rumored that Napoleon had a tumor in his abdominal area and would constantly touch it. It would be interesting to see if this rumor proves to be valid.

*It has been said that Napoleon held his hand on his abdominal area, because he had stomache issues. The rumor says it made him uncomfortable.

__NOTOC__
'''Blender HotKeys''' - ''Relevant to '''Blender 2.37a'''&lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt; - Compiled from Blender Online Guides''

== Window HotKeys ==

Certain window managers also use the following hotkeys.
So '''ALT-CTRL''' can be substituted for '''CTRL''' to perform the
functions described below if a conflict arises.
: '''CTRL-LEFTARROW'''. Go to the previous Screen.
: '''CTRL-RIGHTARROW'''. Go to the next Screen.
: '''CTRL-UPARROW''' or '''CTRL-DOWNARROW'''. Maximize the window or return to the previous window display size.
: '''SHIFT-F4'''. Change the window to a Data View
: '''SHIFT-F5'''. Change the window to a 3D Window
: '''SHIFT-F6'''. Change the window to an IPO Window
: '''SHIFT-F7'''. Change the window to a Buttons Window
: '''SHIFT-F8'''. Change the window to a Sequence Window
: '''SHIFT-F9'''. Change the window to an Outliner Window
: '''SHIFT-F10'''. Change the window to an Image Window
: '''SHIFT-F11'''. Change the window to a Text Window
: '''SHIFT-F12'''. Change the window to an Action Window

== Universal HotKeys ==

The following HotKeys work uniformly in all Blender Windows, if the Context allows:
: '''CTRL-LMB'''. Lasso select: drag the mouse to form a freehand selection area.
** '''ESC.'''
** This key always cancels Blender functions without changes.
** ''or'': FileWindow, DataView and ImageSelect: back to the previous window type.
**  ''or'': the RenderWindow is pushed to the background (or closed, that depends on the operating system).
: '''SPACE.''' Open the Toolbox.
: '''CTRL-SPACE.''' Opens menu with manipulator type choices. (Press 2, 3, 4, or 5 to change the widget type) &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
: '''ALT-SPACE.''' Opens menu with manipulator orientation choices. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
: '''TAB.''' Start or quit EditMode.  Toggles between horizontal and verticle splitting when the user is splitting the window.
: '''F1.''' Loads a Blender file. Changes the window to a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT-F1.''' Appends parts from other files, or loads as Library-data. Changes the window to a FileWindow, making Blender files accessible as a directory.
: '''F2.''' Writes a Blender file. Change the window to a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT-F2.''' Exports the scene as a DXF file
: '''CTRL-F2.''' Exports the scene as a VRML1 file
: '''F3.''' Writes a picture (if a picture has been rendered). The fileformat is as indicated in the DisplayButtons. The window becomes a File Select Window.
: '''CTRL-F3 (ALT-CTRL-F3 on MacOSX)'''. Saves a screendump of the active window. The fileformat is as indicated in the DisplayButtons. The window becomes a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-F3.''' Saves a screendump of the whole Blender screen. The fileformat is as indicated in the DisplayButtons. The window becomes a FileWindow.
: '''F4.''' Displays the Logic Context (if a ButtonsWindow is available).
: '''F5.''' Displays the Shading Context (if a Buttons Window is available), Light, Material or World Sub-contextes depends on active object.
: '''F6.''' Displays the Shading Context and Texture Sub-context (if a ButtonsWindow is available).
: '''F7.''' Displays the Object Context (if a ButtonsWindow is available).
: '''F8.''' Displays the Shading Context and World Sub-context (if a ButtonsWindow is available).
: '''F9.''' Displays the Editing Context (if a ButtonsWindow is available).
: '''F10.''' Displays the Scene Context (if a ButtonsWindow is available).
: '''F11.''' Hides or shows the render window.
: '''F12.''' Starts the rendering from the active camera.
: '''LEFTARROW.''' Go to the previous frame.
: '''SHIFT-LEFTARROW.''' Go to the first frame.
: '''RIGHTARROW.''' Go to the next frame.
: '''SHIFT-RIGHTARROW.''' Go to the last frame.
: '''UPARROW.''' Go forward 10 frames.
: '''DOWNARROW.''' Go back 10 frames.
: '''ALT-A.''' Change the current Blender window to Animation Playback mode. The cursor changes to a counter.
: '''ALT-SHIFT-A.''' The current window, plus all 3DWindows go into Animation Playback mode.
: '''IKEY.''' Insert Key menu. This menu differs from window to window.
: '''JKEY.''' Toggle the render buffers. Blender allows you to retain two different rendered pictures in memory.
: '''CTRL-O.''' Opens the last saved file.
: '''QKEY.''' OK? Quit Blender. This key closes Blender. Blender quit is displayed in the console if Blender is properly closed.
: '''ALT-CTRL-T.''' TimerMenu. This menu offers access to information about drawing speed. The results are displayed in a pop-up.
: '''CTRL-U.''' OK, Save User defaults. The current project (windows, objects, etc.), including UserMenu settings are written to the default file that will be loaded every time you start Blender or set it to defaults by pressing '''CTRL-X.'''
: '''CTRL-W.''' Write file. This key combination allows you to write the Blender file without opening a FileWindow.
: '''ALT-W.''' Write Videoscape file. Changes the window to a FileWindow.
: '''CTRL-X.''' Erase All. Everything (except the render buffer) is erased and released. The default scene is reloaded.
: '''CTRL-Y.''' Redo. Mac users may use CMD-Y.
: '''CTRL-Z.''' Undo. Mac users may use CMD-Z.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-Z.''' Redo. Mac users may use SHIFT-CMD-Z

== Object Mode HotKeys ==

These hotkeys are mainly bound to the 3D Viewport Window, but many work on Objects in most other windows, like IPOs and so on, hence they are summarized here.
: '''HOME'''. All Objects in the visible layer are displayed completely, centered in the window.
: '''PAGEUP'''. Select the next Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT-PAGEUP'''. Adds to selection the next Object Key.
: '''PAGEDOWN.''' Select the previous Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT-PAGEDOWN.''' Adds to selection the previous Object Key.
: '''ACCENT.''' (To the left of the '''1KEY''' in US keyboard) Select all layers.
:: (N.B. '''SINGLE-QUOTE-KEY''' on UK, '''ÖKEY''' on DE &amp;amp; SE, '''&amp;AElig;KEY''' on DK, '''&amp;Oslash;KEY''' on NO, '''&amp;Ograve;KEY''' on IT and '''&amp;Ugrave;KEY''' on AZERTY keyboard)
: '''SHIFT-ACCENT.''' Revert to the previous layer setting.
:: (N.B. '''SHIFT-SINGLE-QUOTE-KEY''' on UK, '''SHIFT-ÖKEY''' on DE &amp;amp; SE, '''SHIFT-&amp;AElig;KEY''' on DK, '''SHIFT-&amp;Oslash;KEY''' on NO, '''SHIFT-&amp;Ograve;KEY''' on IT and '''SHIFT-&amp;Ugrave;KEY''' on AZERTY keyboard)
: '''TAB.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''ALT-E.'''
: '''AKEY.''' Selects/deselects all.
: '''CTRL-A.''' Apply size and rotation. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are assigned to the ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.). At first glance, it appears as if nothing has changed, but this can have considerable consequences for animations or texture mapping. This is best illustrated by also having the axis of a Mesh Object be drawn (EditButtons-&gt;Axis). Rotate the Object and activate Apply. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are 'erased'.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-A.''' If the active Object is automatically duplicated (see AnimButtons-&gt;DupliFrames or AnimButtons- &gt;Dupliverts), a menu asks Make duplis real?. This option actually creates the Objects. If the active Mesh Object is deformed by a Lattice, a menu asks Apply Lattice deform?. Now the deformation of the Lattice is assigned to the vertices of the Mesh.
: '''SHIFT-A.''' This is the AddMenu. In fact, it is the ToolBox that starts with the `ADD' option. When Objects are added, Blender starts EditMode immediately if possible.
: '''BKEY.''' Border Select. Draw a rectangle with the LeftMouse; all Objects within this area are selected, but not made active. Draw a rectangle with the MiddleMouse to deselect Objects. In orthonormal ViewMode, the dimensions of the rectangle are displayed, expressed as global coordinates, as an extra feature in the lower left corner. In Camera ViewMode, the dimensions that are to be rendered according to the DisplayButtons are displayed in pixel units.
: '''SHIFT-B.''' Render Border. This only works in Camera ViewMode. Draw a rectangle to render a smaller cut-out of the standard window frame. If the option DisplayButtons-&gt;Border is ON, a box is drawn with red and black lines.
: '''CKEY'''. Centre View. The position of the 3DCursor becomes the new centre of the 3DWindow.
** '''ALT-C.''' Convert Menu. Depending on the active Object, a PopupMenu is displayed. This enables you to convert certain types of ObData. It only converts in one direction, everything ultimately degrades to a Mesh! The options are:
*** Font -&gt; Curve
*** MetaBall -&gt; Mesh The original MetaBall remains unchanged.
*** Curve -&gt; Mesh
*** Surface -&gt; Mesh

**'''CTRL-C.''' Copy Menu. This menu copies information from the active Object to (other) selected Objects.
*** ''Fixed components are:''
**** Copy Loc: the X,Y,Z location of the Object. If a Child is involved, this location is the relative position in relation to the Parent.
**** Copy Rot: the X,Y,Z rotation of the Object.
**** Copy Size: the X,Y,Z dimension of the Object.
**** DrawType: copies Object Drawtype.
**** TimeOffs: copies Object time offset.

**** Mass: Real time stuff.
**** Damping: Real time stuff.
**** Properties: Real time stuff.
**** Logic Bricks: Real time stuff.
**** Constraints: copies Object constraints.
*** ''If applicable:''

**** Copy Bevel Settings: all bevelling data from the EditButtons.
*** ''Camera Objects:''
**** Copy Lens: the lens value.
: '''SHIFT-C.''' CentreZero View. The 3DCursor is set to zero (0,0,0) and the view is changed so that all Objects, including the 3Dcursor, can be displayed. This is an alternative for '''HOME.'''
: '''DKEY.''' Draw mode menu. Allows to select draw modes exactly as the corresponding menu in the 3D viewport header does.
: '''SHIFT-D.''' Add Duplicate. The selected Objects are duplicated. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''ALT-D.''' Add Linked Duplicate. Of the selected Objects linked duplicates are created. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''CTRL-D.''' Draw the (texture) Image as wire. This option has a limited function. It can only be used for 2D compositing.
: '''ALT-E.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''TAB.'''
: '''FKEY.''' If selected Object is a mesh Toggles Face selectMode on and off.
: '''CTRL-F.''' Sort Faces. The faces of the active Mesh Object are sorted, based on the current view in the 3DWindow. The leftmost face first, the rightmost last. The sequence of faces is important for the Build Effect (AnimButtons).
** '''GKEY'''. Grab Mode. Or: the translation mode. This works on selected Objects and vertices. Blender calculates the quantity and direction of the translation, so that they correspond exactly with the mouse movements, regardless of the ViewMode or view direction of the 3DWindow. Alternatives for starting this mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a straight line.
** The following options are available in translation mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL:''' in increments of 1 grid unit.
**** '''SHIFT:''' fine movements.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL:''' in increments of 0.1 grid unit.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Moving along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Moving along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Moving along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the current translation to the X,Y or Z axis. Blender calculates which axis to use, depending on the already initiated mouse movement. Click MiddleMouse again to return to unlimited translation.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.

*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric
*** key directly. '''TAB''' will switch between values, '''ENTER '''finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS:''' These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** ''Grabber can be terminated with:''
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER:''' move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC:''' everything goes back to the old position.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY:''' starts Grab mode again.
**** '''SKEY:''' switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''RKEY:''' switches to Rotate mode.
: '''ALT-G.''' Clears translations, given in Grab mode. The X,Y,Z locations of selected Objects are set to zero.

*** ''Rot:'' The XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''Size:'' The XYZ dimensions of the Object
*** ''LocRot:'' The XYZ location and XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''LocRotSize:'' The XYZ location, XYZ rotation and XYZ dimensions of the Object.
*** ''Layer:'' The layer of the Object.
*** ''Avail:'' A position is only added to all the current IpoCurves, that is curves which already exists.
*** Mesh, Lattice, Curve or Surface: depending on the type of Object, a VertexKey can be added
: '''CTRL-J.''' Join Objects. All selected Objects of the same type are added to the active Object. What actually happens here is that the ObData blocks are combined and all the selected Objects (except for the active one) are deleted. This is a rather complex operation, which can lead to confusing results, particularly when working with a lot of linked data, animation curves and hierarchies.
: '''KKEY.''' Show Keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects. If all of them were already ON, they are all turned OFF.
: '''SHIFT-K.''' A PopupMenu asks: OK? Show and select all keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects, and all Object-keys are selected. This function is used to enable transformation of the entire animation system.
: '''LKEY.''' Makes selected Object local. Makes library linked objects local for the current scene.
** '''CTRL-L.''' Link selected. Links some of the Active Object data to all selected Objects, the following menu entry appears only if applicable.

*** ''Current Material:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's current Material.
*** ''Current Texture:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing  active Object's current Texture.
: '''MKEY.''' Moves selected Object(s) to another layer, a pop-up appers. Use '''LMB''' to move, use '''SHIFT-LMB''' to make the object belong to multiple layers. If the selected Objects have different layers, this is ORed in the menu display. Use ESC to exit the menu. Press the &quot;OK&quot; button or '''ENTER''' to change the layer seting. The hotkeys ('''ALT'''-)('''1KEY, 2KEY''', ... - '''0KEY''') work here as well (see 3DHeader).
: '''CTRL-M.''' Mirror Menu. It is possible to mirror an Object along the X, Y or Z axis.
: '''NKEY.''' Number Panel. The location, rotation and scaling of the active Object are displayed and can be modified.
: '''ALT-O.''' Clear Origin. The `Origin' is erased for all Child Objects, which causes the Child Objects to move to the exact location of the Parent Objects.
: '''SHIFT-O.''' If the selected Object is a Mesh toggles SubSurf on/ off. '''CTRL-1''' to '''CTRL-4''' switches to the relative SubSurf level for display purpouses. Rendering SUbSurf level has no HotKey.
** '''CTRL-P.''' Make selected Object(s) the child(ren) of the active Object. If the Parent is a Curve then a popup offers two choices:
*** ''Normal Parent:'' Make a normal parent, the curve can be made a path later on.
*** ''Follow Path:'' Automatically creates a Follow Path constraint with the curve as target. If the Parent is an Armature, a popup offers three options:
*** ''Use Bone:'' One of the Bones becomes the parent. The Object will not be deformed. A popup permits to select the bone. This is the option if you are modeling a robot or machinery
*** ''Use Armature:'' The whole armature is used as parent for deformations. This is the choiche for organic beings.
*** ''Use Object:'' Standard parenting. In the second case further options asks if Vertex groups should not be created, should be created empty or created and populated.
** '''ALT-P.''' Clears Parent relation, user is asked if he wishes to keep or clear parent-induced transforms.
*** ''Clear Parent:'' the selected Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent. since the transformation of the Parent disappears, this can appear as if the former Children themselves are transformed.
*** ''... and keep transform:'' the Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent, and an attempt is made to assign the current transformation, which was determined in part by the Parent, to the (former Child) Objects.
*** ''Clear Parent inverse:'' The inverse matrix of the Parent of the selected Objects is erased. The Child Objects remain linked to the Objects. This gives the user complete control over the hierarchy.
: '''SHIFT-P.''' Push/Pull Transformations. It is a bit like scaling, except that every element is moved the same distance toward or away from the center. The distance they move is controlled by moving the mouse toward you (pull away from center) or away from you (push toward center). &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;

** '''RKEY.''' Rotate mode. Works on selected Object(s). In Blender, a rotation is by default a rotation perpendicular to the screen, regardless of the view direction or ViewMode. The degree of rotation is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try moving around the rotation midpoint with the mouse. The rotation pivot point is determined by the state of the 3DWiewport Header buttons. Alternatives for starting this mode:

*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY''': switches to Grab.
**** '''SKEY''': switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''RKEY''': starts Rotate mode again.
: '''ALT-R.''' Clears Rotation. The X,Y,Z rotations of selected Objects are set to zero.
: '''CTRL-ALT-R.''' Rotation Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
** '''SKEY.''' Size mode or scaling mode. Works on selected Object(s). The degree of scaling is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try to move from the (rotation) midpoint with the mouse.

*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the scaling to X, Y or Z axis. Blender calculates the appropriate axis based on the already initiated mouse movement. Click '''MMB''' again to return to free scaling.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains scaling to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. '''ENTER''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.

*** Sel-&gt;Grid: Moves Object to nearest grid point.
*** Sel-&gt;Curs: Moves Object to cursor.
*** Curs-&gt;Grid: Moves cursor to nearest grid point.
*** Curs-&gt;Sel: Moves cursor to selected Object(s).
*** Sel-&gt;Center: Moves Objects to their barycentrum.
: '''TKEY.''' Texture space mode. The position and dimensions of the texture space for the selected Objects can be changed in the same manner as described above for Grab and Size mode. To make this visible, the drawingflag EditButtons-&gt;TexSpace is set ON. A PopupMenu asks you to select: &quot;Grabber&quot; or &quot;Size&quot;.
: '''CTRL-T.''' Makes selected Object(s) track the Active Object. Old track method was Blender default tracking before version 2.30. The new method is the Constrain Track, this creates a fully editable constraint on the selected object targeting the active Object.
: '''ALT-T.''' Clears old style Track. Constraint track is removed as all constrains are.
: '''UKEY.''' Makes Object Single User, the inverse operation of Link
** ('''CTRL-L''') a pop-up appears with choices.
*** ''Object:'' if other Scenes also have a link to this Object, the link is deleted and the Object is copied. The Object now only exists in the current Scene. The links from the Object remain unchanged.
*** ''Object &amp; ObData:'' Similar to the previous command, but now the ObData blocks with multiple links are copied as well. All selected Objects are now present in the current Scene only, and each has a unique ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.).
*** ''Object &amp; ObData &amp; Materials+Tex:'' Similar to the previous command, but now Materials and Textures with multiple links are also copied. All selected Objects are now unique. They have unique ObData and each has a unique Material and Texture block. 
*** ''Materials+Tex:'' Only the Materials and Textures with multiple links are copied.
: '''VKEY.''' Switches in/out of Vertex Paint Mode.
: '''ALT-V.''' Object-Image Aspect. This hotkey sets the X and Y dimensions of the selected Objects in relation to the dimensions of the Image Texture they have. Use this hotkey when making 2D Image compositions and multi-plane designs to quickly place the Objects in the appropriate relationship with one another.
: '''WKEY.''' Opens Object Booleans Menu.
: '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected? Deletes selected objects.
: '''ZKEY.''' Toggles Solid Mode on/off.
: '''SHIFT-Z.''' Toggles Shaded Mode on/off.
: '''ALT-Z.''' Toggles Textured Mode on/off.
: '''PAD-/.''' Toggles layer buttons on/off.

== Edit Mode - General==

Again, Most of these hotkeys are useful in the 3D Viewport when in Edit Mode, but many works on other Blender Object, so they are summarized here. Many Object Mode keys works in Edit mode too, but on the selected vertices or control points; among these Grab, Rotate, Scale and so on. These hotkeys are not repeated here.
: '''TAB''' or '''ALT-E.''' This button starts and stops Edit Mode.
: '''CTRL-TAB.''' Switches between Vertex Select, Edge Select, and Face Select modes. Holding SHIFT while clicking on a mode will allow you to combine modes.
: '''AKEY.''' Select/Unselect all.
: '''BKEY-BKEY'''. Circle Select. If you press BKEY a second time after starting Border Select, Circle Select is invoked. It works as described above. Use NUM+ or NUM- or MW to adjust the circle size. Leave Circle Select with '''RMB''' or '''ESC'''.
: '''CTRL-H.''' With vertices selected, this creates a &quot;Hook&quot; object. Once a hook is selected, CTRL-H brings up an options menu for it.
: '''NKEY.''' Number Panel. Simpler than the Object Mode one, in Edit Mode works for Mesh, Curve, Surface: The location of the active vertex is displayed.
: '''OKEY.''' Switch in/out of Proportional Editing.
: '''SHIFT-O.''' Toggles between Smooth and Sharp Proportional Editing.
: '''PKEY.''' SeParate. You can choose to make a new object with all selected vertices, edges, faces and curves or create a new object from each separate group of interconnected vertices from a popup. Note that for curves you cannot separate connected control vertices. This operation is the opposite of Join ('''CTRL-J''').
: '''CTRL-P.''' Make Vertex Parent. If one object (or more than one) is/are selected and the active Object is in Edit Mode with 1 or 3 vertices selected then the Object in Edit Mode becomes the Vertex Parent of the selected Object(s). If only 1 vertex is selected, only the location of this vertex determines the Parent transformation; the rotation and dimensions of the Parent do not play a role here. If three vertices are selected, it is a `normal' Parent relationship in which the 3 vertices determine the rotation and location of the Child together. This method produces interesting effects with Vertex Keys. In EditMode, other Objects can be selected with CTRL-RMB.
: '''CTRL-S.''' Shear. In EditMode this operation enables you to make selected forms `slant'. This always works via the horizontal screen axis.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and can be returned to via UKEY. Mesh Objects have better Undo, see next section.
: '''WKEY.''' Specials PopupMenu. A number of tools are included in this PopupMenu as an alternative to the Edit Buttons. This makes the buttons accessible as shortcuts, e.g. EditButtons-&gt; Subdivide is also `WKEY, 1KEY'.
: '''SHIFT-W.''' Warp. Selected vertices can be bent into curves with this option. It can be used to convert a plane into a tube or even a sphere. The centre of the circle is the 3DCursor. The mid-line of the circle is determined by the horizontal dimensions of the selected vertices. When you start, everything is already bent 90 degrees. Moving the mouse up or down increases or decreases the extent to which warping is done. By zooming in/out of the 3Dwindow, you can specify the maximum degree of warping. The CTRL limiter increments warping in steps of 5 degrees.

== EditMode - Mesh ==

This section and the following highlight peculiar EditMode Hotkeys.
: '''ALT-B.''' Select portion of viewing area to only be visible.
: '''CTRL-NUM+.''' Adds to selection all vertices connected by an edge to an already selected vertex.
: '''CTRL-NUM-.''' Removes from selection all vertices of the outer ring of selected vertices.
: '''ALT-CTRL-RMB.''' Edge select.
: '''CKEY.''' If using curve deformations, this toggles the curve Cyclic mode on/off.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Selected. &quot;Extrude&quot; in EditMode transforms all the selected edges to faces. If possible, the selected faces are also duplicated. Grab mode is started directly after this command is executed.
: '''SHIFT-EKEY.''' Crease Subsurf edge. With &quot;Draw Creases&quot; enabled, pressing this key will allow you to set the crease weight. Black edges have no weight, edge-select color have full weight.
: '''CTRL-EKEY.''' Mark LSCM Seam. Marks a selected edge as a &quot;seam&quot; for unwrapping using the LSCM mode.
: '''FKEY.''' Make Edge/Face. If 2 vertices are selected, an edge is created. If 3 or 4 vertices are selected, a face is created.
: '''SHIFT-F.''' Fill selected. All selected vertices that are bound by edges and form a closed polygon are filled with triangular faces. Holes are automatically taken into account. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession.
: '''ALT-F.''' Beauty Fill. The edges of all the selected triangular faces are switched in such a way that equally sized faces are formed. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession. The Beauty Fill can be performed immediately after a Fill.
: '''CTRL-F.''' Flip faces, selected triangular faces are paired and common edge of each pair swapped.
: '''HKEY.''' Hide Selected. All selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
: '''SHIFT-H.''' Hide Not Selected: All non-selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.

*** ''Face Loop Select:'' ('''SHIFT-R''') Face loops are highlighted starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Face Loop Cut:'' ('''CTRL-R''') Face loops are highlighted starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (exact):'' ('''SHIFT-K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges are cut at intersections with mouse line. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (midpoints):'' ('''SHIFT-K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges intersecting with mouse line are cut in middle regardless of true intersection point. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an unselected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''SHIFT-L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''CTRL-L.''' Select Linked Selected. Starting with all selected vertices, all vertices connected to them are selected too.
: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Opens a popup asking for the axis to mirror. 3 possible axis group are available, each of which contains three axes, for a total of nine choices. Axes can be Global (Blender Global Reference); Local (Current Object Local Reference) or View (Current View reference). Remember that mirroring, like scaling, happens with respect to the current pivot point.
: '''ALT-M.''' Merges selected vertices at barycentrum or at cursor depending on selection made on pop-up.
: '''SHIFT+CTRL+ALT+MKEY''' Selects unclosed edges / holes in the mesh (Edge select mode only). 
: '''CTRL-N.''' Calculate Normals Outside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `outward'.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-N.''' Calculate Normals Inside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `inward'.
: '''ALT-S.''' Whereas '''SHIFT-S''' scales in Edit Mode as it does in Object Mode, for Edit Mode a further option exists, '''ALT-S''' moves each vertex in the direction of its local normal, hence effectively shrinking/fattening the mesh.
: '''CTRL-T.''' Make Triangles. All selected faces are converted to triangles.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and all subsequent changes are saved on a stack. This option enables you to restore the previous situation, one after the other.
: '''SHIFT-U.''' Redo. This let you re-apply any undone changes up to the moment in which Edit Mode was entered
: '''ALT-U.''' Undo Menu. This let you choose the exact point to which you want to undo changes.
** '''WKEY.''' Special Menu. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Subdivide:'' all selected edges are split in two.
*** ''Subdivide Fractal:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced randomly.
*** ''Subdivide Smooth:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced along the normal.

*** ''Select Swap:'' Selected vertices become unselected and vice versa.
*** ''Flip Normals:'' Normals of selected faces are flipped.
*** ''Smooth:'' Vertices are moved closer one to each other, getting a smoother object.
*** ''Bevel:'' Faces are reduced in size and the space between edges is filled with a smoothly curving bevel of the desired order.

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Vertices:'' all vertices are deleted. This includes the edges and faces they form.
*** ''Edges:'' all edges with both vertices selected are deleted. If this `releases' certain vertices, they are deleted as well. Faces that can no longer exist as a result of this action are also deleted.
*** ''Faces:'' all faces with all their vertices selected are deleted. If any vertices are `released' as a result of this action, they are deleted.
*** ''All:'' everything is deleted.
*** ''Edges and Faces:'' all selected edges and faces are deleted, but the vertices remain.
*** ''Only Faces:'' all selected faces are deleted, but the edges and vertices remain.
: '''YKEY.''' Split. This command splits the selected part of a Mesh without deleting faces. The split parts are no longer bound by edges. Use this command to control smoothing. Since the split parts have vertices at the same position, selection with '''LKEY''' is recommended.

== EditMode - Curve ==

: '''CKEY.''' Set the selected curves to cyclic or turn cyclic off. An individual curve is selected if at least one of the vertices is selected.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Curve. A vertex is added to the selected end of the curves. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is executed.
: '''FKEY.''' Add segment. A segment is added between two selected vertices at the end of two curves. These two curves are combined into one curve.
: '''HKEY.''' Toggle Handle align/free. Toggles the selected Bezier handles between free or aligned.

** '''WKEY.''' The special menu for curves appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices.
*** Switch direction. The direction of the selected curves is reversed. This is mainly for Curves that are used as paths!

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''Segment:'' a curve segment is deleted. This only works for single segments. Curves can be split in two using this option. Or use this option to specify the cyclic position within a cyclic curve.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== EditMode - Metaball ==

: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.

== EditMode - Surface ==

: '''CKEY.''' Toggle Cyclic menu. A PopupMenu asks if selected surfaces in the `U' or the `V' direction must be cyclic. If they were already cyclic, this mode is turned off.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Selected. This makes surfaces of all the selected curves, if possible. Only the edges of surfaces or loose curves are candidates for this operation. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is completed.

: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an non-selected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected together with all the vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''SHIFT-L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected together with all vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.
: '''SHIFT-R.''' Select Row. Starting with the last selected vertex, a complete row of vertices is selected in the `U' or `V' direction. Selecting ''Select Row'' a second time with the same vertex switches the `U' or `V' selection.
** '''WKEY.''' The special menu for surfaces appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices
*** Switch direction. This will switch the normals of the selected parts.
***'''ALT + MKEY.''' Mirror. Asks for axis (X,Y or Z) then mirrors the selected vertices

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following choices:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== VertexPaint Hotkeys ==

: '''SHIFT-K.''' All vertex colours are erased; they are changed to the current drawing colour.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. This undo is `real'. Pressing Undo twice redoes the undone.
: '''WKEY.''' Shared Vertexcol: The colours of all faces that share vertices are blended.

== EditMode - Font ==

In Text Edit Mode most hotkeys are disabled, to allow text entering.

: '''RIGHTARROW.''' Move text cursor 1 position forward
: '''SHIFT-RIGHTARROW.''' Move text cursor to the end of the line.
: '''LEFTARROW.''' Move text cursor 1 position backwards.
: '''SHIFT-LEFTARROW.''' Move text cursor to the start of the line
: '''DOWNARROW.''' Move text cursor 1 line forward
: '''SHIFT-DOWNARROW.''' Move text cursor to the end of the text.
: '''UPARROW.''' Move text cursor 1 line back.
: '''SHIFT-UPARROW.''' Move text cursor to the beginning of the text
: '''ALT-U.''' Reload Original Data (undo). When EditMode is started, the original text is saved. You can restore this original text with this option.
: '''ALT-V.''' Paste text. The text file /tmp/.cutbuffer is inserted at the cursor location.

== UV Editor Hotkeys ==

: '''EKEY.''' LSCM Unwrapping. Launches LSCM unwrapping on the faces visible in the UV editor.
: '''PKEY.''' Pin selected vertices. Pinned vertices will stay in place on the UV editor when executing an LSCM unwrap.
: '''ALT-PKEY.''' Un-Pin selected vertices. Pinned vertices will stay in place on the UV editor when executing an LSCM unwrap.

== EdgeSelect Hotkeys ==

: '''ALT-CLICK.''' Selects an Edge Loop.

== FaceSelect Hotkeys ==

: '''ALT-CLICK.''' Selects a Face Loop.
: '''TAB.''' Switches to EditMode, selections made here will show up when switching back to FaceSelectMode with TAB.
: '''FKEY.''' With multiple, co-planar faces selected, this key will merge them into one &quot;FGon&quot; so long as they remain co-planar (flat to each other).
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked UVs. To ease selection of face groups, Select Linked in UV Face Select Mode will now select all linked faces, if no seam divides them.
: '''RKEY.''' Calls a menu allowing to rotate the UV coordinates or the VertexCol.
** '''UKEY.''' Calls the UV Calculation menu. The following modes can the applied to the selected faces:
*** ''Cube:'' Cubical mapping, a number button asks for the cubemap size
*** ''Cylinder:'' Cylindrical mapping, calculated from the center of the selected faces
*** ''Sphere:'' Spherical mapping, calculated from the center of the selected faces
*** ''Bounds to x:'' UV coordinates are calculated from the actual view, then scaled to a boundbox of 64 or 128 pixels in square
*** ''Standard x:'' Each face gets default square UV coordinates
*** ''From Window:'' The UV coordinates are calculated using the projection as displayed in the 3DWindow

Q1) Use you knowledge of insulators and conductors to explain

Why the wires are insulated.
So that they do not make contact with each other.

Why the sheaths are made of plastic.
So that the user does not get an electric shock.

----
Q2) Why are the pins made of brass and why is the case plastic?

Brass is a good conductor.  Plastic is a good insulator.

----
Q4) A table lamp usually carries a current of 0.5A. What fuse should be put in the plug: 3A, 5A, or 13A?

3A
----

Q5) An iron usually carries a current of 5.2A. What fuse should be put in the plug: 3A, 5A, or 13A?

13A
----

Q6) A kettle is protected by an earth wire and a 13A fuse. The line wire comes loose and touches the side of the kettle. The fuse blows. Explain why.
The Earth completes the circuit with very low resistance. Therefore the current becomes very large (much bigger than the normal operating current) and the fuse blows.

----


Q7) Explain why the fuse is always located on the line wire and not the neutral wire?

The line wire has the higher voltage. If the line wire is damaged inside the appliance and a large current is created then the fuse needs to be in this part of the circuit so that it can blow. If the fuse was on the neutral wire and a fault occured on the line, the fuse would not be in the circuit and would not blow.

Q8) Describe and Explain what happens in the following scenarios:

a) The earth and line wire switch terminals on the plug
b) The line and neutral wire switch terminals on the plug
c) The neutral and earth wire switch terminals on the plug
d) When the earth wire is removed

'''Addressing Parents-in-Law:'''&lt;/big&gt; 

As in English-speaking relationships, how one addresses one's Father-in-law and Mother-in-law varies greatly on how friendly the relationship is, as well as the customs and dialect of the geographic region, etc. Before marriage, it is common for one to call his/her girlfriend/boyfriend's parents 아버지 or 아버지님 and 어머니 or 어머님. 

After marriage, the wife may address her new parents-in-law in the same way, however, a husband would call his mother-in-law 장모님, and his father-in-law 장인어른. Note that after marriage, how one speaks to one's parents-in-law becomes more formal, adding the honorific -님 suffix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is the flatulance comment realy necsessary?
I found it rather unapatising.

:Farting is the primary reason most people avoid beans, so it needs to be addressed. The overnight soaking and multi-hour simmering with water changes would be a rather mysterious procedure if it wasn't explained. People should know what happens if they cut the procudure short - this knowledge will save people both ways, because the procedure is rather annoying. If you live alone and have a stuffed up nose, you can stop when the beans are soft. If otherwise, you'll know that merely softening the beans is not enough and you can't cut corners.

==Optional ingredients==

I've moved everything besides the tortilla and the &quot;beans and/or meat&quot; to the optional section.  Those are really the only two neccessary ingredients to make a burrito - the rest is all up to preference - various herbs and spices are obviously optional, tomatoes I think are nice, but I've made lots of burritos without them, and lots of vegans make burritos, so the cheese is certainly optional, etc.  --[[w:User:Blackcats]]

:That would be a [[Vegan Burrito]] or [[Burrito (Vegan)]] then. We do this for many other recipes. A vegan &quot;burrito&quot; is only distantly related to a burrito. It's not normal to shove everything into the &quot;optional&quot; section. Advanced cooks are expected to know that they can eliminate ingredients as desired. Beginners need decent advice, which means that leaving out the normal major ingredients is not OK. Besides, even for the advanced cooks, it's better to see at a glance which ingredients are important. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:41, 8 April 2006 (UTC)


----

Having grown up in Texas, I never had a burrito until the 1980's when I didn't live in Texas anymore!!  My guess is that burritos are from California.  The primary issue is the flour tortilla.  I never even heard of flour tortillas growing up.  Furthermore, having traveled extensively in Mexico during the 1960's, we NEVER saw a flour tortilla.  We always had CORN tortillas.  I don't think wheat is something that is grown very often in Mexico.

All this said to emphasize that burritos ARE NOT classic Tex-Mex cuisine.</text>

I don't think there needs to be any! I'm in my final year of the IB and this page has been fantastic for revision. [[User:82.32.185.30|82.32.185.30]] 19:50, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

I'd have to agree. The aim for this page is not to provide an exhaustive history persay, but to identify key events, and supporting evidence for them, in order to facilitate review. [[User:Akademix|Akademix]] 17:41, 08 March 2007 (UTC)

== Merging with European History/A Brief Outline of European History ==

I proposed the merge because this page is certainly not a complete text - rather, it is lengthy, bounces all over the place in its ideas, and is in my opinion redundant because there is already a comprehensive text that covers this material far more thoroughly.  Instead, I believe this page should redirect to European History/A Brief Outline of European History, as this outline explores virtually every major theme in European History that could possibly be covered.  In this sense, it seems to make far more sense to use that complete, comprehensive text as a considerably more useful and thorough study guide.


* I agree with your view from the standpoint of efficiency.  However, there is nothing wrong with a refined text that approaches identical topics from alternate viewpoints - think what would have happened had the library in Alexandria not held various historical tomes mirroring one another.  Trade secrets and intellectual property become rather moot in that circumstance.  Given that the Internet is, by nature, an impermanent medium - subject to changes and even partial outages - what would happen if part of the WikiMedia servers were to spontaneously die (unlikely, but not impossible)?  I cannot agree with any standpoint that eschews redundancy to the benefit of &quot;efficiency&quot; however &quot;reasonable&quot; it may seem on the surface - and I'd question your stake in it if I didn't believe you worked every bit as hard as the editors here on your preferred text.  On the other hand, I can certainly see where this text could use improvement, and wholly intend to contribute to it whenever the time feels right.  Nobody should take this as a given, though, and it might behoove the community to encourage users to contribute to this book - no author is perfect, no plan is foolproof, and no one viewpoint can completely cover the facts.  That warning at the top is awfully influential against modifications to the text, destructive and constructive alike.

Perhaps we could re-do this page so that it structurally matches the the current IB Syllabus?  Make chapter headings correspond to sections in the syllabus?  Or does this belong to the wikiversity?  My thoughts are  that is mostly a revision aid and would belong here at wikibooks. . .

'''Mititei''' (grilled meatballs) is a typical Romanian dish. Usually in Romania you could find the prepared meat in most of the food shops, and you only have to cook them.

==Ingredients==
*minced [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] meat ([[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or beef-pork combination would do too)
*minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]]
*[[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]

==Procedure==
#All the ingredients are mixed together, forming a paste; the ingredients are not optional, and the quantities of condiments varies, according to the individual tastes.
#The meat paste is then shaped by hand, into [[Cookbook:cm|7-8 cm]] (3 [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]]) by 2-2.5 cm (1 inch) cylinders (about 50 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] each).
#It is best to [[Cookbook:Barbecuing|barbecue]](Grill) them rather to &lt;!--  --&gt;[[Cookbook:Fry|fry]] them, because they get additional flavour if a little smoked, but a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] is ok. DO NOT use [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]. It will only ruin the flavour. Try a spoon of [[Cookbook:Lard|pork fat]], or fry them in their own juice. It is best to not let them dry to much, they are better if they are juicy.
#You can eat them with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], and of course, [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] is necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Delphi is both an object oriented programming language (OOP) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Published by the Embarcadero company (formerly CodeGear and more formerly Borland), Delphi is an alternative to language such as Visual Basic offering development with both rapidity and good quality. However, nowadays most companies prefer more modern languages such as [[Java Programming|Java]] or [[C Sharp Programming|C#]].

It originated from the Pascal language, which then became Object Pascal (pascal with objects support). Delphi is Object Pascal running on Windows and Kylix is Object Pascal running on Linux.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Verbs/]] | [[../Verb Tenses/]]

The Imperfect Subjunctive is related to the [[../Preterite/|pretérito]] and [[../Imperfect/|imperfecto de indicativo]] as the [[../Present Subjunctive|presente de subjuntivo]] is related to the [[../Present|presente de indicativo]]. That is, when the verb of the independent clause is in the present, the present subjunctive is used in the dependent clause, and when the verb of the independent clause is in the preterite or imperfect, the imperfect subjunctive is used.
:''No quiero que rompas la lámpara.'' —I don't want you to break the lamp.
:''No quería que rompieras la lámpara.'' —I didn't want you to break the lamp.

===Conjugations===
Similar to the [[../Present Subjunctive|presente de subjuntivo]], begin with the third-person plural-form of the [[../Preterite|pretérito]] ('''ellos, ellas, and Usteds'''). Then, remove the '''-ron''' and add the following endings.

'''Hablar'''
hablaron -&gt; habla-

 Hablara     Hablarémos
 Hablaras    Hablaráis
 Hablara     Hablaran

'''Comer'''
comieron -&gt; comie-

 Comiera     Comiéramos
 Comieras    Comieráis
 Comiera     Comieran

'''Vivir'''
vivieron -&gt; vivie-

 Viviera     Viviéramos
 Vivieras    Vivieráis

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I noticed you've decided to [[Special:Contributions/Ivyboy|add a walkthrough for Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire]].  However, it seems that you may have obtained the walkthrough from the web, without the authors' permission to put it on Wikibooks, which would be ''illegal''.  You've also removed the notices saying it seems to be a copyright violation, without posting a rebuttal, which is suspicious and also not a good editing practice.  If you DO have permission from the authors (make sure they know what it would involve, as ''anyone'' would be able to edit their walkthrough), please give us proof.

Also, mind if I ask why you chose your username?  It seems awfully similar to mine. - [[User:Bulbaboy|Bulbaboy]] 20:38, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

==Removing VFDs, copyvio notices, and moving user pages==
Hello there.  I noticed that you removed a few VFDs and removed copyright violation notices.  Please refrain from doing so.  If there is a significant problem with a VFD, then please participate in the discussion by voicing your opinions rather than unilaterally removing the nomination.  Similarly, you should note in the edit description or the talk page why you are removing a copyright violation.

Finally, it is considered to be '''extremely''' rude to move somebody's user page.  Many people get testy even if you edit it.  Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.

Please refrain from repeating these actions, or I will be forced to block you.  If you have questions about anything at all, please feel free to [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Frazzydee&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new leave me a message] -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 05:00, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

:You have been '''''blocked''''' for 24 hours as a result of removing another VfD and redirecting [[User:Bulbaboy]] to your own user page.  Please use this time to reflect upon your actions.  You may [[Special:Emailuser/Frazzydee|email me]] to discuss this block.  Please add to VfD discussions if you feel that the book's deletion is not warranted; simply removing the notice is both feckless and disruptive.

:I hope to see more productive edits in the future. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 16:13, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes you won't be able to find an exact answer, but only an estimate of where the answer lies. This answer, along with suitable '''error bounds''', are perfectly acceptable and are often used for experimental data when a high degree of accuracy isn't always justifiable.

==Errors==

If you were told that a certain door was 2 metres tall, you could assume that the door could be anywhere between 1.5 and 2.5 metres, represented by the [[#Inequalities|inequality]] &lt;math&gt;1.5 \le x &lt; \; 2.5&lt;/math&gt;, and was actually rounded to 2 metres. If you were told that the same door is 2.0 metres, then you could assume more accuracy, and say the door was anywhere between 1.95 and 2.05 metres, represented by the inequality &lt;math&gt;1.95 \le x &lt; \; 2.05&lt;/math&gt;. Here you would say that the height of the door is 2 metres with '''error bounds''' of &lt;math&gt;\pm 0.05&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the actual value is within the range of 0.05m greater or less than the stated value. If you are not given error bounds of a measurement, you should assume that the last digit was rounded, and take all of the other digits as accurate.

The minimum and maximum value for the actual height of the door are called the '''lower''' and '''upper bounds''', and are used to determine the accuracy of measurements.

===Absolute error===

The '''absolute error''' is the difference between the value that is obtained and the true value. The absolute error of a measurement can be found by using the following formula:


&lt;math&gt;Absolute\ error = value\ obtained - true\ value&lt;/math&gt;


===Relative error===

The '''relative error''' is the absolute error as a proportion of the true value. The relative error of a measurement can be found by using the following formula:


&lt;math&gt;Relative\ error = \frac{absolute\ error}{true\ value}&lt;/math&gt;


===Percentage error===

The '''percentage error''' is the absolute error as a percentage of the true value. The percentage error of a measurement can be found by using the following formula:


&lt;math&gt;Percentage\ error = relative\ error \times 100&lt;/math&gt;


For example, if the true value of the 2 metre door was 1.95 metres, the absolute error is &lt;math&gt;2 - 1.95 = 0.05&lt;/math&gt;, the relative error is &lt;math&gt;\frac{0.05}{1.95} = 0.0256&lt;/math&gt;, and the percentage error is &lt;math&gt;0.0256 \times 100 = 2.56\%&lt;/math&gt;.

==Inequalities==

An inequality is an expression which compares the relative sizes of points, lines, or curves. Unlike an [[../Equations|equation]], where both sides of the equals sign are always equal, inequalities can have one side greater than or equal to the other side.

===The four signs of inequalities===

There are four main basic signs:

* &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; less than,
* &lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt; greater than,
* &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; less than or equal to, and
* &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; greater than or equal to.

For example, &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is less than 4, &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 4, &lt;math&gt;x\le 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is four or any number less than this, and &lt;math&gt;x\ge 4&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is four or any number higher than this. 

Note that &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y &lt; x&lt;/math&gt; are both essentially the same statement.

If you become confused with which sign means less than and greater than, it is useful to remember that the inequality signs always point to the smaller number. One basic rule to remember is that if you divide or multiply by a negative quantity the inequality sign reverses. For example &lt;math&gt;-x\ge7&lt;/math&gt; will become &lt;math&gt;x\le-7&lt;/math&gt;. This makes sense because -4 is greater than -5 and 5 is greater than 4.

===Combining inequalities===

There are some cases where two inequalities can be combined into one. For example, the height of the door was said to be between &lt;math&gt;x \ge 1.95&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \le 2.05&lt;/math&gt;. The usual way of writing these is &lt;math&gt;1.95 \le x &lt; 2.05&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the inequality signs are in the same direction. &lt;math&gt;2.05 \ge x &gt; 1.95&lt;/math&gt; is perfectly acceptable, but it is incorrect to combine opposite facing inequalities and they must be left as two separate inequalities.

===Solving Linear Inequalities===
In order to solve a linear inequality simply isolate x. For example: &lt;math&gt;-2x-5 \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-2x \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x \le \frac{-5}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the sign change.

===Solving Quadratic Inequalities===
In order to solve a quadratic inequalities we need to:
1)Set the inequality to zero.&lt;p&gt;
2)Factor the equation and find the zero(s).&lt;p&gt;
3)Make a number line with the zero(s) of the equation as the only points. Make intervals between these points.&lt;p&gt;
4)Find the sign of the factors. Then find the sign of the equation on the interval.&lt;p&gt;
5)The interval(s) that satisfy the  inequality is your answer set.&lt;p&gt;
For example: Find the intervals that satisfy the relationship&lt;math&gt;x^2 -4x \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Step 1:&lt;math&gt;x^2 -4x -5 \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Step2:&lt;math&gt;\left(x + 1\right)\left(x-5\right)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; so the zeros will be -1 and 5&lt;p&gt;
Step 3:
[[File:AlevelC1Step3.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Step 4:[[File:AlevelC1Step4.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Step 5: The intervals that satisfy the relationship are &lt;math&gt;-1 \ge x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;.This is the solution set.

===Solving Inequalities involving Fractions===
Solving an equation involving a fraction is very similar to solving a quadratic inequalities. When you solve an inequality involving fractions you cannot cross multiply (because you could be multiplying by a negative number which would reverse the sign of the inequality). This will lead to an erroneous answer. Also remember that you can never have a zero in the denominator.&lt;p&gt;
For example: Find the intervals that satisfy the relationship&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x+1}\le\frac{6-x}{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Step 1:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x+1}-\frac{6-x}{x+1}\le 0&lt;/math&gt; then simplified it becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac{x-5}{x+1}\le0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Step 2: It is already factored so the zeros are -1 and 5.&lt;p&gt;
Step 3:[[File:AlevelC1Step3.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Step 4:[[File:AlevelC1Step4.png]]&lt;p&gt;
Step 5: The intervals that satisfy the relationship are &lt;math&gt;x &gt; -1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \le 5&lt;/math&gt; therefore &lt;math&gt;-1 &lt; x \le 5&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;x &gt; -1\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than because x cannot equal -1 or else there will be a zero in the denominator.

===Interval Notation===
Interval notation is another way to write the interval of the solution to an inequality problem. You should give your answer in interval notation because it is easier to comprehend. In interval notation the solution set is given in brackets. There are two types of brackets that are used:&lt;p&gt;
( ) This kind of bracket means that the endpoint is not included in the solution set.&lt;math&gt;&lt;\,&lt;/math&gt;  And &lt;math&gt;&gt;,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[ ] This kind on bracket means that the endpoint is  included in the solution set.&lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; And
&lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also you can use various combinations of these brackets. If you have multiple intervals you will need to use the mathematical union sign &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;. Also if you have an interval that goes to  &lt;math&gt;\pm \infty&lt;/math&gt; you need to use the round bracket ), because &lt;math&gt;\pm \infty&lt;/math&gt; is a concept and not a number.&lt;p&gt;
For example convert &lt;math&gt;x&lt;-4\ -3\le x &lt; 7\ 8&lt; x \le 9\ 12 \le x&lt;/math&gt; to interval notation:&lt;p&gt;
In interval notation the solution set becomes &lt;math&gt;\left(-\infty,-4\right)\cup\left[-3,7\right)\cup\left(8,9\right]\cup\left[12,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; , as you can see this is easier to comprehend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An equation consists of two expressions joined by the equals sign (&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;). Everything on the left-hand side is equal to everything on the right-hand side, for example &lt;math&gt;2+3=4+1&lt;/math&gt;. Some equations contain a '''variable''', usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; , though any symbol can be used.
==Manipulating expressions==

Sometimes, expressions will be messier than they need to be, and they can be represented in an easier to understand form. The skills here are essential to the rest of the A-level course, although it is very likely that you have already covered them at GCSE.

===Collecting like terms===

When collecting like terms, you simply add all the terms in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; together, all the terms in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; together, and all the terms in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; together. The same applies for any other letter that represents a variable.

For example, &lt;math&gt;2x+4y+8z-3x-7y-2z+4x&lt;/math&gt; becomes:

&lt;math&gt;2x-3x+4x = 3x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4y-7y = -3y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;8z-2z = 6z&lt;/math&gt;

So, by adding all the answers, &lt;math&gt;2x+4y+8z-3x-7y-2z+4x&lt;/math&gt; simplified is &lt;math&gt;3x-3y+6z&lt;/math&gt;.

===Multiplication===

Multiplication of different variables such as &lt;math&gt;a \times b&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt;. Single variables become [[../Indices_and_Surds|indices]], so &lt;math&gt; x \times x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Like addition and subtraction, you keep like terms together. So, for example:

&lt;math&gt;2x^2z \times 3yz^2 \times 4xy^3&lt;/math&gt; becomes: &lt;math&gt;24{x^3}{y^4}{z^3}&lt;/math&gt;

===Fractions===
It is quite often that fractions are encountered. Therefore we need to learn how to handle them properly. When working with fractions, the rule is to make all of the denominators equal, and then write the expression as one fraction. You need to multiply both the top and bottom by the same amount to keep the meaning of the fraction the same.
	
For example, for &lt;math&gt;\frac {3x}{2} + \frac {2y}{5} - \frac {z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;, the common denomimator is &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;.

Multiply both parts by &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\frac {15x}{10}&lt;/math&gt;
	
Multiply both parts by &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\frac {4y}{10}&lt;/math&gt;
	
Leave this as it is: &lt;math&gt;\frac {z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;
	
You now have &lt;math&gt;\frac {15x}{10} + \frac{ 4y}{10} - \frac {z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;, which becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac {15x+4y-z}{10}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Solving equations==

Often, to solve an equation you must rearrange it so that the unknown term is on its own side of the equals sign. By rearranging &lt;math&gt;2 + x = 5&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x = 5 - 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has been made the '''subject''' of the equation. Now by simplifying the equation, you can find that the solution is &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;An equation with a variable will only hold true for certain values of that variable. For example &lt;math&gt;2 + x = 5&lt;/math&gt; is only true for &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;. The values that the variables have when the equation is true are called the '''solutions''' of the equation. Therefore &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of the equation &lt;math&gt;2 + x = 5&lt;/math&gt;.

===Changing the subject of an equation===

You will usually be given equations that are more complex than the example above. To move a term from one side of the equals sign to the other, you have to do the same thing on both sides of the equals sign. For example, to make &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the subject of &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{4 a (x^2 +b)}{3}&lt;/math&gt;:

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|Multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;3y = 4 a (x^2 + b)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Divide both sides by &lt;math&gt;4a&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac {3y}{4a} = x^2 + b&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Subtract &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from both sides
|&lt;math&gt;\frac {3y}{4a} -b = x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Square root both sides
|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac {3y}{4a} -b } = x &lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;- \sqrt{\frac {3y}{4a}-b } = x&lt;/math&gt; 
|}

===Solving quadratic equations===

Quadratic equations are equations where the variable is raised to the power of 2 and, unlike linear equations, there are a maximum of two '''roots'''. A root is one value of the variable where the equation is true, and to fully solve an equation, you must find all of the roots. For a quadratic equation you can factorise it and then easily find which values make the equation valid. The example above is quite a simple case. You will usually be given a more complicated equation such as &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If the equation isn't already in the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;, rearrange it so that it is. The steps needed to factorise &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt; are:

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
| Multiply &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; (coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the constant term)
| &lt;math&gt;2 \times 3 = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Find two numbers that add to give &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; (coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) and multiply to give &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt; (answer from previous step)
| &lt;math&gt;2 \times 3 = 6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2 + 3 = 5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Split &lt;math&gt;5x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;2x + 3x&lt;/math&gt; (from the results of the previous step)
| &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 2x + 3x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Simplify
| &lt;math&gt;2x(x + 1) + 3(x + 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Simplify further
| &lt;math&gt;(2x + 3)(x + 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So &lt;math&gt;(2x + 3)(x + 1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt; in factorised form. You can now use the fact that any number multiplied by &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to find the roots of the equation. The numbers that make one bracket equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of the equation. In the example, the roots are &lt;math&gt;-1.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also possible to solve a quadratic equation using the [[../Polynomials#The_quadratic_formula|quadratic formula]] or by [[../Polynomials#Completing_the_square|completing the square]].

==Simultaneous equations==

Simultaneous equations are useful in solving two or more variables at once. Basic simultaneous equations consist of two linear expressions and can be solved by three different methods: elimination, substitution or by plotting the graph.

===Elimination method===

The basic principle of the elimination method is to manipulate one or more of the expressions in order to cancel out one of the variables, and then solve for the correct solution.

An example of this:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (1) to this equation)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 6y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (2) to this equation)
|}

From this, we can see that by multiplying equation (1) by a factor of 2 and then subtracting this new equation from (2), the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-variable will be eliminated.

(1) &lt;math&gt;\times 2 \rightarrow 4x + 6y = 20&lt;/math&gt; (1a) (Assigning the number (1a) to this equation)

Now subtracting (2) from (1a):

{|
|align=&quot;right&quot;|
|&lt;math&gt;4x + 6y = 20&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1a)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 6y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 0y = 14&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|
|}

Now that we have &lt;math&gt;2x = 14&lt;/math&gt;, we can solve for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which in this case is &lt;math&gt;7&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;x = 7&lt;/math&gt;.

Substitute the newly found &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; into (1):

&lt;math&gt;2 \times 7 + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;14 + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;

And we find that &lt;math&gt;y = - 4/3&lt;/math&gt;

So, the solution to the two equations (1) and (2) are:

&lt;math&gt;x = 7&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = -4/3&lt;/math&gt;

===Substitution method===

The substitution method relies on being able to rearrange the expressions to isolate a single variable, in the form variable = expression. From this result this new expression can then be substituted for the variable itself, and the solutions evaluated.

An example of this:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y = 12&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (1) to this equation)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x + y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (2) to this equation)
|}

From this expression, it is possible to see that (2) is the most simplistic expression, and thus will be the better choice to rearrange.

Taking (2), and rearranging this into &lt;math&gt;x = 6 - y&lt;/math&gt;. (2a)

Subbing (2a) into (1) we get

&lt;math&gt;2(6 - y) + 3y = 12&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this, we get that &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Again we can sub this result into one of the original equations to solve for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. 
In this case &lt;math&gt;x = 6&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that for situations in which one of the equations is non-linear, you must isolate one variable in the linear equation and substitute it into the non-linear one. Then you can solve the quadratic equation with one of the methods above.

Another form of substitution is if you've got a similar expression in both equations, like in this case:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 3y = 10&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (1) to this equation)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x + 6y = 6&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|style=&quot;width:1em&quot;|
|(Assigning the number (2) to this equation)
|}

Here, &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt; is found in both equations, so:

{|
|&lt;math&gt;2x = 10 - 3y&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(1)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2x = 6 - 6y&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;width:2em&quot;|
|(2)
|}

And since &lt;math&gt;2x = 2x&lt;/math&gt;, you could do:

&lt;math&gt;10 - 3y = 6 - 6y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;6y - 3y = 6 - 10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;3y = -4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = -4/3&lt;/math&gt;

Now you've got &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and finding &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will be the same as above.

Graph by first solving for y.  2x+3y=12

===Solving problems with simultaneous equations===

Often, you will be given problems which you must be able to write out as a pair of simultaneous equations. You will need to recognise such problems, and write them out correctly before solving them. Most problems will be similar to these examples with some differences.

'''Example'''

''At a record store, 2 albums and 1 single costs £10. 1 album and 2 singles cost £8. Find the cost of an album and the cost of a single.''

Taking an album as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and a single as &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the two equations would be:

&lt;math&gt;2a+s=10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a+2s=8&lt;/math&gt;

We could incorporate the following...

''' Burns '''

First cool the burn with large quantities of water.  Do not use ice.  Then cover the burn with sterile or clean dressings.  Then seek help for serious burns or burns that impair breathing, cause shock, or are caused by unusual means (radiation, chemicals, electricity).

Do ''not'' lance burn blisters.

This is the first edition new Wikibooks periodical newsletter. It’s goal is to give general information about current Wikibooks developments. This first issue will mention several things from the relatively recent past on Wikibooks ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page )

== New Developments ==
The Free High School Science Text group from South Africa has started a couple of new books, [[FHSST Biology]], [[FHSST Physics]], and [[FHSST Computer Literacy]], and they have more planned. The project has the goal of providing free science textbooks to all of South Africa. Of course, we know that eventually the books they create will be used in other places as well. The FHSST ( http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst/index.html ) has a large group of contributors organized and already working. They were doing primary development offline and then uploading the information, but leader Mark H ( http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst/4_team.html ) has decided to try out the Wikibooks development tools for their Biology book, developing it online from the very start. 

The FHSST folks are also working with two other organizations to develop lesson plans related to the textbooks.

:http://www.tuxlabs.org.za/
:http://moodle.hmo.ac.za/

We hope that the FHSST books and related materials will set the stage for other adventuresome educators to begin organized efforts to develop educational materials on Wikibooks.

Wikibooks is now experimenting with a method of focusing effort called the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month]] ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Collaboration_of_the_Month ). The idea is to identify a certain book each month for the community to rally around and work on together.

Wikistats ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm ) This page gives statistics about Wikibooks.

Book organization software enabled – Developers enabled wiki software that automatically creates links from daughter pages to parent pages. It also allows easy link-making from parent pages to daughter pages. Format links from parent pages to daughter pages like this: [[/Daughter page]] To take advantage of this feature, place subpages after slashes in the page titling scheme. For example, a chapter on trees in the Plants section of a general biology book: /General_Biology/Plants/Trees On the Trees page, the site automatically creates back links to the Plants page as well as the General_Biology page. Is that cool or what?

Wiki Junior – Wikibooks is developing a series of nonfiction children’s books called Wiki Junior ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior ). The currently under development are:
* Big Cats ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_Big_Cats ), 
* South America ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_South_America ), and the 
* Solar System ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_Solar_System ).

The Wikibooks Newsletter – this is an experiment in communication and rallying of the troops, inspired by Linspire founder Michael Robertson’s “Michael’s Minute” weekly newsletter.

== New Books of Note ==



== Most Active Books ==
*[[Cookbook]] (always)
*[[Jokebook]]


== Recommended Reading ==
*[[How To Build A Computer]] ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/How_To_Build_A_Computer )
*[[World History]] ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/World_History )
*[[Seven Habits Study Guide]] ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seven_Habits_Study_Guide )

== In Other Languages ==

== Wikibooks in the News ==
*'''Jimmy Wales on Slashdot''' – When Jimmy was interviewed on Slashdot recently ( http://interviews.slashdot.org/interviews/04/07/28/1351230.shtml?tid=146&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=11 ), he expressed that one of the things that he is most excited about within the world of Wiki is changing the world of education in the developing world with the creation of free educational materials on Wikibooks.
*[http://www.govtech.net/magazine/channel_story.php?channel=27&amp;id=93976 Panel on Open Source]

== Think Tank &amp; Issues of Debate ==
'''How should the textbook hierarchy be organized?''' With slashes, colons, dashes … “Wikibooks founder” Karl Wick suggests slashes, as the site automatically recognizes slashes as indicators of page structure, and now has software enabled that creates automatic links on daughter pages to parent pages (see New Developments). 

'''How can Wikibooks involve more educators?''' If you are an educator, please give us feedback as to what would help you to use Wikibooks in the classroom or as a development tool, or give examples of how you have used Wikibooks materials in your classroom.</text>

[[Image:Preparation_pizza_pancetta_2.JPG|thumb|right|pancetta pizza]]
'''Pancetta''' is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] form of [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]].  It is pork belly that has been salt cured and spiced, and dried for about three months (but usually not smoked). There are many varieties and each part of Italy produces its own type.  In Corsica, it is considered a regional flavour.

Pancetta can be rolled, the most common type (as in the photograph), or straight (with all the fat on one side).

When served on its own, the rolled pancetta is presented in very thin slices.  More often it is used to flavour other dishes, especially [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] sauces.  Recipes which include pancetta are described as ''all’amatriciana'', for the town of Amatrice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think it would be helpful to add comments to the #include directives, as to why they have to be included (i.e. for what function calls / constants etc.)

== more examples ==

the functions gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() still elude my mental grasp. I would love to see these two functions used in an example (or two)  so i can figure out how precisely they are used.

== example _error_ ==

The server example has a while(1) loop which throws it into an infinite loop. The example should be fixed to not do that.

== Dependencies ==
&quot;This guide assumes you already have a good general idea about C, UNIX and networks.&quot;
Can we agree on a good Wikibook, or at least a free reference, on these? Obviously, this book would cover C, but providing links to the networking and Unix dependencies would be nice. I'll look around and come back with some suggestions. [[User:Ingcake|Ingcake]] ([[User talk:Ingcake|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ingcake|contribs]]) 18:14, 27 May 2015 (UTC)</text>

no errors, i'm russian ;)

== Как и  Каким образом ==
Приьет, I'm learning Russian and I would like to know what is the difference between ''Как'' and ''Каким образом''. It seems they can be translate in English by ''How'' but I suppose there is a grammatical difference between them which in English we don't distinguish.

The one who wrote Russian examples! There are too many mistakes. You are just confusing the people who read this.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we will talk about structures with three operations. These are called algebras. We will start by defining an algebra over a field, which is a vector space with a bilinear vector product. After giving some examples, we will then move to a discussion of quivers and their path algebras.

== Algebras over a Field ==

'''Definition 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a field, and let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-vector space on which we define the vector product &lt;math&gt;\cdot\,:\,A\times A\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''algebra over'' &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; provided that &lt;math&gt;(A,+,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a ring, where &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; is the vector space addition, and if for all &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in F&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;a(bc)=(ab)c&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;a(b+c)=ab+ac&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a+b)c=ac+bc&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;\alpha(ab)=(\alpha a)b=a(\alpha b)&lt;/math&gt;.
The ''dimension'' of an algebra is the dimension of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as a vector space.


'''Remark 2:''' The appropriate definition of a ''subalgebra'' is clear from Definition 1. We leave its formal statement to the reader.


'''Definition 2:''' If &lt;math&gt;(A,+,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative ring, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''commutative algebra''. If it is a division ring, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''division algebra''. We reserve the terms ''real'' and ''complex algebra'' for algebras over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.


The reader is invited to check that the following examples really are examples of algebras.


'''Example 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a field. The vector space &lt;math&gt;F^n&lt;/math&gt; forms a commutative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra under componentwise multiplication.


'''Example 4:''' The quaternions &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-dimensional real algebra. We leave it to the reader to show that it is ''not'' a 2-dimensional complex algebra.


'''Example 5:''' Given a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, the vector space of polynomials &lt;math&gt;F[x]&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra in a natural way.


'''Example 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a field. Then any matrix ring over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, for example &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{array}{cc} F &amp; 0 \\ F &amp; F\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, gives rise to an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra in a natural way.

== Quivers and Path Algebras ==

Naively, a quiver can be understood as a directed graph where we allow loops and parallell edges. Formally, we have the following.

'''Definition 7:''' A ''quiver'' is a collection of four pieces of data, &lt;math&gt;Q=(Q_0,Q_1,s,t)&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''vertices'' of the quiver,
# &lt;math&gt;Q_1&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''edges'', and
# &lt;math&gt;s,t\,:\, Q_1\rightarrow Q_0&lt;/math&gt; are functions associating with each edge a ''source vertex'' and a ''target vertex'', respectively.
We will always assume that &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty and that &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_1&lt;/math&gt; are finite sets.


'''Example 8:''' The following are the simplest examples of quivers:
# The quiver with one point and no edges, represented by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
# The quiver with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; point and no edges, &lt;math&gt;1\quad 2\quad ... \quad n&lt;/math&gt;.
# The linear quiver with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points, &lt;math&gt;1\,\stackrel{a_1}{\longrightarrow}\, 2\,\stackrel{a_2}{\longrightarrow} \,...\,\xrightarrow{a_{n-1}} \,n&lt;/math&gt;.
# The simplest quiver with a nontrivial loop, &lt;math&gt;1\underset{a}\stackrel{b}{\leftrightarrows} 2&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 9:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver. A ''path'' in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of edges &lt;math&gt;a=a_ma_{m-1}...a_1&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s(a_i)=t(a_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i=2,...,m&lt;/math&gt;. We extend the domains of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and define &lt;math&gt;s(a)\equiv s(a_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t(a)\equiv t(a_m)&lt;/math&gt;. We define the ''length'' of the path to be the number of edges it contains and write &lt;math&gt;l(a)=m&lt;/math&gt;. With each vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; of a quiver we associate the ''trivial path'' &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s(e_i)=t(e_i)=i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l(e_i)=0&lt;/math&gt;. A nontrivial path &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s(a)=t(a)=i&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''oriented loop'' at &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.


The reason quivers are interesting for us is that they provide a concrete way of constructing a certain family of algebras, called ''path algebras''.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a field. Let &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; denote the free vector space generated by all the paths of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. On this vector space, we define a vector porduct in the obvious way: if &lt;math&gt;u=u_m...u_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v=v_n...v_1&lt;/math&gt; are paths with &lt;math&gt;s(v)=t(u)&lt;/math&gt;, define their product &lt;math&gt;vu&lt;/math&gt; by concatenation: &lt;math&gt;vu=v_n...v_1u_m...u_1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;s(v)\neq t(u)&lt;/math&gt;, define their product to be &lt;math&gt;vu=0&lt;/math&gt;. This product turns &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; into an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra, called the ''path algebra of'' &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; field. If &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; contains a path of length &lt;math&gt;|Q_0|&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional.

''Proof:'' By a counting argument such a path must contain an oriented loop, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, say. Evidently &lt;math&gt;\{ a^n \}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; is a linearly independent set, such that &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional.


'''Lemma 12:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a field. Then &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional if and only if &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; contains an oriented loop.

''Proof:'' Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be an oriented loop in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional by the above argument. Conversely, assume &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; has no loops. Then the vertices of the quiver can be ordered such that edges always go from a lower to a higher vertex, and since the length of any given path is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;|Q_0|-1&lt;/math&gt;, there dimension of &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt; is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dim}\,FQ\leq |Q_0|^2-|Q_0|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 13:''' Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be a quiver and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a field. Then the trivial edges &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; form an orthogonal idempotent set.

''Proof:'' This is immediate from the definitions: &lt;math&gt;e_ie_j=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;i\neq j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_i^2=e_i&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Corollary 14:''' The element &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in Q_0} e_i&lt;/math&gt; is the identity element in &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof:'' It sufficed to show this on the generators of &lt;math&gt;FQ&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be a path in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s(a)=j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t(a)=k&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{i\in Q_0} e_i\right)a=\sum_{i\in Q_0} e_ia=e_ja=a&lt;/math&gt;. Similarily, &lt;math&gt;a\left(\sum_{i\in Q_0} e_i\right)=a&lt;/math&gt;.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.67}}

Python is a powerful, high-level, dynamic language. The version of Python used in Blender 2.67 is 3.3. If you are unfamiliar with Python, start with the [[Python|Python book]]. If you are familiar with older (2.''x'') versions of Python, [http://docs.python.org/py3k/whatsnew/3.0.html this page] summarizes what’s new in 3.''x''.

If you are familiar with Python scripting in older versions of Blender, be aware that 2.5''x''/2.6''x'' is completely different; the old &lt;code&gt;Blender&lt;/code&gt; module is gone. Much of the functionality is now available through the &lt;code&gt;bpy&lt;/code&gt; module, but don’t expect an exact 1:1 correspondence.

== First Steps In Blender Scripting ==

Open a new, default Blender document. If you haven’t customized your settings, there will be a Timeline [[File:Blender270TimelineIcon.png]] window along the bottom; change this to a Python Console [[File:Blender269PythonConsoleIcon.png]]. Perhaps increase its height to let you see more lines at once.

To start with, let’s find out what objects are present in the document. At the “&gt;&gt;&gt;” prompt, type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
bpy.data.objects
&lt;/source&gt;
You should see the response
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;bpy_collection[3], BlendDataObjects&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
which isn’t actually all that informative. In fact what you have here is an ''iterator''; to see its contents, just do the usual Python thing and convert it to a list. Try entering this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list(bpy.data.objects) #or being lazy: bpy.data.objects[:]
&lt;/source&gt;
This time the response should be
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
[bpy.data.objects[&quot;Camera&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Lamp&quot;]]
&lt;/source&gt;
which shows you how to refer to the three default objects you can see in the 3D View window.

Let’s get a reference to the Cube object for more convenient access: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Cube = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

Now let’s try querying the value of one of its attributes: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Cube.delta_location
&lt;/source&gt;
You should see the response
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Vector((0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; type comes from the &lt;code&gt;mathutils&lt;/code&gt; module provided by Blender. But unlike &lt;code&gt;bpy&lt;/code&gt;, this is not automatically imported into the Python Console. So let’s bring it in for subsequent use: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import mathutils
&lt;/source&gt;
OK, now let’s try changing the location of the default Cube: type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Cube.delta_location += mathutils.Vector((1, 1, 1))
&lt;/source&gt;
(Note the doubled parentheses: &lt;code&gt;mathutils.Vector&lt;/code&gt; takes a ''single'' argument, which is a tuple of X, Y and Z coordinate values.)

Were you watching the 3D View when you pressed {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}? You should have seen the cube jump to a different position. To make it move again, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|UPARROW}} to bring back the above command, so you can execute it again with {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}. As soon as you do this, the cube will jump another step, like before. And that’s it—you’re scripting!

== The &lt;code&gt;bpy&lt;/code&gt; Module ==

The contents of the &lt;code&gt;bpy&lt;/code&gt; module are divided into several submodules (actually classes, but never mind), among which are:

* &lt;code&gt;bpy.data&lt;/code&gt; — This is where you find the contents of the current document.
* &lt;code&gt;bpy.types&lt;/code&gt; — information about the types of the objects in &lt;code&gt;bpy.data&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;bpy.ops&lt;/code&gt; — ''operators'' perform the actual functions of Blender; these can be attached to hotkeys, menu items and buttons. And of course they can be invoked from a script. When you write an addon script, it will typically define new operators. Every operator must have a unique name.
* &lt;code&gt;bpy.context&lt;/code&gt; — contains settings like the current 3D mode, which objects are selected, and so on. Also accessible in the Console window via the global variable &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;bpy.props&lt;/code&gt; — functions for defining ''properties''. These allow your scripts to attach custom information to a scene, that for example the user can adjust through interface elements to control the behaviour of the scripts.

== The &lt;code&gt;mathutils&lt;/code&gt; Module ==

The module &lt;code&gt;mathutils&lt;/code&gt; defines several important classes that are used heavily in the rest of the Blender API.

* &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt;: the representation of 2D or 3D coordinates.
* &lt;code&gt;Matrix&lt;/code&gt;: the most general way of representing any kind of linear transformation.
* &lt;code&gt;Euler&lt;/code&gt;: a straightforward way of representing rotations as a set of ''Euler angles'', which are simply rotation angles about the X, Y and Z axes. Prone to well-known pitfalls such as [[w:Gimbal_lock|gimbal lock]].
* &lt;code&gt;Quaternion&lt;/code&gt;: on the face of it, a more mathematically abstruse way of representing rotations. But in fact this has many nice properties, like absence of gimbal lock, and smoother interpolation between two arbitrary rotations. The latter is particularly important in character animation.
* &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt;: a representation of RGB colours and conversion to/from HSV space (no alpha channel).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''tangent''' is a line in the same plane as a given circle that meets that circle in exactly one point. That point is called the '''point of tangency'''. A tangent cannot pass through a circle; if it does, it is classified as a '''chord'''. A '''secant''' is a line containing a chord.

[[Image:Tangent_Secant_of_circle.jpg‎|right|thumb|The point of tangency is labeled A, the tangent line is labeled B, and the secant line is labeled C.]]

A '''common tangent''' is a line tangent to two circles in the same plane. If the tangent does not intersect the line containing and connecting the centers of the circles, it is an '''external tangent'''. If it does, it is an '''internal tangent'''. 

Two circles are tangent to one another if in a plane they intersect the same tangent in the same point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On definition of term 'Potential energy' - 'Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state.'

It looks incorrect a bit - internal (thermal, for example) energy is also described by state, but this energy is not potential, obviously. 

One more note - may be it's a bad idea to avoid negative numbers - gravitational energy is (actually) always negative.

And, may be the general formula for energy of gravitational interaction energy shuld be added?

== Cantonese sounds ==
=== Syllables ===
There are far fewer syllables in the Cantonese language than English.  The syllables are also easily described with the concepts of ''initials'' and ''finals''.  A syllable begins with a single consonant.  This is called the ''initial''.  The rest of the syllable is called the ''final.'' A final can have a single vowel or a diphthong (two vowels that glide from one to the other) and an optional final consonant (''p'', ''t'', ''k'', ''m'', ''n'', or ''ng'').

The pronunication guide below is based on American English except where otherwise noted.  Not all sounds can be described with English words and some are just approximations at best.  Be sure to listen to actual speakers to ensure that your pronunciation is correct.  Use the [http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-can/ Syllabary] to hear recordings of a native speaker.

==== Tips on finals ====
* The final consonants ''p'', ''t'', and ''k'' are '''unreleased'''.  This means that they are virtually silent and you hear no &quot;puff of air&quot; at the end of the syllable.  To give a concrete example, say the word &quot;cup&quot; and do not open your lips at the end of the word.  Note how there is no &quot;puff of air&quot; at the end. The ''k'' sound will also shift from being what is termed a '''velar stop''' to a '''glottal stop''' when it is used to add liveliness to final modal particles. The final consonant ''k'' will sometimes disappear in rapid speech as in the expression ''m4 sai2 haa[k]3 hei3''.
* The ''aa'' sounds are a low back vowel which is slightly longer in length and different in quality from the ''a'' sounds.  Be sure to note the difference in these sounds since confusing the two will change the meaning of words.
* The vowel quality in ''ing'', ''it'', and ''ik'' is not the same as in ''in'',''im'', or ''i''.  It's the same difference between the English words &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;seen&quot; (or in grammar school terms a &quot;short&quot; vowel versus a &quot;long&quot; vowel).   While this difference is not as important as the one above since it does not contrast word meanings, you will have a much more obvious &quot;foreign accent&quot; if you do not master these two sounds.
* The ''yu'' sound does not exist in English but it is not hard to produce.  Start by saying a long ''i'' as in &quot;see&quot; and--without changing anything else!--round your lips.  It's a common sound in French so &quot;think French&quot; if you have to.
* The ''eu'' sound does not exist in English either but like the ''yu'' it's just a case of rounding the lips.  Start by saying the ''e'' sound in &quot;bet&quot; and--without changing anything else!--round your lips.
* The ''eui'' sound is simply a fusion of ''eu'' and ''i'' (&quot;eu-ee&quot;) into a single syllable.
* The ''o'' sound does not exist in '''American''' English, but it is in British English.  It is the back rounded vowel that you hear when British people say &quot;more&quot; or &quot;scorn&quot;.  If you listen carefully to a British speaker, you'll notice they do not pronounce the &quot;r&quot; in these words.  It is the quality of the &quot;o&quot; vowel that makes them unique to American speakers' ears.
* The final ''eung'' has a faint, British ''r'' sound riding on the vowel, so the number two would be pronounced somewhat like &quot;leurng&quot;.  Be careful -- pronouncing this sound with an American ''r'' is a common mistake that sounds extremely foreign.
* Only the finals ''m'' and ''ng'' can be used as standalone [[w:nasal consonant|nasal]] syllables.
* Vowels preceding nasal final consonants are not nasalized, yet vowels following nasal consonants are.  You can hold your nose while pronouncing some syllables such as ''sin1'' or ''ngo5'' to test your pronunciation.  It's not critical to get this right, but doing so will reduce any apparent foreign accent.

=== Tones ===
==== Introduction ====
All the Chinese languages are tonal.  This is usually one of the biggest challenges for English speakers to overcome since English does not use tones to distinguish meanings.  But notice English does use stress to distinguish meanings, try for yourself: what does 'pro.test mean versus pro.'test?

There is a common misconception that tones requires a musical ear or that you must use a particular pitch.  In fact, tones are always relative.  For instance, if a tone is &quot;high falling&quot; then the key is to start on a pitch that is in the upper range of your normal voice and allow the pitch to drop to the lower range of your normal voice so that you end on a pitch lower than where you started.  Like any pronunciation in any language, success lies in a lot of listening and practicing.  You can and will eventually master them if you conscientiously work on them.

==== Tone categories and numbers ====
{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|'''Yale'''
|'''Description'''
|'''Alternative Notation'''
|'''Start to End Pitch'''
|-
|ā, à
|high level or high falling
|1
|55 or 53
|-
|á
|mid rising
|2
|35
|-
|a
|mid level
|3
|33
|-
|àh
|low falling
|4
|21
|-
|áh
|low rising
|5
|23
|-
|ah
|low level
|6
|22
|}

For the Start/End Pitch, the two numbers listed above are from one to five with one being the lowest pitch and five being the highest for the tone course.  Cantonese school children typically recite the tones in the order listed above: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, with tone 1 being high falling.  For historical reasons, high level is not recited.  In some people, low falling is considerable and a &quot;creakiness&quot; can be heard in the pronunciation.

==== Tips on tones ====
* The syllables that end with ''p'', ''t'', and ''k'' usually are considered only to have &quot;checked&quot; level tones.  Because these syllables are so short, a rise or fall in the pitch usually cannot be detected.  Sometimes the pitch actually changes depending on the tones of the words before it, as in the word for &quot;dish&quot;, ''dip6'' versus ''dip2''.  Both can be correct, and you will notice many other low falling or low level words shift to a mid rising tone.
* A great way to practice tones is to listen to sound files of vocabulary words and guess the tones '''without''' looking at the romanization.  The better you can recognize the tones, the better you can reproduce them in your own speech.
* As you learn more words, you will automatically be able to guess some close tones (e.g., ''maai5'' versus ''maai6'') on many syllables in context, so don't be too concerned if you're having trouble at first.  Patience is the key!

== Yale Romanization ==
=== Conventions ===
#No spaces between syllables that make up a single word.  If the break between syllables becomes unclear you can use an apostrophe, e.g. 二奶 (yih'nāai).
#Tone mark always comes on first vowel.  In the case of the words 唔 (̀mh) and 五 (̀ngh), the tone mark falls on the ''m'' and ''g''.

==Procedure==
# In a large [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]], mix flour, salt and orange peel; [[cookbook:whisk|whisk]] gently to distribute the ingredients.
# Split green cardamom pods and remove the seeds inside. With a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]], grind the seeds into a powder and add this to the other dry ingredients.
# In a small bowl, combine yeast, warm water and sugar. Stir gently for a few seconds, then let stand until the yeast is frothy.
# In a small saucepan on low-to-medium heat, combine butter and milk and bring the mixture to at least {{convert|180|F|C}} while stirring, then turn off heat to let it cool.
# In a separate bowl, beat 2 eggs and set aside.
# Check that the milk and butter mixture is not hot, then add the it into the dry ingredients and mix.
# [[cookbook:Knead|Knead]] the dough until it is smooth and elastic. 
# Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl and let rise in a warm place (in the oven, for example) until it doubles in size, about one hour.
# Knock back the dough, and cut in two parts (one for each loaf).

=== Braiding ===
# For each of the halves, 
## Split the dough into three equal sized portions.
## Roll these into &quot;ropes&quot; about 18 inches (45 cm) long.
## Pinch one end of each rope together.
## Braid the ropes together:
### Take the left rope and cross it over the middle one.
### Take the right rope and cross it over the middle one.
### Repeat this procedure until the ropes are fully braided.
## Pinch the other end of the ropes together.
## Tuck each pinched end underneath the main loaf.
# Put finished braids on a greased [[Cookbook:cookie sheet|cookie sheet]].
# Let rise again until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
# Prepare an egg wash by beating 1 egg thinned with water. 
# Brush the top of each braid with the egg wash.
# Sprinkle each braid with pearl sugar and sliced almonds.
# Bake at 180&amp;nbsp;°C (350&amp;nbsp;°Fahrenheit) for 25 minutes.

==Variations==
* For a [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] version, substitute [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] for milk, egg replacer for eggs, and a vegan [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] for butter.

==Notes==
* Store-bought ground cardamom can be used in this recipe, but has a less intense flavor than freshly ground cardamom.
* Orange peel is not traditional in cardamom bread.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Linguistics ==
[[w:Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] is part of the [[Yue]] group in the [[w:Chinese language|Chinese language]] family.  Although you will often hear people refer to Cantonese as a [[w:Chinese spoken language|&quot;Chinese dialect&quot;]], it is important to realize in what sense the word [[w:Dialect|&quot;dialect&quot;]] is being used.  A dialect of a language means a variety of a language that is still mutually intelligible with other speakers of that language according to definition of western linguistics.  For instance, we can say that the English of New York City or London represent two different dialects of English.  But in Chinese linguistics, we often call any Chinese language that is not [[w:Standard Mandarin|Standard Mandarin]] a dialect of Chinese.  But many of the so-called dialects are not mutually intelligible.  For example, Cantonese is not at all intelligible with Mandarin.  Chinese people often make the joke that a Cantonese speaker and a Mandarin speaker together is like &quot;a chicken talking to a duck (雞同鴨講)&quot;.

Cantonese, a [[w:tonal language|tonal language]], is noted for its numerous tones (six categories of distinct pitch variations in Hong Kong Cantonese).  Like other Chinese languages it is not a [[w:Grammatical tense|tense language]] (does not distinguish past, present, and future verb forms), but rather an [[w:Grammatical aspect|aspectual language]].  An aspectual language marks verbs according to whether the action has been completed, progressive, been experienced, etc.  The benefit of Chinese languages for English learners is the relief of not having to study complicated verb conjugation charts.  There is also no concept of [[w:Grammatical_gender|feminine or masculine nouns]] that languages such as [[w:Romance_languages|Romance languages]] have.  On the other hand, the Chinese languages have become infamous among students because of the difficulty in mastering the [[w:Chinese character|Chinese characters]] in the [[w:Chinese written language|Chinese written language]].  Cantonese is even more unique in this aspect of the written language.  While Standard Written Chinese is widely used by its speakers, it is not representative of the spoken language.  Thus, over time a [[w:Written Cantonese|Written Cantonese]] language has developed that is vastly different from Standard Written Chinese.  Written Cantonese has yet to become an official written language but it is used by many speakers when chatting online, writing messages in bulletin boards, some Hong Kong newspapers, comic books, etc.  This website uses Written Cantonese throughout the lessons.

== Geography ==
Cantonese is the primary language of communication in [[w:Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[w:Macau|Macau]] in southeast [[W:China|China]].  It is also widely spoken in [[w:Guangdong|Guangdong]] province in mainland [[w:China|China]], [[w:Singapore|Singapore]], and in many [[w:Chinatown|Chinatowns]] across the world.  There are estimates of about 70 million Cantonese speakers worldwide.

== Culture ==
Cantonese has held a lot of prestige in the Chinese speaking world in the last few decades.  The economic development of Hong Kong brought about a large film and music industry (including [[w:Cantopop|Cantopop]]) that is popular throughout Chinese societies.  But even before the economic success of Hong Kong, Cantonese people have maintained a long history of unique cultural traditions different from other regions of China.  [[w:Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese cuisine]] is famous throughout China for its abundant seafood dishes and balanced flavors.  [[w:Dim sum|Dim sum]] (點心 dim2 sam1), a meal of tea and savory treats, has become world-renowned with hundreds of varieties and cooks are still developing new recipes everyday.  [[w:Cantonese opera|Cantonese opera]] and Cantonese literature also have a long and respected history in China.

I am a linguist-in-training and particularly passionate about Chinese linguistics.  I have been studying Mandarin for four years formally and Cantonese casually for around the same time.  I just got into the [[Cantonese]] wikibook today and am really excited to see where it can go.  Although I don't suppose I have time to be the main contributor, I hope that I can find some extra fun time to add this when possible.  Hope to meet other Cantonese students or speakers too who are interested in the project.   Cantonese is just begging for more accessible learning materials and references!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm trying out joy-of-cooking style for the ingredients part of the procedure. What do people think about it? It's a bit awkward visually, but I think it's more helpful as a printed out recipe. I'm not so sure about how the second half of the recipe is formatted. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 00:36, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

Giving the amounts a second time would make me nervously check them against each other. I've seen recipes that called for 2 cups of sugar, then used 1 cup in a batter and 1 cup as a topping. So if I see a second measurement, I'm going to get a bit paranoid. When a recipe gets too complicated for a simple numbered list (even with large steps), I split the list using headings. Rarely, I might use bulleted lists to break up steps that have multiple parallel tasks. For examples, see: [[Cookbook:Egg_Roll]], [[Cookbook:Turkey_Soup]], [[Cookbook:Molasses_Cookies]], [[Cookbook:Wonton_Soup]]. Oh, note that for some unknown reason it is standard for the Cookbook to skip 1st-level headers. Maybe this is bad, but we should reach general agreement on that before changing. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:55, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

::Looking at the html, it makes sense. Each top-level header is rendered with a h1 tag. Html specifies that there should be only one h1 tag, so using level two headers everywhere would be the appropriate structural thing to do. I'll take a look at those recipes. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:04, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

::I looked at those recipes; they work for the situation you describe with respect to the same ingredient being used in different sections of the recipe. What I am concerned with, however, is readability of the procedure when actually doing the recipe, which I feel is enhanced by a style like this. Still, I don't want to break the wikibooks de facto standard of listing ingredients separately without some consultation with the other contributors. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 03:51, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I should be clearer about the problem: The recipe requires 2 cups of sugar. I measure this out. Part way through the procedure, the recipe says to add 1 cup of sugar. I dump in the sugar that I've already measured. Whoops! To avoid this error, I must be extremely careful when using a recipe that specifies ingredients in two places. Also, what if the recipe disagrees with itself? This sort of thing happens as people adjust things. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:03, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
::::Oh, I totally understood that. I agree that listing ingredients in multiple places isn't desirable. I was just testing out a different style for the recipe as a whole. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:14, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
:::So I guess I don't care for the idea, but it isn't a big deal. I'd be less bothered if the numbers were only in one place. The fancier formatting looks like extra work too, without justification that I can see. I guess you might mention the ideas on the [[Talk:Cookbook|Cookbook talk page]] to see what others think. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:03, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
::::The main thing I was thinking about was if someone printed out the recipe and tried to use it as they are working in the kitchen. I'm not that bothered either way. Perhaps I'll mention it on the main talk page.  [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:14, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

This recipe calls for 1/2 c sugar in the list, but does not appear to use it in the recipe. It also calls for 1/2 t salt in the list, and uses salt twice in the recipe. My guess would be that sugar should replace salt in one of the instances, but I'm afraid I don't know enough about baking to say where. I do think it might be more appropriate to place this under &quot;vegeterian&quot; rather than &quot;vegan&quot;.

==Image==

Can we get an image for this article? [[User:Sugarpine|Sugarpine]] 03:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

: The next time I make it I'll take one. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:11, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

What about listing all the ingredients together, but, indicating when something gets split.

2 C Granulated Sugar, split
4 C Milk, Whole or 2%, split

It alerts the user that they will need to split or reserve part of this, however, for a shopping list, all the ingredients are listed together.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast]]

'''Hash browns''' or hashed browns are a simple potato preparation in which potato pieces are pan-fried after being shredded, julienned, diced, or riced. This recipe refers to the shredded version, which is the most common in many parts of the United States.

Hash brown are considered a breakfast food, and are often served with [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]].

==Ingredients==
* two [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], washed
* one half [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely chopped (Optional)
* plenty of cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] ([[Cookbook:Canola Oil|Canola]] is good &amp;mdash; see [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] information)
* two tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] OR one [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

==Procedure==
# Grate the raw potatoes with a [[Cookbook:Grater|cheese grater]], place them into a bowl and cover completely with water. Let sit for 10 minutes.
# Place a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] on medium-high heat and add enough oil to provide a thin coating over the entire bottom of the pan. 
# Drain the grated potatoes well; if this is not done thoroughly the potatoes will steam instead of fry.
# Mix in chopped onions by hand.
# Mix the one egg OR two tablespoons of flour into the hash brown mixture evenly. This will allow the hash browns to stay together when frying.
# When the oil has come up to temperature apply a large handful of potatoes to the pan and reshape into a patty that is about [[Cookbook:Inch|1/4 in]] ([[Cookbook:mm|6 mm]]) to 1/2 in (12 mm) thick. The thinner the patty the crispier the hash browns will be throughout. 
# The hash browns are ready to flip when they are crisp and brown on the cooking side. They should also stick together nicely before they are flipped. This should take about 5 to 8 minutes.
# The hash browns are done when the new side is brown and crispy. This should take another 3-5 minutes.

==Variation==
Try using [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]] instead of the onion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Learning the Zulu Language}}


This book is designed to allow anyone who speaks English to learn Zulu for free.  Zulu is one of the most spoken languages in South Africa.  More than 20 million people are able to speak Zulu in South Africa.  The current book allows someone to go from an absolute beginner to the so-called breakthrough stage - this is encompassed in the first six lessons - and beyond.  The book currently provides pronunciation information in Appendix B. It is recommended that students should read it over to gain a better understanding of the pronunciation.

Hello as the creator of the original page.  I have to say even my creation of the page is shaky and I am a third language speaker at a push.  Basically I'm hoping that someone who actually speaks the language will come along and create something better.

== Introductory Lessons Aim == 

The book is going to be written to satisfy first the requirements of the A1 level according to Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.  This is done since it is a reasonably accepted framework.  The requirements are presented below.

&quot;Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. Can introduce him/herself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where he/she lives, people he/she knows and things he/she has.Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help.&quot;

-Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, A1 --[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] ([[User talk:IKnowNothing|talk]]) 15:13, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

=== Basic Points===

* Everyday Expressions
* Introductions
* Questions about personal details
** He/she lives.
** People he/she knows
** Things he/she has.

=== Basic Points ===

* Shopping
* Local Geography
* Family information
* Basic personal information.

* Ask how long someone has been studying or working.
* Introduction of all the pronouns and subject concords.
* Formation of simple sentences with nouns of class 1/1a as the subject or pronouns.

'''Lesson 4'''
* Asking people if they know people or places.
* Introducing multiple people.

'''Lesson 5'''
* Asking people what is wrong/ what they are suffering from.
* Saying what one is suffering from.

== Exercises? ==

Good work! This book is already looking better than some common-language ones. However, exercises are sorely missing and without exercises people won't remember much of what is taught. I'd also really like to see recordings, as Zulu probably doesn't sound at all like English ;-)

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 18:53, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

: I know that exercises are required. I just didn't know how to do them appropriately. It feels like there are not enough resources for book writers to improve their wiki skills.  I've used the same approach for exercises as the Spanish wikibook, which looks like one of the better language books around.  Sound clips would be excellent but unfortunately I'm not a native speaker so my efforts at audio would undoubtedly be dismal.  Most importantly, I really would like to know if anyone visits this book because I cannot help feeling that I am writing this book for myself. Oh, I've written two exercises so far.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Lesson 1=
This introductory lesson provides a simple conversation with a table of all the vocabulary used. Then the ways to say your name or the names of others is provided.

==Hello==

UPhilani ubingelela umngani wakhe, uLindi.

:'''uPhilani''': Sawubona Nandi.
:'''uNandi''': Sawubona Philani.
:'''uPhilani''': Unjani?
:'''uNandi''': Ngikhona, wena unjani?
:'''uPhilani''': Nami ngikhona. Hamba kahle.
:'''uNandi''': Sala kahle.

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isiZulu
! isiNgisi
|-
| Sawubona
| Hello
|-
| Unjani?
| How are you?
|-
| Ngikhona
| I'm fine
|-
| Wena
| You
|-
| Nami
| Also (and me)
|-
| Sala
| Stay
|-
| Hamba
| Go
|-
| Kahle
| well
|}

The first exchange illustrates a fairly casual or familiar tone. It is both more formal and more polite to use the plural forms, eg:

:'''uJacob''': Sanibonani
:'''uNjabulo''': Yebo, sanibonani.
:'''uJacob''': Ninjani?
:'''uNjabulo''': Sikhona, nina ninjani?
:'''uJacob''': Nathi sikhona.

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isiZulu
! isiNgisi
|-
| Sanibonani
| Hello
|-
| Ninjani?
| How are you?
|-
| Sikhona
| We're fine
|-
| Nina
| You (plural)
|-
| Nathi
| Also (and us)
|}

It would normally be considered somewhat rude and abrupt to say goodbye just then. An exchange of pleasantries would normally follow such greetings, but in large cities, since people are often busy, this short conversation is sufficient.

A very polite way of saying farewell would be:

:'''uJacob''': Nihambe kahle.
:'''uNjabulo''': Nisale kahle.

=== Notes===
#Sanibona(ni) where the final ni may or may not be used

==Introducing people==

Philani introduces his friend Thabo to Nandi.

:'''uPhilani''': Nandi, Lo umgane wami, uThabo.
:'''uNandi''': Ngiyajabula ukukwazi!
:'''uThabo''': Nami, ngiyajabula ukukwazi!

Thabo introduces himself to Nosipho.

:'''uThabo''': Igama lami nguThabo!
:'''uNosipho''': Ngiyajabula ukukwazi! NginguNosipho.
:'''uThabo''': Ngiyajabula ukukwazi!

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isiZulu

| Igama
| Name
|-
| -mi
| my
|-
| Lo (Lona)

|-
| Nina
| You (plural)
|-
| Ngiyajabula ukukwazi
| I'm pleased to know you.
|-
| Umngani

| Friend
|-
| Ngingu-
| I'm
|} 

The above table says that ''-mi'' means ''my'' but ''la-'' that is added to it is for agreement.  ''Lami'' agrees with ''igama''.  The same is true for ''wami'': the ''wa-'' agrees with ''umngani
''.

==How are you?==

Philani sees his friend Thabo in the street.

==Grammar==
===Basic Sentences===
The sentence structure of Cantonese is very similar to that of English in that they both follow the pattern of [[w:Subject_Verb_Object|Subject-Verb-Object]] (SVO). Unlike many languages, verbs in Chinese aren't conjugated and noun and adjective endings don't change. They are never affected by things such as time or person. However, in the case of perfect tense, as an [[w:Grammatical aspect|aspectual language]], the word &quot;咗&quot; should be added after the verb to reflect the completion of the corresponding action. 

====S + V + O====
'''Example 1'''
:佢叫黃雪芳。
:''Kéuih giu Wòhng Suet Fōng.''
:She is called Suet Fong Wong.''

{{Warning|Note that in Cantonese you do not need the helping verb &quot;to be&quot; to use other verbs as in English.  While the sentence is translated as &quot;She '''is''' called Wong Suet Fong&quot;, it would be incorrect to say &quot;佢係叫黃雪芳&quot;. If you saying so, it would have the implication of confirmation.}}

====S + 係 + O====
係 ''haih'', the equational verb &quot;to be&quot;, can be translated in English as &quot;is&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, or &quot;are&quot;. The meaning is best summed up as &quot;equals&quot;.

'''Example 1'''
:我'''係'''黃雪芳。
:''Ngóh haih Wòhng Suet Fōng.''
:I '''am''' Suet Fong Wong. (I = Wong Suet Fong)

'''Example 2'''
:我嘅名'''係'''大偉。
:''Ngóh ge mèhng haih Daaih Wáih.''
:My name '''is''' David.'' (My name = David)

'''Example 3'''
:佢哋都'''係'''美國人。
:''Kéuihdeih dou haih Méihgwokyàhn''
:They '''are''' both Americans. (They = Americans)

====S + 唔係 + O====
係 (haih) is negated when preceded by 唔 ''m̀h''.

'''Example 1'''
:我唔係美國人。
:''Ngóh m̀h'haih Méihgwokyàhn.''
:I '''am not''' American.

'''Example 2'''
:佢唔係瑪麗。
:''Kéuih m̀h'haih Máh Leih.'' 
:She '''is not''' Mary.

===Basic Questions===
====V + 唔 + V / Yes-No====
Most statements can quickly become a yes-no question in Cantonese through the V + 唔 + V structure.  The simpliest way to answer such a question is either by repeating the verb (affirmative) or prefixing the verb with 唔 ''m̀h'' (negative).

'''Example 1'''
:佢係唔係你嘅朋友呀？
:''Kéuih haih-m̀h-haih néih ge pàhngyáuh a?''
:Is she/he your friend?

:係，佢係我嘅朋友。
:''Haih, kéuih haih ngóh ge pàhngyáuh.''
:Yes, She/he is my friend.

'''Example 2'''
:你哋係唔係美國人呀？
:''Néihdeih haih-m̀h-haih Méihgwokyàhn a?''
:Are you Americans?

:唔係，我哋係英國人。
:''M̀h'haih, ngóhdeih haih Yīnggwokyàhn.''
:No, we are British.

'''Example 3'''
:你識唔識瑪麗呀？
:''Néih sīk m̀h'sīk Máh Leih a?''
:Do you know Mary?

:識，我識瑪麗。
:''Sīk, ngóh sīk Máh Leih.''
:Yes, I know her.

{{Warning|Note that you must use the same verb in the question as in your answer.  It would be incorrect to respond to the question 你識唔識瑪麗呀？with 係.}}

====乜嘢 ''māt'yéh'' / What...?====
The question word  乜嘢 (māt'yéh), or simply 乜, make statements into questions without changing the order of the sentence. To make one, simply substitute 乜嘢 in the place the subject would be in the answer.  Notice how the word order does not change when you answer the question.

'''Example 1'''
:佢叫乜嘢名呀？
:''Kéuih giu māt'yéh mèhng a?''
:What is her name? (=She is called by what name?)

:佢叫瑪麗。
:''Kéuih giu Máh Leih.''
:She is called Mary

'''Example 2'''
:你識講乜話？
:''Néih sīk góng māt' wá?''
:What languages do you speak? (=You know speak which languages?)

:我識講廣東話。
:''Ngóh sīk góng Gwóngdōngwá.''
:I know Cantonese.

Note when spoken at a fast or natural pace, 乜嘢 is often pronounced mī'yéh.

===Particles===
Cantonese has a number of sentence final particles which expresses the speaker's tone and sometimes changes the sentence type.  The 呀 (a) is a particle which only affects the tone of the sentence.  It softens a question and is a required component of normal questions.  The 吖 (àh) indicates the speaker expects agreement with the statement.  Because the speaker expects a confirmation, this particle gives the sentence a questioning tone.  This is similar to English when we state a fact while using a rising intonation (e.g. &quot;You're going home?&quot;).

==Exercises==
===Pronunciation Drills===
====Initials====
Although most of the Cantonese initials are familiar sounds to English speakers, the ''ng'' initial in the pronoun 我 ''ngóh'' often frustrates beginners.  Actually the sound is also in E'''ng'''lish, but it simply never falls at the beginning of the word. Here's an exercise to help you produce this sound word-initially:

#Say the word &quot;sing&quot; slowly. Notice how the back of your tongue touches the back of your mouth at the end of the word.
#Say the word &quot;sing&quot; slowly again. But this time draw out the &quot;ng&quot; sound at the end of the word.  Try see how long you can hold this sound.
#When you say &quot;sing&quot; this time, hold the &quot;ng&quot; sound and add an &quot;o&quot;.  The word will sound like &quot;sing--o&quot; at first.  Practice this a few more times until the &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;o&quot; are produced together.
#Finally, say the word again but this time whisper the &quot;si&quot; sound.  Keep repeating the word until you can say it without the &quot;si&quot;.  With enough practice you see'll you are able to say 我 ''ngóh'' with little difficulty.

This is a good time to point out one of the sound changes that is undergoing in modern Hong Kong Cantonese.  The ''ng'' initial sound is being dropped in young people's casual speech.  If you listen closely, you may find your your Cantonese friends seem to say 我 ''óh'' when having informal conversations.  It appears that this sound change will likely become complete in the coming decades.  This will mean that the word initial ''ng'' will no longer exist in Cantonese.  However, it is still worth practicing this sound!  Dropping the ''ng'' is not yet considered standard speech by many people and has even been negatively labelled as &quot;lazy speech.&quot;

====Finals====
The syllables that end with one of the final stops ''p'', ''t'', or ''k'' are much shorter than the other syllables without stops.  In addition, it is important that the stop is &quot;unreleased.&quot;  This means there is no &quot;puff of air&quot; at the end of the syllable.  For instance, say the English word &quot;cup&quot; without opening your lips at the end.  Note how there is no puff of air.  Practice this with the following words:
:十 ''sahp'' ten
:國 ''gwok'' country
:識 ''sīk'' know
:乜 ''māt'' what

====Tones====
The list below shows all the tones in the traditional reading order (high to low).  Memorizing this list is an excellent way to improve your tone production and recognition.

:'''High Level:''' 詩 ''sī'' poetry
:'''High Rising:''' 史 ''sí'' history
:'''Mid Level:''' 試 ''si'' test
:'''Low Falling:''' 時 ''sìh'' time
:'''Low Rising:''' 市 ''síh'' city
:'''Low Level:''' 事 ''sih'' matter

The clipped tones are the are virtually the same as the high, mid, and low levels tones.  The only difference in these syllables is they are rather short in duration.
:'''High Clipped:''' 色 ''sīk'' color
:'''Mid Clipped:''' 錫 ''sik'' tin
:'''Low Clipped:''' 食 ''sihk'' eat

&lt;!-- MOVE TO LESSON 2 '''Rising Tones:''' The low rising tone should start in the low register of your normal voice and rise up to the middle register.  The high rising tone starts the middle (or low-middle) register and rises to the highest register of your normal voice.  These two tones are the hardest to distinguish so give yourself time and practice a lot.
:我 ''ngóh'' - 火 ''fóh'' fire
:你 ''néih'' - 幾 ''géi'' how many
:佢 ''kéuih'' - 嘴 ''jéui'' mouth --&gt;

===Grammar Drills===

===Conversation Practice===
#Introduce yourself to your language partner.  Make sure to say your name and your nationality.
#Ask your partner if they know one of your friends.
#Ask your partner their name and nationality. Let them know how happy you are to meet them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What do you mean by the protest orientation of sects?  Also, you may want to define sect

Need a section on religious conversion:

from Batson et. al.
p. 151 &quot;We have considered four possible facilitators of religious experience - psychedelic drugs, meditation, religious language, and music. We suggested that although none has the power to produce religious experience, each has the power to facilitate it. Moreover, we suggested that each works in its own unique way: Drugs affect both the self-surrender and new vision stages; meditation only the self-surrender stage; religious language the existential crisis, new vision, and new life stages; and various forms of music affect all four stages. Note that if these suggestions are correct, then to facilitate all four stages using drugs, meditation, and religious language, two or more techniques must be combined. To combine drugs with meditation would be largely redundant, and it would still leave two stages uncovered. So we would not expect such a combination to occur. But to combine either drugs or meditation with religious language would cover all four stages. Therefore, we would expect such combinations to occur and to prove effective. We would expect various forms of music, which affect emotional rather than cognitive processes, to be combined with any and all of the other facilitators.&quot;

==On Durkheim's Account of Religion==
Personally, I have a bit of a problem with the author's critique of Durkheim's explaination of Religion. Durkheim, in many ways, does stress that religion ''is'' society and/or any social gathering or state of shared conciousnes which is designated as sacred.

It is not what is thought of as the commonly &quot;religious&quot; event (i.e. God, a center of worship, etc) that makes it religious, it is the feeling of sacredness that surrounds the event, mentality or place. Therefore, saying that nationalism is not religion is wrong (as I understand it) by Durkheim - nationalism, if it is a sacred feeling that is expemplified in a gathering or a shared conciousness among many peoples of a territory, it may in fact be &quot;religious.&quot; Whether people consider it to be religious or not depends on their conception of religion, not Durkheim's. This is hardly a flaw in Durkheim's logic or reasonable grounds for a critique.

Durkheim at least implies that what we feel during these sacred events and gatherings is the force of society, and that is what makes it a '''sacred''' event. Bevcause we are no longer primitive peoples, by Durkheim's account, we no longer attribute every sacred event or feeling to that of a God. He attributes the many different settings in which a feeling of sacredness may come about to different social settings and implies that these many different feelings are the basis of polytheism (totemism). 

In sumation, for Durkheim religion ''is'' society. I think that point is greatly missed in this short account of his work on Religion. 
:That's a good point. I'll see if I can't give it a fairer treatment in the future.

I don't think the piece really captures Durkeim's contention, i.e., the sacred is the social. For Durkheim, engaging in religious activity reinforces the hierarchy of the colective over the individual. In class I illustrate the idea by reference to Norse mythology on the origins of scoial structure. I can't remember the particular part of the Edda (although it may be the Rigsthulla) but Heimdallr, one of the gods (going be the eke-name 'Rig' I think) manages to enviegle hs way into the beds of three generations of humanity. The offspring of these visits are the progenitors of the three social classes of norse society (thralls, karls and jarls). In retelling and and attending to the story individuals re-inscribed their relationship to an imutable social order a bit like singing the all things bright and beautiful hymn (the bit about the rich man in his castle and the poor man at his gate). The order is imutable because it has its origins in divine intervention. In short, the function of this instance of the sacred is to re-inforce the priority of a pre-existing social order over the aspirations of the individual, i.e. don't get above yourself.

==What about a discussion of civil religion?==
There is nothing in here about Bellah's concept of civil religion.

The double wheeler, also known as the biverticycle or two-wheeler unicycle is a vehicle with two wheels, where the wheels are stacked on top of each other. The top wheel is pedalled by direct drive.  This drives the bottom wheel, which moves in the opposite direction.

By the same principle, multi-wheel unicycles have been built, with wheels often stacked in parallel, some with as many as 16 wheels.</text>

== Simple Arithmetic ==

Most any programming language can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between [[Computer programming/Variables]] to put the results into new Variables.  Watch out for risk of '''Divide by Zero''', which can give serious indigestion to some programming languages.

== Date Math ==

Many programming languages can calculate the number of days weeks months between two dates, provided the dates are defined using consistent [[Computer programming/Types]].
 
== Higher Math ==

Some programming languages can compute values using mathematics beyond simple arithmetic, such as Square Roots, Sine, Cosine, Logarithms, Imaginary Numbers.

== See also ==

If you want to know more you should read the sister article [[Ada_Programming/Mathematical_calculations]] which is a lot more elaborate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
There are many romanization schemes for Cantonese.  One of the most difficult things for learners is to handle the multiple systems.  Unfortunately there has been no well-established standard like [[w:Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]].  Here's a brief listing of common schemes:
* [[w:Yale romanization|Yale]]: Used by many textbooks for second language learners of Cantonese.  It is easily recognized by the use of a silent &quot;h&quot; to represent syllables that have tones in the low register and the use of tone diacritics similar to [[w:Hanyu Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]].  This website uses a version that was modified by Matthews and Yip (1994).
* [[w:Sidney Lau|Sidney Lau]]: Another method based on the Yale system that has been used in textbooks but not as popular as Yale.
* [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]]: Promoted by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong to be the standard romanization scheme, and used predominantly in the linguistics literature.  One of the pluses of this scheme is that it only uses the letters of the English alphabet and numbers. Thus, it is easy to type.  But few non-linguists have adopted this system and it has some characteristics which makes it unintuitive to English speakers because of the difference between Cantonese and English.
* [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: Also known as the International Phonetic Alphabet.  This is a romanization system used by linguists and is designed to transcribe any language in the world.  Because it is a standard system, it can be useful to compare other romanization schemes to.  However, it does not make the ideal system for learners because it often requires memorizing more symbols than needed.
* [[w:Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanisation|Hong Kong Government]]: Not suitable for foreign language training because there is no one to one mapping of sounds and symbols, although this is affected by the perception of Cantonese phonemes by English speakers.  Nevertheless, this is the romanization you will see on street signs and place names in Hong Kong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Future Directions/Road Map for this module ==

I'm going to try and get to data packets sooner or later (probably sometime in early 2006), but I'm trying to come up with a consistant API... or more to the point a bunch of standardized serial communication routines/objects that I can use with these later discussions.  As this is a book, I want to build on the previous chapters for this particular module, which means I'm not going to be going into the gritty details of how you get a few characters out, but instead get into how data packets are formed and what their general purposes would be.

Some sample &quot;projects&quot; I'm going to add include: 

*Reading temperature measurements from a temperature probe connected via serial data link.
*Sample Stock Market data feeds in serial format.
*:::::or
*Sports Scores data feed
*Updating a &quot;time and temperature&quot; display for outdoor advertising

I also want to cover CRC issues in some depth, and attempt to explain error checking algorithms.  Most of this, however, will be in [[Serial Programming:Error Correction Methods]], which is ripe for an overhaul as well and not written to build from this module.

If you think this roadmap is going the wrong way, or if there are suggestions on how to teach the concepts of forming data packets, please make mention here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:16, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== Problem with a link on the page ==

Well, the link present on the page as [http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.cgi?SLIMP3ClientProtocol The SLIMP3 Client Protocol] is not functional. 

I temporarily replaced the link with another one that i found on that site which is present there now as [http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/SLIMP3ClientProtocol The SLIMP3 Client Protocol], you may check whether it is the same one or some other.

But as that site is still under contruction so maybe you should replace the link with some equivalent from some other site to avoid future problems (you see, they replace a CGI page with a PHP one, assuming i have provided the link to the same page)...

Great work anyways. Thank you (:

|Then saith Jesus unto them. All ye shall be&lt;br&gt;offended because of me this night: for it is&lt;br&gt;written, I will smite the shepherd, and the&lt;br&gt;sheep of the flock shall be scattered &lt;br&gt;abroad. Mt. 26: 31 (Mk. 14: 50)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|And the Lord said unlo me, Cast it unto the&lt;br&gt;potter: a goodly price that I was prised at&lt;br&gt;of them. And I took the thirty pieces of&lt;br&gt;silver, and cast them to the potter in the&lt;br&gt;house of the Lord. Zec. 11: 13&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Price of&lt;br&gt;betrayal cast&lt;br&gt;away on a&lt;br&gt;potter’s field&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And he cast down the pieces of silver&lt;br&gt;in the temple, and departed, and went and&lt;br&gt;hanged himself. And the chief priests took&lt;br&gt;the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful&lt;br&gt;for to put them into the treasury, because&lt;br&gt;it is the price of blood. And they took&lt;br&gt;counsel, and bought with them the potter’s&lt;br&gt;field, to bury strangers in. Mt. 27: 5-7
|-
|False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my&lt;br&gt;charge things that I knew not. Ps. 35: 11&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|False witnesses&lt;br&gt;at His trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|For many bare false witness against him,&lt;br&gt;but their witness agreed not together.&lt;br&gt;Mk. 14: 56
|-
|He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,&lt;br&gt;and as a sheep before her shearers is&lt;br&gt;dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.&lt;br&gt;Is. 53:7
|Silent before&lt;br&gt;His accusers as&lt;br&gt;a lamb to the&lt;br&gt;slaughter
|And he answered him to never a word;&lt;br&gt;insomuch that the governor marvelled&lt;br&gt;greatly. Mt. 27: l4 (Joh. 1: 29)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|But he was wounded for our&lt;br&gt;transgressions, he was bruised for our&lt;br&gt;iniquities: the chastisement of our peace&lt;br&gt;was upon him; and with his stripes we are&lt;br&gt;healed. Is. 53: 5
|Jesus' scourging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
|Then released he Barabbas unto them: and&lt;br&gt;when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered&lt;br&gt;him to be crucified. Mt. 27: 26&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|As many were astonied at thee; his visage&lt;br&gt;was so marred more than any man, and&lt;br&gt;his form more than the sons of men:&lt;br&gt;Is. 52: 14 
|His marred&lt;br&gt;visage (face)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Then Jesus came forward, wearing the crown&lt;br&gt;of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilatus&lt;br&gt;said to them, [&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Christianity/ECCEHOMO|&lt;small&gt;ECCEHOMO&lt;/small&gt;]]&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;] Behold the&lt;br&gt;man. Joh. 19: 5
|-
|And if a man have committed a sin worthy&lt;br&gt;of death, and he be to be put to death, and&lt;br&gt;thou hang him on a tree: His body shall not&lt;br&gt;remain all night upon the tree, but thou&lt;br&gt;shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he&lt;br&gt;that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy&lt;br&gt;land be not defiled, which the Lord thy&lt;br&gt;God giveth thee for an inheritance.&lt;br&gt;De. 21: 22-23
|The Saviour's&lt;br&gt;crucifixion&lt;br&gt;according to the&lt;br&gt;law of the land&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And he said unto them the third time, Why,&lt;br&gt;what evil hath he done? I have found no&lt;br&gt;cause of death in him: I will therefore&lt;br&gt;chastise him, and let him go. And they&lt;br&gt;were instant with loud voices, requiring&lt;br&gt;that he might be crucified. And the voices&lt;br&gt;of them and of the chief priests prevailed. &lt;br&gt;And Pilate gave sentence that it should be&lt;br&gt;as they required. Lu. 23: 22-24
|-
|I gave my back to the smiters, and my&lt;br&gt;cheeks to them that plucked off the hair:&lt;br&gt;I hid not my face from shame and spitting.&lt;br&gt;Is. 50: 6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Spat upon in&lt;br&gt;humiliation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And they smote him on the head with a&lt;br&gt;reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing&lt;br&gt;their knees worshipped him. And when&lt;br&gt;they had mocked him, they took off the&lt;br&gt;purple from him, and put his own clothes&lt;br&gt;on him, and led him out to crucify him.&lt;br&gt;Mk. 15: 19-20
|-
|For dogs have compassed me: the&lt;br&gt;assembly of the wicked have inclosed me:&lt;br&gt;they pierced my hands and my feet.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 22: 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|He is nailed to&lt;br&gt;the cross&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|The other disciples therefore said unto him,&lt;br&gt;We have seen the Lord. But he said unto&lt;br&gt;them, Except I shall see in his hands the&lt;br&gt;print of the nails, and put my finger into the&lt;br&gt;print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his&lt;br&gt;side, I will not believe.&lt;br&gt;Joh. 20: 25 (Re. 1: 7)
|-
|Therefore will I divide him a portion with the&lt;br&gt;great, and he shall divide the spoil with the&lt;br&gt;strong; because he hath poured out his&lt;br&gt;soul unto death: And he was numbered&lt;br&gt;with the transgressors; and he bare the sin&lt;br&gt;of many, and made intercession for the&lt;br&gt;transgressors. Is. 53:12
|Numbered with&lt;br&gt;transgressors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And when they were come to the place,&lt;br&gt;which is called Calvary, there they&lt;br&gt;crucified him, and the malefactors, one&lt;br&gt;on the right hand, and the other on the left.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 23: 33&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
|-
|They part my garments among them, and&lt;br&gt;cast lots upon my vesture. Ps. 22: 18&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|The parting of&lt;br&gt;His garments by&lt;br&gt;castings lots&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for&lt;br&gt;they know not what they do. And they&lt;br&gt;parted his raiment, and cast lots.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 23: 34
|-
|I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried:&lt;br&gt;mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 69: 3
|He becomes&lt;br&gt;thirsty&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|After this, Jesus knowing that all things&lt;br&gt;were now accomplished, that the scripture&lt;br&gt;might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Joh. 19: 28
|-
|They gave me also gall for my meat; and&lt;br&gt;in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 69: 21
|Given bitter&lt;br&gt;drink&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|They gave him vinegar to drink mingled&lt;br&gt;with gall: and when he had tasted thereof,&lt;br&gt;he would not drink. Mt. 27: 34
|-
|I became also a reproach unto them: when&lt;br&gt;they looked upon me they shaked their&lt;br&gt;heads. Ps. 109: 25
|He is mocked&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And they that passed by reviled him,&lt;br&gt;wagging their heads. Mt. 27:39&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|All they that see me laugh me to scorn:&lt;br&gt;they shoot out the lip, they shake the head,&lt;br&gt;saying, He trusted on the Lord that he&lt;br&gt;would deliver him: let him deliver him,&lt;br&gt;seeing he delighted in him. Ps. 22:7, 8
|Railing and&lt;br&gt;taunting toward&lt;br&gt;Christ&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And one of the malefactors which were&lt;br&gt;hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be&lt;br&gt;Christ, save thyself and us. Lu. 23: 39&lt;br&gt; (Mt. 27:43)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|And he bare the sin of many, and made&lt;br&gt;intercession for the transgressors.&lt;br&gt;Is. 53:12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|His intercession&lt;br&gt;for a fellow&lt;br&gt;sufferer in&lt;br&gt;need&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|But the other answering rebuked him,&lt;br&gt;saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing&lt;br&gt;thou art in the same condemnation? And&lt;br&gt;we indeed justly; for we receive the due&lt;br&gt;reward of our deeds: but this man hath&lt;br&gt;done nothing amiss. And he said unto&lt;br&gt;Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou&lt;br&gt;comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said&lt;br&gt;unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day&lt;br&gt;shalt thou be with me in paradise.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 23: 42-43
|-
|And it shall come to pass in that day. saith&lt;br&gt;the Lord God, that I will cause the sun to go&lt;br&gt;down at noon, and I will darken the earth in&lt;br&gt;the clear day. Am. 8: 9

|An intense&lt;br&gt;lonely cry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with&lt;br&gt;a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli lama&lt;br&gt;sabachthani? that is to say, My God,&lt;br&gt;my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&lt;br&gt;Mt. 27: 46
|-

|-
|And afler threescore and two weeks shall&lt;br&gt;Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.&lt;br&gt;Da. 9: 26&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Messiah is cut&lt;br&gt;off (slain)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that&lt;br&gt;one man should die for the people, and that&lt;br&gt;the whole nation perish not. Joh. 11:50&lt;br&gt; (Joh. 11:51-52)
|-
|He keepeth all his bones: not one of them&lt;br&gt;is broken. Ps. 34: 20&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|Not a bone&lt;br&gt;broken&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|But when they came to Jesus, and saw that&lt;br&gt;he was dead already, they brake not his&lt;br&gt;legs: Joh. 19: 33
|-
|And they shall look upon me whom they&lt;br&gt;have pierced, and they shall&lt;br&gt;mourn for him. Zec. 12: 10
|His side&lt;br&gt;pierced&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|But one of the soldiers with a spear&lt;br&gt;pierced his side, and forthwith came&lt;br&gt;there out blood and water. Joh. 19: 34

|The place of&lt;br&gt;burial&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|When the even was come, there came a&lt;br&gt;rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph,&lt;br&gt;who aIso himself was Jesus' disciple: He&lt;br&gt;went to Pilate, and begged the body of&lt;br&gt;Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body&lt;br&gt;to be delivered. Mt. 27: 57-58
|-
|For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;&lt;br&gt;neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to&lt;br&gt;see corruption. Thou wilt show me the&lt;br&gt;path of life: in thy presence is fulness of&lt;br&gt;joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures&lt;br&gt;for evermore.&lt;br&gt;Ps. 16: 10-11&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|His resurrection
|And he said unto them, These are the&lt;br&gt;words which I spake unto you, that all&lt;br&gt;things must be fulfilled, which were written&lt;br&gt;in the law of Moses, and in the prophets,&lt;br&gt;and in the psalms, concerning me. Then&lt;br&gt;opened he their understanding, that they&lt;br&gt;might understand the scriptures, And&lt;br&gt;said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus&lt;br&gt;it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise&lt;br&gt;from the dead the third day: And that&lt;br&gt;repentance and remission of sins should&lt;br&gt;be preached in his name among all&lt;br&gt;nations, beginning at Jerusalem, And&lt;br&gt;ye are witnesses of these things.&lt;br&gt;Lu. 24: 44-48 (Ac. 2: 22-28)

|The ascension&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|And it came to pass, while he blessed&lt;br&gt;them, he was parted from them, and&lt;br&gt;carried up into heaven. Lu. 24: 51&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
|The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at&lt;br&gt;my right hand, until I make thine enemies&lt;br&gt;thy footstool.  Ps. 110: 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|To sit at the&lt;br&gt;Right Hand of&lt;br&gt;God, the Father&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|So then after the Lord had spoken unto&lt;br&gt;them, he was received up into heaven, and&lt;br&gt;sat on the right hand of God. Mk. 16: 19&lt;br&gt; (Re. 3: 21)

|All we like sheep have gone astray; we&lt;br&gt;have turned every one to his own way; and&lt;br&gt;the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of&lt;br&gt;us all. Is. 53: 6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

While you were as&lt;br&gt;sheep gone astray; you are now returned&lt;br&gt;to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.&lt;br&gt;I Pe. 2: 22-25 (1 Co. 15: 3)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Moral reasoning is a thinking process with the objective of determining whether an idea is right or wrong.

To know whether something is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; one must first know what that something is intended to accomplish.
Thus, to know if &quot;this direction&quot; is the right direction to follow to get to a coffee shop, one must first know where one is, where the coffee shop is, and the terrain between here and there (to avoid blocks, etc).

Or, to know if this action is the right action to take, one must know what one wants to accomplish, where one is, and the environment between here and the accomplished state (for example, to impress my boss, I have to know what is likely to impress him/her, what I, myself, can do at the work-place or where he/she would observe, etc).

Thus, to know if something (an idea, an action, a behavior) is &quot;right&quot; one has to know both what one intends to accomplish and the environment that exists between &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there.

But that alone is not enough! To go to a bank and threaten the cashier might well accomplish your aim because you know security is weak and the prospect of capture is low. There is a third consideration: is it good for the people who live around me, and supply the things my stolen cash will buy. Here we have a further dilemma: a quick injection of stolen cash may well help my closest suppliers, but where should we draw the boundary? The neighbourhood? The city? Our Nation? or The whole world? Only this last reason: Good for all humanity, yields &quot;moral reasoning&quot;

Satisfactory solutions to problems are determined by using this principle. Problems or behaviors are difficult to solve when either the environment or the desired accomplishment are incompletely understood from a global perspective. (Religions face this difficulty.)

Therefore, moral reasoning can not be correctly performed until what is sought and the surrounding world-wide environment is fully understood. An example: is it &quot;right&quot; to use fetal stem cells? Only by first deciding &quot;what&quot; the use is intended to accomplish and if the way of accomplishing this is understood could such a question be answered. This is discussed in Thinking And Moral Problems [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Thinking_And_Moral_Problems]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Our actions stem from our thoughts, and such actions influence the lives of others. Unfortunately, we are not born with a &quot;code of conduct&quot;. Rather we absorb our morality from our parents, schools religions, societies and, sometimes we also have to adopt the codes of professions. But such impositions only provide general directions, they do not solve specific questions as to how we should live our lives or how should treat other people:
* One approach  is to seek the knowledge of leaders whose wisdom is respected and simply follow the herd. 
* Alternatively, one could d take such wisdom as one finds and then engage is moral reasoning to determine whether ones actions are right or wrong.

Even in making the choice to seek the knowledge of respected leaders, or to choose a life-philosophy or religion, one is making a decision regarding right action - e.g. &quot;Is this leader, philosophy or religion the correct one to guide my life-stile and inform my choices?&quot;  Even the decision to hand one's decision-making power over to another requires that one be capable of making a decision - hopefully the right one.

Most of us have no choice in our religious, social or moral formation - it is imposed by parents, teachers and politicians. Only later in life do we have the  ability to choose to follow a particular religious calling or to rethink our early indoctrination in the light of some seemingly more relevant philosophy.is as  in  any other similar choice, one can benefit from the application of moral reasoning.

In strongly religious societies the ability to break with convention and make an informed  choice is not available without punishment for [[w:religious offense]]s.   

In secular and democratic societies, with less rigid rules, it is often necessary to  to make a good choice, has powerful consequences thereafter. Our lives, and our effect on others, are governed by the decisions we make, and the consequences of our decisions are likely to be governed by the quality of the decisions we make. The ability to make good decisions - however we may end up defining &quot;good&quot; will impact our lives, how we treat others, how we are treated in return. The ability to have a good framework for making our own decisions will allow us to make better decisions than a person who does not so educate or increase themselves.

While we will often find ourselves lacking good information, and sometimes lacking in the ability to perceive pertinent facts (our ancestors did not know of the existence of microbes), the ability to formulate good decisions with whatever information is available can enable us not to merely muddle through, but to intelligently choose the most effective roads. In an uncertain, complex, and always-changing world, we cannot always count on good data or rely on being able to fall back on past experience and precedent, so it is ever-more important to have the ability to make &quot;good&quot; decisions with what we have, and that requires the ability to choose or recognize what we know to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;right&quot;. Moral Reasoning serves this purpose.

{{Java Programming/LanguageFundamentalsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Boolean values are values that evaluate to either {{java:true}} or {{java:false}}, and are represented by the {{java:boolean}} data type.  Boolean expressions are very similar to mathematical expressions, but instead of using mathematical operators such as &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;, you use comparative or boolean operators such as &quot;==&quot; or &quot;!&quot;.

== Comparative operators ==

Java has several operators that can be used to compare variables.  For example, how would you tell if one variable has a greater value than another?  The answer: use the &quot;greater-than&quot; operator.

Here is a list of the comparative operators in Java:

* &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; : Greater than
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; : Less than
* &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; : Greater than or equal to
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; : Less than or equal to
* &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; : Equal to
* &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; : Not equal to

To see how these operators are used, look at this example:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-37&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.37: Comparisons.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a = 5, b = 3;
System.out.println(a &gt; b); // Value is true because a is greater than b
System.out.println(a == b); // Value is false because a does not equal b
System.out.println(a != b); // Value is true because a does not equal b
System.out.println(b &lt;= a); // Value is true because b is less than a
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for code section 3.37'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
true
false
true
true
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Comparative operators can be used on any primitive types (except &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;), but only the &quot;equals&quot; and &quot;does not equal&quot; operators work on objects.  This is because the less-than/greater-than operators cannot be applied to objects, but the equivalency operators can.

{{XNote|1=Specifically, the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; operators test whether both variables point to the same object.  Objects will be covered later in the tutorial, in the &quot;[[Java Programming/Classes,_Objects_and_Types|Classes, Objects, and Types]]&quot; module.}}

== Boolean operators ==

The Java boolean operators are based on the operations of the [[Wikipedia:Boolean algebra|boolean algebra]]. The boolean operators operate directly on boolean values.

Here is a list of four common boolean operators in Java:

* &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; : Boolean NOT
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; : Boolean AND
* &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; : Boolean inclusive OR
* &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; : Boolean exclusive XOR

The boolean NOT operator (&quot;!&quot;) inverts the value of a boolean expression.  The boolean AND operator (&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;) will result in true if and only if the values on both sides of the operator are true.  The boolean inclusive OR operator (&quot;||&quot;) will result in true if either or both of the values on the sides of the operator is true.  The boolean exclusive XOR operator (&quot;^&quot;) will result in true if one and only of the values on the sides of the operator is true.

To show how these operators are used, here is an example:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-38&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.38: Operands.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
boolean iMTrue = true;
boolean iMTrueToo = true;
boolean iMFalse = false;
boolean iMFalseToo = false;

System.out.println(&quot;NOT operand:&quot;);
System.out.println(!iMTrue);
System.out.println(!iMFalse);
System.out.println(!(4 &lt; 5));
System.out.println(&quot;AND operand:&quot;);
System.out.println(iMTrue &amp;&amp; iMTrueToo);
System.out.println(iMFalse &amp;&amp; iMFalseToo);
System.out.println(iMTrue &amp;&amp; iMFalse);
System.out.println(iMTrue &amp;&amp; !iMFalse);
System.out.println(&quot;OR operand:&quot;);
System.out.println(iMTrue || iMTrueToo);
System.out.println(iMFalse || iMFalseToo);
System.out.println(iMTrue || iMFalse);
System.out.println(iMFalse || !iMTrue);
System.out.println(&quot;XOR operand:&quot;);
System.out.println(iMTrue ^ iMTrueToo);
System.out.println(iMFalse ^ iMFalseToo);
System.out.println(iMTrue ^ iMFalse);
System.out.println(iMFalse ^ !iMTrue);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for code section 3.38'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
NOT operand:
false
true
false
AND operand:
true
false
false
true
OR operand:
true
false
true
false
XOR operand:
false
false
true
false
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Here are the truth tables for the boolean operators:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!a !! &lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;a
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
|}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!a !! b !! a &amp;&amp; b !! a &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt; b !! a &lt;nowiki&gt;^&lt;/nowiki&gt; b
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
|}

:''For help on simplifying complex logic, see [[Wikipedia:De Morgan's laws|De Morgan's laws]].''

In Java, boolean logic has a useful property called ''short circuiting''.  This means that expressions will only be evaluated as far as necessary.  In the expression &lt;code&gt;(a &amp;&amp; b)&lt;/code&gt;, if a is false, then b will not be evaluated because the expression will be false no matter what. Here is an example that shows that the second expression is not automatically checked:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-39&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.39: Short circuiting.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
System.out.println((4 &lt; 5) || ((10 / 0) == 2));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for code section 3.39'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
true
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

To disable this property, you can use &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; but it's not recommended.

:''For the bitwise operations on &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, see [[Java Programming/Basic arithmetic#Using bitwise operators within Java|Arithmetic expressions]].''

== Re: User:Ivyboy ==

Possible? Yes.  Likely? You're right- probably not.  Still, there's little harm in trying to bend him into shape rather than blocking him right away.  That's why I'm going to keep an eye on him for any more 'funny business' so I can block him right away if I see that he's not willing to cooperate and learn. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 12:37, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

:Ivyboy continued his disruptive behavior, as you predicted.  I've blocked him for 24 hours, but it'll probably deserve a one week block if he does it again.  Oh well, it was worth a try :). -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 16:18, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

::I noticed that he said he was going to &quot;update this on wikipedia,&quot; so I've registered the wikipedia account &quot;Ivyboy.&quot; I don't plan to use it- I just wanted to make sure he didn't get it.  Please [[Special:Emailuser/Frazzydee|email me]] for the password, if you want it. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 16:29, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

:::No problem :) I've protected your user page only against moves; that should probably be sufficient.  Most people are okay with it, especially if it's just against moves (there's no reason for anybody to move a user page).  Mind you, some people might complain if you fully protect it- that's usually only done if a page gets a lot of vandalism. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 23:06, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

::::He did the same thing on my wikipedia talk page...thanks for reverting.  You should be proud to have your own personal imposter :D.  I did a whois on the IP, and it looks like the abuse email is &quot;Bamam.Forum@mail.biu.ac.il&quot;.  I think that a lot of the edits coming from the IP look alright, so I don't think that we need to take such drastic action yet.  I personally don't mind people vandalizing my talk page so much that I would even block them, but other editors are usually very different about it; therefore, I'll block if ivyboy vandalizes somebody else's talk page, user page, or articles, but I don't plan to block if they're just vandalizing my talk page.  Thanks for your message :) -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 02:22, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

:::::Actually there seems to be no evidence that blocking that one IP address will lead to the entire university being blocked.  Unless I'm reading this wrong, the university owns all IP addresses from 132.70.0.0 - 132.70.255.255.  They probably have one IP for each computer or building, etc.
:::::They could have one IP shared between all of them, but that's probably unlikely.  I tried unblocking the auto-block anyways, and I ''think'' that it worked, but I'm not certain. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 23:58, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

::::::I guess that's possible, and it sounds like it from User142's comments.  But that seems really weird to me...why would they have so many IPs but only use one? I read his comment again, and it looks like maybe that IP is used for the computers in one, publically-acessible room.  I'm not sure.  I tried unblocking the autoblock on Wikipedia, and it doesn't seem to have come back.  If not, then maybe we can try just blocking the username and not the IP. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 01:10, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

&lt;nowiki&gt;****I agree that the clicking to go forwards and backwards is important. This is one of the reasons that I put in Stubs for Pokemon who didn't have pages, and added the tables to articles that didn't have them.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Bulbaboy. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Bulbaboy~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

A Pie-Chart/Diagram is a graphical device - a circular shape broken into sub-divisions. The sub-divisions are called &quot;''sectors''&quot;, whose areas are proportional to the various parts into which the whole quantity is divided. The sectors may be coloured differently to show the relationship of parts to the whole. A pie diagram is an alternative of the sub-divided bar diagram.

To construct a pie-chart, first we draw a circle of any suitable radius then the whole quantity which is to be divided is equated to 360 degrees. The different parts of the circle in terms of angles are calculated by the following formula.
 
     Component Value / Whole Quantity * 360

The component parts i.e. sectors have been cut beginning from top in clockwise order.

Note that the percentages in a list may not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.  For example if a person spends a third of their time on each of three activities: 33%, 33% and 33% sums to 99%.

'''Warning:''' Pie charts are a poor way of communicating information. The eye is good at judging linear measures and bad at judging relative areas.  A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable way of displaying this type of data. 

Cleveland (1985), page 264: &quot;Data that can be shown by pie charts always can be shown by a dot chart.  This means that judgements of position along a common scale can be made instead of the less accurate angle judgments.&quot; This statement is based on the empirical investigations of Cleveland and McGill as well as investigations by perceptual psychologists. 

Three-dimensional (3d) pie charts compound perceptual misinterpretation of statistical information by altering the relative angle of pie slices to create the impression of depth into a [[w:Vanishing_point|vanishing point]]. Angles and areas at the bottom of the chart must be exaggerated and the angles and areas at the top of the chart reduced in order to create the dimensional effect; a specifically false depiction of the data.

==Does a File or Directory exist ?==


Example:

 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
   IF Exist(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;) = TRUE THEN
        Label1.Text=&quot;OK i found Bash&quot;
   END IF
   IF Exist(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;) = FALSE THEN
        Label1.Text=&quot;Error Bash is missing&quot;
   END IF
END
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Get system's root / home folder ?==

Example :

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
'Created : Cijo Jose
'E-mail  : info.cijo@gmail.com
'Job ID  : Junior Software Engineer

PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()

       dir_name as string 
       dir_name = system.root    ' Will return root folder 
       print dir_name
       dir_name = system.home    ' Will return home folder 
       print dir_name

END
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;



When you click on your button your gambas program checks for Bash
if Bash is found then Label1 displays &quot;OK i found Bash&quot; if Bash is not found 
then Label1 displays &quot;Error Bash is missing&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cardinal Numbers ==

=== General Rules ===
In Cantonese, numbers can be interpreted as a series of digits. From tens to ten-thousands, each digit has a corresponding character. To read out the number, read the number of the value of the digit followed by the value of the digit. For example, the number ''four-hundred and seventy-nine'' (479) has three digits: ''four hundreds'' (四百, read as sei-bāak), ''seven tens'' (七十, read as chāt-sahp) and ''nine'' (九, read as gáu). The number is written as 四百七十九 and is read as sei-bāak-chāt-sahp-gáu. The word &quot;''and''&quot; in &quot;''four-hundred and seventy-nine''&quot; is omitted.

Any digit in zero followed by a digit which is not zero is replaced by the character 零 (read as lìhng). For example, the number ''one-thousand and one'' (1001) is read as yāt-cin-lìhng-yāt.

The number ''eleven'' (11) is literally ''one-ten'' and ''one'' but the character &quot;''one''&quot; in &quot;''one ten''&quot; is usually omitted. The same case applies to twelve to nineteen.

The number ''two'' sometimes becomes 兩 (read as loeng) rather than 二 (read as yih). Examples include: 
*兩性  loeng-sing ''the two sexes''&lt;br&gt;
*兩文三語 loeng-man-sāam-jyu ''two written languages and three spoken languages''&lt;br&gt;
*一國兩制 yāt-gwok-loeng-zai ''one country two systems''&lt;br&gt;

Generally, ''two'' is 兩 when:
* it is used for counting (e.g. two apples, two people, two houses)
* it precedes units more than or equal to a thousand

''two'' is 二 in:
* certain set expressions (such as idioms)
* numbers less than or equal to a thousand

=== One through Ten===
{{audio|Zero_to_ten_in_Cantonese_Chinese.ogg|Listen to audio}}
*〇 (零) lìhng ''zero'' 0
*一 (壹) yāt ''one'' 1
*二 (貳) yih ''two'' 2
*三 (叁) sāam ''three'' 3
*四 (肆) sei ''four'' 4
*五 (伍) ng ''five'' 5
*六 (陸) luhk ''six'' 6
*七 (柒) chāt ''seven'' 7
*八 (捌) baat ''eight'' 8
*九 (玖) gáu ''nine'' 9
*十 (拾) sahp ''ten'' 10

Parenthesized entries are the complex forms, which are used mainly in notarized, official documents. An exception is zero wherein the complex form is more widely used.

=== Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Etc. ===

*十一 sahp-yāt ''eleven'' 11&lt;br&gt;
*十二 sahp-yih ''twelve'' 12&lt;br&gt;
*十三 sahp-sāam ''thirteen'' 13&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*二十一 yih-sahp-yāt ''twenty-one'' 21&lt;br&gt;
*二十二 yih-sahp-yih ''twenty-two'' 22&lt;br&gt;
*二十三 yih-sahp-sāam ''twenty-three'' 23&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*一百 yāt-bāak ''one-hundred'' 100&lt;br&gt;
*一百零八 yāt-bāak-lìhng-baat ''one-hundred and eight'' 108&lt;br&gt;
*一百六十六 yāt-bāak-luhk-sahp-luhk ''one-hundred and sixty-six'' 166&lt;br&gt;
*二百三十 yih-bāak-sāam-sahp ''two-hundred and thirty''&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*一千 yāt-cin ''one-thousand'' 1,000&lt;br&gt;
*七千二百一十三 chāt-cin-yih-bāak-yāt-sahp-sāam ''seven thousand two hundred and thirteen'' 7,213&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*一萬 yāt-maan ''one myriad'' or ''ten-thousand'' 10,000&lt;br&gt;
*四萬三千 sei-maan-sāam-cin ''forty-three thousand'' 43,000&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;


*十萬 sahp-maan ''one-hundred thousand'' 100,000&lt;br&gt;
*九十六萬八千二百七十四 gáu-sahp-luhk-maan-baat-cin-yih-bāak-chāt-sahp-sei ''nine hundred and sixty-eight thousand two hundred and seventy-four'' 968,274&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

*一百萬 yāt-bāak-maan ''one million'' 1,000,000&lt;br&gt;
*六百七十八萬二千 luhk-bāak-chāt-sahp-baat-maan-yih-cin ''six-million seven-hundred and eighty-two thousand'' 6,782,000&lt;br&gt;
等等 etc.&lt;br&gt;

== Ordinal Numbers ==
To show the position of something in a list of items, simply add the word 第 (read as dai) before the number.

*第一 dai-yāt ''the first''&lt;br&gt;
*第十一 dai-sahp-yāt ''the eleventh''&lt;br&gt;
*第四百八十九 dai-sei-bāak-baat-sahp-gáu ''the 489th''&lt;br&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Ductal Carcinoma in Situ'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Clinical Presentation==
*Ductal carcinoma in situ - by default not metastatic; up to 5% axillary LN+ probably due to undiagnosed invasive focus
*Risk factors same as invasive BCA: FH, reproductive events, EtOH consumption


==Mammography==
*Presenting abnormalities (Tabar, 1999):
**microcalcifications 76%
**asymmetric densities 10%
*Size underestimated by 1-2cm compared to pathology


==Pathology==
*16-24 duct-lobular systems, culminating in collecting duct at the nipple; multiple lateral ductal anastomoses
*Histologically very diverse, no easy way to grade, but typically [http://surgpathcriteria.stanford.edu/breast/dcis/ 3 groups]

===Upstaging to Invasive Disease===
*'''Harvard; 2008''' PMID 17891441 -- &quot;Sentinel node biopsy is important in mastectomy for ductal carcinoma in situ.&quot; (Dominguez FJ, Ann Surg Oncol. 2008 Jan;15(1):268-73. Epub 2007 Sep 22.)
**Retrospective. 179 patients, mastectomy with SLB for DCIS on intial biopsy. 
**Outcome: Size of DCIS were not recorded uniformly. Unsuspected invasive cancer in 11%; of these, 20% had SLN+. However, overall SLN+ in 11% (micromets 1%, ITCs 10%), suggesting 10% SLN+ (94% ITCs) in patients with DCIS only. completion ALND in 3 patients, SLNB was the only positive node in all of them
**Conclusion: 11% of DCIS patients had invasive disease; use of SLND allowed them to avoid axillary dissection

==Natural history==
*Considered rare until 1980's, prior to advent of population-wide mammographic screening
*Autopsy series show rates &lt;1% - 13%
*Cumulative lifetime risk: ~0.5%
*Prevalence on screening mammograms: ~20%


'''''Progression of DCIS into invasive cancer:'''''
*Cumulative progression rate after biopsy in 7 studies: 36%. Most occur within 10 years, but some &gt;15 years
*Development of invasive CA (10-year rates): after BCS only ~15%, after BCS+RT ~8%
*'''Nurses' Health Study''', 2005 - PMID 15770688 &amp;mdash; &quot;Outcome of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ untreated after diagnostic biopsy: results from the Nurses' Health Study.&quot; Collins LC et al. Cancer. 2005 May 1;103(9):1778-84. 
**13 pts with DCIS later identified in breast biopsy originally thought benign.  6 pts developed invasive cancer (OR 13.5) and 10 pts developed either an invasive or in-situ lesion (OR was 20.1).

==Mastectomy==
*Locoregional failure rate 4% or less, cancer specific mortality &lt;4%
*No randomized study comparing mastectomy with BCT

===Surgical Margin===
*'''Harvard; 2012''' (1998-2005) -- &quot;Impact of Margin Status on Local Recurrence After Mastectomy for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ.&quot; (Childs SK, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Sep 10.)
**Retrospective. 142 pts underwent mastectomy without RT for pure DCIS (without microinvasion). 
***positive margin: 21 (15%). close margin (&lt;= 2 mm): 23 (16%). Deep margin (close 14, positive 6). Superficial margin (close 13, positive 19). 
**Median f/u 7.6 yr. 
**Chest wall recurrence 2/142 (1.4%) -- 1/21 (4.8%) for positive margins, 1/23 (4.3%) for close margins, 0/98 for negative margins.
**Conclusion: &quot;Mastectomy for pure DCIS resulted in a low rate of local or distant recurrences. Even with positive or close mastectomy margins, the rates of chest wall recurrences were so low that PMRT is likely not warranted.&quot;

*'''UC San Francisco; 2010''' (1985-2005) PMID 20646871 -- &quot;Is Radiation Indicated in Patients With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ and Close or Positive Mastectomy Margins?&quot; (Chan LW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Jun 18. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 193 patients underwent mastectomy. DCIS median size 4.5 cm. Surgical margin: 55 close SM, 4 SM+. Median F/U 8 years
**Outcome: Chest wall recurrence 1/59 close/positive SM (patient had 4 cm, G3 DCIS, SM 5 mm, skin-sparing mastectomy). 
**Conclusion: Risk of chest wall recurrence low for patients with margin &lt;5 mm; not enough cases with positive margin

*'''Southern California Permanente; 2008''' (1994-2002) PMID 18954711 -- &quot;Close or positive margins after mastectomy for DCIS: pattern of relapse and potential indications for radiotherapy.&quot; (Rashtian A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Nov 15;72(4):1016-20.)
**Retrospective. 80 patients, DCIS treated with mastectomy without RT, with margins &lt;10 mm. SM &amp;le;2 in 39%, SM 2.1-10 61%. Median F/U 5 years
**Outcome: Local recurrence 7%; if SM &amp;le; 2 mm 16% vs SM &gt;2 mm 2% (SS). Of the 6 patients with LR, 5 had G3 DCIS and/or comedonecrosis. All were &lt;60 years
**Conclusion: Greater than expected local recurrence in patients with &lt;2 mm margin, particularly if they have high grade disease or comedonecrosis

*'''Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle; 2007''' (1990-2006) &lt;u&gt;ASTRO Abstract&lt;/u&gt; -- &quot;The Role of Adjuvant Radiotherapy After Mastectomy in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, Breast&quot; (Eulau SM, Abstract 2043, 2007)
**Retrospective. 16 patients, mastectomy for DCIS, adjuvant RT. Average DCIS size 6.8 cm, positive or &amp;le; 1mm SM 7 patients, 1 mm SM 7 patients, &amp;ge; 2 mm 2 patients (lesion size 10 and 15 cm). RT dose average 55.8 Gy (45 - 66.4). Median F/U 4.7 years
**Outcome: LC 100%, DFS 100%, OS 100%
**Toxicity: No lymphedema, decreased shoulder ROM 12%, chronic mild pain 12%. In 2 immediate reconstructions, both failed. In 2 delayed reconstruction, neither failed.
**Conclusion: Excellent local control with RT despite close/positive margins and large lesions

*'''Emory; 2007''' PMID 17481544 -- &quot;Local recurrence of ductal carcinoma in situ after skin-sparing mastectomy.&quot; (Carlson GW, J Am Coll Surg. 2007 May;204(5):1074-8; discussion 1078-80.)
**Retrospective. 223 patients, DCIS treated with skin-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. No adjuvant RT. Mean F/U 6.9 years
**Outcome: local recurrence 3.3%, regional recurrence 0.9%, distant recurrence 0.9%. If SM &lt;1mm, local recurrence 10%. High grade also influenced LR
**Conclusion: LR after skin-sparing mastectomy similar to total mastectomy. Re-excision of close SM should be performed and adjuvant RT should be considered


==Wide excision alone==
*'''ECOG E-5194''', 2009 (1997-2002) 
**'''2009''' PMID 19826126 &quot;Local Excision Alone Without Irradiation for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the Breast: A Trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.&quot; (Hughes LL, J Clin Oncol. published online ahead of print Oct 13 2009.)
***Prospective, non-randomized. 670 pts. Low or intermediate grade DCIS 2.5 cm or less, or high grade DCIS 1 cm or less; surgical margins 3 mm or greater; no residual calcifications on postoperative mammography. Presence of comedo necrosis was categorized in the high grade group. Tamoxifen was allowed in those pts enrolled after 2000 (about 30% of pts received tamoxifen). Pathologic assessment was rigorous (sequential sectioning and complete embedding).
***Median f/u 6.2 yrs(low-int;n=565) and 6.7 yrs(high grade;n=105). Median age 60; median tumor sizes 6mm (low/int grade) and 5mm (high grade). 5-yr ipsilateral breast events 6.1% (low/int) and 15.3% (high); 7-yr rate 10.5% (low/int) and 18.0% (high).
***Conclusion: &quot;Rigorously evaluated and selected patients with low- to intermediate-grade DCIS with margins 3 mm or wider had an acceptably low rate of ipsilateral breast events at 5 years after excision without irradiation. Patients with high-grade lesions had a much higher rate, suggesting that excision alone is inadequate treatment.&quot;
**Comment: pathologic assessment included &quot;complete sequential tissue processing&quot;. Their results may not be extrapolated to other centers using less rigorous pathologic assessment.
** 10 year update ECOG 5194 (Solin SABCS 2012):  10 yr IBTR is is ~ 15% in both groups. http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/71/24_Supplement/S4-6.short -- Median f/u 8.8 yr
** '''2015: 12 year''' PMID 26371148 -- &quot;Surgical Excision Without Radiation for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ of the Breast: 12-Year Results From the ECOG-ACRIN E5194 Study.&quot; (Solin LJ, J Clin Oncol. 2015 Nov 20;33(33):3938-44.) -- Median f/u 12.3 yr
***12 yr rate of ipsilateral breast event (IBE) 14.4% (Cohort 1) and 24.6% (Cohort 2). Rate of invasive cancer: 7.5% and 13.4%. 
***Conclusion: &quot;For patients with DCIS selected for favorable clinical and pathologic characteristics and treated with excision without radiation, the risks of developing an IBE and an invasive IBE increased through 12 years of follow-up, without plateau.&quot;


*'''Harvard''', 2006 (1995-2002) - PMID 16461781 &quot;Prospective study of wide excision alone for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.&quot; Wong JS et al. J Clin Oncol. 2006 Mar 1;24(7):1031-6. 
**Prospective, non-randomized. 158 pts. Pts with DCIS size &lt;= 2.5 cm, grade 1-2. Necrosis allowed. Required wide excision with margins &gt;= 1 cm. Tamoxifen not allowed.
**Median f/u 40 mos. LR was 2.4%/yr, 5-yr rate of 12%. 69% of recurrences were DCIS and 31% were invasive cancer. 
**Conclusion: substantial risk of LRR with WLE without RT.

**10-year IBTR (lumpectomy alone): SM- 26% vs SM+ 44%
*NSABP: 14 year IBTR (lumpectomy + RT): SM- 13% vs. SM+ 23%
*MSKCC: 10 year IBTR (lumpectomy +/- RT): SM close 28% vs SM medium 21% vs SM wide 19%

*'''Dublin; 2009''' PMID 19255332 -- &quot;Effect of margin status on local recurrence after breast conservation and radiation therapy for ductal carcinoma in situ.&quot; (Dunne C, J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1615-20. Epub 2009 Mar 2.)
**Meta-analysis. 4,660 patients, 22 trials evaluating BCS and RT.  
**Outcome: median time to IBTR 5 years. Recurrence 64% less if negative SM vs positive SM (OR 0.4, SS, using trial definition of negative margin, which ranged from no cells at ink to 10 mm). Margin thresholds for recurrence, &amp;ge; 5-mm OR 1.0 vs 2-mm OR 1.5 (NS) vs 1-mm OR 2.9 (SS) vs no cells on ink OR 2.6 (SS). 
**Conclusion: Negative surgical margins should be obtained; 2mm margin a good cut-off


'''''Studies'''''
*'''RAND Corporation; 2011''' (1985-2000) PMID 21200025 -- &quot;Comparative effectiveness of ductal carcinoma in situ management and the roles of margins and surgeons.&quot; (Dick AW, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2011 Jan 19;103(2):92-104. Epub 2011 Jan 3.)
**Retrospective. 2 health systems: Monroe County, New York and Henry Ford Health System, Michigan. 994 women with DCIS, 50 treating surgeons. Evaluated surgical margin and treatments (BCS alone, BCS + RT, mastectomy), stratified by surgeon. Final SM positive 4.6%, close (&amp;le; 2mm) 20.0%, negative 75.4%. Median F/U 5 years
**Outcome: 5-year IBTR all ~6%, SM+ ~19%, SM close ~9%, SM negative 4% (SS). Surgeon performance accounted for 15-35% of 5-year IBTR and 13-30% of 10-year IBTR. 5-year DFS after mastectomy (99.3%), lumpectomy + RT (94.5%), and lumpectomy without RT (82.4%) significantly different by surgeon. IBTR risk: BCS no RT SM- 1.0; RT 0.25, BCS SM+ 3.4, SM close 1.4, mastectomy SM- 0.03, mastectomy SM close 0.4, mastectomy SM+ 2.0
**Surgeon impact: If surgeon effect were improved to mean, IBTR reduction by 15%; if median, IBTR reduction by 22%, and if at 75th percentile, IBTR reduction by 31%
**Conclusion: Positive SM large impact on IBTR, even for mastectomy and BCS with RT. Extent of surgeon variation and its contribution to long-term outcomes are troubling

**Retrospective. 194 patients, DCIS, excision alone or excision + RT
**Outcome: IBTR 10-year 22%, 15-years 29%. By SM, &lt;1mm 28% vs 1-9 mm 21% vs &amp;ge; 10 mm 19%. RT reduced IBTR by 62% (SS), if &lt;1mm by 83% vs 1-9 mm by 70% vs &amp;ge; 10mm by 24% (NS). High volume disease near margin (margin width, number of involved ducts at closest margin) associated with increased risk of IBTR in no RT group, and greater proportional benefit of RT in RT group
**Conclusion: Effect of RT on IBTR influenced by disease volume near margin

**Retrospective analysis. 1569/1799 patients analyzed, 692 (44%) received optional boost. Majority boost 10 Gy (1-20 Gy) after 50 Gy whole breast. Mean F/U 14 yrs
**Outcome: IBTR SM- 13% vs. SM+ 23% (SS). By margin status, if SM- boost 13% vs no boost 13% (NS), if SM+ boost 21% vs. no boost 26% (NS). On multivariate analysis, boost not significant predictor for recurrence; while age, SM status, comedo necrosis were significant predictors  
**Conclusion: Surgical margin status significant predictor for recurrence

==BCS +/- RT==
*10-year local recurrence: 25-30% BCS alone vs. ~15% BCS + RT (~50% reduction)
**Invasive recurrence: ~16% vs. ~8% (~50% reduction)
**Non-invasive ~15% vs. ~8% (40-50% reduction)
*Based on NSABP B-17 data, annual IBTR recurrence rate is ~4% per year with surgery alone (2% invasive and 2% noninvasive); adjuvant RT decreases it to ~2% per year
*Based on 3 randomized trials (NSABP B-17, EORTC 10853, and UKCCCR), all subgroups (as analyzed by multivariate analysis looking at individual variables) benefit from RT. These data have not been analyzed for subgroups defined by several variables (such as &lt;40 and intermediate grade and large size). 
*Some retrospectively-defined prognostic groups (such as Van Nuys, see Prognosis section below) suggest there are discrete patient groups that may have different outcomes, and may benefit from different treatments:
**&quot;Low risk&quot; patients - RT does not offer much if any additional benefit over BCS alone. These patients could potentially be treated with BCS alone
**&quot;High risk&quot; patients - while RT does offer significant benefit, the rate of recurrence is still unacceptably high. These patients should probably be treated with mastectomy
**In clinical practice in US, ~30% DCIS patients are treated with BCS alone, ~40% are treated with BCS+RT, and ~30% are treated with mastectomy. These rates vary widely with geography
**Unfortunately, there are no commonly accepted guidelines to help stratify patients

***Subgoup analysis: No synergy between tamoxifen and RT. No benefit of tamoxifen differs from B-24 trial: authors suggest it may be due to differences in the patient population.  In B-24 33.5% of patients were under 50 compared to only 9.5% in the UK/ANZ trial

**'''12.7 years; 2011''' PMID 21145284 --&quot;Effect of tamoxifen and radiotherapy in women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ: long-term results from the UK/ANZ DCIS trial.&quot; (Cuzick J, Lancet. 2011 Jan;12(1):21-9.). Mean F/U 12.7 years
***Conclusion: RT can be recommended for DCIS, there is little evidence to recommend tamoxifen for prevention of ipsilateral invasive disease.

==Multi-focal DCIS==
*'''Toronto; 2007''' (1982-2000) PMID 17984188 -- &quot;Significance of multifocality in ductal carcinoma in situ: outcomes of women treated with breast-conserving therapy.&quot; (Rakovitch E, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Dec 10;25(35):5591-6. Epub 2007 Nov 5.)
**Retrospective. 615 cases of DCIS (multifocal n=260, unifocal n=314, unreported n=31), treated with BCS alone (50%) or BCS+RT (50%); most RT 50/25, some 40/16
**Outcome: local recurrence BCS alone 21% (50% invasive) vs. BCS+RT 9% (24% invasive); 10-year LRFR BCS alone 72% vs. BCS+RT 82%. Median time-to-recurrence BCS alone 4.3 years vs. BCS+RT 3.0 years
**Multifocality: 10-year LRFR multifocal 59% vs. unifocal 80% (SS); but if treated with BCS+RT, no difference (80% vs. 87%, NS)
**Conclusion: Multifocality significant predictor of local recurrence if BCS only; no difference if adjuvant RT used


==Prognosis==
'''NCCN Guidelines'''
*RT for all patients after BCS, unless DCIS diameter is &lt;0.5 cm
*Boost recommended for everyone getting RT

**949 pts with DCIS, 604 excision alone, 345 excision + RT. No hormonal therapy. Used the updated USC / Van Nuys scoring system (size, margin, DCIS classification, age) which gives scores 4-12. Goal is to update the treatment recommendations to achieve a LR risk of &lt;20% at 12 yrs.
**Outcomes: Median f/u 86 months (7.1 yrs). 165 local recurrences (103 - excision alone, 62 - RT). 
***12-yr local recurrence: score 4-6, &lt;= 6% (NS difference for RT vs no RT); score 10-12, &gt;= 40% (for excision + RT); 
**Original treatment recommendations: excision alone for those who score 4-6; RT for those who score 7-9; mastectomy for those who score 10-12.
**New treatment recommendations: to achieve a LR risk of &lt;20% at 12 yrs.

N Engl J Med. 1999 May 13;340(19):1455-61.
**Retrospective. 469 pts. Pts treated until 1989 received post-op RT and those treated after 1989 did not. RT was 40-50 Gy to whole breast + 16-20 Gy boost. Tumors were assessed for histologic subtype, nuclear grade, comedonecrosis, maximal diameter, and margin width. Margins were classified as close or involved (&lt;1 mm), intermediate (1 to &lt;10 mm), or wide. 
**RT decreased the recurrence rate for close or involved margins; for intermediate or wide margins, was not statistically different. 
**Conclusion: RT is not necessary for margins &gt; 10 mm.

**Came up with Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI). Combines tumor size, margin width, histologic classification. Score 1-3 for each to arrive at a total score of 3-9.
**Evaluated 333 pts treated with excision alone or excision + RT. 
**For pts with VNPI score of 3-4, excellent recurrence free survival (100% vs 97%) whether or not RT was used. For VNPI scores of 5-7, there was a 17% decrease (85% vs 68%) in RFS when RT was used. For score of 8-9, recurrence rate &gt; 60% despite RT. 
**Conclusion: recommend excision alone for score of 3-4, excision + RT for score of 5-7, and mastectomy for 8-9.

== Ingredients ==
*250 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] of fresh human [[Cookbook:Placenta|placenta]], chopped into fine strips (about half of the placenta from a 6.6 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] baby, or 1/3 from a 9.9 pound baby)
*1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped.
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Rosemary|Rosemary]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
*[[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin]]
*[[Cookbook:Noodle|Rice noodles]]
*red [[Cookbook:Chile|chile]]
*[[Cookbook:Shallot|Shallots]]

==Procedure==
#Cook onion in olive oil until it is transparent.
#Add chopped garlic.
#Toss in placenta.
#Cook quickly.
#Add a dash of fresh rosemary and 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of cumin.
#Add a pinch of salt and ground pepper to taste.
#Place on a bed of rice noodles and garnish with thin slices of red capsicum and shallots.

==Warning==
As with any meat from uncontrolled sources (such as hunting or scavenging) people should be cautious of risks involved. Certain blood borne diseases can live in blood and tissue outside the body for some time. Be sure that sensible precautions have been taken.

== Which Programming Language Should I Use? ==
Shouldn't there actually be some information on WHICH programming languages are good for competitions in this section, rather than just a very quick review of the differences between programming for an organisation and programming for a competition? [[User:24.225.233.40|24.225.233.40]] 17:09, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

== The Word &quot;Stupid&quot; ==

The statement, &quot;Why would they pay so much for a stupid programming contest?&quot; is ambiguous. &quot;Stupid&quot; in this context means too many possible things. Perhaps, &quot;Why would they pay so much for a simple programming contest?&quot;, or even better, &quot;Why would they pay so much for a programming contest?&quot;

== Scope of this book? ==

What do people feel is the correct scope for this book? It was nominated for deletion and the consensus was that it could be left as a stub that could grow larger, but it's not clear to me exactly what content people foresee being added. Is there any utility to providing details about the various programming competitions, beyond simply linking to the web pages of the competitions? --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 20:10, 9 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gaining the support of your neighbors is crucial to residential beekeepers. There are a variety of ways to gain their support, or at least acceptance, for your activities. First, do some subtle checking amongst your neighbors beforehand to see if any are allergic to bee-stings.  If any are allergic, you may want to reconsider your hobby, locating your bees as far from their home as possible, or purchasing an EpiPen. Education on honeybees may also help alleviate your neighbors concerns.  Furthermore, small gifts from your beehive such as products made from wax or the ever popular honey, can work towards calming your neighbors.

Back to [[PHP Programming|PHP]]

As you should have already learned in previous sections of this book. PHP is more than just a web server language. It can be used to create GUI applications, shell like scripts, and even daemons, among other things. This chapter focuses on using PHP to create GUI applications using PHP-GTK.


== What is PHP-GTK ==
PHP-GTK is a GTK+ and GNOME language binding for PHP. That's just a fancy way of saying that PHP-GTK makes it so that GNOME and GTK+ programs can be written using PHP.

You have to have PHP-CLI and GTK installed on your box.

For questions, search or browse this [http://www.nabble.com/Php---GTK-f170.html PHP GTK Forum] hosted by [http://www.nabble.com Nabble].

== Example PHP-GTK Program ==
Below is a very simple PHP-GTK program. It just creates a window that doesn't do anything. In fact, as you'll find out if you run it, this window won't even close if you try to ''close it'' using the normal means.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $window = new GtkWindow();
  $window-&gt;show_all();
  gtk::main();
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a little more complex than your usual ''Hello World program''. But we'll go through it step by step.

The first line:
        $window = new GtkWindow();
creates a new GTK+ window. One thing to note about GTK+ and GNOME programming is that when you create a window it does not automatically get displayed. (That's what the next line does.)

The next line:
        $window-&gt;show_all();
displays the newly created window.

The last line:
        gtk::main();
is where all the magic happens with GTK+. For now, just take my word for it that you need to call this to make you GTK+ program ''run''.

== External Links ==
* [http://www.nabble.com/Php---GTK-f170.html PHP GTK Forum] lots of GTK related topics

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Your Japanese wikibook edits==
Hey, I noticed you've been making some additions to the Japanese wikibook. Looks good. Next time you make an edit you should try to remember to use the &quot;Show preview&quot; button instead of &quot;Save page&quot;. This gives you a chance to review your changes before submitting them and it helps prevent clogging up the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese:JLPT:Verb_Types&amp;action=history page history] pages. It also makes it much easier to track what changes have been made, since we only have to view one diff instead of 15. Anyway, thanks for the edits! We hope to see more :) - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 03:04, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ZZT-OOP''' is a primitive object-oriented scripting language used by the DOS game creation system ''ZZT''. The language was created by Tim Sweeney of Epic MegaGames (now Epic Games).

== History of ''ZZT'' ==

''ZZT'' was made in 1991. It was Epic's first release; although it was not terribly successful, it did gain some attention. After version 3.2 (the version considered to be the &quot;official&quot; ''ZZT''), Tim Sweeney discontinued development, moving on to other projects, such as ''Jill of the Jungle''. A sequel to ''ZZT'' with more advanced features was made, called ''Super ZZT'', but it never had the success of its predecessor. The source code for the original was lost, putting a stop to the development of any further versions.

In 1997, Epic decided to release ''ZZT'' and the four games that came with it as freeware, due to the program's being severely outdated in both graphics and sound. Despite its age, ''ZZT'' continues to draw a following, and an online community based around it still exists today. Many attempts have been made in recent years to improve the program, ranging from hacking the ''ZZT'' executable itself to writing emulators that work like ''ZZT'', except with a few new features. ''ZZT'' has even inspired various other fan-created game creation systems, such as ''ZIG'' and ''MegaZeux''. However, the original ''ZZT 3.2'' continues to be the most widely used.

== Overview of ''ZZT'' ==

The ZZT-OOP language is an integrated part of ''ZZT''; as a result, in order to write a program in ZZT-OOP, you must have some familiarity with ''ZZT''. ''ZZT'' is not playable by itself; it is an interpreter through which ''ZZT'' games can be played. These games, called ''worlds'', usually have all their code contained in one file with a &lt;tt&gt;.ZZT&lt;/tt&gt; extention.

=== World Structure ===

The space in each world is divided into segments called ''boards''. The display size of a board is fixed in size, and the player can only view one board at a time. However, these boards can be linked together to create the illusion of a continuous landscape. To clarify this concept, suppose that you were designing some dungeons in ''ZZT''. The entrance to the dungeons would be on one board. The entrance on this board might link to a second board that contained the first rooms of the dungeons and a staircase. The stairs would link to a third board, which would contain part of the underground dungeons. This board might link to yet other boards that contained adjacent dungeon rooms, and so on. Note that scale is not always kept consistent; for example, each dungeon board might only contain a few rooms, while the board containing the dungeon entrance could be made into a zoomed-out map of everything else in the area. When a player leaves the board he or she is on, the board disappears from view, replaced by the board that he or she has moved to.

Every board in a world file is playable with the exception of the first board in the file. This board is called the ''Title Screen'' because it is the first board that the user sees when he or she loads your game. Because the player cannot actually play it, the Title Screen is usually used as a splash screen for the game; however, ZZT-OOP code will still run, which allows simple animation and even introductory cutscenes to be displayed.

=== Board Structure ===

The terrain on each board is based on a 60 by 25 grid of ''tiles''. Each tile is a block on the screen that has a certain appearance and properties. Because ''ZZT'' runs in text mode, each tile is character sized, takes the appearance of one of the 256 ASCII characters, and has both a foreground and background color. Terrain limits the movement abilities of the player, but it is often used just to create an interesting backdrop. Although the word &quot;terrain&quot; implies an outdoor setting, it is also used for constructing indoor features, such as walls. The terrain can range from a simplistic box that represents a room to a more decorative, organic board; using different colors of terrain, it is even possible to draw simple pictures.

Tiles are not limited to representing terrain; various items and creatures can also be put onto boards as well. A detailed list of all tile types is beyond the purposes of this introduction; however, one of the most useful tile types will be mentioned here; the ''object''. Objects are important because, unlike most of the other tile types, object tiles can contain ZZT-OOP programs. This allows the world designer to customize object behavior. For example, say you wanted to fill a dungeon full of monsters, but you did not want to use ''ZZT'''s built-in enemies. After designing the dungeon and laying down the proper terrain, you would add several objects to the board. You would then write a ZZT-OOP program that would instruct them on how to attack the player; how to write such programs is the subject of this book.

== Reasons to Learn ZZT-OOP ==

There are several reasons for learning ZZT-OOP:

* ZZT-OOP is necessary for writing an original ''ZZT'' game. Although it is possible to make ''ZZT'' games without knowing ZZT-OOP, one is restricted to only using the preprogrammed items and enemies.

* ZZT-OOP is a good introductory programming language. Although you couldn't turn programming in ZZT-OOP into a career, it is a fun and easy way to learn the basics of programming.

* ZZT-OOP (and ''ZZT'') is a fun hobby. Writing games for ''ZZT'' is a nice medium for expressing your creative self, and it's not hard to go online and find somebody who will play your games.

* ZZT-OOP is restrictive, but in a fun way. Because the language was only meant for simple adventure games, code that would be easy in other languages becomes a challenge in ZZT-OOP. However, some of us live for such challenges, and although it won't get you a date or a job, being able to code complex things - a fractal generation program, for example - using only an archaic game creation system is rather impressive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Origin of Chinese characters==
You might wonder why you have to bother with the origin of Chinese characters if you are merely learning the Chinese written language. However, Chinese characters are less like most Western languages, where words are formed by spelling, and pronunciations can easily be read from the letters. However the meaning and sound of some Chinese characters can be guessed from their similarity to other characters once you begin to understand how the system works. Most Chinese characters are composed from about 200 basic radicals put together to make a single character. The following are some examples:&lt;br&gt;
'''人'''(human)&lt;br&gt;
'''男'''(male)&lt;br&gt;
'''女'''(female)&lt;br&gt;
'''上'''(up,above)&lt;br&gt;
'''下'''(down,below)&lt;br&gt;
'''河'''(river,in ancient times it refers particularly the Yellow River)&lt;br&gt;
'''家'''(home)&lt;br&gt;
'''花'''(flower)&lt;br&gt;
So, you can see, even the most useful words are as complicated as puzzles.

However, the Chinese characters can be systematic and easier to understand if you know ''why'' they will be written like that. That brings you back to the origin of Chinese characters, which is the only link and classification between Chinese characters.

The Chinese characters are actually originated from six different origins. They are 象形(pictograms),指事(simple indicatives),會意(compound indicatives),形聲(phono-semantic compounds)(,轉注(derived characters) and 假借(borrowed characters).
{{wikipedia|Chinese character classification}}
===象形 (xiàng xíng, ''Pictograms'') ===
Pictograms is the oldest origin of Chinese characters. Words originated from pictograms are actually simple pictures of the objects. For example, 人(man) is a simple picture of a man's side-view.

Another example is the word 女(female), which is a simple picture of a woman sitting in the traditional Chinese posture in ancient times.

So, as you can see, understanding these characters is not that difficult, once you know their origin, you can remember it quite well. Try to imagine the picture of a man's side-view if you forgot how to write 人. The same goes for the other characters with this origin.

===指事 (zhǐ shì, Simple indicatives)===
Ancient Chinese people can easily draw things out to create words. But how about abstract ideas like &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;? That explains one weakness of pictograms: you can only express things that have an actual form. This is where simple indicatives come in handy. Words originated from simple indicatives usually consist of two parts: a picture just like pictograms, and an indicator which indicates the abstract meaning applied on that picture. The character 上(up,above) is an example which realizes the abstract meaning of &quot;above&quot; to &quot;things above the ground&quot;. 

Be careful that these two words don't mean only ''things above/below the ground''. They &quot;use the ground as an example&quot;, thus meaning &quot;up/above&quot; and &quot;down/below&quot; respectively.

===會意 (huì yì, Compound indicatives)===
Compound indicatives is another type of Chinese characters which combines two or more characters to express a certain meaning.

The character 男(male) is a typical example. It consists of the character 田 and 力. 田 means farm or field; and 力 means force. By combining the meaning of 田 and 力, we can draw the meaning of this word: a person working (indicated by 力, force) in the farms(田), which matches exactly as male - they are the working labour in ancient times, and the work required in ancient times was mostly farming. 

Another example is 家(home). It consists of a 宀(this is not a character, just a part of the word, representing the roof of the house - imagine it), and a 豕(pig). Keeping pigs in the home is an important matter of ancient Chinese people, as it provides them food and milk, in ancient times where they rely on farming. This way we can draw the meaning of this word: the place(宀) where we keep pigs(豕).

===形聲 (xíng shēng, Phono-semantic compounds)===
If all Chinese characters originated from the above three methods, then it would be extremely hard to memorize the characters, as each of them would be completely different in shape. Fortunately, over 90% of the Chinese character originated from phono-semantic compounds, which is far more systematic. Phono-semantic compounds characters consists of two parts: 形符 (the &quot;semantic&quot; element), indicating the general meaning of that character; and 聲符 (the &quot;phonetic&quot; element), indicating the pronunciation of that character. Look at the remaining two characters from the above example:

河(river) consists of 氵and 可. 氵is the semantic element, and it itself means &quot;water&quot;, so, we can deduce that the character 河 is related with water. 可 is the phonetic element, and it itself means &quot;can&quot; (modal verb), but we don't have to mind that. The pronunciation of 河 and 可 are ho&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and ho&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in Cantonese respectively; and hé and kĕ in Mandarin. So, you can see, their pronunciations are similar. So, to understand this word, we can first quickly recall its meaning from the sematic element, 氵, that it is related to water. That helps a lot to recall your memory about its meaning: river. The next part is the pronunciation. The phonetic element, 可, gives you a general idea about how it should sound like. Usually the sound will not be the same, but at least in most cases the phonetic elements gives you a general idea of the rhyme of the word: for 河, &quot;o&quot; in Cantonese and &quot;e&quot; in Mandarin. That should help you recall the pronunciation of the word.

The other example, 花(flower), works the same way. Note that this time the characters is divided vertically into two parts, unlike 河, which is horizontally divided. Yet this is not a problem. We can still find the semantic element, 艹, which means &quot;grass&quot;, and is used to represent plants. The phonetic element is 化, which is pronounced fa&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Cantonese, and huà in Mandarin. Comparing to that of 花, which is fa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in Cantonese and huā in Mandarin respectively, we can see the same similarities. Thus we can know the meaning of 花, flower, and the pronunciation easily.

Many learners could find it hard to learn Chinese because everything is memorizing. But by this method we can simplify the problem a lot. Remember, over 90% of the Chinese characters originate from phono-sematic compounds.

===轉注 (zhuǎn zhù, Derived characters), 假借 (jiǎ jiè, Borrowed characters)===
These two are not origin of characters, but about the way ancient Chinese use characters.

====Derived characters)====
Derived characters refers to pairs of words that share the same etymological root, usually with similar (or same) meaning in the very first, yet is now used to denote different meanings.

The characters 老 lǎo (old) and 考 kǎo (a test) is a pair of derived characters, both originating from a common etymological root, and both meant &quot;old&quot; in the very first. Yet now a part of each character is changed to express different meanings. The pronunciations has also changed for the pair.

====Borrowed characters====
Borrowed characters refers to characters that was &quot;borrowed&quot; to express a new meaning differing from the original one. This is usually due to the few number of characters in ancient China. When people had new ideas to express, yet cannot find a corresponding word, they might just use an exisiting one to express the new idea. As for the original meaning, sometimes it was expressed in the same character along with the borrowed meaning, and sometimes a new character was created to substitute it.

The character 自 (self) was originally a pictogram of the nose, thus denotes the meaning &quot;nose&quot;. However, it was later borrowed to express the meaning of &quot;self&quot;. Nowadays this character retain only the new meaning &quot;self&quot;. As a side note, the character 鼻 (nose) was created later on to express the meaning &quot;nose&quot;.

Welcome to the wikibook course on written Chinese. This course aims at teaching Chinese for all dialects. The Chinese spoken language is extremely diverse. It can be mainly divided into [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese]], not mentioning the diverse dialects. The map on the right can give you an idea of the diversity of the Chinese spoken language. Therefore, this course aims at the written form of Chinese, which is universal in most parts of China. You can pick up different pronunciations of the language in the corresponding dialect you target to learn.

==Pronunciation/讀音/读音==
The difference between the written and spoken language in Chinese differs even more in regions. The official Mandarin, spoken all throughout mainland China (put aside the slight differences in dialects for now), is rather simple: you speak what you write. It is just like in English: you speak what you write in passages or books, etc. In English even the spoken abbreviations (I'm, it's, etc) can be written down half-formally. This is the case in Mandarin.

The spoken language in other dialects, especially those in Southern China, are however more complicated. The written language can, of course, be spoken as usual as you do when reading aloud an English passage; however the language used in everyday lives are different from the written forms. Their spoken language features many alterations of the words, not to mention the different pronunciations of most of the Chinese words from the Mandarin. Although the spoken language can be written down, it is clearly regarded as informal (save for those books that are especially targetted for spoken-language readers).

For beginners and those who wish to use Chinese as a mean of communication throughout China, Mandarin is surely your choice (the only exceptions are some of the Southern provinces, most notably the cities of Hong Kong, Macau and Guangzhou, where people use Cantonese for everyday communications). However, for those who wish to study the Chinese culture or the language in depth, it is recommended that you learn Cantonese, Min Nan or Hakka. Mandarin is a language based on the original northern dialects recently half-invented in order to unify the spoken language used throughout China. Because the northern part of China has been under the influence of many other tribes, such as the Mongols, Huns, etc, which actually ruled the northern people and forced their culture into the Chinese people's lives, many alterations to the original Chinese language can be observed.

In contrast, the southern part of China has managed to retain the features of the original language (for example, 食 - eat, is the word used in spoken Cantonese and Hakka, yet it should be replaced by the Mandarin 吃 in all written forms. However, 食 is the original word used by ancient Chinese, and is the word featured throughout the developing years). So for investigators, scholars, or other who want to study the language in depth, Cantonese is recommended.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scope of the text==
This Cantonese Basic Course is a course in spoken Cantonese. It uses all the basic grammatical structures of the language and a vocabulary of approximately 950 words. The subject matter of the course deals with daily life in Hong Kong. The course was designed to be taught in an intensive language program of 25-30 class hours a week. Students are expected to spend additional time outside of class listening to tapes of the lesson. There are 30 lessons in the course, and the rate of progress in an intensive class is expected to be approximately 2 lessons per week, including time for review and testing. Each lesson contains five sections:
#A basic conversation to be memorized;
#Notes;
#Pattern Drills, structural drills of the type in which the teacher's cue is the stimulus for the students' response;
#Conversation for Listening, a listening comprehension section; and
#Say it in Cantonese, English to Cantonese practice, much of it in conversational question-answer form, in which students activate what they have learned in the lesson.
The early lessons in addition contain explanation and practice drills on pronunciation points, and some classroom phrases for the students to learn to respond to when used by the teacher.

==Method of Instruction==
Ideally, but perhaps not typically, instruction is by a team consisting of a native speaking Cantonese as instructor and a native speaking American as linguist, with the instructor teaching by voicing the Cantonese sentences of the text for the students to imitate and the linguist giving explanations in English when required.  A good 80-90% of class time will then be spent with the native speaking instructor drilling the students in recitations, during which time the language in use is entirely Cantonese.  Students will read the notes of each lesson outside of class, and questions they have on the text will be answered in English by the linguist during periods set aside for that purpose.  Questions in English are not asked during drill sessions with the instructor.  Psychologically this establishes the habit of using only Cantonese in classes with the instructor. Class time is concentrated on learning the language by imitation, repetition, and transformation, according to spoken cues. The instructor speaks at natural speed, and the students learn to comprehend and speak at the same natural speed. If there is no linguist to explain students' questions, special periods are set aside for students to ask questions of the instructor. It is recommended that the rhythm of the drills not be interrupted by questions in English.

==Pace==
Although the course is projected as a 16 week course if studied on an intensive program, the time plan is to be viewed as a rough guide only.  The number of students in the class, their language learning aptitude, their amount of previous experience with related languages, the amount of time available for outside study, the excellence of the teacher--all these are variable factors which could affect the pace of learning.

An earlier version of the course was tested out on a pilot class of five students during the summer of 1967, and the proposed pace of two lessons a week seemed about right.  However the students in that course had been selected on the basis of roughly the same language aptitude score on the Modern Language Aptitude Test, and they had all previously studied Mandarin Chinese, a closely related language. Also, the present version incorporates pronunciation practices which the earlier version did not have, and additional Conversations for Listening and Say It in Cantonese sections.

It is therefore suggested that the teacher rely on his own judgment in regard to the pace of the lessons, rather than follow a set pace rigidly.  The text has been devised so that the crucial grammatical structures are covered in the first 26 lessons.  By covering the first 26 lessons well, students will gain a firm structural control of the spoken language.  We firmly feel that confident mastery of the first 26 lessons is preferable to hesitant control of the entire text, if a choice must be made between the two.  The rule of thumb should be that before going on to a new lesson students should be able to recite the old lesson's Basic Conversation fluently and with expression and should be able to do the Pattern Drills without looking at the book and without marked hesitation.

==Objectives of the course==
The objectives of the course are to teach students to speak Standard Cantonese in the locales where Cantonese is spoken, to speak it fluently and grammatically, with acceptable pronunciation, within the scope of topics of daily life. The course was not designed to lay the groundwork for learning the written language. At the end of the course students will be able to buy things; talk on the telephone; ask and give directions; handle money; discuss events past, present, and future; make comparisons; talk about themselves and their families; tell time; order simple meals; talk with the landlord, doctor, servant, bellboy, cabdriver, waiter, sales-clerk; discuss what, when, where, why, who, how, how much. They will not be able to discuss politics or their jobs or other topics of a specialized nature.

==Reliability of the material==
All the conversations and drills in this book were written by native Cantonese speakers working under the direction of an American linguist who specified which grammatical points to cover and what situations were required. The design of the text—--what to cover, what sequence to use in introducing new material, what limits to set on vocabulary, the write-ups of structure notes, types and layouts of pattern drills, and the contents of the English-to-Chinese translation sections, were done by the American linguist. 

What we have done to handle the problem of limited structures and vocabulary is to plan the lessons so that certain topics and forms don't come up until rather late in the course. The words 'yesterday,' 'today,' and 'tomorrow,' for example, don't occur until Lesson 16. Meanwhile the student has built up the grammatical structure and vocabulary to talk fluently on some subjects which don't involve these expressions and the complexities of verb structures that are involved with time-related sentences.  For this reason the present text is not appropriate for use of students whose needs are for just a few phrases of Cantonese--it takes too long from that point of view to get to some of the phrases which a tourist, for example, wants to use right away.  But the student who can study hard on an intensive program for H months and cover at least 26 of the 30 lessons, will then speak natural-sounding and grammatical Cantonese, and will be able to cope with most daily life situations in the language.

==Procedure==
===Basic Conversation===
Each lesson begins with a Basic Conversation covering a daily life situation, organized around one or more grammatical points. The conversation is presented first in buildup form, then in recapitulation. The buildup is partly a device to isolate new words and phrase for pronunciation and identification, partly a device to enable students to gain smooth delivery and natural sentence rhythm by starting with a small segment of a sentence then progressively adding to it to build a full sentence.

The recommended procedure for the buildup is as follows:  Students open their books to the new lesson and look at the English equivalents as the teacher voices the Cantonese.  The teacher voices the first item six times--three times for the students to listen only, three times for them to reenact after the teacher. (The teacher may voice the items more times, but it is recommended that he not do less.) The teacher then moves on to the next item and repeats the same procedure.  When the entire buildup hae been performed this way, the students close their books, and the teacher leads them through the buildup again giving each item one time, the students this time watching the teacher and imitating his behavior both vocal and kinetic--his lip movements, facial expressions, and body gestures.

If the students have particular trouble with a portion of the buildup, the teacher may give it a few more repetitions than the rest, but if the difficulty persists, he drops it for the time being and marks it to return to later. Repetitions under pressure are quite tension-producing, and it works better to return to a difficult passage in a more relaxed mood.

In the recapitulation section the conversation is repeated in full sentence form.  The teacher voices each sentence at least two times, with pauses after each sentence for students to repeat. The first goal is for the students to be able to say the conversation after the teacher at natural speed and with natural sentence rhythm.

Details of pronunciation are spotlighted in another section--the first goal for the conversation is sentence rhythm and natural speed. The second goal is for the students to memorize the Basic Conversation, so they can say it independently without the teacher's model to follow, maintaining natural speed and rhythm. Students will find the tape recorder a valuable aid to memorizing. The tape recorder is tireless in furnishing a model for students to imitate, and enables them to proceed at the pace best suited to their needs.

The purpose of memorizing the Basic Conversations is twofold. Memorizing situational material gives students tip-of-the-tongue command of usable Cantonese. Secondly, since the basic conversations are organized on grammatical principles, students by memorizing the conversations will be learning the grammatical framework of the language, on which they can construct other sentences. 

The second day on the lesson, when students have memorized the conversation, it is recommended that the teacher have them act out the conversational roles. Later, after moving on to a new lesson, the teacher has them act out the Basic Conversation of an earlier lesson as a form of review.

===Pronunciation Practice===
In general, the Pronunciation Practices concentrate on giving limited explanation and fuller practice drills on new sounds encountered in a lesson, plus comparison drills with sounds previously learned and sometimes comparisons with American close counterparts. Instead of giving many examples, using items unknown to the students the pronunciation drills stick to examples from material they have met in the Basic Conversation or Pattern Drills. The exception to this is Lesson One, which presents an overview of all the tones, consonant initials, and vooalio finals of the language, in addition to giving an introduction to intonation and stress. Students who absorb pronunciation best though mimicking the model and who find the linguistic description of sounds confusing or boring or both, should concentrate on mimicking the model and skimp or skip the explanations.

===Notes===
There are two kinds of Notes--Structure (grammar) Notes and Culture Notes. These are to he read outside of class. The structure notes summarize the structures used in the Basic Conversations and practiced in the Pattern Drills, and are for those students who want a general explanation of how the language works. The students who absorb language structures better through learning model sentences and drilling variations of the model can concentrate on the Basic Conversations and Pattern Drills, and skimp on the Structure Notes.

The Culture Notes comment on some Cantonese life patterns which differ from our own.

===Pattern Drills===
There are six kinds of Pattern Drills in Cantonese Basic Course. The purpose of the drills is to make the vocabulary and sentence structures sink in and become speech habits, so that the student understands spoken Cantonese without having to translate mentally and speaks fluently and grammatically at natural speed without awkward hesitation and groping for words. The Pattern Drills give students practice in structures and words which have been introduced in the Basic Conversations. In addition, there are other vocabulary items which appear first in the drill sections. A plus sign marks each occurrence of a new word in this section, and the English equivalent is given.

Each drill begins with an example giving a model of the teacher's cue and the students' response. Then there follow 8 to 10 problems to be done on this pattern. The teacher gives the cue, and the student responds to the new cue following the pattern set in the example. The response is thus predictable, controlled by the pattern and the cue. In the book the ones are given in the left hand column and the responses on the right, with the example above.

Students will find that going over the drills in a session with the tape recorder before performing then in class with the teacher aids their grasp of the material and smooths their delivery.  In class students look at their books to check the example for each drill, to learn what their task is. Then they perform the drill with books closed, relying on the pattern of the example sentence and the cues provided to know what to say. A drill is mastered when the student can respond to the cues promptly, smoothly, and without reference to the book.

The types of drills follow:
#Substitution Drills
#*The teacher voices a pattern sentence, then voices a word or phrase (called a cue) to be substituted in the original sentence.  The student notes the substitution cue and substitutes it in the appropriate place to make a new sentence.
#*; Example :
#*:T (for Teacher):  Good morning, Mrs. Brown. /Jones/
#*:S (for Student):  Good morning, Mrs. Jones.
#Expansion Drills
#*There are two kinds of expansion drills.  One could be called a listen-and-add drill, using vocabulary and structure familiar to the students.  The teacher says a word or phrase and the students repeat it.  Then the teacher voices another word or phrase and the students add that word to the original utterance, expanding it.  The teacher adds another cue, and the students incorporate it, and so on, making each time a progressively longer utterance.
#*; Example :  
#*:T:  Hat
#*:S:  Hat
#*:T:  Blue
#*:S:  Blue hat
#*:T:  Two
#*:S:  Two blue hats.
#*:T:  Buy
#*:S:  Buy two blue hats.
#*This type of expansion drill is handled a little differently if it includes new vocabulary.  In that case it is performed as a listen-and-repeat drill, the students echoing the teacher.
#*;Example:  
#*:T:  Hat
#*:S:  Hat
#*:T:  Blue hat
#*:S:  Blue hat
#*:T:  Two blue hats
#*:S:  Two blue hats
#*In the second type of expansion drill the example sentence gives the model to follow and the students expand the subsequent cue sentences according to the pattern set by the example.
#*;Example:  
#*:T:  I'm not Mrs. Lee.  /Chan/
#*:S:  I'm not Mrs. Lee--my name is Chan.
#Response Drills
#*The response drills involve 1) question stimulus and answer response, or 2) statement stimulus and statement response, or 3) statement stimulus and question response.
#*; Ex. 1:  
#*:T:  Is your name Chan?  /Lee/
#*:S:  No, it's Lee.
#*; Ex. 2:  
#*:T:  He speaks Cantonese.  /Mandarin/
#*:S:  He speaks Mandarin too.
#*; Ex. 5:  
#*:T:  He speaks Cantonese.  /Mandarin/
#*:S:  Does he speak Mandarin too?
#Transformation Drills.
#*In transformation drills the students transform the grammatical form of the cue sentences from positive to negative to question, according to the pattern set in the example.  A positive to negative transformation would be:
#*; Ex:  
#*:T:  Her name is Lee.
#*:S:  Her name isn't Lee.
#Combining Drills.
#*In combining drills the students make one long sentence from two short cue sentences, according to the pattern set in the example.
#*; Ex:
#*:T:  It's nine o'clock. We study Chinese.
#*:S:  We study Chinese at nine o'clock.
#Conversation Drills.
#*In conversation drills students carry on a conversation following the pattern set by the example.  The book or the teacher furnishes cues to vary the content while retaining the structure.
#*; Ex:
#*:A:  Good morning, Mrs. Lee.
#*:B:  Excuse me, I'm not Mrs. Lee.  My name is Chan.
#*:A:  Oh, excuse me, Miss Chan.
#*:B:  That's all right.
#*:A.........Miss Smith. / A.  Good morning, Miss Smith.
#*:B..............Brown. / B,  Excuse me, I's not Miss Smith, My name is Brown.
#*:A..................   / A:  Oh, excuse me, Miss Brown.
#*:B..................   / B:  That's all right.

===Conversations for Listening===
The Conversations for Listening, recorded on tapes, give the students a chance to listen to further conversations using the vocabulary and sentence patterns of the lesson under study. These can be listened to outside of class and replayed in class, with the teacher then asking questions (in Cantonese of coarse) on the selections and the students answering. Usually several replays are needed before the students' comprehension of the conversation is complete. After they understand a conversation in its entirety, it is recommended that they play it through two or three more times, listening especially for the expressive elements of intonation and final particles, as these occur primarily in conversation and not as natural features of pattern sentences which the students practice 4n the drill sections.

After Lesson l0, there will be new vocabulary in the Conversation for Listening, to help the story along. These words and phrases are glossed in Cantonese and English at the foot of each conversation in the printed text, but students will not be held responsible for learning them.

===Say It in Cantonese===
The Say It in Cantonese section gives situations and sentences in English, and students are to give Cantonese equivalents. This section is to be performed in class for the linguist or the teacher, though the students may prepare it beforehand if they like.  Students should recognize that there is often more than one acceptable way to 'say it in Cantonese.'

===Vocabulary Checklist===
At the end of each lesson is a vocabulary checklist, giving the new vocabulary for that lesson, the part of speech for each entry (noun, verb,etc.), and the English translation.

===Suggestions for Further Practice===
The Say it in Cantonese section is the final working section of each lesson. After doing that section the teacher is encouraged to allow time for the students to carry on conversation practice using the material in the lesson. The teacher should be referee for this part, and make sure all students get a chance to participate.  Some students are by nature more talkative than others, and the teacher must see to it, by asking a few questions of the more retiring students, that participation in free conversation is fairly evenly distributed and that the naturally talkative students don't do all the talking.

Repeating the dialogue of the Basic Conversations of earlier lessons is a good way to keep those vocabularies and sentences fresh in the students' minds.  Also, selections from earlier dialogues can often be used during free conversation practice of the lesson under study.

==System of Romanization Used==
The system of romanization used in the text is a modification of the Huang-Kok Yale romanization. It is described in detail in Lesson l. In comparing Cantonese and Mandarin sentence structures the system of romanization used for the Mandarin is Yale romanization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Causes of war==
There is great debate over why wars happen, even when most people do not want them to. Representatives of many different academic disciplines have attempted to explain war.

===Historians===
Historians tend to be reluctant to look for sweeping explanations for all wars. A. J. P. Taylor famously described wars as being like traffic accidents. There are some conditions and situations that make them more likely but there can be no system for predicting where and when each one will occur. Social scientists criticize this approach arguing that at the beginning of every war some leader makes a conscious decision and that they cannot be seen as purely accidental.

===Psychological theories===

[[w:Psychology|Psychologist]]s such as [[w:E.F.M. Durban|E.F.M. Durban]] and [[w:John Bowlby|John Bowlby]] have argued that human beings, especially [[w:men|men]], are inherently violent. While this violence is repressed in normal society it needs the occasional outlet provided by war. This combines with other notions, such as [[w:displacement|displacement]] where a person transfers their grievances into bias and hatred against other ethnic groups, nations, or ideologies. While these theories can explain why wars occur, they do not explain when or how they occur. In addition, they raise the question why there are sometimes long periods of peace and other eras of unending war. If the innate psychology of the human mind is unchanging, these variations are inconsistent.

A solution adopted to this problem by militarists such as [[w:Franz Alexander|Franz Alexander]] is that peace does not really exist. Periods that are seen as peaceful are actually periods of preparation for a later war or when war is suppressed by a state of great power, such as the [[w:Pax Britannica|Pax Britannica]].

If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it. One alternative is to argue that war is only, or almost only, a male activity and if human leadership was in female hands wars would not occur. This theory has played an important role in modern [[w:feminism|feminism]]. Critics, of course, point to various examples of female political leaders who had no qualms about using military force, such as [[w:Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]].

Other psychologists have argued that while human temperament allows wars to occur, they only do so when mentally unbalanced men are in control of a nation. This school argues leaders that seek war such as [[w:Napoleon|Napoleon]], [[w:Hitler|Hitler]], and [[w:Stalin|Stalin]] were mentally abnormal and thus if some sort of screening process, such as elections, could prevent these types from coming to power, war would end.

A distinct branch of the psychological theories of war are the arguments based on [[w:evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychology]]. This school tends to see war as an extension of animal behaviour, such as territoriality and competition. However, while war has a natural cause the development of technology has accelerated human destructiveness to a level that is irrational and damaging to the species. We have the same instincts of a chimpanzee but overwhelmingly more power. The earliest advocate of this theory was [[w:Konrad Lorenz|Konrad Lorenz]]. These theories have been criticized by scholars such as [[w:John G. Kennedy|John G. Kennedy]], who argue that the organized, sustained war of humans differs more than just technologically from the territorial fights between animals.

===Anthropological theories ===

[[w:Anthropology|Anthropologists]] take a very different view of war. They see it as fundamentally cultural, learnt by nurture rather than nature. Thus if human societies could be reformed war would disappear. To this school the acceptance of war is inculcated into each of us by the [[w:Religion|religious]], [[w:Ideology|ideological]], and [[w:Nationalism|nationalistic]] surroundings in which we live.

Anthropologists also see no links between various forms of violence. They see the fighting of animals, the skirmishes of [[w:hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherer]] tribes, and the organized warfare of modern societies as distinct phenomena each with their own causes. Theorists such as [[w:Ashley Montagu|Ashley Montagu]] emphasize the top down nature of war, that almost all wars are begun not by popular pressure but by the whims of leaders and that these leaders also work to maintain the system of ideological justifications for war.

===Sociological theories===
Sociology has long been very concerned with the origins of war, and many thousands of theories have been advanced, many of them contradictory. Some use detailed formulas taking into account hundreds of demographic and economic values to predict when and where wars will break out. The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the Uppsala Department of Peace and Conflict Research. So far none of these formulas have successfully predicted the outbreak of future conflicts. On the other hand there is a case for avoiding war in the Democratic peace theory, since liberal democracies rarely go to war against each other. A detailed study by Michael Haas found that no single variable has a strong correlation to the occurrence of wars. There have been many other attempts at Predicting War.

Many sociologists have attempted to divide wars into types to get better correlations, but this has also produced mixed results. Data looked at by R.J. Rummel has found that civil wars and foreign wars are very different in origin, but Jonathan Wilkenfield using different data found just the opposite.

Sociology has thus divided into a number of schools. One based on the works of Eckart Kehr and Hans-Ulrich Wehler sees war as the product of domestic conditions, with only the target of aggression being determined by international realities. Thus World War I was not a product of international disputes, secret treaties, or the balance of power but a product of the economic, social, and political situation within each of the states involved.

This differs from the traditional approach of Karl von Clausewitz and Leopold von Ranke that argue it is the decisions of statesmen and the geopolitical situation that leads to war.

===Information theories===
A popular new approach is to look at the role of information in the outbreak of wars. This theory, advanced by scholars of international relations such as Geoffrey Blainey, argues that all wars are based on a lack of information. If both sides at the outset knew the result neither would fight, the loser would merely surrender and avoid the cost in lives and infrastructure that a war would cause.

This is based on the notion that wars are reciprocal, that all wars require both a decision to attack and also a decision to resist attack. This notion is generally agreed to by almost all scholars of war since Karl von Clausewitz. This notion is made harder to accept because it is far more common to study the cause of wars rather than events that failed to cause wars, and wars are far more memorable. However, throughout history there are as many invasions and annexations that did not lead to a war, such as the U.S.-led invasion of Haiti in 1994, the Nazi invasions of Austria and Czechoslovakia preceding the Second World War, and the annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union in 1940. On the other hand, Finland's decision to resist a similar Soviet aggression in 1939 led to the Winter War.

The leaders of these nations chose not to resist as they saw the potential benefits being not worth the loss of life and destruction such resistance would cause. Lack of information may not only be to who wins in the immediate future. The Norwegian decision to resist the Nazi invasion was taken with the certain knowledge that Norway would fall. The Norwegians did not know whether the German domination would be permanent and also felt that noble resistance would win them favour with the Allies and a position at the peace settlement in the event of an Allied victory. If in 1941 it had been known with certainty the Germans would dominate central Europe for many decades, it is unlikely the Norwegians would have resisted. If it had been known for certainty that the Third Reich would collapse after only a few years of war, the Nazis would not have launched the invasion at all.

This theory is predicated on the notion that the outcome of wars is not randomly determined, but fully determined on factors such as doctrine, economies, and power. While purely random events, such as storms or the right person dying at the right time, might have had some effect on history, these only influence a single battle or slightly alter the outcome of a war, but would not mean the difference between victory and defeat.

There are two main objectives in the gathering of intelligence. The first is to find out the ability of an enemy, the second their intent. In theory to have enough information to prevent all wars both need to be fully known. The Argentinean dictatorship knew that Britain had the ability to defeat them but their intelligence failed them on the question of whether the British would use their power to resist the annexation of the Falklands. The American decision to enter the Vietnam War was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces would resist them, but did not believe that the guerillas had the capability to long oppose American forces.

One major difficulty is that in a conflict of interests, some deception or at least not telling everything, is a standard tactical component on both sides. If you think that you can convince the opponent that you will fight, the opponent might desist. For example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an attack fiercly partly by playing on the myth of Arian superiority, and by making sure that Hermann Göring only saw Elite troops in action, often dressed up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit.

===Economic theories===
Another school of thought argues that war can be seen as an outgrowth of economic competition in a chaotic and competitive international system. That wars begin as a pursuit of new markets, of natural resources, and of wealth.  Unquestionably a cause of some wars, from the empire building of Britain to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in pursuit of oil this theory has been applied to many other conflicts. It is most often advocated by those of the left of the political spectrum who argue that such wars serve only the interests of the wealthy but are fought by the poor.

===Marxist theories===
The economic theories also form a part of the Marxist theory of war, which argues that all war grows out of the class war. It sees wars as imperial ventures to enhance the power of the ruling class and divide the proletariat of the world by pitting them against each other for contrived ideals such as nationalism or religion. Further, wars are a natural outgrowth of the free market and class system, and will not disappear until the world revolution occurs.

'''International relations''' ('''IR''') is an academic and public policy field, a branch of political science, dealing with the foreign policy of states within the '''international system''', including the roles of international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and multinational corporations (MNCs). Because international relations seeks to analyze as well as formulate foreign policy, it can be either positive or normative.

It draws upon such diverse fields as political science, economics, history, law, philosophy, area studies, sociology, cultural studies and other social sciences. International relations involves a diverse range of issues, including the environmental movement, nuclear proliferation, nationalism, foreign aid, economic development, and human rights.

== Theories ==

There are many ways of thinking in international relations theory, including Constructivism, Institutionalism, Marxism, Neo-Gramscianism, and others. However, two schools of thought are predominant: Realism and Liberalism.

==== Realism ====

The term '''Realism''' is often associated with the German term realpolitik. Realpolitik is a combination of two words: the German &quot;real&quot;, meaning &quot;real&quot; or &quot;substantive,&quot; as in the German &quot;Realität&quot; (meaning &quot;reality&quot;), and &quot;politik&quot; (meaning &quot;politics&quot; or &quot;policy&quot;).
Bismarck used the term after following Metternich's lead in finding ways to balance the power of European empires. Balancing power meant keeping the peace, and careful realpolitik practioners tried to avoid arms races. However, during the early-20th Century, arms races (and alliances) occurred anyway, culminating in World War I.

Realism makes several key assumptions. It assumes that the international system is anarchic, in the sense that there is no authority above states capable of regulating their interactions; states must arrive at relations with other states on their own, rather than it being dictated to them by some higher controlling entity (that is, no true authoritative world government exists). It also assumes that sovereign states, rather than international institutions, non-governmental organizations, or multinational corporations, are the primary actors in international affairs. According to realism, each state is a rational actor that always acts towards its own self-interest and the primary goal of each state is to ensure its own security. Realism holds that in pursuit of that security, states will attempt to amass resources and that relations between states are determined by their relative level of power. That level of power is in turn determined by the state's capabilities, both military and economic.
Moreover, Realists believe that States are inherently aggressive (&quot;offensive realism&quot;), and that territorial expansion is only constrained by opposing power(s).
The principal Realist theorists are [[w:E.H._Carr|Carr]], [[w:Hans_Morgenthau|Morgenthau]] and [[w:Kenneth_Waltz|Waltz]].

There are two sub-schools of realism: '''maximal realism''' and '''minimal realism'''.  The theory of maximal realism holds that the most desirable position to be in is that of the hegemon]], the most powerful entity in the world, and that smaller entities will align themselves with the hegemon out of political self-interests.  Under maximal realism, the position where there are simultaneously two equally powerful co-hegemons (such as was the case during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union) is an inherently unstable one and that situation will inevitably collapse into a more stable state where one nation is more powerful and one is less powerful.

The theory of minimal realism holds that non-hegemonic states will ally against the hegemon in order to prevent their own interests from being subsumed by the hegemon's interests.  Under the minimal-realism theory it is possible to have two equally powerful co-hegemons with whom a smaller entity may ally in turn depending on which hegemon better fits with the smaller entity's policies at the moment (playing both sides against the middle).

==== Liberalism ====

'''Liberalism''' holds that state preferences, rather than state capabilities, are the primary determinant of state behavior. Preferences will vary from state to state, depending on their culture, economic system, or type of government. Many different strands of liberalism have emerged; some include commercial liberalism, liberal institutionalism, idealism and regime theory.

Recently, realism and liberalism have evolved into neo-realism and neo-liberalism. no

==== Other Schools of Thought ====

Other schools, which cannot (yet) be counted to the established mainstream in the Study of International Relations, include postmodern, feminist and Neo-Marxist approaches, and Neo-Gramscianism. These perspectives differ from both Realism and Liberalism in their epistemological and ontological premises and are postpositivistic in nature.

Different schools of thought in international relations can predict the same events. The theories are differentiated by the assumptions they make in their reasoning toward predictions. For example, both realists and liberals claim that events as disparate as World War I, the Cold War, and the relatively conflict-free post-Cold War Europe were predicted by their theories. The theories differ in the fundamental assumptions they make in predicting state behavior. It is possible that one liberal theorist will predict war while another liberal theorist will predict peace; their disagreement arises from how they interpret events, but their fundamental assumptions are the same. Similarly, it is possible that a realist theorist and a liberal theorist could both predict peace, but their fundamental assumptions as to why that occurs would be different. _

== History ==

The history of international relations is widely traced back to the [[w:Peace of Westphalia|Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 where the modern states system as we see it today was developed.  It was not until 1919 that the first university department devoted to 'international politics' (and its Woodrow Wilson Chair of International Politics) was founded by David Davies at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales.  The first university to found an international relations department was the London School of Economics in 1924.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''use of force''' doctrine is employed by police forces, as well as soldiers on guard duty, to regulate the actions of police and guards. The aim of such a doctrine is to balance security needs with ethical concerns for the rights and well-being of intruders or suspects.

U.S. soldiers on guard duty are given a &quot;use of force briefing&quot; by the [[w:sergeant of the guard|sergeant of the guard]] before being assigned to their post.

&quot;The only difference between lawful force for police and civilians is that peace officers are not given the option of fleeing the scene to avoid confrontation.&quot; [http://web.archive.org/20011019111115/www.geocities.com/gunversation/useofforce/useofforce.htm]

Indeed, soldiers on guard duty will be severely punished for &quot;abandoning their post&quot; if they leave before being &quot;properly relieved&quot;.

A '''foreign policy''' is a set of [[Politics|political]] goals that seeks to outline how a particular country will interact with the other countries of the world.

Foreign policies generally are designed to help protect a country's national interests, national security, ideological goals, and economic prosperity. This can occur as a result of peaceful cooperation with other nations, or through aggression, war, and exploitation.

The 20th century saw a rapid rise in the importance of foreign policy, with virtually every nation in the world now being able to interact with one another in some [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] form.

Creating foreign policy is usually the job of the head of government and the foreign minister (or equivalent). However, in the United States, Congress also has considerable power and influence, and is able to pass Foreign Relations Authorization bill's.

[[Image:Schlacht-bei-waterloo.png|thumb|right|200px|Military strategy in the Waterloo campaign]]

'''Military strategy''' is a collective name for planning the conduct of warfare.  Derived from the Greek ''strategos'', strategy was seen as the &quot;art of the general&quot;.  Military strategy deals with the planning and conduct of campaigns, the movement and disposition of forces, and the deception of the enemy.  The father of modern strategic study, [[w:Carl von Clausewitz|Carl von Clausewitz]], defined military strategy as &quot;the employment of battles to gain the end of war.&quot;  Military strategy was one of a triumvirate of &quot;arts&quot; or &quot;sciences&quot; that govern the conduct of warfare; the others being '''tactics''', the execution of plans and maneuvering of forces in battle, and '''logistics''', the maintenance of an army.

== Fundamentals of military strategy ==

Strategy and tactics are closely related.  Both deal with distance, time and force but strategy is large scale while tactics are small scale.  Originally strategy was understood to govern the prelude to a battle while tactics controlled its execution.  However, in the world wars of the 20th century, the distinction between manoeuvre and battle, strategy and tactics, became blurred.  Tactics that were once the province of a company of cavalry would be applied to a panzer army.

In its purest form, strategy dealt solely with military issues.  In earlier societies, a king or political leader was often the same person as the military leader.  If he was not, the distance of communication between the political and the military leader was small.  But as the need of a professional army grew, the bounds between the politicians and the military came to be recognized.  In many cases, it was decided that there was a need for a separation.  As French statesman Georges Clemenceau said, &quot;war is too important a business to be left to soldiers.&quot;  This gave rise to the concept of the '''grand strategy''' which encompasses the management of the resources of an entire nation in the conduct of warfare.  In the environment of the grand strategy, the military component is largely reduced to '''operational strategy''' -- the planning and control of large military units such as corps and divisions.  As the size and number of the armies grew and the technology to communicate and control improved, the difference between &quot;military strategy&quot; and &quot;grand strategy&quot; shrank.

Fundamental to grand strategy is the diplomacy through which a nation might forge alliances or pressure another nation into compliance, thereby achieving victory without resorting to combat.  Another element of grand strategy is the management of the post-war peace.  As Clausewitz stated, a successful military strategy may be a means to an end, but it is not an end in itself.  There are numerous examples in history where victory on the battlefield has not translated into long term peace and security.

Strategy (and tactics) must constantly evolve in response to technological advances.  A successful strategy from one era tends to remain in favour long after new developments in military weaponry and mat&amp;eacute;riel have rendered it obsolete.  [[w:World War I]], and to a great extent the [[w:American Civil War]], saw Napoleonic tactics of &quot;offense at all costs&quot; pitted against the defensive power of the trench, machine gun and barbed wire.  As a reaction to her WWI experience, France entered [[w:World War II]] with a purely defensive doctrine, epitomised by the &quot;impregnable&quot; Maginot Line, but only to be completely avoided in the German blitzkrieg.

:''&quot;Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.&quot; '' &amp;ndash;[[w:Sun Tzu|Sun Tzu]]

==Principles of military strategy==
''Main article:'' [[w:Principles of military strategy|Principles of military strategy]]

Many military strategists have attempted to encapsulate a successful strategy in a set of principles.  Sun Tzu defined 13 principles in his ''[[Wikisource:The Art of War|The Art of War]]'' while Napoleon listed 115 maxims.  American Civil War General [[w:Nathan Bedford Forrest|Nathan Bedford Forrest]] required only one: &quot;get there first with the most&quot;.  The fundamental concepts common to most lists of principles are:

#The Objective
#Offense
#Cooperation
#Concentration (Mass)
#Economy
#Manœuvre
#Surprise
#Security
#Simplicity

Some strategists assert that adhering to the fundamental principles guarantees victory while others claim war is unpredictable and the general must be flexible in formulating a strategy.  Field Marshal Count [w:[Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke|Helmuth von Moltke]] expressed strategy as a system of &quot;ad hoc expedients&quot; by which a general must take action while under pressure.  These underlying principles of strategy have survived relatively unscathed as the technology of warfare has developed.

== Development of military strategy ==

=== Early military strategy ===

The principles of military strategy can be found as far back as 500 BC in the works of Sun Tzu and earlier in Spartan thinking.  The campaigns of [[w:Alexander the Great]], [[w:Hannibal|Hannibal]], [[w:Julius Cæsar|Julius Cæsar]] and [[w:Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan]] demonstrate strategic planning and movement.  In 1520 [[w:Niccol&amp;ograve; Machiavelli]]'s ''Dell'arte della guerra'' (Art of War) dealt with the relationship between civil and military matters and the formation of the grand strategy.  In the [[w:Thirty Years War|Thirty Years War]], [[w:Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] demonstrated advanced operational strategy that led to victories in Holy Roman Empire area.

It was not until the 18th century that military strategy was subjected to serious study.  In the Seven Years War  (1756-1763), [[w:Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] improvised a &quot;strategy of exhaustion&quot; to hold off his opponents and conserve his [[w:Prussia|Prussian]] forces.  Assailed from all sides by [[w:France|France]], [[w:Austria|Austria]], [[w:Russia|Russia]] and [[w:Sweden|Sweden]], Frederick exploited his central position which enabled him to move his army along interior lines and concentrate against one opponent at a time.  Unable to achieve victory, he was able to stave off defeat until a diplomatic solution was reached.  Frederick's &quot;victory&quot; led to great significance being placed on &quot;geometric strategy&quot; which emphasised lines of manoeuvre, awareness of terrain and possession of critical strongpoints.

=== Napoleonic strategy ===

The [[w:French Revolution|French Revolution]] and the [[w:Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic Wars]] that followed revolutionized military strategy.  The impact of this period was still to be felt in the American Civil War and the early phases of World War I.  With the advent of cheap small arms and the rise of the drafted citizen soldier, armies grew rapidly in size to become massed formations.  This necessitated dividing the army first into divisions and later into corps.  Along with divisions came divisional artillery; light-weight, mobile and with great range and firepower.  The rigid formations of pikemen and musketeers firing massed volleys gave way to light infantry fighting in skirmish lines.

[[w:Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I of France]] took advantage of these developments to pursue a brutally effective &quot;strategy of annihilation&quot; that cared little for the mathematical perfection of the geometric strategy.  Napoleon invariably sought to achieve decision in battle, with the sole aim of utterly destroying his opponent, usually achieving success through superior maneuver.  As ruler and general he dealt with the grand strategy as well as the operational strategy, making use of political and economic measures.  Napoleon was ultimately defeated when his opponents adopted the strategies that he had perfected.

Napoleon's practical strategic triumphs inspired a whole new field of study into military strategy.  The two most significant students of his work were Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian with a background in philosophy, and [[w:Antoine-Henri Jomini]], who had been one of Napoleon's staff officers.  Clausewitz's ''[[w:On War|On War]]'' has become the bible of strategy, dealing with political, as well as military, leadership.  His most famous assertion being:

:&quot;War is not merely a political act, but also a real political instrument, a continuation of policy carried out by other means.&quot;

Clausewitz dismissed &quot;geometry&quot; as a significant factor in strategy, believing instead in the Napoleonic concept of victory through battle and destruction of the opposing force, at any cost.  However, he also recognised that limited warfare could influence policy by wearing down the opposition through a &quot;strategy of attrition&quot;.

In contrast to Clausewitz, Antoine-Henri Jomini dealt mainly with operational strategy, planning &amp; intelligence, the conduct of the campaign, and &quot;generalship&quot; rather than &quot;statesmanship&quot;.  He proposed that victory could be achieved by occupying the enemy's territory rather than destroying his army.  As such, geometric considerations were prominent in his theory of strategy.  Jomini's two basic principles of strategy were to concentrate against fractions of the enemy force at a time and to strike at the most decisive objective.

One notable exception to Napoleon's ''strategy of annihilation'' and a precursor to trench warfare were the [[w:Lines of Torres Vedras|Lines of Torres Vedras]] during the [[w:Peninsular War|Peninsular campaign]]. French Armies lived off the land and when they were confronted by a line of fortifications which they could not out flank, they were unable to continue the advance and were forced to retreat once they had consumed all the provisions of the region in front of the lines.

The Peninsular campaign was notable for the development of another method of warfare which went largely unnoticed at the time, but would become far more common in the 20th century. That was the aid and encouragement the British gave to the Spanish guerrillas who forced the French to squander most of the assets of their Iberian army in protecting the army's line of communications. This was a very cost effective move for the British, because it cost far less to aid Spanish insurgents than it did to equip and pay regular British army units to engage the same number of French troops. As the British army could be correspondingly smaller it was able to supply its troops by sea and land without having to live off the land as was the norm at the time. Further, because they did not have to forage they did not antagonise the locals and so did not have to garrison their lines of communications to the same extent as the French did. So the strategy of aiding their Spanish civilian allies in their guerrilla war benefited the British in many ways, not all of which were immediately obvious.

=== Strategy in the industrial age ===

The evolution of military strategy continued in the American Civil War (1861-1865).  The practice of strategy was advanced by generals such as [[w:Robert E. Lee|Robert E. Lee]], [[w:Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[w:William T. Sherman|William T. Sherman]], all of whom had been influenced by the feats of Napoleon ([[w:Thomas J. Jackson|Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]] was said to have carried a book of Napoleon's maxims with him).  However, the adherence to the Napoleonic principles in the face of technological advances such as the long-range infantry rifle generally led to disastrous consequences.  The time and space in which war was waged changed as well.  Railroads enabled swift movement of large forces but the maneuver was constrained to narrow, vulnerable corridors.  Steam power and ironclads changed transport and combat at sea.  

There was still room for triumphs of strategy of maneuver such as Sherman's March to the Sea in 1864, but these depended upon an enemy's willingness to not entrench.  Towards the end of the war, especially in defense of static targets as in the battles of [[w:Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]] and [[w:Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], trenches between both sides grew to a World War I scale.  Many of the lessons of the American Civil War were forgotten when in wars like the [[w:Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Prussian War]] or the [[w:Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian War]], when manoeuver won the day.

In the period preceding World War I, two of the most influential strategists were the Prussian generals, [[w:Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke|Helmuth von Moltke]] and [[w:Alfred von Schlieffen|Alfred von Schlieffen]].  Under Moltke the Prussian army achieved victory in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), the latter campaign being widely regarded as a classic example of the conception and execution of military strategy.  In addition to exploiting railroads and highways for manoeuvre, Moltke harnessed the telegraph for control of large armies.  He recognised the increasing need to delegate control to subordinate commanders and to issue directives rather than specific orders.

Moltke is most remembered as a strategist for his belief in the need for flexibility and that no plan, however well prepared, can be guaranteed to survive beyond the first encounter with the enemy.

Field Marshal Schlieffen succeeded Moltke and directed German planning in the lead up to World War I. Modifying strategies priorly devised by Moltke, he advocated the &quot;strategy of annihilation&quot; but was faced by a war on two fronts against numerically superior opposition.  The strategy he formulated was the [[w:Schlieffen Plan|Schlieffen Plan]], defending in the east while concentrating for a decisive victory in the west, after which the Germans would go on to the offensive in the east.  Influenced by Hannibal's success at the [[w:Battle of Cannae|Battle of Cannae]], Schlieffen planned for a single great battle of encirclement, thereby annihilating his enemy.

Another German strategist and historian of the period was [[w:Hans Delbrück|Hans Delbrück]] who expanded on Clausewitz's concept of &quot;limited warfare&quot; to produce a theory on the &quot;strategy of exhaustion&quot;.  His theory defied popular military thinking of the time, which was strongly in favour victory in battle, yet World War I would soon demonstrate the flaws of a mindless &quot;strategy of annihilation&quot;.

At a time when industrialisation was reaping major advances in naval technology, one American strategist, [[w:Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred Thayer Mahan]], almost single-handedly brought the field of naval strategy up to date.  Influenced by Jomini's principles of strategy, he saw that in the coming wars, where economic strategy could be as important as military strategy, control of the sea granted the power to control the trade and resources needed to wage war.  Mahan pushed the concept of the &quot;big navy&quot; and an expansionist view where defence was achieved by controlling the sea approaches rather than fortifying the coast.  His theories contributed to the naval arms race between 1898 and 1914.

=== Strategy in World War I ===

At the start of [[w:World War I|World War I]] strategy was dominated by the offensive thinking that had been in vogue since 1870, despite the more recent experiences of the [[w:Second Boer War|Second Boer War]] (1899-1902) and [[w:Russo-Japanese War|Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-1905), where the machine gun demonstrated its defensive capabilities.  By the end of 1914, the Western Front was a stalemate and all ability to manoeuver strategically was lost.  The combatants resorted to a &quot;strategy of attrition&quot;.  The German battle at [[w:Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], the British on the [[w:Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme]] and at [[w:Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] were among the first widescale battles intended to wear down the enemy.  Attrition was time-consuming so the duration of World War I battles often stretched to weeks and months.  The problem with attrition was that the use of fortified defenses in depth generally required a ratio of ten attackers to one defender for any reasonable chance of victory.  The ability of the defender to move troops using interior lines prevented the possibility of breakthrough.

On other fronts, there was still room for the use of strategy of manouever.  The Germans executed a perfect battle of annihilation against the Russians at the [[w:Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg (1914)]].  Britain and France launched the disastrous [[w:Dardanelles Campaign]], combining naval power and an amphibious landing, in an effort to aid their Russian ally and knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war.  The Palestine campaign was dominated by cavalry and the British achieved two breakthrough victories at [[w:Third Battle of Gaza|Gaza]] (1917) and [[w:Battle of Megiddo|Megiddo]] (1918).  Colonel [[w:T.E. Lawrence|T.E. Lawrence]] and other British officers led Arab irregulars on a guerilla campaign against the Ottomans, using strategy and tactics developed during the Boer Wars.

World War I saw armies on a scale never before experienced.  The British, who had always relied on a strong navy and a small regular army, underwent rapid expansion that outpaced the training of generals and staff officers able to handle the strategic planning of such a mammoth force.  Technological advances also had a huge influence on strategy: aerial reconnaissance, artillery techniques, poison gas, the automobile and tank, telephone and radio telegraphy.

More so than in previous wars, military strategy in World War I was directed by the grand strategy of a coalition of nations; the Entente on one side and the Central Powers on the other.  Society and economy were mobilized for total war.  Attacks on each enemies' economies included Britain's use of a naval blockade and Germany employing submarine warfare against merchant shipping.

Unity of command became a question when the various nation states began coordinating assaults and defenses.  The Entente eventually settled under Field Marshal [[w:Foch|Foch]].  The Germans generally led the Central Powers, though German authority diminished and lines of command became confused at the end of the war.

World War I ended when the ability of the German soldiers to fight became so diminished that Germany asked for peace conditions.  The exhausted German military was defeated during the battle of Amiens (8-11 August 1918)
and the German homefront entered general revolt over a lack of food and destruction of the economy.  Victory for the Entente was, however, assured by that point.  It was only a matter of time before the tank reintroduced manouever as a viable strategy.

===Strategy Development Between World Wars===

In the years following World War I, two of the technologies that had been introduced during that conflict, the aircraft and the tank, became the subject of strategic study.

The leading theorist of air power was Italian general [[w:Giulio Douhet|Giulio Douhet]] who believed that future wars would be won or lost in the air.  The air force would carry the offensive and the role of the ground forces would be defensive only.  Douhet's doctrine of strategic bombing meant striking at the enemy's heartland -- his cities, industry and communications.  Air power would thereby reduce his willingness and capacity to fight.

British general [[w:J. F. C. Fuller|J. F. C. Fuller]], architect of the first great tank battle at [[w:Battle of Cambrai|Cambrai]], and his contemporary, [[w:B. H. Liddell Hart|B. H. Liddell Hart]], were amongst the most prominent advocates of mechanization and motorization of the army.  They saw that the armoured fighting vehicle demonstrated firepower, mobility and protection.  It would negate the static defences of the trench and machine gun and restore the strategic principles of manoeuvre and offense.

The innovative German General Heinz Guderian further developed Fuller's and Liddell Hart's ideas to create the groundbreaking blitzkrieg tactics that were used by Germany against Poland in 1939 and later against France in 1940. France, still used to stationary World War I strategies, was completely surprised and summarily overwhelmed by Guderian's Panzer Corps.

Technological change has had both an enormous effect on strategy, and little effect on leadership.  The use of telegraph and later radio, along with improved transport, has enabled the rapid movement of large numbers of men.  However, the amount of men that one officer can effectively control has, if anything, declined.  The increases in the size of the armies has led to an increase in the number of officers.

===Strategy in World War II===
During the World War II, led by British intelligence forces, the allied forces developed and deployed sophisticated ruses, strategic deception, designed to mislead Axis planners resulting in ineffective actions.

[[w:Churchill|Churchill]], [[w:Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[w:Stalin|Stalin]] and other heads of state met at several [[w:List of World War II conferences|conferences]] to prioritize strategies such as [[w:Europe first|Europe first]].

===Cold War Strategy===

The Cold War was the first time period dominated by the threat of total world annihilation through the use of nuclear weapons, a policy known as [[w:mutual assured destruction|mutual assured destruction (MAD)]].  As a consequence it was also a war in which attacks were not exchanged between the two main rivals, the [[w:United States|United States]] and the [[w:Soviet Union|Soviet Union]].  Instead, the war was fought through proxies.  The battle-grounds were everywhere the superpowers weren't.  Instead of mainly being confined to Europe or the Pacific, the entire world was the battlefield, with countries rather than armies acting as main players.  The only constant rule was that troops of the Soviet Union and the United States could not overtly fight with each other.

The difference between tactics, strategy and grand strategy began to melt during the Cold War as command and communication technologies improved to a greater extent, in first world armed forces.  The third world armed forces controlled by the two superpowers found that grand strategy, strategy and tactics, if anything, moved further apart as the command of the armies fell under the control of super power leaders.

American cold warriors like [[w:Dean Acheson|Dean Acheson]] and [[w:George Marshall|George C. Marshall]] quickly recognized that the key to victory was the economic defeat of the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union had adopted a defensive posture following the end of World War II, with the United States and its strong navy quickly finding that it had to aggressively defend much of the world from the Soviet Union and the spread of Communism.  It was one of many seeming contradictions in the logic of strategy.

[[w:Nuclear strategy|Strategies]] during the Cold War also dealt with nuclear attack and retaliation.  The United States maintained a policy of [[w:limited first strike|limited first strike]] throughout the Cold War.  In the event of a Soviet attack on the Western Front, resulting in a breakthrough, the United States would use tactical nuclear weapons to stop the attack.  The Soviet Union responded by adopting a policy of [[w:no first use|no first use]], involving massive retaliation resulting in mutual assured destruction.  So, if the [[w:|Warsaw Pact]] attacked using conventional weapons, [[w:NATO|NATO]] would use tactical nukes.  The Soviet Union would respond with an all out nuclear attack, resulting in a similar attack from the United States, with all the consequences the exchange would entail.  This did not happen.  The United States continues to maintain a policy of limited first strike to the present (June 2004).

===Post Cold War Strategy===

Strategy in the post Cold War has come to be defined by the [[w:superpower|hyperpower]] status of the United States

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motivation and Goals==
Ask yourself: '''Why do I want to study Cantonese and what is my eventual goal?'''  Choosing the best method of study will depend a lot on these answers.  It will also give you a better idea on how to measure your personal successes.  Language learning needs a lot of self-encouragement!

Here are some common reasons for studying Cantonese:
*Communicate with friends or family
*Work in Hong Kong, Macau, southeast China, or in other Chinese speaking communities
*Learn a language that is considerably different from English
*Be able to better appreciate Cantonese culture and art, like [[w:Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese cuisine]], [[w:Cantonese opera|Cantonese opera]], [[w:Cantopop|Cantopop]], etc.
*Learn a language that has few foreign learners and is less-commonly taught
*Study ancient (during [[w:Tang Dynasty|Tang Dynasty]]) Chinese poem 
*...

'''Note to Hong Kong tourists:''' If you are going to Hong Kong for a short vacation, you should realize that most people can speak some English and you do not have to know Cantonese to get by.  This isn't to say there is no reason to study some Cantonese before going.  Actually, if you want to have the opportunity to really enjoy the Cantonese cuisine, get off the beaten tourist tracks, or just learn more about the culture, then learning some Cantonese could be very beneficial.  In such a case though, a book like [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0864426453/qid=1116944375/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-0475329-2411030?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846 Lonely Planet's Cantonese Phrasebook] might be sufficient.

==Means of study==
===Informal study===
A lot of people like to self-study a language as a hobby or create language clubs.  If your interest in Cantonese is more than just passing, you should definitely consider finding a Cantonese-speaking person to supplement your studies.  Try searching [http://www.meetup.com Meetup] or visiting your local Chinatown for more resources.  If this truly isn't feasible, then plan on gathering a lot of sound recordings and work extra hard on your listening/speaking.
A good Cantonese book for self-study is [http://www.amyleunglanguage.com.hk 'No sweat Cantonese'] by Amy Leung. It is commercially available in Hong Kong and it comes with an audio CD for pronunciation.

===Formal training===
If you are truly serious about becoming fluent in Cantonese then you need to study more than just this book.  You would best off taking a formal course.  Brigham Young University maintains a [http://asiane.byu.edu/cla/CantProg.html list of programs] around the world that teach Cantonese. The ideal choice for many people would be the courses in Hong Kong, although it is a bit expensive.

==Suggestions on using this book==
*Study the pronunciation pre-lessons very well before you begin the regular lessons.  A good foundation will make everything go smoother.
*Each lesson will probably take at least two or three sessions to review well.
*Studying the book too closely will get tedious after a while.  Bring creative ways of learning into your routine by watching a Cantonese movie or listen to music.  Afterwards, take a clip of the movie or song and try to listen for words you know or imitate the words/sentences you hear.
*Work with a language partner on the exercises

==Method for studying dialogues==
This method or one similar is often taught by foreign language teachers and many learners have found it to be successful.  However, if you find it demanding or not suitable to your learning style you should adjust it accordingly.  The main point is to use your listening skills and inductive reasoning ability as much as possible.

#At the beginning of each lesson, read the short English summary of the conversation.  '''Do not''' look any farther in the book. 
#Listen to the dialogue one or two times (sounds files are coming!) to get a feel for the conversation.  '''Do not''' look at the book, just listen!  
#Then listen to vocabulary list, again '''do not''' look at the book!  Listen to each word and repeat it.  Make a guess at the romanization and try even writing it down as you go through the list.  In the first couple lessons, you might want to hold off on writing until you get a better feel for the romanization system.  But as you progress, practice writing the complete Yale romanization '''with''' tones each time you listen to the vocabulary list.  Tones obviously will be extremely difficult to get right in the beginning.  Focus first on getting the correct segments and the tones will come gradually.  Of course, you will have to listen more once!  Don't worry about meanings, just focus on the sounds.
#After you feel you have put forth your best effort, double check your romanizations with the book and start associating the English meanings with the sounds.  Pay careful attention to any of your romanization mistakes and listen to the file again until you feel you can recognize the correct sound.
#Now listen to the conversation, but still '''do not''' look at the book (not the Cantonese transcription nor the English translation)!  You know all the vocabulary in the conversation now and you should be able to pick up a few words (maybe even most of them).  When you have gotten past the first couple lessons, aim to listen to the dialogue recordings enough times so that you can guess the general meanings of what each person said before you check the book.
#Look at the Cantonese transcription and listen again.  Make a mental note of which words you picked up yourself in the previous listenings.  Pay attention to the difficult spots that you couldn't understand.  Refer to the transcription and listen again to see if you can pick out the words now.  By now, you probably know the gist of the conversation even though you haven't looked at the English translation yet!  You may be surprised to realize this skill of listening and reasonable guessing is critical for advancement in the language learning.  Route memorization and &quot;cheating&quot; by looking at the English translations at first will constantly hold you back.  Furthermore, it's important that you learn how to feel comfortable with this process now because as you reach intermediate and advanced levels you will depend on these skills even more.
#Finally, you can look at the English translation.  You should just check that your understanding is factually accurate.  Do not dwell on translation details.  For example, Cantonese doesn't distinguish past or present tense so there is no point in trying to understand why a particular verb in the translation is past tense.  Translations are to be taken as a rough guide.  Detailed understanding of the grammar will come through the grammar notes and more exposure to the language.  The real key to learning a language is recognizing the patterns within the language itself.

__NOTOC__
These are recipes for people with little time to cook, especially for the evening meal.  They may also be appropriate for people with little experience in cooking.  

Generally, they can be made in less than 15 minutes to prepare the ingredients and less than 1 hour start-to-finish.  Most require additional side dishes to make a complete meal.

While, in the Cookbook, there are many recipes meet these requirements, this page is intended to show some of the better recipes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- This page was changed because the previous entry had nothing to do with the triangle inequality. --&gt;
==The Triangle Inequality==

'''The Triangle Inequality''' states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side of the triangle.

For instance, if you have a triangle with sides of length A, B and C.  Then you know that
* A + B &gt; C
* A + C &gt; B
* C + B &gt; A

In Euclidean Geometry, it is impossible to draw a triangle that violates the Triangle Inequality.

===Using the Triangle Inequality===

The Triangle Inequality can be used to find the length of a side of a triangle.  For instance, say you have a triangle with sides labeled A, B and C.  If you know that A = 7, and B = 5 then you can figure out the approximate value of C as follows:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Statement&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reason&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7 + 5 &gt; C&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Triangle Inequality&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12 &gt; C&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definition of Addition&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;C &lt; 12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definition of Less Than&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

So we know that the third side of our triangle is less than 12, but that doesn't help us very much.  It turns out that the triangle Inequality can help us again.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Statement&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reason&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;C + 5 &gt; 7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Triangle Inequality&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;C &gt; 7 - 5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definition of Subtraction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;C &gt; 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Definition of Subtraction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In this situation, there is a range of values that C could take.  C has to be more than 2, and less than 12.  2 &lt; C &lt; 12.  

So it turns out that the measure of the third side of any triangle falls in between the Sum and Differences of the other two sides.  Example: If two sides are 9 and 6, then the remaining side's measure would be between 15 (the sum of 9 and 6) and 3 (the difference of 9 and 6).  This would result in the following inequality:  3 &lt; c &lt; 15.

There are many triangles that could fit our givens.

==Exercises==

1) Try to draw a triangle that violates the Triangle Inequality.

2) For each of the following sets of A, B and C, indicate whether the 3 lengths could be the sides of a triangle or not.
* A = 3, B = 4, C = 5
* A = 3, B = 8, C = 5
* A = 14, B = 5, C = 8
* A = 5, B = 5, C = 5

3) Given that you have a triangle with sides of length 12 and 2, write a proof showing what range of values the third side could take.  Use a two-column format as shown above.

== Triangle Inequality Theorem ==
In any triangle, the longest side is opposite of the largest angle, the middle sized side is opposite the middle measured angle, and the shortest side is opposite the smallest angle.

Example Problem
In triangle ABC, if angle A is 100 degrees and angle B is 35 degrees and angle C is 45 degrees, what are lengths of sides from longest to shortest?

Answer:
        Since side BC is opposite the largest angle, it is the largest side.
        Since side AB is opposite the middle sized angle, it is the middle sized side.
        Since side AC is opposite the smallest angle, so it is the smallest side.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;big&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Subscript text&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Triangle Inequality In Two Triangles: The Hinge Theorem or SAS Inequality Theorem ==
If two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of a second triangle, and the angle between these sides of the first triangle is greater than the angle between these side of the second, then the third side of the first triangle is greater than the third side of the second triangle.

         Example: If triangles ABC and DEF have sides AB = DE and 
         AC = DF and m&lt;A = 80 degrees and m&lt;D = 70 then BC &gt; EF.

==Triangle Inequality In Two Triangles: The Converse of Hinge Theorem or SSS Inequality Theorem ==
If two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of a second triangle, and the side between these angles of the first triangle is greater than the side between these angle of the second, then the third angle of the first triangle is greater than the third angle of the second triangle.
 
       Example: If triangles ABC and DEF have the sides 
         AB = DE BC = EF and AC &gt; DF then, angleB &gt; angleE.

'''This page refers to the popular 7400 series IC'''

The 7400 series is a popular set of logic ICs that can be ordered from many vendors, and used in many applications. 7400 chips are generally 14-pin or 16-pin DIP packages, although other form factors are available as well. 

The power supply required is +5V. For most of the 7400 chips, pin 7 is the ground (GND) connection and pin 14 is the +5V power supply. There are exceptions like the 7490. 2.0V or higher signifies a logical &quot;1&quot;; 0.8V or lower signifies a logical &quot;0&quot;. 

{{wikipedia| logic family}}
Each chip has its name printed on top (for example, &quot;74HC132&quot;), describing its logic family and digital logic functionality.

== OR Gates, 7432 ==
4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is high only when either one, or both, of the input pins are high.

== NOR Gates, 7402 ==
[[File:7402_Quad_2-input_NOR_Gates.PNG|thumb|right|150px]]
4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is low only when either one, or both, of the input pins are high.

== XOR Gates, 7486 ==
4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is low when both input pins are equal (both high or both low), and it is high when one of the input pins is high and at the same time the other input pin is low.  This is called the &quot;odd but not even gate&quot; meaning that an odd number of inputs need to be high in order for the output to be high.  The XNOR gate is just the opposite; called the &quot;even but not odd gate&quot;.

== AND Gates, 7408 ==
4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is high only when all input pins are high at the same time.

== Other AND Gates ==

7411 has 3 AND gates, each with 3 inputs and 1 output.
7421 has 2 AND gates, each with 4 inputs and 1 output.

== NAND Gates, 7400, 74132 ==

4 gates on this package, each with 2 input pins, 1 output pin. The output pin is low only when all input pins are high at the same time.

== Other NAND Gates ==

7410 has 3 NAND gates, each with 3 inputs and 1 output.
7420 has 2 NAND gates, each with 4 inputs and 1 output.
7430 has 1 NAND gate, with 8 input pins, and 1 output pin.

== Flip Flops ==

7474 has 2 JK flip flops.  Pin 4 is the 5V power pin; pin 11 is GND.

== Design ==

When designing new digital circuits, we may sketch dozens of slightly different kinds of [[Digital Circuits/Gates | gates]] -- different numbers of inputs, etc.
Just about every kind of gate you can imaging has been manufactured somewhere.
However, when it comes time to actually construct a circuit, we typically use only a few kinds of &quot;common&quot; chips rather than every possible chip.
The Apollo Guidance Computer is an example of an entire computer out of only one kind of gate.

If our sketch includes a 4-input AND gate, you might think we would simply grab a 7421 off the shelf and wire it up.
Ha! I haven't seen an actual 7421 chip in over a decade.
It is far more likely that we will do one of:
* draw it in a schematic capture application with a &quot;7421&quot; from a &quot;7400 library&quot;, then download the design into a FPGA.
* implement it using some other more common [[Digital Circuits/Common Integrated Circuits]], using [[Digital_Circuits/Logic_Operations#Boolean_Algebra | Boolean algebra]] -- then grab *that* chip off the shelf and wire it up.
* translate it into [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6/Boolean Expressions|Boolean expression]]&lt;!-- is there a better page this should link to? --&gt;, then run it on a microprocessor.

Currently the most useful physical gates are:
* 74AC132 -- 4 Schmitt 2-input NAND gates
* [[Digital Circuits/Multiplexers-Demultiplexers | multiplexers]]
** 74AC153 dual 4:1 mux chip -- can be wired as any logic gate with up to 3 inputs, including XOR.
** 74AC157 quad 2:1 mux chip
* 74AC595 SIPO shift register
* 74AC165 PISO shift register
* ...
* ... ''(that other chip I'm forgetting)'' ...
* ... ''(any other extremely useful chip that can't be easily replaced by a couple of the above chips?)'' ...

Very wide gates (say, a 16-input NOR gate) are typically implemented as a handful of less complicated gates in a &quot;tree&quot; or &quot;funnel&quot;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A main argument of realist theory is that states (or nations) are always engaged in a struggle for power. One of the earliest books to espouse Realist theory is Machiavelli's ''The Prince'', which was written for the de Medici family as a guide to uniting Italy. A later, more comprehensive book that helped build the foundation of Realist theory was &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot;, by Hans J. Morgenthau.

Realist theory advocates the use of power to fulfill the interest of a nation. &quot;National power&quot; is composed of geography, economy and natural resources, population, military strength and preparedness, national character and moral, and the competency of the national government. 

The influence of geography can be broken down into the separation of nations and the size of nations. Nations can be separated by deserts, mountains, rivers, and, most notably, oceans. Deserts prevented Egypt, Greece, and Rome from establishing contact with the parts of Africa south of the Sahara and prevented the Aztecs from contacting Indians in the modern United States. Though they rarely destroy a powerful army, deserts often wear the army down and help its eventual destruction. The power of mountains is illustrated by the Alps, which prevented Rome from effectively controlling modern-day France and Germany. The power of water is twofold; military power and trade/economic power. It is no accident that the two most recent superpowers, Britain and the United States, are isolated from rivals by oceans. Armies can only cross water when it is bridged; rivers can be bridged, oceans cannot. Thus, both Britain and the US have been protected from foreign armies by water, and need only to maintain a navy to ensure that enemy troops cannot be transported by boat. 

Water also provides fast, easy, cheap, and large-scale transportation. It is no accident that the two most economically powerful cities in the world, New York and Hong Kong, are on river deltas. Not only does this transportation benefit industry, but it can also allow troops to be moved in large numbers (and they will not be tired when their journey is over), but it also allows a nation to watch over its interest with a navy, as both Britain and the US have done. 
The size of a nation works much like natural barriers. However, rather than an army being unable to cross a certain barrier, a large nation may have too much land for the army to cross. Russia used this advantage when it was invaded by Napoleon and Hitler, and had success when wearing the enemy down, rather than facing it head-on (wearing the enemy down is usually termed attrition). A large landmass also gives a nation better chance of having ample natural resources. This is not to say that small nations are weak, it is often the opposite. Though Britain has depended on food imports for well over 100 years, it upheld considerable power until the end of WWII, and the Netherlands have been, and still are, a notable economic power. Further, the Papal States is arguably the most influential nation, per capita, on Earth, though its military power is subject to much speculation. 


It is the economy of a nation that supports the creation of a military. A modern economy can build modern equipment for a military, while a large economy can build massive amounts of equipment and supply more troops. 

There are 3 ways in which economies are used in national competition: military Vs. economy, sustainable military Vs. overstretched military, and economy Vs. economy.

The first situation is when nation A uses its military to attack the economy of nation B. Examples of this are naval blockades (which prevent trade) and the destruction or capture of cities or vital infrastructure. These tactics were used notably in WWII with varying success. In order to conduct a successful naval blockade, there are three things to analyze: the strength of your navy compared to the enemy navy, the enemy's dependence on imports by sea (and if those imports can be redirected to a land route), and the potential reactions of those who will no longer be able to trade with the blockaded. The first aspect is illustrated in the mutual blockades of Britain and Germany during both World Wars. Britain had the more powerful navy, and though German U-boats made Britain pay dearly for its supplies, the more powerful navy eventually won the rivaling embargos. The second consideration is illustrated in Napoleon's embargo on Britain. Though Britain did suffer from the embargo, it did not depend on mainland Europe for supplies, and was able to survive with the help of its colonies. The third aspect is exemplified by the German attack on the Lusitania, which pushed America to enter WWI and helped tip the scales in favor of Britain and France. 

The second possibility, sustainable military Vs. overstretched military, is not a conflict of the militaries themselves, but rather a struggle of two nations to sustain their respectful militaries. In this case, the overstretched (or oversized) military, like those of napoleon and Hitler when invading Russia, eventually crumbled because the militaries could not be maintained by the nation. Additionally, much of the Cold War falls into this category. 

Finally, economy vs. economy competitions are seen in international trade, tariffs, and embargos. If nation A wants to destroy a certain part of nation B's economy, nation A can flood nation B with products at an extremely low price, and eventually destroy the companies in nation B which cannot compete with nation A's far cheaper products. The effects of such an action are twofold; nation B depends on nation A for that product, and nation A can raise prices as competition has vanished; also, nation B is deprived of a product that may be important to the nation's security, and thus is weaker if nation A and nation B go to war. Protective tariffs are designed to prevent actions such as this. Protective tariffs are an extra tax on certain, or all, products, thus preventing nation A from flooding nation B's economy, as nation A's products are no longer cheaper, as they have to pay the extra tax. Additionally, protective taxes can be used to help build a new or small industry, not just protect one that is at risk. Not all tariffs are protective, many are used only to raise revenues for national governments, but all tariffs have financial and protective effects. Finally, embargos are very similar to blockades, but the embargoing nation threatens to impose trade restriction on those who trade with the embargoed, rather than use military force. This method is not as effective as blockades – there is nothing to prevent nations that are already embargoed from trading with each other – but it is useful for compelling a nation to follow the wishes of the embargoing, and can also be used as a predecessor to blockades if a war is to break out.

== System monitoring overview ==


=== What is system monitoring? ===
Computer monitoring systems are used to repeatedly gather data from various monitored systems for the purpose of real-time incident notification, system health verification, performance analysis, and longitudinal capacity planning. Various metrics are typically gathered by these systems, including CPU, memory, network, or disk utilization, response time of network services, occurrence of anomalous messages in system log, et al. Without such a tool, like big brother or Xymon, a system administrator would have to login to each machines to collect these information repeatedly. This kind of repetitive task can be automated using a system monitoring tool.

Please see the chapter ''[[../Other Docs/About System Monitoring/]]'' for a more details overview of monitoring systems.

* ''Repository model'' describes the relationship between various copies of the source code repository. In a client-server model, users access a master repository via a client; typically, their local machines hold only a working copy of a project tree. Changes in one working copy must be committed to the master repository before they are propagated to other users. In a distributed model, repositories act as peers, and users typically have a local repository with version history available, in addition to their working copies.
* ''Concurrency model'' describes how changes to the working copy are managed to prevent simultaneous edits from causing nonsensical data in the repository. In a ''lock'' model, changes are disallowed until the user requests and receives an exclusive lock on the file from the master repository. In a ''merge'' model, users may freely edit files, but are informed of possible conflicts upon checking their changes into the repository, whereupon the version control system may merge changes on both sides, or let the user decide when conflicts arise. Note that distributed version control almost always implies a merge concurrency model.

=== Hobbit Renamed to Xymon ===
This note needs a date...
&lt;pre&gt;
Greetings!

As I wrote some time ago, I was contacted by the owners of the 
&quot;Hobbit&quot; trademark back in June.

Several names have been suggested by you on the mailing list
(see ), but
the decision has now been made.

As of today, the official name is &quot;Xymon&quot; (pronounced just
like &quot;Simon&quot;).

At the moment this renaming has not caused much of a change,
but it will be implemented over the coming weeks.

* The Sourceforge project URL remains at 
   due to project renamings
  currently being suspended on Sourceforge. Once the suspension
  is lifted, however, there is a queued request to rename the
  project. It will then be available at

* The mailing list address remains &quot;&quot; for the
  moment. A new &quot;Xymon&quot; mailing list will be setup, but 
  this will be announced separately.

* The demo website  is active. The old
  address -  - will remain in place for
  some time, but no longer than August 2009.

* Changes to documentation, code, webpages inside the
  Hobbit monitor etc. will be happening over the next couple
  of weeks, and will be fully implemented in the upcoming
  release.


Best regards,
Henrik
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Development Road Map ==
=== Henrik, Feb 9 2009 ===
On February 9, Henrik posted the following roadmap to the list.  I 
haven't heard much lately so I don't know if it has changed.

Version 4.4:
* SNMP support for data collection
* Status updates based on data collected in the RRD files (this is really nice - essentially, *any* value you put into an RRD file can trigger a new or modified status in Xymon. So you could eg. change the status of your &quot;http&quot; test to go red, if the response time of a webpage exceeds 5 seconds).
* Status &quot;flap&quot; handling, to catch statuses that change rapidly.

Version 4.5:
* Support for communication between clients and Xymon to use compression and/or encryption.
* Support for client authentication via SSL certificates (so you cannot spoof a client message).

Version 4.6:
* Revised web interface - eliminate the need for webserver-based authentication, and provide more fine-grained authorization for the various Xymon components.
* Per-user custom login pages, so the login will always show those systems that the user has responsibility for / is allowed to access.

Somewhere along the road I will also introduce a new &quot;ping&quot; test
daemon - I am getting to the point where ping'ing all hosts take 
longer than 5 minutes (I have a lot of hosts). So something needs
to be done, and I think I know how to do it.

=== Changes ===


=== Todos ===
 Tasks that most team member agree to implement.

=== Design Document ===
[[Hobbit Design Document]]

=== Wish Lists ===
* Test Suite for software quality assurance.
* Migrate all the bb modules from deadcat.net to hobbit.
* SLA Report built in.
* Better Theme support.
* Provide encrypted communication pipe between hobbit server and hobbit client.
* hobbit messages compression.
* ipv6
* 4.2.x maintenance release.
* Rewrite of the alerts module to work properly. ;) It's quite flawed at the moment.

== Autoconfiscate Hobbit ==
This section describe the conversion of hobbit source tree into autotool control.
=== Why the autoconfiscation ? ===
* To be more portable across OS platforms.
* Plan for I18n and L10n.
* To become true GNU software which require use of autotool.

=== Learn autotool ===
* [http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html the autotools tutorial] and read the [http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/dl/autotools.pdf pdf slides].
* hand on testing on hello world example.
* [http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/ example of using autoscan].

=== Convert hobbit source tree ===
* make sure your autotool sets has following version.
&lt;pre&gt;
GNU Autoconf 2.61 (November 2006)
GNU Automake 1.10 (October 2006)
GNU Libtool 1.5.24 (June 2007)
GNU Gettext 0.17 (November 2007)
&lt;/pre&gt;
* download the [http://www.hswn.dk/beta/hobbit-snapshot.tar.gz latest hobbit source tar ball].
* run autoscan to get configure.scan and then modify it as configure.ac.
* convert lib/Makefile demotool/Makefile ... etc into Makfile.am.
* Fine tune configure.ac to take configuration options as configure options.
* Support Linux and Solaris OS setting in configure.ac.

=== References ===
* [http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html Great Autotool tutorials and links started here]
* [http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/ Another tutorial]
* [http://vindaci.members.sonic.net/cbreak/projects/autotools/ Autotool for Beginners]

== Xymon Documentation ==
#Current
## Henrik Stroner use troff to generate manual pages so that we have the RTFM type of documentation.
## Also troff2html is used to create html page for web browser viewing.
#Enhancements Proposals.
## Use latex+dia+make+wiki to create publishing grade docs
## Use Table of Conetent, index, references and Figures to describe Xymon related topic.
## Generate Xymon User Guide.
## Generate Xymon Developer Guide
## Generate Xymon System Admin Guide.
## Generate Xymon Slide for presentation purpose.
## Use Wiki documentation content incubation.
## Generate html.RTF and pdf for different purpose.
# Request Development Team to use doxygen syntax for source code documentation.


=== MediaWiki to DocBook ===
* use mvc to gain hobbit wiki source
* convert mediawiki source to latex.

=== Man pages ===

=== Reuse content from existing hobbit documentation source ===
*  http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/manpages/

== Xymon test suite ==
Run through test cases to verify the code changes are ok.

=== Performance test scripts ===
=== Quality assurance test scripts ===
==== shell scripts ====
* test script in build directory of hobbit-4.0.3 to make sure depended software are in build machine.
&lt;pre&gt;    
build/perl.sh
build/fping.sh             
build/rrd.sh   
build/ssl.sh
build/ldap.sh          
build/pcre.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Test script by Perl ===

=== Test script by Python ===
=== Test script by DejaGNU ===

=== Dtrace probes in hobbit server ===
[http://blogs.sun.com/barts/entry/putting_user_defined_dtrace_probe An example of putting dtrace probe int an application].

== Packaging ==
=== Hobbit Client for OpenSolaris IPS format ===

* Features of This hobbit client
** This hobbit client will use a local account and group to avoid NIS and NFS dependency.
** It will use SMF to start/top hobbit client.
** It will use sudo or Solaris 10's ACL to achieve reading restricted information off OpenSolaris.
** hobbit-client-serverconf is simple version of hobbit client without local messages processing.
** hobbit-client-local will do some processing filtering, it need more depended software.
** it use /opt/hobbitclient42 as installation path.
** svcadm disable/enable network:/hobbit-client-serverconf

=== Using CPAM tools to automate package building ===

== How to participate the hobbit development ==
* subscribe to hobbit mailing list
* create an account on en.wikibooks.org to participate in hobbit documentation effort.
* learn from http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/CPAM_with_TWW to participate in hobbit automated cross-platform software packaging effort.
=== Setup your development environment ===

==== On OpenSolaris x86 ====
===== Using prebuilt OpenSoalris VMWare Image =====
* Download OpenSolaris VMWare Image from here(TBA).
* Install VMWare player 3.0 from here(TBA).
===== Using VirtualBox OpenSolaris Image =====
==== On Solaris 10 Intel ====
* host info
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00# which cvs
/opt/csw/bin/cvs
bash-3.00# uname -a
SunOS unknown 5.10 Generic i86pc i386 i86pc
bash-3.00# which gcc
/opt/csw/gcc3/bin/gcc
bash-3.00# which gmake
/opt/csw/bin/gmake
bash-3.00#
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== On RedHat Linux ====
==== Setup your TWW developement ====
* download TWW tools onto your system
* compile hobbit*.[sb|pb].

=== checkout source code from sourceforge.net  ===
=== Read the source codes  ===
=== Feedback to Hobbit ===
* include your fix,patch, modules addition to sourceforge.net

== Hobbit Functional diagrams ==
=== Hobbit server ===
&lt;pre&gt;

So the core design looks like this:


   Network tests --\
                    \
            TCP:1984 \           IPC
   Clients ----------&gt; hobbitd --------&gt; hobbitd_channel ---&gt; worker module
                     /         Sh. mem.                 stdin
                    /
   Custom tests ---/


     
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Windows Hobbit client  ===

[http://bbwin.sourceforge.net/ BB Win]

== Hobbit Modules Development ==
== Developing Hobbit by Existing Internet Development Environment ==
=== Custom Monitoring Scripts for Hobbit ===

[[System Monitoring with Hobbit/HOWTO/Custom Monitoring Scripts for Hobbit]]
http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/hobbit-tips.html#scripts

== Developing Hobbit by CPAM/TWW Development Environment ==
=== Why use CPAM/TWW tool ? ===
* Pros
** Hobbit server and client need to be cross-platform thus the need of CPAM/TWW.
** Like Emacs editor, it can will be run everywhere without license. TWW tools is GPL opensource so it can be ported to any OS.
** A structural and automated approach to deal with packages creation and management.
* Cons
** Another learning curve need to climb.
** Changing people's development habit is hard.

=== Supported OS ===
* Solaris Sparc
* RH AS 3.0
* HP-UX 11.11
== Hobbit package sources ==
=== Hobbit client on MS windows Overview ===
# bbwin (Xymon client) is implemented in c++. It requires opensource software like boost c++ libary and tinyXML. 
# The packaging tool it used is Microsoft's opensource packaging tool - [http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/ WiX]to do the Win32 packaging.
# The detals building instruction is [http://bbwin.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bbwin/trunk/Build.txt?revision=21&amp;view=markup build.txt] on bbwin project site. 
# You have two ways to build BBWin.msi, 
## Use Microsoft's make: nmake
## Use &quot;Build Soultion&quot; in VS2008.

Following is a procedure to create a Windows XP development box so you can create your own  BBWin.msi.

== Prepare your Xymon win32  build environment ==
# Install [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms669985 hhc.exe],it is used to compile html doc into windows chm help file.
## add &quot;C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop&quot; into PATH so hhc.exe is accessible.
# Install Visual Studio 2008 Standard or Professional Edition.
# Make sure your cmd.exe has following PATH name addition. echo %PATH% %INCLUDE% %LIB% in your DOS prompt.
## PATH
## &quot;LIB=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib\.;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\LIB;&quot;
## INCLUDE
 &lt;pre&gt;
 INCLUDE=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include\.;
 C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include\atl;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include
 &lt;/pre&gt;

Remeber to install all options (include 64 bit and 32 bit) to avoid &quot;atlthunk.lib not found&quot; issue.

#[http://wix.sourceforge.net/releases/ WiX opensource packaging tool from Microsoft]: this is use to turn the compiled binary into MS MSI package format.
# [http://www.boost.org/ Boost C++ library]:These powerful C++ libraries are used for some agents and will be certainly used in the BBWin core service in the future. 
##  [http://www.boostpro.com/download/ Download the pre-compiled 1.35 one for VS2008] and install it under C:\boost directory.
# [http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/ TinyXML]: BBWin used the excellent TinyXML library for the configuration loading XML. You do not need to download and install it. TinyXML sources are included in BBWin sources.
# Prepare your source code editors:
## [http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net notepade++]:
## [http://www.xemacs.org/Download/win32/ XEmacs for win32]:

# checkout bbwin src.
## Using command &quot;svn co https://bbwin.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bbwin bbwin&quot;
# Change the Makefile code for C:\boost installation.
## Modify Makefile to point INCLUDE to C:\boost and LIB to include C:\boost\lib\*.lib
## Modify C/C++ iclude c:\boost and Linker to include c:\boost\lib\*.
# Optional software installation
## install cygwin to have a strong unix enviroment on your windows box. So you can run command like following to clean up *.obj file that current makefile can't do.
## Clean up Release directory by Deleting Setup/*.msi
&lt;pre&gt;
$ rm Setup/*
$ rm Release/*
&lt;/pre&gt;
==== Build the bbwin using command line approach ====
BBWin.msi creation process is automated in &quot;C:\BBWin\trunk\Setup\Makefile&quot;.
This makefile will be called from &quot;C:\BBWin\trunk\Makefile&quot;
* Make sure your nmake command is avaiable.

Build file for BBWin
    2 ==============================================================
    3 
    4 This file explains you how to build BBWin from the sources.
    5 
    6 
    7 Getting the last sources 
    8 ========================
    9 
   10 BBWin is developped in C++ (the Standard Template Library and the Standard C++ Library
   11 are used)
   12 The source of BBWin are available from the sourceforge subversion
   13 repository for the BBWin projects :
   14 http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/bbwin/
   15 
   16 
   17 Install the tools
   18 =================
   19 
   20 BBWin has been developped thanks to many tools. You should install them to 
   21 build BBWin easily without troubles.
   22 
   23 Windows Platform SDK 2003 : it is used for the development environment.
   24 It is use to have the complete sdk to develop programs on Microsoft OS.
   25 You can download it for free from microsoft website :
   26 http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&amp;displaylang=en
   27 You will need 1 gb of free space if you install every thing :)

   28 BBWin Makefiles are using the nmake tool and Makefile templates from the SDK.
   29 This SDK is very important for anyone who would like to start developping under Windows.
   30 
   31 Visual C++ Toolkit : it is the compiler used to build the bbwin release
   32 It is the original compiler from Visual Studio 2003 Professional (Code optimisation is included)
   33 You can download it for free from the Microsoft website :
   34 http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/

   36 Wix Toolkit : this package is used to build the BBWin MSI installer
   37 You should install it and have the bin directory in your current path
   38 http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/
   39 
   40 TinyXML : BBWin used the excellent TinyXML library for the configuration loading XML.
   41 You do not need to install it. TinyXML sources are included in BBWin sources.
   42 
   43 Boost Lib : These powerful C++ libraries are used for some agents and will be
   44 certainly used in the BBWin core service in the future.
   45 You should get the boost C++ from the website : 
   46 http://www.boost.org/
   47 Build it in the directory C:\boost so you won't have to change BBWin Makefiles.
   48 If you want to build BBWin with Visual C++ Express 2005, please read the following page :
   49 http://www.boost.org/tools/build/v1/vc-8_0-tools.html
   50 
   51 
   52 I recommand you the Notepad++ editor if you are looking for a nice free code editor.
   53 You can download it from : 
   54 http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net

   58 Building the BBWin with Visual C++ Express 2005
   59 ===============================================
   60 
   61 Open the BBWin.sln file at the top directory of the project
   62 First, you should prepare your Visual C++ configuration by adding
   63 in the default bin, include and lib directories the different directories from :
   64 
   65 - the platform SDK
   66 - the boost libraries
   67 
   68 Then just build the solution.
   69 
   70 
   71 Building the BBWin with Visual C++ ToolKit 2003
   72 ===============================================
   73 
   74 Open a Platform SDK Build command line environment (installed with the Platform SDK)
   75 Go the top directory of the BBWin source tree
   76 Type nmake
   77 Go get a cup of coffee
   78 It's ready !
   79 
   80 If you get errors, it may be due to some errors in your include or lib path.
   81 Make sure the environment variables %Lib%; %Path% and %Include% are correctly 
   82 configured. You may need to add some directories.
   83 
   84 Building process order
   85 ======================
   86 
   87 1) BBWin core service
   88 2) Agents
   89 3) Externals (needing compilation)
   90 4) Setup MSI
   91 
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Package build automation  ==

=== The Makefile to automate the whole process ===

== Create a firefox search engine plugin for hobbit server ==
* References: http://mycroft.mozdev.org/deepdocs/deepdocs.html

== Using relational DBs with Xymon Server ==
The default database back end of Xymon is RRD(Roun-Robin Database).
=== Database ===
==== RRD ====
==== SQLite3 ====
* Almost as fast as C fopen function code.
* No server process, data are store in plain files.
* Just like another rrd file that can be rsynced over to your standby xymon server.

==== MySql ====
* light weight DB.
==== Oracle ====
==== LDAP ====
==== XML flat file ====

=== Benefits of using relation DBs ===
==== Inventory Monitoring ====
* Store a machine's asset information
** Serial Number
** OS type
** Computer Maker
** Leased/owned 
** Trigger an alert if leasing is expiring soon.
** Display pie chart of OS type,Makers ... etc.

==== bb-hosts generation ====
* bb-hosts files got generated from host database table.

=== MVC Implementation ===
==== Mysql + PHP + EXTJS ====
==== Catalyst/SQLite ====
===== Bill of Materials =====
* Catalyst Book 1
* perl-5.10.0
* Fedora 11
* Address Book Example in Book 1.
* SQLite3
* Catalyst::Runtime,Catalyst::Plugins::*,Catalyst::Devel.
* Sql files to create Asset schema.
===== Procedures =====
* Use catalyst.pl to initiate your MVC project with sample templates.

== Xymon GUI ideas ==
=== GUI Requirements ===
# Keep cgi+html+tigramenu for legacy support.
# Include modern Javascript GUI framewok like extjs or jQuery.
# Provide realtime web GUI update from clients using AJAX.
## Waiting for 1+ minutes to see the changes from web page is barely acceptable but hope to avoid.

=== From Neil Franken ===
# Use CSS to provide easy theme and resolution change.
## Resolutions: 
## Themes:
#Enable fine-grained control on cloumns in different views.

=== From T.J. Yang ===
I found following combination of existing opensource software can make up a new GUI for Xymon.
End user can still see old cgi+html GUI. 
#Use extjs for new GUI and miframe.js to contain old tigra menu GUI in a frame.
# See [http://xymon.dlinkddns.com:8083/hobbit/ext3/examples/desktop/  Xymon Desktop Prototype].{{dead link|date=December 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''international organization''' (also called '''intergovernmental organization''') is an [[w:organization]] of international scope or character. There are two main types of international organizations: international intergovernmental organizations, whose members are sovereign states; and [[w:non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), which are private organizations. Generally the term international organization is used to mean international governmental organizations only. It is in this sense that the term is used in the remainder of this article.

Legally speaking, an international organization must be established by a treaty providing it with [[w:legal entity|legal recognition]]. International organizations so established are subjects of international law, capable of entering into agreements among themselves or with states. Thus international organizations in a legal sense are distinguished from mere groupings of states, such as the [[w:G-8]] and the [[w:G-77]], neither of which have been founded by treaty, though in non-legal contexts these are sometimes referred to as international organizations as well. International organizations must also be distinguished from treaties; while all international organizations are founded on a treaty, many treaties (e.g., the [[w:North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA)) do not establish an international organization and rely purely on the parties for their administration.

International organizations can be categorised in two main ways: by their membership, and by their function.

International organizations differ in who their members are and in who is permitted to join them. Membership of some organizations (global organizations) is open to all the nations of the world. This category includes the [[w:United Nations]] and its specialized agencies, as well as the [[w:World Trade Organization]]. 

Some specialized agencies predate all other types. In the [[w:nineteenth century]], [[w:France]] was the ''fons et origo'' of many of them. By this it is meant that much of the driving force to form such bodies (such as those which maintain the [[w:metric system]]) came from the French, and that their headquarters is in France, often in [[w:Paris]]. Under the [[w:Third Republic]], the [[w:Exposition Universelle (1878)|International Exposition of 1878]] in that city held a great number of meetings of such international organizations - as opposed to the preceding regimes. The motivation was that to keep France a republic and not slip back into either a monarchist or [[w:Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] regime, the republicans would underscore their inheritance of the crusading nature of the [[w:French Revolution]] against feudal cultural remnants within France, which had been generalized to the rest of feudal Europe, eventually to the world. Some conclude from this example that internationalism often has national origins, at the difference of [[w:globalism]].

Other organizations are only open to members from a particular region of the world. Finally, some organizations base their membership on other criteria: cultural or historical links (the [[w:Commonwealth of Nations]], [[w:La Francophonie]]), level of economic development or type of economy ([[w:Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[w:OPEC|Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries]] (OPEC)), or religion ([[w:Organization of the Islamic Conference]]).

Were it to come about, the ultimate international organization would be a [[w:federation|federal]] [[w:world government]].

[[Image:world_government_hierarchy.gif|right]]

A '''world government''' is a hypothetical entity consisting of a single or series of levels of government with authority encompassing the entire planet. No such world government has ever existed, although large empires and superpowers have attained something of that level of power; historical examples have generally been hindered by the fact that insufficient communications and travel made a world organisation of any sort, much less an entire government, unfeasible.  This article will examine what proposals have been made for a world government, and which movements have advocated such a state.

Some internationalists seek the establishment of a world government as a way of establishing freedom and a benign rule of law over the world. Some (including internationalists) have concerns that a world government would need to respect the diversity of the nations or peoples it includes. Others regard a global government as a nightmarish possibility, with a malevolent world government creating an endless totalitarian state without the prospect of escape or revolution. The alternative term '''global political monoculture''' emphasizes the latter fears perceived by some to be developing via either  the transnational corporations or international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund the World Trade Organization and World Bank. Similarly, the term '''global cosmopolitan democracy''' describes a world government based on respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. 

Many modern internationalists say that current shortcomings in the international order may be redressed not by merely opposing globalization, which they see as an inevitable and even welcome process, but by counterbalancing the ills brought by over-centralization or purely economic interests (such as violation of human rights - including labor rights - and sociocultural and environmental integrity) with similarly global representative democratic institutions having supranational authority.

The idea of world government is often explored in science fiction, either as a central theme or as plot backdrop.

==Multinational empires, federations and unions==

Effective governance of multiple nations has been accomplished in the past either by empire, by federation, or by supranational union.

=== Empires with pretensions or asprirations to world dominance ===

* Perhaps the empire coming closest to dominance of the then-known world was Alexander's in 323 BC, an empire which sought to fuse the disparate cultures of its rapidly conquered territories rather than impose a Macedonian template.
:&quot;When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer.&quot; (Attributed to John Milton&lt;sup id=&quot;Footnote_1&quot;&gt;[[#Footnotes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;)

* The Roman Empire (1st century BC to 5th century AD) ruled most of the Mediterranean rim, as well as parts of the Celtic regions of Northern Europe. 

* The Mongol Empire of the 13th century was probably the largest continuous land empire of all time, ruling about half of the world population. Most historians believe that Western Europe would also have fallen under Mongol rule had the news of Ögedei Khan's death not forced Batu Khan to suspend his campaign.

* Ming Dynasty China had dominion over the &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;, which it believed all significant culture, science, and art in the world. On the verge of global naval dominance the Chinese fleet was recalled partially because the Emperor was thought to need nothing in the outside world. Jared Diamond has advanced the thesis that a government, such as China's, without meaningful external opposition will tend to technologically and socially stagnate; many modern objections to World Government are based on the long decline of Imperial China.

* The Ottoman Empire which ended in 1922, covered the entire Arab world, to include the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe and Asia. 

* The British Empire reached its peak in early 20th century, ruling over about a quarter of Earth's population. 

* The Soviet Union (&quot;Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot; - USSR) stretched over large parts of the northern Eurasian continent from 1922 to 1991. Until 1935 it proposed a global communist government through exported revolution and military expansion.

=== Voluntary unions of polities in history ===

Countries like Switzerland and Belgium developed confederal forms of government centuries ago to bring diverse groups together to peacefully form stable and effective societies that continue to respect internal linguistic and ethnic diversity. The Netherlands established the world's first federation by creating the United Provinces in 1581 by signing of the Oath of Abjuration. The United States established the world's second federation with the replacement of the Articles of Confederation by the Federal Constitution of 1787, which has since been emulated by dozens of countries. In addition, the extent of the United States' influence both military and economically in affairs outside its borders has been described as an American Empire. India, the world's largest democracy, is a federation of dozens of peoples, each with its own culture and language. 

More recently, the evolving and expanding European Union has attempted to unite a large group of widely diverse, formerly hostile, nations spread over a large geographical area. The EU's lead is being followed by the African Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the South American Community of Nations. These multinational associations are at different stages of development, but they are all growing, both in coverage and in extent of economic and political integration.

The total population currently aggregated under multi-national political governance organizations, either a full federation or an evolving regional integration process, is approximately 3 billion, about a half of humanity.

==Functional international institutions==

The United Nations (UN) is the primary institution coordinating human activities on a global scale. In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the World Health Organization the International Labour Organization, and International Telecommunications Union ([http://web.archive.org/web/20030403214912/http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html chart]). Of particular interest politically are the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), were formed together in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, 1944, to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. The World Trade Organization (WTO) sets the rules of international trade. It already has a semi-legislative body (The General Council, reaching decisions by consensus), and a judicial body (The Dispute Settlement Body).

There is also a body of international law, encompassing international treaties, customs, and globally acceptable legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) (also known as World Court) is the judiciary organ of the United Nations. It settles disputes submitted to it voluntarily by states (only), and gives advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it by other organs of th UN, such as the General Assembly or Security Council.

A recent development towards the establishment of the rule of global law is The International Criminal Court (ICC). This is the first ever permanent, treaty based, international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes do not go unpunished. Of ninety-two countries who signed the treaty, forty-seven - including the United States - have not ratified it, citing various concerns about sovereignty and legal jurisdictions.

==Theories of international integration==

A number of scholars have theorized as to how a world government might come into being peacefully. Two general schools of thought on this are functional and regional integration. According to the functional school, world government would arise through all the nations of the world gradually establishing international bodies to deal with particular issues (trade, communications, health, etc.)&amp;mdash;these bodies would slowly grow in power, and, having succeeded their parent states in terms of importance, finally be federated to form one world government. According to the regional school, the formation of a world government would be preceded by the formation of regional governments in different parts of the world, these regional governments later joining together to form one world government. As described above, both forms of integration are currently active and growing in scope.

Both these schools of thought see the peaceful establishment of a world government as a slow and gradual process, which will take decades, if not centuries. However, others argue that a world government could come about very quickly, through an agreement between all the nations of the world. Such a view was quite popular in the idealism of the post-World War II era (one famous proponent being Garry Davis but by the end of the 1950s had been revealed to be quite unrealistic, at least in the climate of the times. Although there is no reason theoretically why it could not happen, the practical rules of politics (especially in today's world) make the sudden establishment of such a body highly unlikely, and the gradual route holds much more promise. Many who see the establishment of a world government as desirable still hold out hope.

Of course, both possibilities can operate.  Just as human society has evolved in progressively larger units of cohesion despite many setbacks&amp;mdash;and while pushed forward rapidly at times by the results of occasional calamities and/or ingenuity and opportunity, many have proposed that this tendency toward stronger coordination, yet with decentralized control, is an inevitable path.  The United States government, for example, did not come immediately into being (nor, its advocates would argue, at the expense of individuality).  The states of the union were initially quite resistant to the idea of supplying any resources to the national government (if they supported one at all).  However, certain events such as impending war with Great Britain drew its constituent elements closer to each other along another global trend, self-determination.  Although self-determination may seem the opposite of unification, federalists (whether national or international) argue that it is actually a prerequisite to true unification (though empires have undoubtedly achieved some measure of standardization and unification).  Once &quot;liberated&quot; to sufficiently govern their own affairs, states can associate with others in balanced relationships which allow mutual benefit.  However, such a unification brought about by war as the United States experienced was not sufficient to weld its constituent elements firmly together.  The  Articles of Confederation deliberately created a weak federal government, dedicated to the independence of the states, without even the power to raise troops in wartime. Despite this, the loose coallition was able to defeat the greatest military power of its day. However, some in Congress were unsatisfied with this, and considered the central government too weak. They thought that it might not be able to respond efficiently to serious crises in future. Therefore, the &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; of the (federal) United States devised a system which prevented the national government being ineffectual without undue interference in the affairs of the states. However, the American Civil War shattered this equilibrium, with the federal government waging war against break-away states. It has been argued that this test of the system was due to its being tied in its own contradictions of &quot;self-determination&quot; regarding the issue of slavery, and that the Civil War strengthened the nation's unity.  Much effort was also spent through educational avenues to inculcate a new sense of national unity amidst the people who had previously felt no special loyalty to those from other states.

Parallels have been drawn to the current state of weak world governance (through the United Nations and other related regional or international institutions) with the United States' Articles of Confederation.  In the current system of the United Nations, many have argued that this present system gives too much weight to state sovereignty and too little to cohesive action.  For example, any of 5 permanent members of the Security Council can veto any matter brought before it (not only security matters).  The World Parliament (the General Assembly), it is argued, hardly represents the people, since it is not elected by the people in a separate election for international governance (and in many cases, the governments currently choosing the representatives are unelected themselves). Furthermore, the representation is not proportional in any manner to population (unlike most bicameral legislatures, including the United States House of Representatives), and their decisions are not in any way binding (besides expressing opinion).  Moreover, the participating nations admitted into the United Nations General Assembly are in many cases oppressive dictatorships not accountable to their own people (perhaps parallel to the southern states of the U.S. before the Civil War not allowing black people basic economic or political freedoms such as the right to vote). The World Court, likewise, is severely limited in its powers in being able to adjudicate in matters not agreed to be brought before it by both parties, or if the parties are not states.  Even those belonging to permanent member countries have argued that such sovereignty only begets anarchy in getting things accomplished (especially during the Cold War).  While federalists are equally wary of the dangers of over-centralization, they argue that many aspects of the United Nations system (or a new system) should be sufficiently strengthened to allow effective action, whether dealing with security or auxiliary issues argued to be related to security.

(Besides federalism, some internationalists point to the model of a commonwealth for the future patterning of a world government which can offer another type of balance between national and international control.)

==Hopes and fears==

The forces of globalization have caused major changes in the type of threats and opportunities facing humanity. In many ways the world already operates as a single society, where everyone’s activities affect everyone else. Environmental damage that crosses international borders, nuclear weapons proliferation, terrorism, unchecked national militarism, international crime, cruel regimes, anarchic states and refugees are all examples of issues that cannot be fully addressed by individual national governments, or even by voluntary multilateral treaties and agreements. While some military spending contributes to prosperity, advocates of world government hope that non-military means of providing security will be more economical and free up resources that can stimulate prosperity directly and more efficiently. They hope that a worldwide democratic electorate would reassign military budgets to stimulate economic growth in poor countries, e.g., by improving education and productivity-amplifying infrastructure, and the global maintenance of the rule of law. The local populations, however, may prefer to reallocate military budgets to lowering taxes or increasing local social welfare spending instead.  

Beyond the humane benefits, advocates claim such reallocation would eliminate, once and for all, inter-governmental threats, including a large-scale nuclear holocaust (World War III). At the end of the second world war, nationalists and internationalists alike found this to be a compelling motive for the formation of world government: 

: &quot;Unless we establish some form of world government, it will not be possible for us to avert a World War III in the future.&quot; (Winston Churchill, 1945).

: &quot;As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power, war is inevitable. There is no salvation for civilization, or even the human race, other than the creation of a world government.&quot; (Albert Einstein, 1945 [http://universal-democracy.editme.com/QuotesCitations from &quot;World Citizen Quotes&quot;]) 

While acknowledging that a world government may be wasteful and inefficient, proponents contend that the costs of not having such a government are far higher. Conversely, they claim that the currently fragmented and loosely coordinated system of international governance misses countless opportunities for beneficial collaboration across national boundaries. To quote H.G. Wells (''The Outline of History'', 1922): ''&quot;There can be little question that the attainment of a federation of all humanity, together with a sufficient measure of social justice, to ensure health, education, and a rough measure of equality of opportunity to most of the children born into the world, would mean such a release and increase of human energy as to open a new phase in human history.&quot;''

From the above observations, advocates of world government hope that enlightened self-interest at the national level would naturally lead to the rise of a world government, without the common external threats that led states and provinces to federate into countries in previous centuries. In the short term, however, many hurdles remain to be overcome.

National governments in positions of greater military or economic power enjoy greater freedom to pursue their agendas with lower concern for the reaction of governments of less powerful nations. Accepting the supremacy of global law requires such governments to accept additional constraints on the range of available actions they may take, and to comply with decisions of courts over which they have limited control. Even when support of a global authority is of clear benefit to the majority of citizens of a country, such support may still act against the desire of individual government members for greater personal influence. This unfortunate conflict of interests is much amplified in despotic regimes, reducing the likelihood that a democratic federal government with global jurisdiction can be established prior to the complete elimination of dictatorial governments at the national level.

There are also hurdles to expanding popular support for the idea. People in many countries feel intense loyalty to their nation-state and/or legally protected rights, resulting in reluctance to accept arrangements in which national sovereignty is compromised. In Western systems which place high value on individual autonomy, discussions of a global government sometimes invoke frightening visions of absolute collective or dictatorial control from which there is no escape. Others are concerned that proper controls over a remote world government would be difficult to implement, leading to excessive waste, corruption and abuse of power. To quote former U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater: ''&quot;A government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away.&quot;'' 
On the other hand, some people in non-Western countries under the hegemony of their cultures and ruling oligarchies, demonize the anarchy of individuality and are suspicious of world government for fears that Western powers will unduly impose their values through control of these institutions.

Some religious teachings, such as those of the Bahá'í Faith and Unitarian Universalism, are highly supportive of a world government. At the other extreme, numerous fundamentalist Christians in the U.S. associate the idea of world government (and, indeed, powerful international organizations in general) with the Antichrist and the End Times.  (See, for example, Pat Robertson's book ''The New World Order''.)

Despite the slow progress, many advocates remain hopeful that ingenuity, education, statesmanship, and other proactive efforts would continue to advance support among nations and their leaders for a greater political and social union based on justice, consultation, and respect for state and individual rights. The desire of countries bordering the European Union to join it, in effect creating a voluntarily expanding democratic empire, demonstrates the attraction of a multi-national political and economical integration. (However, the apparent reluctance of many within the union to allow rapid expansion may be a countervailing indicator). Nations in Africa (AU), South America (SACN) and South-East Asia (ASEAN) have launched similar political integration efforts. Activist organizations, such as the World Federalist Movement, continue to promote the idea of a global federal democracy amongst national governments, and are constantly seeking to expand their membership.

===The United Nations as a budding federal world government===
{{npov}}
The United Nations currently mainly serves as a forum for the world's sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action. As such, it is not set up to easily evolve into a federal world government. Its most critical deficiencies are (1) legitimacy and (2) power.

Legitimacy is lacking in that the operation of the UN is not based on widely accepted democratic principles, such as proportional representation (each government has one vote regardless of population size, or whether it truly represents that population) or equality of status (some countries have permanent seats and veto power in the security council). Some proposals for improving the UN's legitimacy involve the introduction of weighted voting, the establishment of a directly-elected parliamentary organ, or the creation of an additional body (internal or external) open only to self-styled democracies.

Power is lacking in that implementation of its decisions is entirely dependent on the goodwill of its members. It has no legal power to directly collect taxes to fund operations, maintain an army or a police force, or directly impose economical penalties on national governments refusing to comply with its decisions. Proposals for increasing the UN's power include the direct collection of taxes, for instance:
* Taxing international monetary transactions (the &quot;Tobin Tax&quot;) 
* Licensing the use of global commons (oceans, space)
An independent income would permit the UN to establish its own standing rapid-deployment military and police forces. 

A proposal called the binding triad would make General Assembly resolutions binding if approved by a group of nations representing a majority of
*The world's population;
*UN financial contributions; and
*The membership of the General Assembly.

One the most significant current hurdle to the growth in UN influence is the reluctance of the current US administration to concede autonomy, especially following the refusal of the Security Council to approve a military attack on Iraq in early 2003 and the subsequent declaration of this attack as illegal by the UN's Secretary General. Some hope that the reluctance of the US government to support further UN growth would be overcome by reform, openness and accountability in the UN, and demonstrated integrity and transparency in the administration of international law. Others believe that a refusal by other nations to collaborate with the US other than via the UN (or other rule-governed institutions) would be necessary.

==Attributed ideologies==

Various people attribute, though not at times without caricature, the idea of a world government to, often exclusively, and often with false assumptions, ideologies (frequently extreme) such as :

===Nazism===
Adolf Hitler attempted to establish a &quot;thousand year Reich&quot; that, at the very least, would have encompassed Europe and Russia. It seems probable that had Hitler been successful in this, he would have eventually attempted to conquer the rest of the world. However, he believed that a state was at its strongest when at war, so perpetual or recurring war would probably have been something he would advocate; thus negating the possibility of a complete world government.

===Neoliberalism===
Neoliberals rarely advocate a world ''government'' in the classical sense of the word, and prefer instead a single world-wide ''economic order'' of free market capitalism. Their aim would be the eventual integration of all countries into this economic order, with the removal of all trade barriers and (in some cases) the removal of all regulations on capitalism. Strands of neoliberal thought influence the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which are the focus of opposition from the anti-globalization movement.

===Communism===
The communist movement has an ideal of world government emerging from the voluntary co-operation of communist countries, presumably after capitalism has been overthrown. However, in the past, many communist states showed distrust or even outright hostility towards each other (see the [[w:Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet split]] between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China). 

In particular, Leon Trotsky is famous&amp;mdash;and probably foremost among communists&amp;mdash;in advocating a &quot;world revolution,&quot; as opposed to the single-state visions of Stalin and Mao. His supporters have suffered alienation within the communist movement, however, due in large part to the propaganda of the Soviet Union against Trotsky. They have been making a comeback only since the fall of the Soviet Union.

===Anarchism===
Although anarchists advocate a world not divided by borders, which they regard as nothing but artificial boundaries, and are generally against nationalism, they do not advocate a world government as such, because government itself is an institution they believe to be morally wrong and harmful. Instead, anarchists propose a world order based on free association and mutual aid, though this may vary depending on the specific branch of anarchism in question (see the main article on anarchism for further details).

===Conspiracy theory===
A number of conspiracy theories postulate the existence of a mysterious global cabal that controls the world, or large portions of it, from behind the scenes.  Other theories prophecise (or warn of) domination of the world by a single entity, often referred to as a &quot;One World Government&quot;.

===A large, loving family===
When children are young, their basic needs (food, shelter and clothing) are provided, and it should be possible to create in time a world government that will abolish all poverty-related hardships, possibly combined with a limitation of populations to areas where there is, and will be, enough for all. It may also involve other limitations, such as a guidance of students into careers where there will be certain to be a job for them when they are ready for a job. Probably there have already been (unsuccessful?) attempts to build such a society on a small scale.

===A society based on systems in a healthy human body===
The human body includes many highly successful systems that together do their best to keep the body working, and even working well, such as the food processing, the garbage/rubbish expulsion, the regulation of body temperature, the defences against various bacteria and virus infections. etc. The various organs do their work reliably and without strikes, slowdowns, etc. and they work for the well-being of the whole body, not just for individual selfish aims. Possibly there have already been (unsuccessful?) attempts to build such a society on a small scale.

==World government in science fiction==

In both science fiction and utopian/dystopian novels, authors have made frequent use of the age-old idea of a global state and, accordingly, of world government. In tune with Immanuel Kant|Kant's vision of a world state based on the voluntary union of all countries of this planet in order to avoid colonialism and in particular any future war (&quot;Idee zu einer allgemeinen Geschichte in weltbürgerlicher Absicht&quot;, 1784; &quot;Zum ewigen Frieden&quot;, 1795), some of these scenarios depict an egalitarian and environmentally sustainable world supervised (rather than controlled) by a benevolent (and usually democratic) world government. Others, however, describe the effects of a totalitarian regime which, after having seized power in one country, annexes the rest of the world in order to dominate and oppress all humankind. James L. Halperin's novel ''The Truth Machine'' (1996) is an example of the former while Ira Levin's ''This Perfect Day'' (1970) and the evangelical Christian Left Behind series are examples of the latter.

'''''The Truth Machine''''' envisages the future of humankind after the invention of a device which is much more reliable than conventional lie detectors. Mass marketed and as small and cheap as a mobile phone, the truth machine is available to everyone so that lying has become something which just does not pay any longer and, consequently, is generally considered erratic behaviour which used to occur in the past. Also, crime has become almost obsolete. As politicians are in no way exempt from being continually checked, no economy with the truth can be found in their speeches or soundbites any longer, and only those who really wish well are prepared to take office. As the only remaining superpower, the United States of America takes the lead and all the other nations readily join in to form a truly global society.

The '''''Left Behind''''' books are a series of novels that tell the story of the Rapture according to evangelical Christian theology. The stories center around the quick rise to power of a charismatic, populist Romanian politician named Nicholae who is eventually appointed Secretary General of the United Nations. Once in power, Nicholae advocates a series of popular proposals, such as a global currency and massive international disarmament. Eventually, all countries unite into one &quot;Global Community.&quot; However, things quickly turn sinister, and although Nicholae remains increasingly revered (now as &quot;Global Pontiff&quot;) he institutes increasingly totalitarian measures to unite the world, such as allowing only one legal religion, and only one global media outlet. Nicholae is eventually seen as the antichrist, and is rejected by the books' Christian protagonists. The idea that the antichrist will be the leader and chief advocate of a world government is a popular theory among believers in Christian Rapture theory. 

'''''This Perfect Day''''' is set in a seemingly perfect global society whose genesis remains vague (&quot;Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei led us to this perfect day&quot; is what schoolchildren have to chant). The world is ruled by a central computer called UniComp which has been programmed to keep every single human on the surface of the earth in check. People are continually drugged by means of regular injections so that they can never realize their potential as human beings. They are told where to live, what to eat and which job to take. Everyone wears a bracelet with a scanner which tells them where they are allowed to go and what they are allowed to do. At 65, they receive a lethal injection. Even opposition against such a life by those few who happen to be resistant to the drug and who consequently wake up to a day which for them turns out to be anything but perfect is dealt with by the programmers of UniComp who, in their underground hideaway, constitute the world government.

=== Lunar government ===
''Main article: [[w:Lunar Government|Lunar Government]]''

Perhaps the most promising prospect in the near future for a single world government may be on the moon. Administration of Lunar territories may initially follow the Antarctic model, whereby land is divided up amongst existing nations. Once a sufficient population has developed, several thousand perhaps, a path towards self-governance could be forged through either the UN or by a unilateral declaration of independence. (This would be a “world government” in the sense of unitary planetary authority but would lead to the balkanization of the solar system, and would actually create more, rather than fewer sovereign governments.)

== Footnotes ==

[[#Footnote_1|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] The Milton attribution for this line is a popular myth, not confirmed by any of his known work. [http://www.pothos.org/alexander.asp?paraID=96 pothos.org] has located the likely origin in an essay be Plutarch: 
: &quot;'Alexander cried when he heard Anaxarchus talk about the infinite number of worlds in the universe. One of Alexander's friends asked him what was the matter, and he replied: &quot;There are so many worlds, and I have not yet conquered even one.&quot;' (&quot;On Contentment of the Mind&quot; in Plutach's [[w:Plutarch#Other Works|''Moralia'']].)
In one sense the original quote has the opposite meaning to the legendary one, but both imply that he had the future conquest of the entire world within his grasp. Had he not died at 33, perhaps he would have created the first World government.

'''Green politics''' is a body of political ideas informed by [[w:environmentalism]] aimed at developing a [[w:sustainability|sustainable]] society. It is considered by its advocates to be an alternative to both [[w:left-wing politics|left]] and [[w:right-wing politics|right]] views and parties, although adherents to both views tend to view [[w:Greens]] as &quot;on the other side&quot;. Certainly it is true that [[w:Worldwide green parties|Green parties]] advocate measures that appear to conventional politicians different from those grouped into [[w:labour (economics)|labour]] and [[w:capital]] by economic interests.

Some of these views include:
*a commitment to the methods of [[w:consensus decision making]], [[w:participatory democracy]] and [[w:deliberative democracy]] wherever feasible
*a [[w:green tax shift]] that would increase consumption and sales taxes on all resource-intensive items, while reducing [[w:income tax]] and [[w:capital gains tax]] - a position also associated with [[w:Libertarianism]] and seen as extreme by many on the left and right.
*a cessation of all taxes levied against strictly local production and trade - a position shared only by some advocates of [[w:Libertarianism]]
*local and [[w:moral purchasing]] provisions for [[w:government]] especially, requiring the source of supply to follow similar environmental and labour standards as those prevailing in the consuming jurisdiction - a position usually associated with liberal religious groups, [[w:pacifist]]s, and left-[[w:feminism]]
*[[w:measuring well-being]] as an alternative to [[w:consumer price index]] based  means of measuring [[w:economic growth]] - seen also as a radical left-wing position especially as it would impact the [[w:money supply]] and measures of [[w:inflation]].
*[[w:full cost accounting]] and an end to [[w:dirty subsidy]] of [[w:pollution]] by [[w:government]]  - another economically neoliberal position, ending [[w:corporate welfare]] and requiring corporations to compete on the basis of energy and waste savings.
*against [[w:nuclear power]] and the build up of [[w:persistent organic pollutants]] - based on a strict adherence to the [[w:precautionary principle]] where technologies are rejected unless they can be proven to not cause significant harm to the health of living things or the [[w:biosphere]]
*an end to biological forms of pollution and human health damage via the subsidy of [[w:dairy farming]] and the [[w:meat industry]] - a position that cuts against the tendency of both left and right to support [[w:family farm]]s without limit or conditions
*treating [[w:waste]] as a [[w:resource]] - a commodification of something of negative value, previously dumped into the [[w:commons]] without [[w:full cost accounting]]
*investing heavily in [[w:human capital]] - usually a left wing position when done by the public sector, and a right wing one if the investment is via the private sector
*[[w:accounting reform]] that would probably disadvantage both labour and large investors in favor of small investors, customers, and the public at large - more of a left wing position but not considered as a key issue by most left parties
*an end to the [[w:War on Drugs]] in the [[w:United States]] and [[w:Europe]] - seen as both a radical left wing and [[w:Libertarianism|Libertarian]] position
*an end to the [[w:War on Terrorism]] and the curtailment of [[w:civil rights]] - focusing instead on growing [[w:deliberative democracy]] in war-torn regions and the construction of a [[w:civil society]] with an increased role for women - this position is seen by many as a somewhat radical position
*[[w:urban secession]] by major cities to permit them to shake off control of the suburbs and renew their economies in ways that they cannot do if they require the permission of their surrounding regions, e.g. to tax, ban cars in downtowns, or put money in [[w:mass transit]] instead of [[w:highway]]s - this view is usually more associated with [[w:Libertarianism]] and extreme decentralization movements of both left and right
*[[w:bioregional democracy]] reflecting ecological boundaries in politics directly - a scale which tends to be smaller than existing [[w:nation-state]]s, and thus is a de facto [[w:secession]] movement, favored more by left than right in modern times, although historically the right wing was often defined by ethnic and tribal identities.

Because it lacks clear identification with powerful interest groups, and tends to appeal more to a world-view or [[w:mindset]], Green politics tends to grow slowly but also not to easily lose ground to other views or parties over time. In [[w:developed nation]]s Greens have typically stood at 3-12% of the vote for long periods of time without making breakthroughs, usually participating in government as a minority partner, or working at municipal or regional levels. Most Greens reject [[w:radical centrist politics]] though there is a strong overlap between that perspective and what is occasionally referred to as the &quot;realist&quot; wing of the Greens.

Basic statements of Green political values include the [[w:Four Pillars of the Green Party]] originally adopted by the [[w:European Greens]], the [[w:Ten Key Values of the Global Greens]] adopted by most English-speaking Greens in the [[w:1990s]], and the [[w:six core Green principles]] accepted in [[w:2001]].

Greens often refer to [[w:productivism]], [[w:consumerism]] and [[w:scientism]] as examples of &quot;grey&quot; views, which implies age, ashphalt and obsolete ideas of human social organization, including [[w:globalization]] of economic relations. Many Greens are important players in the [[w:anti-globalization movement]]. This involvement includes the full spectrum from [[w:street protesters]] to those building local alternatives to [[w:global economic monoculture]].

Green politics is usually said to include the [[w:green anarchism]], [[w:eco-anarchism]], [[w:anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] and [[w:peace movement]]s - although these often claim not to be aligned with any party. Some claim it also includes [[w:feminism]], [[w:pacifism]] and the [[w:animal rights]] movements. Most Greens support special policy measures to empower women, especially mothers; to oppose war and de-escalate conflicts and stop proliferating technologies useful in conflict or likely to lead to conflict, and such unusual measures as [[w:Great Ape personhood]] to end [[w:ape genocide]], which they see as akin to [[w:genocide]] of primitive human populations, e.g. [[w:Stone Age Amazon]] tribes.

'''Globalization''' (or '''globalisation''') is a term used to describe the changes in societies and the world economy that are the result of dramatically increased trade and cultural exchange. In specifically economic contexts, it refers almost exclusively to the effects of trade, particularly trade liberalization or &quot;free trade&quot;
Between 1910 and 1950, a series of political and economic upheavals dramatically reduced the volume and importance of international trade flows. In the post-World War II environment, fostered by international economic institutions and rebuilding programs, international trade dramatically expanded. With the 1970s, the effects of this trade became increasingly visible, both in terms of the benefits and the disruptive effects.

== Meanings of Globalization ==
&quot;Globalization&quot; can mean:
*The formation of a global village &amp;mdash; closer contact between different parts of the world, with increasing possibilities of personal exchange, mutual understanding and friendship between &quot;world citizens&quot;, and creation of a global civilization. The World Bank defines globalization as the &amp;#8220;Freedom and ability of individuals and firms to initiate voluntary economic transactions with residents of other countries&amp;#8221;.
*Economic globalization &amp;mdash; 'free trade' and increasing relations among members of an industry in different parts of the world (globalization of an industry), with a corresponding erosion of National Sovereignty in the economic sphere. The IMF defines globalisation as &amp;#8220;the growing economic interdependence of countries worldwide through increasing volume and variety of cross-border transactions in goods and services, freer international capital flows, and more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology&amp;#8221; (IMF, World Economic Outlook, May, 1997).
*The negative effects of for-profit multinational corporations &amp;mdash; the use of substantial and sophisticated legal and financial means to circumvent the bounds of local laws and standards, in order to leverage the labor and services of unequally-developed regions against each other.
*The spread of capitalism from developed to developing nations.
*&quot;The concept of Globalisation refers both to the compression of the world and the intensification of consciousness of the world as a whole&quot; - Roland Robertson   

It shares a number of characteristics with internationalization and is used interchangeably, although some prefer to use globalization to emphasize the erosion of the nation-state or national boundaries. 

Globalism, if the concept is reduced to its economic aspects, can be said to contrast with economic nationalism and protectionism. It is related to laissez-faire capitalism and neoliberalism.

==History of globalization==
Since the word has both technical and political meanings, different groups will have differing histories of &quot;globalization&quot;. In general use within the field of economics and political economy, is, however, a history of increasing trade between nations based on stable institutions that allow individuals such as Masa and Kellie and firms in different nations to exchange goods with minimal friction. 

The term &quot;liberalization&quot; came to mean the combination of laissez-faire economic theory with the removal of barriers to the movement of goods. This led to the increasing specialization of nations in exports, and the pressure to end protective tariffs and other barriers to trade. The period of the gold standard and liberalization of the 19th century is often called &quot;The First Era of Globalization&quot;. Based on the Pax Britannica and the exchange of goods in currencies pegged to specie, this era grew along with industrialization. The theoretical basis was Ricardo's work on Comparative advantage and Say's Law of General equilibrium. In essence, it was argued that nations would trade effectively, and that any temporary disruptions in supply or demand would correct themselves automatically. The institution of the gold standard came in steps in major industrialized nations between approximately 1850 and 1880, though exactly when various nations were truly on the gold standard is a matter of a great deal of contentious debate. 

The &quot;First Era of Globalization&quot; is said to have broken down in stages beginning with the first World War, and then collapsing with the crisis of the gold standard in the late 1920's and early 1930's. 

Globalization in the era since World War II has been driven by Trade Negotiation Rounds, originally under the auspices of GATT which led to a series of agreements to remove restrictions on &quot;free trade&quot;. The Uruguay round led to a treaty to create the World Trade Organization or WTO, to mediate trade disputes. Other bilateral trade agreements, including sections of Europe's Maastricht Treaty and the North American Free Trade Agreement have also been signed in pursuit of the goal of reducing tariffs and barriers to trade.

==Signs of globalization==
Globalization has become identified with a number of trends, most of which may have developed since World War II. These include greater international movement of commodities, money, information, and people; and the development of technology, organizations, legal systems, and infrastructures to allow this movement. The actual existence of some of these trends are debated.
*Increase in international trade at a faster rate than the growth in the world economy
*Increase in international flow of capital including foreign direct investment
*Greater transborder data flow, using such technologies such as the Internet, communication satellites and telephones
*The push by many advocates for an international criminal court and international justice movements (see the ICC and ICJ respectively).
*Greater international cultural exchange, for example through the export of Hollywood and Bollywood movies. 
*Some argue that even terrorism has undergone globalization. Terrorists now have attacked places all over the world.
*Spreading of multiculturalism and better individual access to cultural diversity, with on the other hand, some reduction in diversity through assimilation, hybridization, Westernization, Americanization or Sinosization of cultures. 
*Erosion of national sovereignty and national borders through international agreements leading to organizations like the WTO and OPEC
*Greater international travel and tourism
*Greater immigration, including illegal immigration
*Development of global telecommunications infrastructure
*Development of a global financial systems 
*Increase in the share of the world economy controlled by multinational corporations
*Increased role of international organizations such as WTO, WIPO, IMF that deal with international transactions 
*Increase in the number of standards applied globally; e.g. copyright laws

Barriers to international trade have been considerably lowered since World War II through international agreements such as the [[w:General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT). Particular initiatives carried out as a result of GATT and the WTO, for which GATT is the foundation, have included:
*Promotion of free trade
**Of goods: reduction or elimination of tariffs; construction of free trade zones with small or no tariffs
**Of capital: reduction or elimination of capital controls
**Reduction, elimination, or harmonization of subsidies for local businesses
*Intellectual Property Restrictions
**Harmonization of intellectual property laws across nations (generally speaking, with more restrictions)
**Supranational recognition of intellectual property restrictions (e.g. patents granted by China would be recognized in the US)

As defined through lecture series given by Dr. Cullenberg, Professor of Economics at the University of California, Riverside, globalization can be basically understood from an economic perspective through the following seven aspects:
*International Trade: Exports and imports of goods and services. Creation of increased interdependency and the creation of a balance of trade.
*International Portfolio Investment: Assets, cash, international currency, stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.
*Migration: Movement of people.
*Foreign Direct Investment: Movement of whole companies.
*International Environment: Global warming, O-zone layer, water resources etc.
*Global Culture: Creation of understanding and meaning, and international communication.
*International Governments: Control and power nationally and internationally.

==Anti-globalization==
''Main article: &quot;[[w:Anti-globalization|Anti-globalization]]&quot;.''

Various aspects of globalization are seen as harmful by public-interest activists as well as strong state nationalists This movement has no unified name.  &quot;Anti-globalization&quot; is the media's preferred term.  Activists themselves, for example Noam Chomsky, have said that this name is meaningless as the aim of the movement is to globalize justice.  Indeed, &quot;the global justice movement&quot; is a common name.  Many activists also unite under the slogan &quot;another world is possible&quot;, which has given rise to names such as ''altermondisme'' in French.

There is a wide variety of different kinds of &quot;anti-globalization&quot;. In general, critics claim that the results of globalization have not been what was predicted when the attempt to increase free trade began, and that many institutions involved in the system of globalization have not taken the interests of poorer nations and the working class into account. 

Economic arguments by fair trade theorists claim that unrestricted free trade benefits those with more financial leverage (i.e. the rich) at the expense of the poor.

Many &quot;anti-globalization&quot; activists see globalization as the promotion of a corporatist agenda, which is intent on constricting the freedoms of individuals in the name of profit. They also claim that increasing autonomy and strength of corporate entities increasingly shape the political policy of nation-states.

Some &quot;anti-globalization&quot; groups argue that globalization is necessarily imperialistic, is one of the driving reasons behind the Iraq war and that it has forced savings to flow into the United States rather than developing nations.

Some argue that globalization imposes credit-based economics, resulting in unsustainable growth of debt and debt crises. 

Another more conservative camp in opposition to globalization are state-centric nationalists that fear globalization is displacing the role of nations in global politics and point to NGOs as impeding upon the power of individual nations.  Some advocates of this warrant for anti-globalization are Pat Buchanan and Jean-Marie Le Pen.

The main opposition is to ''unfettered'' globalization (neoliberal; laissez-faire capitalism), guided by governments and what are claimed to be quasi-governments (such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) that are supposedly not held responsible to the populations that they govern and instead respond mostly to the interests of corporations. Many conferences between trade and finance ministers of the core globalizing nations have been met with large, and occasionally violent, protests from opponents of &quot;corporate globalism&quot;.

The movement is very broad, including church groups, national liberation factions, left-wing parties, environmentalists, peasant unionists, anti-racism groups, libertarian socialists and others.  Most are reformist (arguing for a more humane form of capitalism) and a strong minority is revolutionary (arguing for a more humane system than capitalism).  Many have decried the lack of unity and direction in the movement, but some such as Noam Chomsky have claimed that this lack of centralization may in fact be a strength.

Protests by the global justice movement have now forced high-level international meetings away from the major cities where they used to be held, and off into remote locations where protest is impractical.

Some &quot;anti-globalization&quot; activists object to the fact that the current &quot;globalization&quot; globalizes money and corporations and at the same time refuses to globalize people and unions. This can be seen in the strict immigration controls that exist in nearly all countries and the lack of labour rights in many countries in the developing world.

==Pro-globalization (globalism)==
Supporters of democratic globalization can be labelled pro-globalists. They consider that the first phase of globalization, which was market-oriented, should be completed by a phase of building global political institutions representing the will of World citizens. The difference with other globalists is that they do not define in advance any ideology to orientate this will, which should be left to the free choice of those citizens via a democratic process.

Supporters of free trade point out that economic theories of comparative advantage suggest that free trade leads to a more efficient allocation of resources, with all countries involved in the trade benefiting. In general, they claim that this leads to lower prices, more employment and higher output. 

Libertarians and other proponents of laissez-faire capitalism say higher degrees of political and economic freedom in the form of democracy and capitalism in the developed world produce higher levels of material wealth. They see globalization as the beneficial spread of democracy and capitalism.

Critics argue that the anti-globalization movement uses anecdotal evidence to support their view and that worldwide statistics instead strongly support globalization. One effect being that the percentage of people in developing countries living below $1 (adjusted for inflation and purchasing power) per day have halved in only twenty years [http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp]. Life expectancy has almost doubled in the developing world since WWII and is starting to close the gap to the developed world where the improvement has been smaller. Child mortality has decreased in every developing region of the world [http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=2429]. Income inequality for the world as a whole is diminishing [http://www.columbia.edu/~xs23/papers/worldistribution/NYT_november_27.htm].

Many pro-capitalists are also critical of the World Bank and the IMF, arguing that they are corrupt bureaucracies controlled and financed by states, not corporations. Many loans have been given to dictators who never carried out promised reforms, instead leaving the common people to pay the debts later. They thus see too little capitalism, not too much. They also note that some of the resistance to globalization comes from special interest groups with conflicting interests like Western world unions.

==Globalization in question==
There is much academic discussion about whether globalization is a real phenomenon or only a myth. Although the term is widespread, many authors argue that the characteristics of the phenomenon have already been seen at other moments in history.  Also, many note that those features that make people believe we are in the process of globalization, including the increase in international trade and the greater role of multinational corporations, are not as deeply established as they may appear.  The United State's global interventionist policy is also a stumbling point for those that claim globalization has entered a stage of inevitability.  Thus, many authors prefer the use of the term internationalization rather than globalization.  To put it simply, the role of the state and the importance of nations are greater in internationalization, while globalization in its complete form eliminates nation states. So, these authors see that the frontiers of countries, in a broad sense, are far from being dissolved, and therefore this radical globalization process is not yet happening, and probably won't happen, considering that in world history, internationalization never turned into globalization &amp;mdash; (the European Union and NAFTA are yet to prove their case.) 

However, the world increasingly shares problems and challenges that do not obey nation state borders, most notably pollution of the natural environment, and as such the movement previously known as the anti-globalisation movement has transmogrified into a movement of movements for globalisation from below; seeking, through experimentation, forms of social organisation that transcend the nation state and representative democracy. So, whereas the original arguments of anti-global critique can be refuted with stories of internationalisation, as above, the emergence of a global movement is indisputable and therefore we can speak of a real process towards a global human society of societies.

==New URL==

In time we will have to move to a new (hopefully shorter) URL like maybe&quot;food.wikipedia.org&quot; to support unique cookbook-only features like unit conversion, [[en:moral purchasing]] tags, etc. Maybe we should propose doing that right now, to have &quot;pl.food.wikipedia.org&quot; and &quot;en.food.wikipedia.org&quot;. Eventually make it &quot;wikook&quot; or something distinctive - sounds like &quot;we cook&quot;.
Why not do this right now?

:&quot;Wikook&quot; is cute. I suggest you purchase the domain name (both .com and .org) and donate that to the Wikimedia Foundation. However, I'm not sure if a cookbook project by itself will be broad enough to be viable (remembering that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia,  almanac and gazetteer; Wiktionary too is more than just a dictionary since it is also a thesaurus and a translating dictionary and grammar guide). Is there anything similar that can be tacked onto the subject of cooking that is complementary? The last thing we need is another project that is so focused that it is still born (like the Sept11wiki - which, as I suggested, should have been a general tribute wiki). --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 08:37 12 Jul 2003 (UTC)
::No risk whatever of that - cookbooks are the largest single segment of, and have among the longest shelf life, of any books.  Compare that to the Sep11 tribute books.  I suspect also that many people cook and share recipes and such who are not so interested in documentation in general, nor less in textbooks.  It would be good to attract in &quot;church ladies&quot; and chefs and cooking teachers  (especially).  I can't see them caring much about the concerns of say an organic chemistry textbooks.

:::Isn't cooking technicle organic chemistry?

::As for complementary issues, read the page:  group and institutional nutrition, hospitality, kitchens and utensils and table manners and settings and condiments of different cultures, ingredient sourcing and the relationship of that to your environment, community, health and ethics.  There's lots more to go through, and ideas like cooking competitions to explore - maybe we can get the rights to republish rights from cooking shows or restaurants, for publicity.  Go to a cookbook section and you'll see a lot of full-spectrum cookbooks.  Aside from what [[en:Slow Food]] does, imagine a treatment like [[en:Diet For A Small Planet]] by [[en:Frances Moore Lappe]], which has recipes and implications of them for the whole planet.  This could be the largest subproject going, it's easy to imagine

:::Yes! That is what I was talking about - a broad based project about all things related to food. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] 06:32 13 Jul 2003 (UTC)

----
Wikook sounds good to me. I think one thing that should be resolved swiftly is a [[template for recipies]] that is complete enough to accomodate the wide variety of cuisine there exists.

I concur with the above, and wonder: the 'nutrition' link, for one, should that be a cookbook link or a wikipedia link? --[[User:JakeNelson|Jake Nelson]] 23:38 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Authors of this Cookbook might be interested to know and integrate
an open cookbook by Matthew Balmer which is available 
[http://www.randomdata.net/osc/downloads/OSCOOKBOOK.txt here] and is released
under GNU FDL 1.1
&lt;/div&gt;

:We can't use it - it has Invariant Sections. Permission will be needed to use it here without the Invariant Sections. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 22:21 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:: So, has anyone contacted Matthew Balmer about this? I'm almost positive he'd be ok with our licensing, considering it's already released under the GFDL. I'll do it if no one else has, just let me know.-- [[User:Merphant|Merphant]] 07:29 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)
:::Matt Balmer writes:&lt;br&gt;'' You have my permission to incorporate parts of the cookbook into the project, but I have one request: I'd like to know what you're importing. Is it whole chapters, individual recipes, or what? I'm just interested in knowing how people are using my cookbook.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Also, if you would like portions of your cookbook integrated into mine and given a nice, professional print look (for people that want a print version), I would be more than happy to integrate parts of your project and put those in the PDF and PostScript versions I will be distributing with 0.5. Let me know if you're interested.

:: Great! I've started an info page for this book: [[Cookbook:Balmer Open Source Cookbook]]. Let's take this discussion there. -- [[User:Merphant|Merphant]] 09:32 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)

==Talk concerning the old main page==
Talk about ambitious. Added Japanese cuisine and first two points to outline. Hope I don't make a total mess of it.

Also changed links in Learning section from Country/culture to Country/culture Cuisine. Japanese pointed to a Japanese language text. Question: Shouldn't the word cuisine in the page titles be capitalized? I capitalized the links I changed, but noticed later that the links in the outline section are lower case. Which way do we go? [[User:CyberMaus|CyberMaus]] 20:02, 8 Sep 2003 (UTC)

==Atkins==
Atkins is listed on http://www.quackwatch.org, in other words, he's a quack suspect!  I vote that we remove any commerical affiliations with this cookbook, and that we immediately remove the Atkins section of the book.  Keep the Atkins recipes fine, but remove their affiliation to Atkins and do not endorse any recipes as part of any sort of diet.  Wikipedia should not advertise nor advocate any eating habits.   [[User:207.112.53.29|207.112.53.29]] 03:11, 14 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:It's a good thing we ain't Wikipedia then. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

:Atkins is not a quack. There is ample scientific evidence behind it. If wikipedia (I assume you mean to include Wikibooks) can't endorse any diets, than there goes low fat diets, low calorie diets, and not caring about what you eat at all. Everything is a diet. Atkins has become a generic term, so I wouldn't worry about that issue either. The Atkins diet is more sustainable than other diets and has the same, if not better, results for weight loss in most people. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 22:40, 16 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Atkins is controversial, yes.  There are other specialised diets, such as vegetarian though; why not Atkins?  I vote for keep; I'm a vegan, which is about as far as you can get from Atkins, and I think Atkins is an unhealthy fad diet [although good for quick weight loss], but there's absolutely no reason to delete the section.  If people want to put in recipes which match their diet, including in a specific section, why stop them?  The type-of-diet things are a great convenience; now all we need is better cross-referencing.  Wikipedia is not advertising or advocating eating habits; people who share eating habits sort recipes by them.  Big difference.

==What to do with recipes at wikipedia==

Should we port over all of the recipies from the regular Wikipedia to this cookbook? The recipies should really be here, not at Wikipedia proper. Right now, there is no interwiki page moving feature, though. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 22:40, 16 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:My preference is that this should be done sooner than later, in order to get this project rolling.  However, there is one small problem.  Wikipedia gets more visibility than wikibooks does.  How do we ensure that we get traffic?  The search engine on Wikipedia does not search through wikibooks does it?  I guess we can just rely on Google to pick up our pages over time.  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 17:37, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Well, hopefully once the cookbook here is a little more functional we'll be able to move everything from wikipedia proper here and have the old articles there link to here. -- [[User:The_Grimm_Ripper|Grimm]]

:::May I make a request? Over on Wikipedia, I did a lengthy, detailed reworking of the article on [[chili con carne]], which incorporates a number of actual recipes by way of illustration and to distinguish between types of chili. I have no objection to ''copying'' those recipes to this cookbook -- but please do '''not''' simply delete them from that article in the process. The article would completely meaningless without them. --[[User:Mksmith|Mksmith]] 21:19, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)

==Library of Cookery==
&quot;Library of Cookery&quot; by the Women's Institute is now online at Project Gutenberg. [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc110h.zip Vol 1], [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc210h.zip Vol 2], [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc310h.zip Vol 3], [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc410h.zip Vol 4], [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06/8loc510h.zip Vol 5]. It's roughly 2 megs of text, and quite a few images so it could probably get this cookery section off to a good start. -- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 10:05, 2 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:There's also [http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/1/0/0/1/10011/10011-h/10011-h.htm 365 Foreign Dishes] -- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 15:07, 9 Nov 2003 (UTC)
::365 Foreign Dishes may not be of much use. I only gave it a quick glance but it contains such helpful advice as &quot;cook until done&quot;. Yes that really is all the information the recipie gave on determining when to stop cooking. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

==Spices and herbs==
Just a small note: I am currently building better pages for spices and herbs.  I have a template [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Herbs_and_Spices Wikipedia:WikiProject_Herbs_and_Spices] going, and I have ported a few pages over to this format.  Some herbs and spices already have an article written but it is in a plant/botanical slant.  I rename those to [[spice_name (plant)] and create a new cooking/spice slanted page at [[spice_name (spice)]] or [[spice_name (herb)]].  All of the spice pages listed at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spices Spices] should be moved over to this wiki eventually.  I could wait until we have some interwiki moving feature.  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 17:37, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Alphabetical listing of recipes==
I have created a space for alphabetical listing of recipies (probably a good place for recipies to begin their life in the cookbook) and also begun to copy over some recipies from the en Wiki's [[w:List_of_recipies|List of recipies]]. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|The Grimm Ripper]]

==Should we include cooking techniques==
How about in addition to recipes, Wikook includes basic cooking skills-how to boil, how to roast, how to stir-fry, etc. Thoughts? [[User:Kagredon|Kagredon]] 03:06, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I'd think that Wikook (cute name btw) would cover everything to do with food, and be a kind of culinary encyclopedia. There's an infinite variety of things to write about, and I'm excited to help work on it. All I need to know is where to do it! I was doing some of this kind of stuff in the wikipedia... Karen J., who'd better register here if this is where the wiki cookbook will be.

==Page too ugly==
IMNSHO, this page is too ugly to be the first page everyone comes to when they click ''Cookbook''.  This page seems more like a planning or orginization page, so propose that the page be moved to [[Cookbook:Cookbook planning]], and a new, Table of Contents type page replace it.  That page should have only a few links, such as [[Cookbook:Ingrediants]], [[Cookbook:Techniques]], [[Cookbook:Equipment]], [[Cookbook:Cuisines]], and [[Cookbook:Recipes]], as well as a link to the planning page.

Any thoughts? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 18:18, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)

*If anyone wants to see what I'm thinking, I've put together [[Talk:Cookbook/Temp]]. The current page would move to [[Cookbook:Planning]], or something similar.[[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]
**I've my own version at [[Talk:Cookbook/Temp2]] to further separate out planning stuff and provide a place for more links (which is appropriate for a table of contents, IMO). [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 22:15, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)
*I like your version better, but there should be links to the various types of dishes, not just the cuisines, as well as the recipe index. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

::I agree, the TUF-KAT version is even more eye-catching. I would retain the title centered at the very top as in the Gentgeen version, however&amp;mdash; and perhaps make the type a bit larger.

I haven't had any internet access for the last few days... so this is the first I've seen of the new page and I hate it! I don't see any logical place to hang actual useful articles off that table of contents. What happened to the index list I was working on last week with cookbook sections that needed to be worked on? I agree that was WAS on the page before was a hideous mess but I don't really think this is much better. Instead of too much information now we're presenting the reader with none at all. There's got to be a middle ground. (One of the reasons I HATE tables is that I don't have a clue how to edit them, and nor do a lot of people...)[[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 12:22, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)

*I agree that the new main page is rather... terse and I too hate editting tables. This is why I keep a copy of the HTML 4.whatever specs under my pillow: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/  [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

==TOC vs Intro==
Regarding the new design of this page -- I changed it because I figured this should be the table of contents for the Cookbook.  Perhaps the old text should be integrated here, but I'm also considering redesigning the table itself.  There are undoubtedly more subjects to be incorporated in a table of contents, and a new format might make it more wieldy to read and edit. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 07:50, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)
----
We need a link to [[Cookbook:Glossary of Ingredients]] to store things like comparisons/conversions between different countries. I don't know how to edit tables or where it would best go. [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 07:57, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Also, thinking about the front page, people have been adding a lot of ingredients to the little lists, and they're starting to get pretty long so it's hard to read them. We can't put EVERYTHING on the front page of the book! I'd suggest revamping the front page a bit and instead of having categories for meat/veg/fruit/grains/dairy etc we amalgamate them all into the category of INGREDIENTS - then put the meat etc over in the examples column and people can go to Meat to find buffalo etc. This would also allow us to add a section for Pantry Cupboard Staples or Dry Ingredients or Baking Ingredients (not sure what you'd call it) to cover all the myriad of explanations that we really need... (oops, forgot to sign) [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 08:05, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*I've put your idea of an Ingredients row, with all the various ingredients on their own page, together at [[Talk:Cookbook/Temp3]].  I agree that it clears up much of the clutter of this page. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 13:29, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)
** That test version looks so much neater! It's great... I'd give it my vote :) [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 02:56, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Another question. I was just trying to fix the Italian Cuisine page because it was broken... but when I tried to link pasta back to Italian Cuisine it said there is no such page and I discovered that whoever made the index used 'Cuisine of Italy' for the page title (and most of the other countries too) Why use the awkward title 'Cuisine of France' 'Cuisine of Germany' etc. If you're going to mention it in an article you're going to write 'French cuisine' 'German Cuisine' etc. Why not just give the page the most obvious title? [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 04:14, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

: You could create redirect sets in one way or the other... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:23, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::I saw the &quot;Cuisine of xxx&quot; page somewhere, and just accecpted it as the standard without thinking about it.  If I remember correctly, that naming convention came to us from Wikipedia, where the cuisine pages are part of the &quot;Culture of xxx&quot; pages.  I prefer the &quot;xxx cuisine&quot; name myself, but what do we call food from New Zealand? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:06, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::I think it was simply established on en and bled over here.  I don't see either title as being much better than the other, but there are pros and cons for both sides.

:::I think the single biggest reason for using &quot;Cuisine of XXX&quot; on Wikipedia is that it is has less of an ethnic connotation.  &quot;Cuisine of Japan&quot; could mean ethnic Japanese in Japan, or ethnic Japanese in Europe, or Ainu, Okinawans or Russians in Japan, as well as info on how the Cuisine of Japan has had an impact elsewhere.  Another objection is that many countries have a rather obscure adjectival form ([[Nigerian cuisine]] vs. [[Nigerien cuisine]], for example) or one that is simply awkward ([[New Zealander cuisine]], [[Solomon Islander cuisine]]) -- for consistency's sake, then, the adjectival form should be avoided even in &quot;Cuisine of Italy&quot; or &quot;Cuisine of Japan&quot;, where these issues are not as prominent.  On wikibooks, all this seems less important, so it doesn't much matter, as long as there is consistency and the other form is a redirect. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 07:14, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

: Oh yes, the Open Source Cookbook.  He apparently takes submissions of recipies and compiles them into a book.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated in a while.  THe recipes definetly need to be ported over (it's under the GNU FDL).  It's hosted at http://www.ibiblio.org/oscookbook/.

==Recipe Template==
I was nosing around the German cookbook ([[Kochbuch]]), after they put alink at the top of ours, and noticed they have a nice recipe template ([[Kochbuch/Rezeptvorlage]], with a machine translation into English [http://www.worldlingo.com/wl/translate?wl_lp=DE-en&amp;wl_glossary=gl1&amp;wl_fl=2&amp;wl_rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwikibooks.org%2Fwiki%2FRezeptverzeichnis&amp;wl_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikibooks.org%2Fwiki%2FKochbuch%2FRezeptvorlage here]) that's more developed, and I think much better, than ours ([[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template]]).  Anyone object to ditching the old template and making a new one based on the work of our German cohorts, but tweaked a little to match our style? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 12:08, 3 May 2004 (UTC)

==Redesign Needed for Recipe Search==

*I think that the main page should be redesigned so that the link to all recipes is much clearer, rather than just being a small &quot;more recipes&quot; at the bottom of the &quot;Featured Recipe&quot; box.  Why not in '''LARGE''' letters at the top of the screen?  That's the logical place for a visitor to start looking.

Also, why doesn't the &quot;search&quot; function work better?

I wrote a recipe for &quot;tartiflette&quot; that was in the main Wikipedia for a while before being moved here a day or so ago.  If you're in the Wikipedia and type &quot;tartiflette&quot; into the &quot;search&quot; you then get a link to it as well as a link to the Wikibooks cookbook.  But if you then go to the cookbook by error you can't use &quot;search&quot; to find &quot;tartiflette....&quot;[[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 17:45, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)
:Um, there is another link to the recipe index as one of the main links on the left hand side of the &quot;Table of Contents&quot; area below the featured ingredient and recipe.  As far as searching, I understand that the search index is currently not being updated, but that it is only a temporary situation. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:00, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)


Is there an automatic way to alphabetically list every recipe that is in this category?&lt;br&gt;
For example: I create a recipe with 'Martian cuisine' on the header. Do I have to add it to the Martian cuisine list of recipes or it could be done automatically?&lt;br&gt;
It would also be really nice to have it for ingredients... if I click on cucumber I get in some way the complete list of recipes that use cucumber.&lt;br&gt; --[[User:Sbenza|Sbenza]] 18:22, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== public domain sources ==

I searched '''Project Gutenberg''' to see what books it had concerning cooking and came up with some historic and possibly still useful books.  They are below:
*[http://www.gutenberg.net/catalog/world/authrec?fk_authors=3210 Woman's Institute Library of Cookery] 5 Vol. set.
*[http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/10632 The Healthy Life Cook Book, 2d ed.]
*[http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/6912 School And Home Cooking], A home economics text.
*[http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/6385 Simple Italian Cookery]
*There are a whole bunch.  Just go to http://www.gutenberg.net and search for &quot;cook&quot; in the title field.  It gives some false positives for Captain Cook but other relevant resources as well.

'''Government sites''': The following sites have recipes that come from government sites and may be useful for the purposes of this cookbook.
*http://www.metrokc.gov/HEALTH/nutrition/cookbook.htm - I liked this one because it has a nutrition facts included.

== Ingredients vs Basic Foodstuffs ==

When clicking on the &quot;Ingredients&quot; link on the Cookbook main page, it links to a page named &quot;Basic Foodstuffs.&quot; It would be more consistent to title this page &quot;Ingredients&quot; but I'm not sure what the purpose of the page is. I would like to add &quot;pasta&quot; somewhere but I don't know that I would call it a &quot;basic foodstuff&quot; but it is an ingredient. There is a large class of manufactured/processed ingredients such as pasta, breakfast cerials, and sauces that don't fit well into the present basic foodstuff categories.  Anybody have suggestions? [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 17:17, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)


== Recipes from copyright-protected cookbooks. ==
&quot;Mere listings&quot; of ingredients are not subject to copyright. 
http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl122.html mentions this.
What -is- potentially subject to copyright is the directions.

How willing/resistant is this wiki cookbook project to the inclusion of recipes from still-protected cookbooks, with the directions entirely rewritten and potential modifications to the ingredients list, along with a note of the original source and the fact modifications were made?  
I'm not proposing taking whole cookbooks and treating them this way, but there are a few specific recipes which I quite enjoy and are adapted from mildly to unrecognizably from relatively current cookbooks, and would like to put up here.
* I personally would '''not''' like the idea of merely just taking recipes from cookbooks or recipe sites and then posting them here, unless they were the Open Source Cookbook or one of the public domain cookbooks.  Even then, we should still cite them as sources.  That's just my opinion.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 08:30, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)

* If someone writes a book with the recipe for 'Boiled Water', it means that I can't use it here anymore? Most recipes are of public domain and most cookbooks are just recopilations of these kind of recipes. --[[User:Sbenza|Sbenza]] 18:33, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)
**The directions to a recipe are a procedure, and procedures are not copyrightable under US law (although they can be patented, but that's another matter).  The part of a recipe that can be copyrighted include the descriptive blurb at the top, any photographs, and perhaps the layout of the recipe if it (the layout) is new or novel.

I've come up with another layout for the main cookbook page, again.  I've updated [[Talk:Cookbook/Temp]] with the new layout. Any suggestions or comments will be appriciated. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:07, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:The alternative layout looks good.  I don't have a preference between the two.  Of note is that the new look wouldn't hold featured recipe pictures very well.  Both seem to have too many links but that follows the pattern of much of Wikibooks.  I haven't thought of anything better myself so I don't have room to talk :-) [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:39, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)

==A matter of philosophy==

Here's a question - should we generally exactly dictate ingredients and cooking times, which seem to me to cut out matters of personal taste, or should we instead strive to explain the concept of a dish and the methodology behind its production, and leave matters as to, for instance, whether the ideal roast turkey brine employs maple syrup or apple juice, or what the exact right poultry rub for fried chicken is up to individual chefs?

My feeling is that it is more helpful to explain what one is doing than it is to simply give a list of directions, and that ingredient lists should only contain those items necessary to fulfill the technical requirements of the dish. Certainly guidance on possible seasonings should be included, but I think the distinction between stuff that must be done in order for the recipe to work (It is simply a bad idea, for instance, to make fried chicken with no breading)  and the stuff that makes the recipe your fried chicken (Corn flakes or flour?) is important to make clear in the recipes. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 06:34, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:If people don't realize recipe's can be changed &quot;to taste,&quot; even in drastic measures, then they really should be following the directions carefully. If I have a way to cook something that I think is best, why not tell others the exact way.  They can create their own best recipe by modifications themselves. My two cents. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:46, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::I agree for most  cookbooks, but this is not most cookbooks. Unless we intend to have a wild multiplication of pages on various recipes, we are faced with the problem of a multiplicity of views on how to cook something. The problem is analagous to the problems that require a NPOV policy on the encyclopedias. We need some method of ensuring, for lack of a better word, culinary NPOV. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 15:13, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::Well, the template for recipes (which only about 20% of recipes use, sorry, I burned out on converting recipes) provide a place for variations.  It's also easy to set up a new page and link to it, for example at [[Cookbook:Chocolate Mousse]], where we link to the Atkins-freindly version.  We also might suggest more specific naming of recipes, so that we don't have a recipe at [[Cookbook:Chili]], for example, but use that page for a collection of recipes.  Just some suggestions. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 17:34, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::::I think, though, that a lot can be done with explaining the methodology of a dish, and that this is, in the end, more useful than being just another cookbook. I'm thinking something more in line with either of Alton Brown's cookbooks - containing directions for how to do something, but also containing a whole lot of explanation of what you're doing, and clear guidance of when it's OK to divert from the recipe, and when it's going to be disastrous. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 04:25, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::Snowspinner, I see what you're saying about the cookbook scaling. Though, I wonder if it would be a problem to have a multiplicity of recipes as long as the variation section is used appropriately. But, &quot;appropriately&quot; could be a thorny decision.  I'm not sure I understand what your suggested alternative is so it may be better.  An example would be nice. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 15:26, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::::[[Cookbook:Fried chicken]] is a good example of the sort of recipe I think we should have. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 23:15, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::::::Nice recipe.  I've got a copy of AB's first cookbook, and another one called ''What Einstein told his cook'' by Robert L. Wolke ( ISBN 0-393-01183-6 ) which has a similar style, and I agree that explaining what is going on is really more important than providing just a recipe.  However, I think we could put these &quot;teaching someone about their kitchen&quot; segments in the ingredient, technique, and cuisine modules, with links to example recipes.  For example, [[Cookbook:Sautéing]]  describes the cooking method, compairs it to other similar methods, and lists recipes that call for food to be sautéed. We've still got a long way to go with this project. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:16, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::::::Thanks Snowspinner, I now know what your talking about :-)  While the recipe is presented well and gives something concrete for people to use (except the spice which is understandable), I'm not sure it will keep recipes from proliferating any better than making use of the &quot;variation&quot; section. For example, I know that if I were to add a fried chicken recipe it would be different enough to require another page; the only fried chicken I've seen cooked in a home before was in an iron skillet and was not soaked in brine. I think your recipe could be presented in our current template format that included the same info but was presented differently. The '''Procedures''' section would just have three parts, The spice rub, Brining the chicken, and Prepping the chicken. Comments about ingredient variations could be split out to go into the variation section. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 04:40, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Going left again - my feeling on the brining is that it is not so much a specific POV on the recipe as an underused technique. Since you can, if you want, just use a water brine (Though I think it's boring), it amounts to a particular way of salting the chicken that's really effective on meats. 

As for pan-frying, I know of that style. I just didn't go with it because, well, iron skillets of oil scare me. But, again, this would amount to a little note in the frying section indicating that you can pan-fry it. Again, I think this is superior to a variations section, though, because it presents the variations not as different recipes, but as different ways of achieving the same goal on a single recipe (whether it be seasoning, roasting, or whatever). Maybe this is just me, but I view a food not as a set of six or seven possible recipes, but as one process with a differance of opinion on each step of the process. But I don't think the process itself changes that much from recipe to recipe. Just the nagging details. [[User:Snowspinner|Snowspinner]] 05:19, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)

For my own part I think we should have detailed recipies with notes indicating how they may be modified (and we should encourage people to modify and be creative). I would humbly submit my own (thus far) [[Cookbook:Gyoza]] (they're better known as 'Potstickers'). I give a detailed list but with a number of suggestions for alterations and leeway within the recipie to allow people to season the dish themselves. I must admit I do actually have some more ideas for alterations to this that I've held back but I'm afraid they may cause the dumplings to break during cooking. On the other end of the argument there are some recipes without much room for alteration (for example a roux should always be made from the same ratio of fat and flour but after one has a roux an infinite number of uses exist). [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

::::::
Completely disagree, this will dissuade amateur cooks.  As they take grow more expereienced and know what make what tastes like ____, they themselves will make changes to the recipe.  Explanation will be good, but still give exact measurements please! ''Rogers'' 02 Dec 2004


:I agree with Rogers. Experienced cooks will already look at a recipe and think of ways it could be modified to meet their individual tastes. Amateur cooks, on the other hand, such as myself, need specific instructions because we often aren't yet familiar enough with the ingredients and possibilies out there to have a personal taste, or to articulate it if we do have one. The fried chicken recipe is about as minimal as it could be and still be useful to a beginner. The section about the spice rub was, in fact, a little too vague to be of use. It was helpful, at least, that it suggested some spices to use, but it would have been better if it had suggested a complete ratio of spices to use for a sample spice rub. Certainly I could throw some random spices together and find out through experimentation whether they worked; but the reason a beginner comes to a cookbook is because they want to be told some answers without having to waste time and food on experiments that often don't work out. --[[User:209.108.217.226|209.108.217.226]] 22:03, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introductory FAQ ==
=== Q. What is hobbit ?  ===

'''A.''' Hobbit was the old name used by Xymon System Monitoring tool. http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/about.html

=== Q. What is Xymon ?  ===

=== Q. Why should I use Xymon instead of BB ? ===

* Speed.  Hobbit runs much faster and is less resource intensive than Big Brother.
* More functionality built in
* GPL
* Integrated Trending
* A write up of why I use hobbit at http://gendalia.public.iastate.edu/Hobbit.txt


== User FAQ ==

===  When is the next version going to be released ? ===
'''A.''' 
Hobbit is a  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS FOSS] project by [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/System_Monitoring_with_Hobbit/Developer_Guide#Developers_Who_is_who hobbit developers] who contribute to the project in their spare time. It is under active development but a release date for the next version has not been announced.  The current development snapshot is available for download from sourceforge if required. If you are chasing a specific bug fix or feature not currently available within the existing production release, please search the archive and/or post a query to the general discussion mailing list to see if there is a solution available. You can subscribe to the list by sending an e-mail to hobbit-subscribe@hswn.dk. A searchable archive of the list is available at http://www.hswn.dk/hobbiton/ 
 
Please subscribe to the hobbit announcement list to be notified of the release of new versions. You can subscribe to the list by sending an e-mail to hobbit-announce-subscribe@hswn.dk. 

There is another answer for this question at http://www.hswn.dk/hobbiton/2008/02/msg00227.html

===  Where can I find more tests ? ===
'''A.'''  
Deadcat http://www.deadcat.net 
Deadcat is mostly Big Brother scripts, but most of them will work on Hobbit without too much fuss.

The Shire Project (Xymonton) https://wiki.xymonton.org/doku.php
Shire Project is specific to Xymon(Better than Deadcat)

===  How do I put duplicate hosts in the bb-hosts file ? === 
'''A.'''  
The first occurrence of the host is as normal. All further occurrences should be 
&lt;pre&gt;  
0.0.0.0 hostname # noconn 
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  How does the conn test work if the first ping doesn't respond ? ===
'''A.'''  bbtest-net calls either hobbitping or fping (configurable is FPING= in hobbitserver.cfg) 

====  How many pings are sent simultaneously ?  ====
'''A.'''  Exactly how many parallel connections are being used depends on your operating system - 
    the default is FD_SETSIZE/4, which amounts to 256 on many Unix systems
    You can choose the number of concurrent connections with the &quot;--concurrency=N&quot; option to bbtest-net. 

====  How many packets are sent each time ?  ====
'''A.'''  hobbitping normally stops pinging a host after receiving a single response, and uses that to determine the round-trip time.

====  What is the ping time-out ?  ====
A  The default timeout is 5 seconds. 

====  Can we configure it?  ====
'''A.'''  Yes. The --timeout=N parameter to hobbitping allows you to set the timeout to N seconds. 

===  What do the conn test (ping) colours mean?  ===
'''A.'''  Green is an OK response, yellow with packet loss (not delays, just lost packets) and red when there is no response. 

===  How do I get the hobbit client to download etc/hobbitclient.cfg from the server (or other files in etc or ext), then restart?  ===

'''A.'''  Why? If the clients are set up to use server-side config, they don't even need the /etc/*.cfg files locally... 

===  Is there a way within Hobbit of creating a graph with data from multiple RRD files ?  ===
'''A.'''  If you want to create a graph from multiple rrds, I would suggest using the 3rd party tool called drraw http://web.taranis.org/drraw/

===  How do I disable the REPEAT alerts ? ===
'''A.'''  Leaving off the REPEAT= defaults to repeat alerts every 30 minutes. Setting REPEAT=0 defaults to every minute. 
   To disable repeat alerts, set REPEAT=365d 
   If your problem lasts that long, you have bigger problems than too many alerts. 

===  The data being sent from my clients is being truncated.  ===
'''A.'''  The maximum message size can be set in hobbitserver.cfg 
   MAXMSG_CLIENT= 
   MAXMSG_DATA= 
   MAXMSG_STATUS= 
   Change the above parameters to suit your needs.

===  Do I need to restart the Hobbit server after editing the config files ? ===
'''A.'''  No. All files are reread every 5 minutes. 
   The only exception to this is hobbitserver.cfg Changes to this file require a restart. 

===  Do I need to restart my Hobbit client after making a change ?  ===
'''A.'''  No. All client config files are reread periodically 

===  How do I monitor a web page ?  ===
'''A.'''  Add the following line to the bb-hosts file 
   ip.ad.dr.ress www.example.com # http://www.example.com/ 
or for https 
   ip.ad.dr.ress www.example.com # https://user:passwd@www.example.com/ 
Note that there are also content checks and post and browser options available. See the &quot;HTTP TESTS&quot; section of the bb-hosts(5) manual for details.

===  My test only runs every hour. How do I get it to not go purple after 30 minutes ? ===
'''A.'''  Sometimes you want something monitored/tested only once each hour (remote Internet site), once each day (backup job or DNS update), or even less often. Or perhaps more frequently (a critical connection once per minute or less).

There is a &lt;code&gt;LIFETIME&lt;/code&gt; option when you call &lt;code&gt;bb&lt;/code&gt; on the client to report status. It defines how long a status message is considered valid (i.e. ''fresh'' and not yet ''stale''). Search &quot;LIFETIME&quot; on the [http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/manpages/man1/bb.1.html bb man page] for a bit more info. Syntax is like the following.
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
$BB $BBDISP &quot;status+4h $MACHINE.$COLUMN $COLOR `date`
&lt;/source&gt;
The defaults are 5 minute testing intervals and 30 minute status lifetimes, so 5 misses are accepted by default. The lifetime should be adjusted for the acceptable number of misses, otherwise false positives might occur. For example, if the host goes completely offline for 2 hours, or twice coincidentally overlapping each hourly reporting period, an hourly test probably doesn't need immediate debugging. Alternatively, for something being tested every minute, a lifetime of 30 minutes should probably be adjusted downward.

A couple of sample scenarios:
* If a script reports backup status only when a backup is finished, and the host or display is not communicative at that exact time, purple might or might not be desirable for that host's backup status in that NOC.
* If a script checks the size of each subdirectory within a parent directory, and the status is more intended for graphing than for green/yellow/red reporting, many misses may be acceptable.

Warning: The man page suggests &quot;sligtly more than the interval between your tests&quot;. But if that was actually followed then the default timeout would be 6 minutes. It isn't 6, and it's not designed to be easily changed from 30: Instead of being an option in a configuration file, it's hardcoded in the &lt;code&gt;hobbitd/hobbitd.c&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;handle_status&lt;/code&gt; function: &lt;source lang=c&gt;int validity = 30;&lt;/source&gt;

===  Does Hobbit encrypt its transmissions ? ===
'''A.'''  Natively, no. Some people have reported success using external encryption. 
   Later versions might support data encryption. 

===  How do I monitor files? I have added FILE /path/to/my/file to hobbitclient.cfg but still nothing happens. ===

'''A.'''  

You also need to add monitored files to client-local.cfg (This tells the client to send the file metadata to the server)
The server then uses the metadata and the config in hobbitclient.cfg to determine test results.
Also make sure hobbit has read access to the files.

===  How do I monitor log files other than the default ones?  ===

'''Answer 1'''  

&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;Kauffman, Tom&quot; &lt;KauffmanT@nibco.com&gt; 
 
&gt; On your hobbit server -
&gt; 
&gt; 1) set up etc/client-local.cfg to reference the logs you want AND any exclusions. For AIX, I have:
&gt; [aix]
&gt; log:/var/log/syslog:10240
&gt;         ignore 3004-004
&gt;         ignore 3004-035
&gt;         ignore 3004
&gt; log:/var/log/console.log:10240
&gt; log:/var/log/dsmsched.log:10240
&gt; 
&gt; 2) set up etc/hobbit-clients.cfg to create your alerting criteria. For AIX, I've got these set:
&gt; HOST=%.*
&gt;         LOG /var/log/syslog %.*crit.su.*to.root red
&gt;         LOG /var/log/syslog %.*crit.su   yellow
&gt;         LOG %/var/(adm|log)/console.log %.*not.responding.still.trying yellow
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Change client-local.cfg first. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for this to propagate to the client;
&gt; look for a file called logfetch.&lt;hostname&gt;.cfg in client/tmp. This should match your entries in
&gt; client-local.cfg.
&gt; 
&gt; Once the logs started to coming in, play with the client-local.cfg and a test system, to track
&gt; what you're interested in.
&gt; 
&gt; Tom
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''Answer 2.''' 
I have added LOG /path/to/my/logfile WARNING COLOR=yellow to hobbitclient.cfg but still nothing happens. 

You also need to add monitored log files to client-local.cfg.
This tells the client to send the log file to the server because Hobbit messages protocol is bi-directional, not just hobbit client sending message to server. hobbit server can actually instruct hobbit client to send in log files that are not default ones.

   The server then uses the sent data and the config in hobbitclient.cfg to determine test results. 
   Also make sure hobbit has read access to the log.

An example client-local.cfg file.

===  What's the meaning of the track alert-mail-number in the subject of hobbit alert emails ?   ===
'''A.'''  The number is the ack-code you can use for acknowledging the alert. 
   They are random numbers generated for each alert. 

===  How do I restrict access to Hobbit pages to specific people or groups ?   ===
'''A.'''  Apache has its own authentication. Use it. 
   To give one group access to some info, and another group access to other info, use the PAGE
   statement in bb-hosts. This will create a new directory for each page, which can be controlled
   by apache's authentication system.

===  I am having a problem with devmon ....  ===
'''A.'''  Please post devmon related questions to the devmon support mailing list. 

===  How do I create custom scripts and graphs ?   === 
'''A.'''  http://xymonton.org/tutorials:customgraph

=== Why does my custom graph only show in the trends column but not its own column ? ===
'''A.''' This is typical for tables. One must append the column name to the &lt;code&gt;--multigraphs&lt;/code&gt; setting.
#Look in the source file ''web/hobbitsvc.c''.
#*Find the &lt;code&gt;multigraphs&lt;/code&gt; assignment and note its value.
#Edit the configuration file ''server/etc/hobbitcgi.cfg'':
##Find the &lt;code&gt;CGI_SVC_OPTS&lt;/code&gt; assignment.
##Add a &lt;code&gt;--multigraphs=&lt;/code&gt; value to the assigned string, including the columns that tend to have tabular data. For example: &lt;pre&gt;CGI_SVC_OPTS=&quot;--env=/home/hobbit/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg --no-svcid --history=top --multigraphs=disk,if_load,if_dsc&quot;&lt;/pre&gt; (Note that, while the setting in ''hobbitsvc.c'' starts and ends with a comma, the setting in ''hobbitcgi.cfg'' does not.)
#Then try out the change (refresh the web page).
More details on &lt;code&gt;--multigraphs&lt;/code&gt; is in the hobbitsvc.cgi documentation. (''man hobbitsvc.cgi'')

===  I don't want to display column foo in my display. How do I do that ?   ===
'''A.'''  Add the entry NOCOLUMNS:foo,bar to hide column foo and bar. 

===  How do I check to ensure something is not running ?   ===
'''A.'''  In bb-hosts 
&lt;pre&gt;
1.2.3.4 my.host.com # !ftp 
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will cause the test to go red if FTP is running

===  I want to monitor Windows servers. How do I do that ?   ===
If you have to, use BBWin as your client. http://bbwin.sourceforge.net/

=== What are the translations between BBWin's XML and Central Mode? ===

===  I am having a problem with bbwin on my Windows......  ===
'''A.'''  Please post bbwin issues to the bbwin forum


The BBWIN client works well. I've re-used a script that funcioba before Big Brother. The result is left in C: \ BBWin \ logs.

Everything else is reported to the server but not external.

===  I set up my client, but nothing is appearing on the status page ?   ===
'''A.'''  Check the ghost client reports or the hobbitd status page. It could be misconfigured.

===  We are changing the name of a host, and want to keep monitoring it, and keep the history. Is there a way ?   ===
'''A.'''  Check the Hobbit Tips &amp; Trick page in help menu ~/server/bin/bb 127.0.0.1 &quot;rename OLDHOSTNAME NEWHOSTNAME&quot; 

===  I don't want to use rrdtool to create data averages and round-robin the data, I want to keep all data forever. Can I do it ?   ===

'''A.'''  There's a method of doing this in the current snapshot, including a new hobbitd_rrd manpage that describes how to run it,

   and what the input to your custom script looks like. 
   The option is --processor=COMMAND 
   It will feed the raw data via stdio into COMMAND 
   COMMAND can then process the data into another storage system.

=== Is it possible to disable and acknowledge alerts via email, how? ===

Include an &lt;tt&gt;IGNORE&lt;/tt&gt; '''exception''' with hosts or alert that you wish to ignore:

   HOST=* SERVICE=*
      IGNORE HOST=%[a-z]{3}[0-9]{4} 
      MAIL admin@foo.com

or perhaps more specific:

   HOST=* COLOR=red
      IGNORE HOST=marketing.foo.com SERVICE=cpu TIME=4:1500:1800
      MAIL admin@foo.com

and check configuration:

   $ cd ~/server
   $ ./bin/bbcmd hobbitd_alert --test tic0102 comm
   00026606 2012-03-01 10:52:51 *** Match with 'IGNORE HOST=%[a-z]{3}[0-9]{4}' ***
   00026606 2012-03-01 10:52:51 IGNORE rule found

=== Can I configure a maximum time limit a alert can be acknowledged for ? ===
'''A.'''  
=== Can I restrict what hosts can be disabled on the enable/disable page ? ===
'''A.'''

=== Can I enable/disable on only one display server and have it show on both? ===

Typical installations with dual display servers have them configured to act independently.  Each Xymon display server lists only itself in the &lt;tt&gt;XYMSERVERS&lt;/tt&gt; setting in &lt;tt&gt;xymonserver.cfg&lt;/tt&gt;, so usually, the enable/disable page only applies to the server that served the form.

However, the &lt;tt&gt;XYMSERVERS&lt;/tt&gt; value can be overridden for each CGI script, and the enable/disable form will send updates to all Xymon servers defined in &lt;tt&gt;XYMSERVERS&lt;/tt&gt;.  To override for enable/disable, perform the following.

Create the file &lt;tt&gt;xymonserver-enadis.cfg&lt;/tt&gt; containing:

  include /etc/xymon/xymonserver.cfg
  XYMSERVERS=&quot;display1 display2&quot;  # replace with IP addresses of Xymon servers

Then edit &lt;tt&gt;cgioptions.cfg&lt;/tt&gt; and add this line:

  XYMONENV_ENADIS=/usr/lib/xymon/server/etc/xymonserver-enadis.cfg

and modify &lt;tt&gt;CGI_ENADIS_OPTS&lt;/tt&gt; to reference the new variable:

  CGI_ENADIS_OPTS=&quot;--env=$XYMONENV_ENADIS&quot;

=== Can the SMS alert format be reconfigured to display more or less information ? ===
'''A.'''  Not directly, but an alert script ([http://xymonton.org/alerts:smsplus smsplus]) has been written to provide more information than the default
SMS output does.  The script can be easily modified using the following environment variables (from the hobbit documentation):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name !! Description
|-
| BBCOLORLEVEL	|| The current color of the status
|-
| BBALPHAMSG	|| The full text of the status log triggering the alert
|-
| ACKCODE	|| The &quot;cookie&quot; that can be used to acknowledge the alert
|-
| RCPT	        || The recipient, from the SCRIPT entry
|-
| BBHOSTNAME	|| The name of the host that the alert is about
|-
| MACHIP	|| The IP-address of the host that has a problem
|-
| BBSVCNAME	|| The name of the service that the alert is about
|-
| BBSVCNUM	|| The numeric code for the service. From SVCCODES definition.
|-
| BBHOSTSVC	|| HOSTNAME.SERVICE that the alert is about.
|-
| BBHOSTSVCCOMMAS || As BBHOSTSVC, but dots in the hostname replaced with commas
|-
| BBNUMERIC	|| A 22-digit number made by BBSVCNUM, MACHIP and ACKCODE.
|-
| RECOVERED	|| Is &quot;1&quot; if the service has recovered.
|-
| DOWNSECS	|| Number of seconds the service has been down.
|-
| DOWNSECSMSG	|| When recovered, holds the text &quot;Event duration : N&quot; where N is the DOWNSECS value.

'''A.''' Use the &quot;badTEST&quot; setting in bb-hosts (see the man-page). This delays
a yellow or red status from appearing until it has stayed yellow (or
red) for a number of test cycles. So you could use this to suppress the
yellow status until it had been yellow for some time, so when it does
turn yellow you know this is something you have to handle.

Or if your custom test reported a &quot;red&quot; status, you could make it go
yellow for the first 5 test cycles, and red after that.

&gt; Is the new Hobbit client compatible with the old BigBrother server?
&gt; BigBrother is run by a different part of the organization and I may not

&gt; z/VM systems, I would be interested in converting to the new Hobbit code.

In the default mode, you cannot use the Hobbit client to report to a Big
Brother system. No data would ever show up, because a Big Brother server
doesn't know how to feed the client data through the hobbitd_client
module, which takes care of converting the client data into status
columns.

However, you *can* run the Hobbit client in the local-configuration
mode. When the configure script asks
   Server side client configuration, or client side [server] ?
answer &quot;client&quot;, and the launch the client with the &quot;--local&quot; option.

In this mode, the client sends normal &quot;status&quot; messages to the Hobbit/BB
server. I'm not sure if alerts will work, though, since the Hobbit
client doesn't generate the &quot;page&quot; messages that the BB server expects
to trigger sending out alerts. (Hobbit ignores these messages
completely, so it did seem like a waste of time to generate them).

Note that this isn't really described very well anywhere. It means you
will have to maintain the client configuration on the client, not on the
Hobbit server.

Subject: Re: [hobbit] Hobbit newbie from BB: differences and what may I
lose from migrating?

Hi Jordan,

I'll try to answer your questions. Since I also develop Hobbit I am
probably slightly biased when it comes to the &quot;is-this-more-difficult-
to-do-than-with-BB&quot; type of questions, but I am sure others will
voice their opinions on that.

On Tue, Aug 01, 2006 at 12:36:29PM -0700, Jordan Mendler wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; First, after reading through whatever I could find on the website I am
&gt; still a little bit confused about configuration and setup. With BB,
&gt; you install and configure each client and server on the local machine,
&gt; except for the universal bb-hosts. Is this the same on Hobbit, or does
&gt; Hobbit use a central configuration file that is modified only on the
&gt; server to configure clients? I am trying to figure out the difference
&gt; between installing, maintaining and configuring BB and Hobbit setups.

First, let me stress that Hobbit is fully compatible with your existing
BB clients. You can keep your current client setup and just switch to
Hobbit on the server side, and all of your clients will continue to 
work as they do with BB as the server. So you can migrate the server
side first, and then migrate clients when you find that it is convenient
to do so - or you want to take advantage of some of the new stuff that
is in Hobbit.

The Hobbit client configuration is maintained on the Hobbit server. 
Clients in Hobbit are designed to be *really* dumb; they just collect
data, and all of the configuration of what to monitor, what thresholds
to use for e.g. disk utilization and so on is configured only on the
Hobbit server.

This is a major difference between Hobbit and BB. With BB you have
delegated the client administration to whoever manages each server.
Hobbit centralizes the monitoring configuration, so you will probably
have a group of people who take more control of the monitoring setup.

&gt; Hobbit looks a lot more complex to setup, but once I get my feet wet is
&gt; it any harder than BB?

I think it is easier, once you get used to the Hobbit way of doing
things. But as I said, I am biased.

&gt; Second is performance. I know this list may be biased toward Hobbit,
&gt; but is it actually faster? We have about 50-100 clients on BB and I did
&gt; not notice any performance issues.

With that number of systems monitored, you probably will not see a huge
difference. BB works quite well for a small number of systems, but when
you move beyond a couple of hundred boxes the overhead of generating 
webpages through shell scripts becomes very noticeable. On my setup,
the servers were simply choking on the disk I/O caused by BB saving
every status in a separate file, and from the huge number of small
cut-grep-awk-sed etc. commands that ran to generate webpages.

&gt; Hobbit looks like it is very complex, so does this mean it uses a lot 
&gt; of resources on the client and server? What speed/ram server is
&gt; usually the minimum recommended for a dedicated Hobbit server? Would
&gt; something like a dual Pentium II 266mhz have any performance issues 
&gt; as a server, if it does nothing else? What about for clients? We have
&gt; still have some testing, stating and production servers left that are
&gt; singe chip Pentium III 700-850 mhz, and even a couple Pentium II's. 
&gt; Just need to make sure all the resources used for things like graphs
&gt; are taken from the server and not each client.

The Hobbit server uses fewer resources than the BB server. The main
resource usage is memory; Hobbit keeps everything in memory except 
the history logs and the RRD files used for graphs. That doesn't mean
a whole lot, though: Here's a ps listing of the Hobbit processes running

on my main monitoring system - it handles about 2500 hosts:

As you can see, the biggest chunk of memory goes to the &quot;hobbitd&quot;
process which is the one that keeps all state information. It's
currently using some 31 MB of memory. (This box has 1 GB RAM).

A rough estimate of how much memory Hobbit needs would be the size of
your bbvar/logs/ directory, plus 30 MB.

As for CPU usage, your PII/266 should be adequate for 50-100 servers.
The box I'm running on is an old (7-8 years) Solaris server with a 
900 MHz UltraSparc II processor. That's roughly comparable to a PII
running at 1.2 GHz. And it handles 25 times as many hosts as you are
aiming for.

&gt; Third is plugins. Are BB plugins compatible with Hobbit?

Yes.

&gt; Also how hard are plugins to write for Hobbit? 

Plugins that run on the monitored client systems are as easy to write
as for BB, since it is basically the same thing.

Hobbit also allows you to write plugins for the Hobbit server, which
receive events from the Hobbit server daemon. This is used by the 
core Hobbit tools - e.g. the hobbitd_rrd processes you see in the
ps-listing above are a plugin that handle updating of the RRD files
from the status- and data-messages that are sent to Hobbit. There
aren't any third-party plugins that use this yet (at least, I 
don't know of any), but writing them is fairly simple since it 
basically involves reading data from a pipe and processing it in
whatever way you want.

&gt; I don't know if these even exist for bb, but I ultimately would 
&gt; like to integrate plugins that 1) monitor legato tape backup, 

Don't know about this.

&gt; 2) run nmap to see what ports are open/can be seen from an external 
&gt; machine, 

The Hobbit client in version 4.2 (about to be released soon) reports
details about the network services running on a host. So you can check
for which ports are open/listening for connections, and trigger alerts
if any unwanted ports show up.

&gt; 3) run 'lshw -html' to show a list of all the hardware on the system, 

This would typically be a client-side test.

&gt; 4) monitor uptime, 

This is standard.

&gt; 5) monitor OS and kernel versions (uname -a and head -n 1 /etc/issue),

This data is collected by the Hobbit client.

&gt; 6) maybe some more router/network monitoring stuff and 

Hobbit comes with built-in network service monitoring. There is also
an SNMP add-on which can be used for monitoring devices such as routers.

&gt; Fourth is relay. By this I mean monitoring systems on a private
&gt; subnetwork that are only accessible to the Hobbit server by going
&gt; through an intermediate server. Is this possible with Hobbit and is it
&gt; any more difficult to do than on BB?

Two ways of doing that. First, there is a proxy utility which is used
to forward Hobbit messages from one network to another. This is used if
your client systems on the private subnet are allowed to make outgoing
connections to the proxy, and the proxy can connect to the real Hobbit
server.

Second, Hobbit 4.2 includes a set of tools where it's the server that
contacts clients to pick up the data they have collected (i.e. the
traffic is initiated by the server, where the normal BB setup is for 
the client to initiate the connection). Useful for DMZ style setups
where clients are not allowed to generate outbound connections.

&gt; Fifth is portability. BB is very portable, I can make a 'model' client
&gt; for say Red Hat and tar it and distribute it very easily to every
&gt; server I have using only a few commands. Is Hobbit the same, or are there
&gt; client dependencies or other things that may make this more difficult.

The Hobbit client uses only the system libraries and standard utilities 
found on your client systems. You will need at least one system where
you can compile the client binaries (that's similar to the BB
requirements), since a few of the client-side tools are written in C.

Once you have a client compiled for an OS, it is as portable as any
binary that is dynamically linked on your platform. I.e. you can 
just copy it over as long as the same run-time libraries are available.

So far, we haven't managed to find any unix-like system that couldn't
run the Hobbit client. Including some rather odd ones. The current list
of client-side data collectors are

hobbitclient-aix.sh    hobbitclient-darwin.sh  hobbitclient-freebsd.sh
hobbitclient-hp-ux.sh  hobbitclient-irix.sh    hobbitclient-linux.sh
hobbitclient-netbsd.sh hobbitclient-openbsd.sh hobbitclient-osf1.sh
hobbitclient-sunos.sh

&gt; Sixth is development. How active is the development of Hobbit, how big
&gt; is the community, etc? How many people can attest to having fully
&gt; functional hobbit setups, how long has it been around and how often
&gt; are new releases usually made? 

Hobbit started back in late 2002 when it was called the &quot;bbgen toolkit&quot;.
It was renamed to Hobbit in March 2005 when it had developed into a 
complete replacement for BB. More details in the hobbit(7) man-page
available online at http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/manpages/

It is actively being developed by me, but people on this list have
made contributions of code. Some have picked up special projects
like the Windows client and run that completely on their own.
I'd say Hobbit currently has a very active user community, and
the development community is slowly growing beyond just myself.

There are currently 433 subscribers to the Hobbit mailing list.
According to the Sourceforge download statistics, it is downloaded
about 1000 times per month.
http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=128058&amp;ugn=hobbitmon&amp;type
=&amp;mode=year

There was a thread on the mailing list back in May about who uses
Hobbit. The results were summarized here:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/System_Monitoring_with_Hobbit/User_Guide#Wh
o_use_Hobbit_.3F

New releases have usually happened frequently - 2-4 times a year.
The current interval between the 4.1.2 release and version 4.2 is 
unusually long - a whole year. I don't expect that to happen again.


&gt; Also I saw something this morning about a Windows client -- how 
&gt; stable is that? 

From what I hear it should be usable. But you can stick with the
current BBNT client until it reaches version 1.0.

&gt; How stable is the Solaris version?

Rock-solid.


&gt; Is there a client for Mac OSX? 

Yes. It will run the Hobbit server also, if you want to.


&gt; Is Hobbit like BB in the sense that you can change paths to system 
&gt; binaries like grep and sed to allow easy use on other UNIXes like OSX?


Adding a client for a new OS will require implementing both a
client-side script to collect whatever data is interesting for this
system, and implementing the data parsing on the Hobbit server-side.
So it is somewhat more challenging. But since Hobbit already supports
all of the common Unix systems, I doubt that you will need to worry 
about that. If you do have a system which is not on the list, I will
help you with adding support for it.


&gt; When will 4.2 be officially released as a production version? 

Probably by the end of this week.


&gt; Since we have a working BB setup for now, I need to
&gt; decide if I should try to start migrating now or if I should wait some
&gt; time for Hobbit to develop more before I migrate from BB.

I don't think you have to wait. But it's for You to decide.

Henrik

=== How do I monitor HP-UX network log ? ===

&gt; HP-UX stores its network log in a binary file (/var/adm/nettl.LOG000) that

&gt; anyone have an EXT script to monitor it?  If so, could I have a copy?

Alternatively, you could modify the HP-UX client script to generate a
normal Hobbit &quot;msgs&quot; section with the text-output from the netfmt
command; then Hobbit can process it as if it were an ordinary text-based
logfile.

E.g. at the bottom of the hobbitclient-hp-ux.sh script running on your
clients, just before the &quot;exit&quot; command add this:

   echo &quot;[msgs:/var/adm/nettl.LOG000]&quot;
   netfmt ...whatever needs to go here to get the text-output ...

Then you can use a normal log-file entry on the Hobbit server to process
the log data.

=== Q. How do I enable RSS on hobbit server ? ===
'''A.'''
*  In the hobbitserver.cfg file, change the &lt;var&gt;BBGENOPTS&lt;/var&gt; variable from the following:

=== Q. How do I  configure SMF for hobbit on Solaris 10 ? ===
'''A.''' From: Everett, Vernon [mailto:Vernon.Everett@woodside.com.au]
For those of you familiar with Solaris 10, you should know about services, but for some, adding new ones is a little tricky.
To get Hobbit working as a sevice we need to do the following.

Create a file named /var/svc/manifest/application/hobbit.xml with the following content:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE service_bundle SYSTEM &quot;/usr/share/lib/xml/dtd/service_bundle.dtd.1&quot;&gt;

&lt;service_bundle type='manifest'name='Hobbit-monitor:hobbit'&gt;

&lt;service name='application/hobbit' type='service' version='1'&gt;
&lt;dependency name='filesystem' grouping='require_all' restart_on='none' type='service'&gt;

&lt;service_fmri value='svc:/system/filesystem/local'/&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency name='multi-user-server' grouping='optional_all' type='service' restart_on='none'&gt;
&lt;service_fmri value='svc:/milestone/multi-user-server' /&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;exec_method type='method' name='start'exec='/usr/lib/hobbit/client/runclient.sh start'
         timeout_seconds='10'&gt;
&lt;method_context&gt;
&lt;method_credential user='hobbit'/&gt;
&lt;/method_context&gt;
&lt;/exec_method&gt;
        &lt;exec_method type='method' name='stop' exec='/usr/lib/hobbit/client/runclient.sh stop'
         timeout_seconds='10'&gt;
&lt;method_context&gt;

&lt;/method_context&gt;
&lt;/exec_method&gt;

&lt;method_context&gt;

&lt;/method_context&gt;
&lt;/exec_method&gt;
        &lt;instance name='default' enabled='true' /&gt;
        &lt;stability value='Unstable' /&gt;
        &lt;template&gt;
&lt;common_name&gt;
&lt;loctext xml:lang='C'&gt; Hobbit Monitor Client &lt;/loctext&gt;

&lt;/common_name&gt;

&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;/service&gt;

&lt;/service_bundle&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Take note of lines 37, 47 and 57, the lines that start &quot;exec=&quot;. You may need to edit the path to your Hobbit start script.

To avoid confusion or possible issues, shut down your hobbit client at this point using the runclient script.

Now, as root, run the command
 #svccfg import /var/svc/manifest/application/hobbit.xml

We should now have a service called hobbit.
 #svcs | grep hobbit
 online 9:23:05 svc:/application/hobbit:default
(It will probably have gone online at this point)

You can now treat it as you would a regular service. If it hasn't gone online, kick it off as normal.
 #svcadm enable hobbit
It may be necessary to do a disable and then an enable, but that should get it going.

And because we have set the default as enabled, the service should start automatically when you do a reboot.

Confirm it's all good by doing
 # ps -efa | grep hobbit
All the usual scripts should be running.

If you don't want it as a service anymore, as root run
 #svccfg delete hobbit.
This will remove the service, and allow you to continue running it from the runclient script.

=== Q. How do I configure Hobbit Client for Solaris 10 using SMF ? ===
'''A.''' copied from http://xymonton.org/addons:hobbitsmf
&lt;pre&gt;
 These are service manifest files for Solaris 10. These will allow you to import the hobbit start
 and stop scripts for the server/client into the new Solaris Service Management Facility (Solaris 10
 replacement of /etc/rcN.d).

Installation

   1. mkdir -p /var/svc/manifest/application/monitoring/hobbit
   2. copy the client and server xml files to /var/svc/manifest/application/monitoring/hobbit
   3. import the service(s)

      svccfg import /var/svc/manifest/application/monitoring/hobbit/server.xml
      svccfg import /var/svc/manifest/application/monitoring/hobbit/client.xml

   4. enable the service(s)

      svcadm enable svc:/application/monitoring/hobbit/client:default
      svcadm enable svc:/application/monitoring/hobbit/server:default

  # Get the command we must run from the client config

  # If &quot;msgs&quot; is red and there is a command, run it
  if test &quot;$MSGSSTATUS&quot; = &quot;red&quot; -a &quot;$CMD&quot; != &quot;&quot;
  then
     $CMD

Before doing this, consider the security implications of having your
servers run commands that they fetch from a remote host without
authentication.

=== Q. How do I configure &quot;GROUP&quot; alerts ? ===


'''A.''' &quot;GROUP&quot; keyword is used in hobbit to classify many process name or disk partition name into different groups. This feature is needed in a big IT environment usually has different teams responsible for different areas of IT infrastructure. Ex. an IT organization usually consists of network,data/storage,backup, databases, application and Unix teams.

* hobbit-client.cfg : We need to specify which process will alert which GROUP.
* hobbit-alerts.cfg : In this file we then specify which email address receive the GROUP alert.

=== Example ===
This is simple setup for learning purpose.
Assuming when / is over 93% usage we want unix team to be paged.when /boot is over 15 percent apps team need to be alerted.
Also cron process is dead, Unix team should be alerted. when Xvnc is over 120 processes then apps team need to be alerted also.

==== hobbit-client.cfg ====
&lt;pre&gt;
HOST=t-rh9.mywork.com
        DISK / 93 98            GROUP=UNIX_TEAM_PARTITION
        DISK /boot 15 20        GROUP=APPS_TEAM_PARTITION
        PROC cron 1 -1 yellow   GROUP=UNIX_TEAM_PROCESS
        PROC Xvnc 1 120 yellow  GROUP=APPS_TEAM_PROCESS
        PROC defunct  0 0  red
        LOG /var/log/messages  WARNING COLOR=yellow
        LOG /var/log/maillog   WARNING COLOR=yellow
        LOG /var/opt/hobbitclient42/log/clientlaunch.log WARNING COLOR=yellow
        LOG /var/opt/hobbitclient42/log/hobbitclient.log  WARNING
        FILE /etc/passwd  SIZE&gt;0  OWNERID=root  COLOR=yellow
&lt;/pre&gt;
==== hobbit-alerts.cfg ====
The names after GROUP, have to be exact the same that are used in hobbit-client.cfg
&lt;pre&gt;
GROUP=UNIX_TEAM_PROCESS
     MAIL site02unix-admin-email@site02ad2141.mywork.com FORMAT=TEXT

GROUP=UNIX_TEAM_PARTITION
     MAIL site02unix-admin-email@site02ad2141.mywork.com FORMAT=TEXT

GROUP=APPS_TEAM_PROCESS
     MAIL site02unix-admin-email@site02ad2141.mywork.com FORMAT=TEXT

GROUP=APPS_TEAM_PARTITION
     MAIL site02unix-admin-email@site02ad2141.mywork.com FORMAT=TEXT
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Debugging ===
Hobbit provide a very powerful debugging tool to trace the alert rules. From following example we check a host against all the rules in hobbit-alert.cfg.

* How do I debug &quot;Oversize data/client msg&quot; error message?
** following is a example error message
&lt;pre&gt;

=== Q. How do I get trimhistory to work for a hobbit server on Solaris ? ===

'''A.''' The default example in [http://hobbitmon.sourceforge.net/docs/man8/trimhistory.8.html hobbit manpage] is for hobbit server on Linux.
* run bbcmd first to inherit BBHIST etc of variables.
* 31676645 is about 1 year of epoch time number.
* ./trimhistory --debug --cutoff=`/usr/bin/perl -e 'printf &quot;%d\n&quot;, (time-31676645);'`
* References : http://solarisjedi.blogspot.com/2006/06/solaris-date-command-and-epoch-time.html

=== Q. How do I exclude &quot;info&quot; and &quot;trends&quot; columns from the NK overview page? ===

'''A.''' As of Hobbitd 4.12 it is currently hard-coded that the &quot;info&quot; and &quot;trends&quot; columns show up on all pages, including the NK and BB2 pages. If you want those columns removed you'll have to edit the Hobbit source-code. The change is pretty simple. In the hobbit-4.1.2/bbdisplay/pagegen.c file, lines 121-123 look like this:
 /* TRENDS and INFO columns are always included on non-BB pages */
 if (strcmp(column-&gt;name, xgetenv(&quot;INFOCOLUMN&quot;)) == 0) return 1;
 if (strcmp(column-&gt;name, xgetenv(&quot;TRENDSCOLUMN&quot;)) == 0) return 1;
Change the &quot;return 1&quot; on both lines to &quot;return 0&quot;, save the file, run &quot;make&quot; and either run &quot;make install&quot;, or copy the bbdisplay/bbgen program to ~hobbit/server/bin/ . Next time the NK page is updated, those columns will be gone.

=== Q. How do I use the internal HTTP test feature of Hobbit to test a Squid proxy server? ===

'''A.''' If you want to check that the service is actually functional use something like this in your bb-hosts file:
 &lt;pre&gt;0.0.0.0   squid.domain.com   # http://squid.domain.com:8080/http://www.google.com/&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Q. How do I use the internal HTTP test feature of Hobbit to test a proxy server with authentication to a Windows domain? ===

'''A.''' If you want to check that the service is actually functional use something like this in your bb-hosts file:
 &lt;pre&gt;0.0.0.0   servername.domain.com   # \
    http://domain\username:password@servername.domain.com:8080/http://www.google.com/&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Q. How do I compare graphs from different hosts on one page? ===

'''A.''' As of Hobbitd 4.12 there currently isn't a  front-end to build the URL's needed for the graphs, but you can do it by hand for any graphs with ''-multi'' definitions (eg load average, swap):

# Find the base graph you want, e.g. the cpu &quot;load average&quot; graph for one of your hosts.
# In your browser, right-click the graph and select &quot;view image&quot; or &quot;open image&quot;. You now have a view of your load graph only.
# In the address bar field you'll see the URL for this image. E.g.
         &lt;pre&gt;http://hobbit.domain.com/hobbit-cgi/hobbitgraph.sh?host=host1.domain.com&amp;service=la\
&amp;graph_width=576&amp;graph_height=120&amp;disp=host1%2edomain%2ecom&amp;nostale&amp;graph=hourly&amp;action=view
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now, you can add more hosts after the &quot;host=...&quot; part of the URL - just list all of your hosts separated by commas. Like:
  &lt;pre&gt;http://hobbit.domain.com/hobbit-cgi/hobbitgraph.sh?host=host1.domain.com,host2.domain.com,\
host3.domain.com&amp;service=la&amp;graph_width=576&amp;graph_height=120&amp;disp=host1%2edomain%2ecom&amp;nostale&amp;\
graph=hourly&amp;action=view
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Q. I just upgraded from the BigBrother client to the Hobbit client and I don't get any status for CPU or disk, but I get status for other tests ===

'''A.''' Most common cause is that the hostname used by the client is different from the hostname you have in your bb-hosts file. On the client, what's the hostname reported by the &quot;uname -n&quot; command ? If that is different from the hostname you have in the bb-hosts file, start the client with the &quot;--hostname=THE.REAL.HOSTNAME&quot; option.
=== Q. How do I fix &quot;Oversize status msg from 192.168.1.31 for test.my.com:ports truncated (n=508634, limit=262144)&quot; ===
'''A.'''

Try to increase value of MAXMSG_STATUS in ~server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg :
&lt;pre&gt;
MAXMSG_STATUS
   The maximum size of a &quot;status&quot; message in kB, default: 256. Status
   messages are the ones that end up as columns on the web display. The
   default size should be adequate in most cases, but some extension
   scripts can generate very large status messages - close to 1024 kB.
   You should only change this if you see messages in the hobbitd log
   file about status messages being truncated.
&lt;/pre&gt;
limit=262144 is 256kB.  You can divide n value for 1024 (508634/1024 = 496) then you can set MAXMSG_STATUS=&quot;500&quot; and restart hobbit server. 

'''B.'''

&gt; First line: godzilla|sunos

&quot;godzilla&quot; - a Solaris host - sent a too-large &quot;client&quot; message of
815825 bytes. There's a limit set in Hobbit for the size of client
message at 512 KB, so the message was truncated.

This is interesting. If the truncated message caused hobbitd_client to
crash, I would have expected a different exit-code. I'll have to check 
how it handles truncated messages.

&gt; How can this happend?

Dont know, but apparently some input from your host caused it.

&gt; Has this been fixed in latest snapshot?

Probably not. Which version are you running?

&gt; Which worker process died? (hobbitd_client is still running)

It's restarted automatically by hobbitlaunch.

&lt;/pre&gt;
* We need to investigate why the hb client message is oversize. Like following we found we have msg.*.txt file that is over 512k. This is  abonormal for bb message sampling of a system.

&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00# wc msg.k206.test.com.txt
    7943   55662  611936 msg.k206.test.com.txt
bash-3.00# ls -l  msg.k206.test.com.txt
-rw-r--r--   1 hobbitc  hobbitc   611936 May  2 18:35 msg.v04k206.test.com.txt
bash-3.00#

&lt;/pre&gt;
* Further investigation  found that [ports] section of msg.*.txt has too many output from two &quot;netstat -na&quot; commands.
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-3.00# grep netstat /opt/hobbitclient42/bin/hobbitclient-sunos.sh
netstat -rn
echo &quot;[netstat]&quot;
netstat -s
netstat -na -f inet -P tcp | tail +3
netstat -na -f inet6 -P tcp | tail +5
bash-3.00#

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Q. I'ld like to change the default period for graph display: by default hobbbit displays trends with 4 graphs (48h,12d,48d,576d periods).  It is possible change it to 48h,7d,30d,365d for example ? ===

'''A.''' It isn't configurable, but in the hobbit-4.2.0/web/hobbitgraph.c file near the top of the file you'll find these lines:

  #define HOUR_GRAPH  &quot;e-48h&quot;
  #define DAY_GRAPH   &quot;e-12d&quot;
  #define WEEK_GRAPH  &quot;e-48d&quot;
  #define MONTH_GRAPH &quot;e-576d&quot;

Change them to suit you. Then search that same file for the HOUR_GRAPH
etc. further down; you'll find 1 place where each is used like this:

  period = HOUR_GRAPH;
  persecs = 48*60*60;

and you need to change that &quot;persecs&quot; calculation also for all 4 graph
types.

Change the legend:
  //persecs = 12*24*60*60;
  persecs = 7*24*60*60;
  //glegend = &quot;Last 12 Days&quot;;
  glegend = &quot;Last 7 Days&quot;;

Then run &quot;make&quot; (from the hobbit-4.2.0 directory) and &quot;make install&quot; 
(or just copy the &quot;web/hobbitgraph.cgi&quot; file to your ~hobbit/server/bin/ 
directory).

== Graph FAQ ==

=== Q. Why does my Hobbit server have the following http response graph ? ===
Why does the response time of the http service differ so much. Is this a mis-configured http server?&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:hobbitserver-http-time.png|A trending of http response time.]]

'''A.'''Hundreds of reasons could cause a delay on an http server. We see a graph differ only in a range between 2 and 10 ms. This is quite normal. Due to the automated scaling, the graph differences look more important or drastic than they actually are.

=== Q. My Hobbit server has the following wrsmd* network traffic trending graph ? ===
      
[[Image:hobbitserver-bge0-network-traffics.png|A trending of bge0 network traffic.]]

'''A.''',  Inbound traffic is much more than outbound, this is normal. The Hobbit server receives lots of bb/hb message from clients.

==== Q. What are those wrsmd* interfaces ?  ====
'''A.''',
The wrsmd(7D) (WCI Remote Shared Memory (WRSM) DLPI driver) status was reported 
by the Solaris 10 command &quot;/usr/bin/kstat -p -s '[or]bytes64'&quot; used for 
[ifstat] in hobbitclient-sunos.sh. I said &quot;was&quot; because on all our patched 
Solaris 10 servers, we have not seen this for quite a while.

You can avoid this output by using &quot;/usr/bin/kstat -p -s '[or]bytes64' | grep 
-v wrsmd | sort&quot; for [ifstat]. You need also to remove all ifstat.wrsmd*.rrd files.

==== Q. Graph after correction   ====
The wrsmd interfaces now disappeared from the graph.

[[Image:hobbitserver-bge0-network-traffics-corrected.png|A trending of bge0 network traffic without wrsmd* intefaces.]]

=== Q. How can we use Hobbit/BBWin client to collect Bit/s on the Network interfaces? ===
'''A.''',  I'm very interesting in this question, but have not found an answer yet.

== Error FAQ ==
===  semop failed, Invalid argument ? ===
'''A.''', Frequently seen when hobbit dies ungracefully. Stop Hobbit, and run, 
          # ipcs |grep hobbit
          0x0100ba76 162758665  hobbit    600        262144     2

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there, I was wondering who had added the link to my research page on Meta from Wikiversity so did some homework and noticed it was you! And you used my user page - I'm chuffed! Another Wikimedian left me a message on my talk page about my useful repository of links - well, that's what they're there for.. But I wanted to mention that the box that was on my page was lifted from [[:w:User:Seth_Ilys]] so you should probably give him credit for that (he's a prolific editor on en) rather than me. If you want to get back to me, [[:w:User_talk:Cormaggio|my user page on Wikipedia]] would probably be the best, since I'm pretty busy and don't visit wikibooks so often (I'll try to get more involved in Wikiversity on the future though).

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Lilious. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Lilious~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==The Second Industrial Revolution==
The 1920s saw a period of unprecedented industrial growth, known as the &quot;Second Industrial Revolution&quot;. The industrial nations of the world saw the conclusion of a major shift in their primary energy source from coal to oil.  As well as providing cheaper and more abundant energy, which greatly stimulated economic growth, this shift had important geopolitical consequences.  Britain and France became deeply engaged in the countries of the Middle East to protect their petroleum supplies.  Japan similarly found itself dependent on overseas oil, specifically from Indonesian and Malay sources.  Russia and the United States were largely self-sufficient in oil during this period.  However, tensions and disputes over oil production regions and sea lanes, most notably those of Japan, would have a great influence on the outbreak and course of the Second World War (Adolf Hitler sought to seize Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus, while the Japanese justified their attack on Pearl Harbor by claiming that the United States was moving to choke off its supplies by sea).

Many consumer goods such as [[w:car|cars]] and radios were produced for the first time on an industrial scale, especially in the United States, where new highways and suburban home developments sprang up to accommodate the growing economic output.  The combination of inexpensive chemical fertilizer and mechanized harvesting saw agricultural productivity surge in many regions of the world, providing the basis for the twentieth century's exponential leap in world population.  Centralized, industrial agriculture had its dangers, however, as was seen in the Soviet Union, with the Bolsheviks' destruction of the independent peasant farmers and the great famine which Stalin deliberately caused in Ukraine for political reasons.

==The Great Depression==
One of the worst events of this period was the Wall Street Crash, which took place in 1929. A speculative bubble in stock market prices during the 1920s came to an end and investors (many of whom had borrowed money to buy stock) panicked, causing the US stock market to collapse. Millions were thrown out of work, and thousands of banks collapsed worldwide over the next three years.  The simplest explanation for the cause of the Depression was too much industrial output and not enough liquid currency to purchase all the goods produced.  There was no destruction of factories or other physical disaster; rather, the losses caused by the stock market crash magnified themselves across the global economy, as companies found themselves unable to sell their output to other firms which had been ruined.  Bread lines and economic refugee movements appeared in many countries.  

In hard-hit Germany, both Communists and Adolf Hitler's Nazi party assailed the centrist democratic government for failure to deal with the economic crisis and, in Hitler's case, for not restoring Germany to its pre-World War I great power status.  Hitler emerged the victor in this political contest, becoming Chancellor with help from high-placed conservatives who thought they could manage and control the Nazis.  Within a year and a half, however, Hitler had wiped out most opposition to his rule.

During this period, the Soviet Union, with its closed state-run economy, was insulated from the effects of the free-market crisis.  The brutal purges and political repression of dictator Josef Stalin, however, brought misery of a different kind on a great scale.  Paranoid and seeing enemies everywhere, Stalin reached unchallenged power by 1929 and soon began herding entire classes of people — peasant farmers, dissident Communists, non-Russian nationals — into the prison camp system known as the Gulag, on various flimsy pretexts.  Those who didn't perish from exposure, malnutrition or disease essentially became slaves of the Communist rulers, who needed large amounts of forced labor as they tried to forcibly industrialize the backward Soviet economy to match the West.

==Roosevelt and the &quot;New Deal&quot; in the U.S.==
Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as President of the USA in 1932, and promised to sort out the USA's problems with his &quot;New Deal&quot;. He introduced a wide range of social and economic policies to stimulate the American economy and raise standards of living through government intervention in the economy.  This was a major break with the values, deeply held by many in the U.S., that private business and industry should flourish or fall free from public influence.  Although many people criticized the New Deal when it was introduced, it did do a lot to help millions of Americans - for example, hundreds of schools, hospitals and roads were built by the Public Works Administration, one of the new agencies set up by Roosevelt.

==Improving World History==
Since both the [[U.S. History]] and the [[World history]] book are part of the same license, it is fair to copy and paste the text onto either book.   Feel free to do so. --[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 03:04, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Yes, the odds are minute. But, here's the thing, Charlie, even if you increase the odds of winning to 99.99999999% YOU STILL LOSE ON AVERAGE. Why?
Because the payout on high percentage bets is exeedingly low. In fact, when you account for a built in house edge/pay-to-play/bookie-cut, you are actually losing a small but real portion of your stake each bet. 
You may win some, you may lose some, the laws of large numbers dictate that if you play long enough your wallet will eventually be empty. That you can bet on! --[[User:Shmeedogg|Shmeedogg]] 01:14, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

Hi,

I cannot in any way see this as a wikibook for edutacional and academic purpouses. Also, you call it 100% complete, whilst it is mereley one page, and not a book at all. What do you mean with doing this? Have you not read the policies of the wikibooks?

Take a look at the [[Wikibooks:About|about page]], and please reconsider your book. --August 09:50, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

== [[Car Terms]] ==

Any particular reason this needs to be split into a total of four pages so far, when one would have sufficed? I find it best to use a minimum number of pages, then only split it, if it's getting too long. Furthermore, if you should need to create subpages, please follow the conventions on the page [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]]. Thankyou. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 16:20, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

== Re: [[Car Terms]] ==

''If the book expands, it will be necessary to split it into sections;''

: Indeed. '''If''' the book expands. Perhaps you should wait to see how long it gets before making the decision as to split it. Also at this time, you will have a better idea of where a good place to split it would be. Leaving it on one page, using a '==' heading for each term would allow for easy linking via &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Car Terms#ABS|ABS]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This way you don't have to remember which page number it's on. Page numbering is generally frowned upon.

''furthermore, short pages take less time to load. Remember that we don't all have broadband yet!''

: With text data, this is a negligable consideration, and probably unwise to model the book based on technical considerations. Generally we split pages which are over 32k (the system will warn you when this is the case), although a small hardcore of users belive it's always preferable to have the book in a single page to make it easy to print.

''How would you recommend naming the sections?''

: According to the provisional policy, one of two conventions is currently acceptable. &lt;code&gt;bookname/pagename&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bookname:pagename&lt;/code&gt;. The former has the advantage of automatically creating a link on the subpage back to the main page. In addition, you can extend the hierarchy if necessary to &lt;code&gt;bookname/sectionname/pagename&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bookname:sectionname:pagename&lt;/code&gt;. The former will then create a link back to the section and the book.

''If it gets big enough, one section for each letter of the alphabet might be a good idea - then something would always stay in the same section. Let me know what you think... [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 16:25, 12 July 2005 (UTC)''

: That would seem reasonable when it becomes necessary, and would allow for people to easily link via &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Car Terms/A#ABS|ABS]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 16:49, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

== Vote for deletion ==

Hi, I just thought that I would remind you that you forgot to sign you vote to delete Ardvark the Aardvark on the [[WB:VFD]] page. If you get a chance, would you sign it, because your vote won't count without it. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 12:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

== Becoming an admin on the Wikibooks Simple English ==

I see that you are trying to become an administrator with Simple English Wikibooks.  I hope that you have had some good luck in this area.  If not, I would strongly recommend that you take a look at [[meta:Steward|the Steward page on Meta]] to ask one of the folks there for some help.  I would also strongly suggest that you &quot;e-mail this user&quot; rather than try to use the talk pages, although the stewards will more than likely respond.  I totally agree with you that Simple English needs an admin, and if you are willing to do the work, put in the request.  There is no admin nomination page for that wiki either, so it is fertile ground to try and get it organized more properly.

I've also taken a glance around and there appears to be a couple of pages that need to be deleted as well.  So there is some cleanup work that needs to be done as well.  Contact the stewards to see if they can get you set up as an admin for Simple English Wikibooks  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:58, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

: From experience, you should also get a fairly swift response (&lt;24h) by using the official [[m:Requests for permissions]] page on Meta. There's usually at least one admin watching the page who can get things sorted out. It would probably be polite to use this page prior to contacting a specific steward, since this page is also watch by the developers who have even more power than stewards. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:59, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

This is a simple rice pudding recipe, dating to at least 1965, in Columbus Ohio USA.  

== Ingredients ==
*3/4 gallon(12 cups) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*2/3 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3 cups cooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (brown rice works as well as, if not better than, white rice)
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] or [[Cookbook:Zante currant|Zante currants]], if desired
*[[Cookbook:Cinnamon|Cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]] to taste
*[[Cookbook:Cardamom|Cardamom]] to taste if desired. (Approximately 1/8 teaspoon (US) for this serving size.  Add with other spices).

== Procedure ==
#Mix milk, eggs, sugar in a large(about 3 quart) casserole dish until thoroughly mixed and frothy.  
#Mix in cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  
#Mix in rice, then put in raisins.  Do not mix in raisins, or they will all wind up on the bottom!
#Place casserole in a larger baking pan with about 1 inch of water. This will keep the bottom from cooking too fast and burning.
#Bake in a 325 degree oven until set(about 1.5 hours).

==Notes==
Putting less milk than rice in the dish will cause the milk to evaporate, thus creating a rice dish, rather than a pudding. For every cup of rice, 1/4 gallon(2 to 3 cups) of milk should be added.

'''Microwave Risotto'''. This risotto is made using the [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]]. It requires
very little stirring and turns out quite well.

==Ingredients==

*3 cups simmering hot chicken broth
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*dash ground white or black pepper
*2 tablespoons butter
*2 tablespoons olive oil
*1/2 cup minced yellow onion
*1 cup uncooked medium grain rice

==Procedure==

#In a saucepan, bring chicken broth, salt and pepper to a low simmer, keep warm until needed.
#In 8&quot; x 8&quot; x 2&quot; an oven proof dish (or 10&quot; [[Cookbook:Quiche|quiche]] dish), heat oil and butter in microwave for 2-minutes.
#Add minced onion to the oven proof dish, stir to coat with oil, cook in microwave for 4-minutes.
#Add uncooked rice to the oven proof dish, stir to coat with oil, cook in microwave for another 4-minutes.
#Pour simmering chicken broth into the oven proof dish and stir well. Microwave 9-minutes. 
#Stir rice and chicken broth well and microwave another 9-minutes.
#If a creamier risotto is desired, add 1/4-cup warm water, stir well and microwave for another  2-minutes. 

Makes 3 main dish servings or 6 side dish servings.

==Notes, tips and variations==

#For a 750-watt microwave, use 100% power settings for each time interval. For 1000 or 1500-watt microwaves, use 70% power settings for each time interval.
#As a variation, use 2 1/2-cups chicken broth and 1/2-cup white wine.
#Freshly grated Parmesan cheese may also be added after cooking.

Hello Jimmy, I'm amazed with what you are doing in the mathematics School. I think you are doing a great job. I have no almost Idea about mathematics, but I'd like to help you if you have some doubt about how Wikimedia works.
May i give you some advises about the work to do? (they are just some opinions of my own, don't take them as if i were the commander who you must obbey, ok? :)
*Wikiversity is a baby so we don´t really know what it is going to be. It depends mostly on our work. 
*We must be careful so that we don´t make a mess. I mean, I think we should be careful making a clear distinction between the Wikiversity contents and the contents from other wikis. But, don´t forget that they exist and wikiversity may/should/have to/or even must get profit of their contents in order to save time and to make them more useful. Ah, of course, i also think that external links may always be very useful when Wikis do not cover an specific area.

*Another idea i had about Wikiversity is that we may enable discussion forums for the students where they may ask specific questions. The forums could be the discussions pages of each page in Wikiversity. It seems obvious, but I think it is very important.

So, until here, some ideas. I only wanted to share them with you, but, I will be glad to read your opinions, (excuse my terrible English, I'm spaniard)Chao, and continue with your great job. --[[http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuario_Discusi%C3%B3n:Javier_Carro Javier Carro]] 13:21, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

==How can we solve the problem to separate School and resources?==
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that you would save much time if the theory part of the courses is filled with links to Wikibooks and articles of Wikipedia dealing with those topics, or with pedagogical resources of internet. I think that the content to study has got a right place in both projects. Wikiversity could be the place to meet those who want to study these topics and where may be described what a person may study, how, in which way, where can this person search for answers, ...

I don't want to discourage you at all. You do it great, but i think that in a wikischool we don't need to follow the same patterns as in a conventional school sometimes. For example, if somebody wants to learn maths, but he doesn't have the time to do it in a semester, as it is said in the divisions stablished by the conventional educational system, they should be able to study in the Wikiversity anyway, what do you think so? It's just my opinion, but in general terms your work is great. Continue, we will see the results in a few years of a free education which breaks many borders :) --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 13:11, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

I think the idea of problems, questions, answers and solutions is great. --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 13:14, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Yes, you should do it as you think so. Eventhough, sometimes, you may consider adding some link to support your course with optional resources, for those who want to contrast different views or to complement, somehow as if it were additional bibliography.--[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 13:34, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Content issues ==
Jimmy, you seem to be duplicating a lot of content. That in itself is not a big deal, it seems to be the norm here so that's not really the issue. The problem is that we should be trying to include as much of the differing content here as possible, to go in the Wikiversity sections, perhaps. I'd like to move your [[Wikiversity:Pure Mathematics]] sections elsewhere, but I don't want to do this in case I move it to a name you don't like. Do let me know what name you'd prefer, or you could move the stuff yourself. I'd like to rework the Pure Mathematics section to integrate all the existing content and add room for expansion [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:35, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Firstly, please sign your posts. Secondly, I'm talking about pages like [[Pure Mathematics 4]] which says nothing that it involves integration. I'm not trying to obliquely make a reference to your work ,but since everyone here seems to go off and write their own books, then what we can do is have a gatewy page for the Pure Math section or whatever, or have another seperate gateway page, and link to all the books and courses. Or we can simply pool resources and work on the content we have. I don't know.

But for the moment, we should make the several content pages as compartmentalized as possible, and that means that your pages such as [[Pure Mathematics 4]] should be moved. If you want to create a title for your structure, you can either let me know (&quot;Pure Mathematics&quot;?) and I'll move them, or you can move them yourself.

: ''An utterly ignorant or utterly lazy man, if possesed of a little ingenuity, can with the help of a dictionary and grammar give a word-for-word rendering, whether intelligible or not, and print 'Translation' on his title-page. On the other hand it is a melancholy spectacle to see men of high ability and undoubted scholarship toil and struggle at translation under a needless restriction to literality, as in intellectual handcuffs and fetters, when they might with advantage snap the bonds and fling them away ...'' &amp;mdash; ''Preface, First Edition, July 1902: N.T. in Modern Speech'' by R.F. Weymouth.

: ''More than any book in the New Testament this [Gospel of John] calls aloud for isolated study, that by candid, fearless, and reverent thinking its secret may stand disclosed.'' &amp;mdash; ''Introduction, First American Edition, 1943: N.T. in Modern Speech'' by R.F. Weymouth; revised, J.A. Robertson.

: ''He whose will and desire in conversation is to establish his own opinion, even though what he says is true, should recognize that he is sick with the devil's disease. And if he behaves like this only in conversation with his equals, then perhaps the rebuke of his superiors may heal him. But if he acts in this way even with those who are greater and wiser than he, then his malady is humanly incurable.''  &amp;mdash; ''The Ladder of Divine Ascent'' by Saint John Climacus Step 4, paragraph 48.

: ''We desire that books be looked after most carefully as the continual food of our souls, and that they be written [fieri] with the utmost diligence, so that we may preach the Word of God by the work of our hands, since we cannot do so with our mouths.'' &amp;mdash; Guigo, Prior of Grande Chartreuse in Carthusian ''Consuetudines''. (1127)

: ''We think we know what a verse says because we have read it or heard it so many times. Then when we find it quoted in a book, we skim over it and miss the full meaning. Therefore I have deliberately used paraphrases in order to help you see God's truth in new, fresh ways. English-speaking people should thank God that we have so many different versions to use for devotional reading. Also, since the verse divisions and number were not included in the Bible until 1560 A.D., I haven't always quoted the entire verse, but rather focused on the phrase that was appropriate. My model for this is Jesus and how he and the apostles quoted the Old Testament. They often just quoted a phrase to make a point..'' &amp;mdash; ''The Purpose Driven Life,'' by Rick Warren, Zondervan: 2002, pg. 325.

: ''It would be true to character if Pope Benedict were to invest all his zeal in the effort to recast the concept of the divine incarnation in a new language, which would once again render it understandable to modern-day theologians, teachers and intellectuals.'' &amp;mdash; ''Pope Without A Country,'' 4-30-05: New York Times Online.

= About Me =

Welcome, I arrived on my birthday, April 5, this being the 63rd recurrence. My primary concern is the Modernity Version of the New Testament, secondarily, the definition of omnificence, who, what and wherefore that unique word, and thirdly, could expand on [[Pharmacognosy]]. A vision from God appeared in my rain soaked study Bible in 1991. On the quoted Ladder of Divine Ascent, it must rank as a 10. I would consider myself eligible to moderate a spiritual Wikipedia project.

= Project =

We, the Wikipedia/WikiChristian Bible people translate/paraphrase the N.T. within the Weymouth tradition. I set the rules with the first two chapters of the Gospel of John and we see what develops as each verse starting with John 2:23 is up for edit. Unlock the secret, possibly, reverent thinking, definitely. THE RULES: Eliminate the seeming anti-semitism &amp;mdash; appears to be regional strife &amp;mdash; that is, Galilean against Judean supremacy. This requires [http://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/greek/johnpap.html Judean(s)] for Jew(s). Racial epithets invariably are harsh sounds like the N word, Jew (boy), Wop, Slob, Injun, or Chink. &quot;Jews&quot; is emblematic, why not the more historically sound and melodic, Jew-dee-ans? There are 101 believes in John (KJV). Retain &quot;believe&quot; instead of Weymouth's &quot;trust,&quot; &quot;regards,&quot; or &quot;convinced.&quot; The watchword could be I AM [That I Am] He, rather blasphemous in that day. Order of Gospels should be JOHN, MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE, and ACTS. What better in the beginning than &quot;In the beginning?&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia says John had sometimes been first in order in earlier times because of the surety of authorship (or statement of eye-witness account). The Epistles of Paul in historical order, is there a split Timothy movement, there is an outline in Weymouth? Make St. John, &quot;the greatest marvel of all the world's literature,&quot; more literary and the most important letters in history more historical, if it happens, this would be a testament to the communion of minds available here and, come on, your particular verse may live forever. Change British spelling and Elizabethan phraseology of Weymouth (sometimes all that is required). Highlight Aramaic origin (at least once). Explain John 7:53, make consistent figures of speech and capitalization throughout, i.e. Life of the Ages (3rd edition Weymouth) = eternal Life (5th edition). I love John's theology, although his discourses are somewhat repetitious. Matthew, Mark and Luke are open source, you can discuss Alpha and Omega till Kingdom come and, wala, Wikibook? Gender neutral when possible. John is the Book of Signs, use &quot;signs&quot; for quoting that word when spoken and substitute, miracles, for the running commentary. Plan to reconstruct an icon &quot;the truth&quot; in Greek of the P52 fragment as the ultimate visual image of the earliest New Testament manuscript. Each new verse will follow Weymouth 5th edition, minor changes have already been made with problem words for the sake of consistency. Bracketed [text] is termed explanatory apposition or inline footnote, could be read not said. Need only three such notes in the Gospel of John, initiate the ultimate Word play, add a touch of the miraculous, and send everybody home. John as a Gospel evidences considerable play on words, punning, and irony, such irony they say, that the &quot;very Christ&quot; (7:26) is proclaiming the Word all about with total impunity.

== An Actual Comment(s) ==

You know, the more common place to put this stuff is in your User Page, rather than your talk page.  I'd move it for you, but you'd probably get mad.  [[User:64.198.97.66|64.198.97.66]] 19:17, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Thank you for your courtesy. This is an experiment, I just finished the layout, you found it before I was ready to publicize. I am a newbie, so maybe I won't publish at all. I have to contact the initiator of [[John 20:16]] and get his thoughts about Wikibook possibilities. [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] 00:21, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Come back [[User:64.198.97.66|64.198.97.66]]. How very fitting if the first verse (2:23) was edited anonymously, sure, there will be protocol for review with later verses, but if you feel the urge and accept the challenge, change the two words suggested, underline &quot;believers&quot; and leave your comment in the temporary (Discussion Start) section for the record. Even more fitting, it would be from the Avalon (High) School of Biblical Research, so well known in eccleciastical circles.

Thanks Dr. Prab, my image would have had copyright problems, this is even better, outstanding, and the caption still represents the quest for the truth in religious modernity or post-modernity which years past may have fragmented. How did you find the verso so quickly, did you notice my initials came off that fragment also. This is monumental, is it possible to put the interlinear text on the image page, not sure about text on those pages?

I put the Greek from K.C. Hanson translation in Word, (Note: no Greek characters in WikiChristian software) cannot paste to wiki. Will keep working on it and post it to the Image_talk whenever.

===Non-denominational===

Glad to help, one of the things I'm working on is moving some of the more cumbersome links to easier to find ones (e.g., moving &quot;What does salvation mean?&quot; to simply &quot;salvation&quot; since someone is far more likely to type that into the search bar). ---- 08:36, 26 Apr 2005 (PDT)

= Annotation of N.T. (Discussion Start) =
Why change the verse?
example &amp;mdash; 2:23 Judeans do sometimes designate their celebrations as Festivals. Suggest return to original &quot;Feast&quot; and maybe &quot;witnessing&quot; instead of watching miracles. Passover revolves around the food or festive meal, others could be, for example, Celebration of Tabernacles.

= Constructive criticism, if wanted =
The translation below is rather free. We are dealing here with the Word of God! Therefore explanations belong into a commentary, not into the text (that's not just my view, that's even a pre-Christian tradition). If the syntax requires words to be supplied that are not in the Koine, then they should be placed in brackets, e.g. &quot;creative power&quot; in Jn 1:3 - that's apart from missing in this verse the difference betweeen &quot;to come&quot; and &quot;to become&quot; (when a bus comes along, hurray, but it has been in existence before it came into view...), and changing a negative into a positive statement. In v. 6 the translator introduces an appearance but drops a pregnant sending. In v. 7 the sending itself replaces the more humble came - humble, since this time it is the bus-type coming, not the being created one. Next a Semitism, a tell-tale literary feature, has been eliminated: &quot;witness that he might witness&quot;. These few examples of liberties in the translation convince me that its value is limited to a literary exercise. The translator of the text below cannot be regarded as a servant of the original, I mean servant like doulos, you know: like Mary, like David, like in Isaiah?!!!

==General Comments (below)==

== Re: Book of the Month ==

Thanks for correcting my mistake, I copy-pasted and forgot to change month name.

Now everything is ok - the issue is with Wikimedia caching system - sometimes you have to reload page several times to see changes in templates used in it. Generally, if page and template used in it say something different, what you see in template is true. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 15:47, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

== What is Wikibooks ==

I changed WIW according to your suggestions. I'm not American so I am sometimes not aware of some small but vital details (like about educational system). --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:33, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

==Regarding Gospel 101 Translation==
I accept the suggested task.  It will take me a while. Thanks! [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 07:31, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:I wanted to let you know, I have decided to drop the gospel translation class for the moment.  When I attempt it I get a lot of free associations that dogmatic believers might find heretical and I do not wish to expend the energy at the moment arguing with them.  I am attending adult sunday school and relearning the basics from an adult perspective.  Perhaps in a year or two I will be better prepared to venture into open discussion /debate on a public wiki such as this.  Thanks for the opportunity! [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 02:03, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

== Speedy Delete ==

I have posted a reply to the thread at '''[[User talk:Kernigh#Speedy Delete]]'''. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:28, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

== Deleting content on [[Christianity]] Wikibook ==

I'm sorry if it seemed arbitrary on the VfD.  This really was a legitimate place to have a speedy delete of the module, which really didn't have any content at all.  The sum total content of the page under dispute earlier was &quot;There is no wikipage about this.&quot;  I hardly consider that content worth keeping.  I am not trying to condemn the idea of the Christianity Wikibook, and indeed I have been a general defender of the concept.  I just felt that this one module needed rapid resolution as there was nothing to fight over.

I hope you continue to develop this Wikibook.  Don't take my deletion of one page as a slight against the Christianity Wikibook in general.  Keep up the very excellent work you have been doing here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:07, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

== An invitation ==

Please take a look at http://christianity.wikia.com and consider joining our project! --[[User:70.25.244.31|70.25.244.31]] 07:27, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:22, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Christianity]] and such ==

I sent a message to [[User:TeamZissou]], telling him that his actions are not correct, that he can't just delete content, and that he needs to work towards a solution as per [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]. You need to do the same. Add your table of prophesies back into the page (because it was improperly deleted), and make a message on the corresponding talk page ''and'' on [[User:TeamZissou]]'s talk page stating that the table has been reinserted, and that it should not be removed again without discussion first. [[User:TeamZissou]] has been warned, and if he causes more problems, we will be blocked. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:59, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== bold edits on recent changes page ==

A long time ago you asked why some edits on the recent changes page ( [[Special:Recentchanges]] ) were in bold.
I finally [[User_talk:DavidCary#Lord.27s_Table | figured out why]].
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 01:41, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

== Minor Changes ==
I have changed the phrases using 'me chamo' to 'chamo-me' and 'tchau' to 'adeus' as the former strikes me as Brazilian rather than European.  If someone has some evidence to show that the former usage is becoming more common in Portugal I would appreciate seeing it as I've never once heard that from a Portguese person (though I have not yet had the opportunity to visit Portugal istelf).  


== Giving some help here ==

I'm from Brazil, so I'm just revising everything here and fixing some things that sounded very unnatural. If any help is needed in further development of the course, please state this here.
Thanks





i've renamed this Lesson One, Saying Hello, just to tell people what's going to be taught.

== Transcription ==

Hi,
I don't know Portuguese at all. I try to begin from here but there is no pronunciation of the words. I think there are some peculiarity. For example: você - [vo`ke] or [vo`se] (as Complete Pronunciation says about letter c) or something other? Eu - [oi] (as German) or [eu] or ...?&lt;BR&gt;
I think it will be more clear if some native speaker add pronunciation to the words. No matter how easy for one part of world is to pronounce, some other part of the world may have difficulties.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Yasin. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Yasin~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">A 'gripper' is a component of the robot used to manipulate an object loose from the robot itself. This can be a ball it needs to pick up, or the dirty socks it was programmed to find and dispose of. Grippers exist in many varieties ranging from simple; a thong-like design to complex arms.

How complex your robot's gripper has to be depends on what it's supposed to do with it. Picking up a ball requires a different approach than picking up socks.

== Kind of grippers ==
Grippers are commonly modeled after tools, machines or the human hand. The choice behind a gripper doesn't differ much from the choice of the tool on a excavating machine, forklift, crane or other machine.

== Scoops ==

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Flat Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Raised scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Raised Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Scoops are very simple 'grippers'. These can be flat, flat with raised edges or more complicated shapes. These 'grippers' are easily to control as they can be build with minimal moving parts: being able to move up and down is sufficient for many purposes. Forward Tilting is common too and may be necessary to 'unload' the scoop.

== Tongs ==
Tongs are more complicated than scoops but allow better control over what is picked up. For example: with a scoop it's very hard to pick up a glass and put it down somewhere else. With a tong-like gripper this is trivial.
Otherwise is it much harder to move a ball with a tong than with a scoop.

Tongs differ in the number of fingers and their shape. Most tongs have 2 fingers, one of those could be fixed.

=='Hands'==

[[File:CACM-film81jpg.jpg|thumb|Robot Gripper]]


Many designs for robot hands have been tried including quite anthropomorphic hands.  

Robotics has also led to a renewed interest in the 'design' of the human hand.  The asymmetry of the human hand and in particular the fact that a rod like object gripped in the hand naturally falls at about &lt;math&gt;45^\circ&lt;/math&gt; to the axis of the hand givews much greater flexibility in tool use than a symmetrical design would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink=I.A.Kapandji |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The Physiology of the Joints, Volume One|origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition=Fifth |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=Church Livingstone  |location= |language=en |isbn=0-443-02504-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=278 |chapter= |chapterurl=|quote=..the tool can only be properly oriented for use when the handle runs obliquely with the axis of pronation-supination   }} &lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Degrees of Freedom==

Grippers also differ in their degree of freedom. Basicly there are 6 degrees of freedom: 3 translations and 3 rotations. See [[Theoretical Mechanics]] about these degrees of freedom.

But generally, unless you're building an arm, you wouldn't need all 6 degrees of freedom (DOF). You get one DOF for free on a mobile robot: it can already move forwards and backwards on its own. Although adding gripper movement along this direction will increase your robot's accuracy, it's not really necessary.

How many DOF you need depends on how complicated the movement of your robot has to be. If it only needs to pick up a glass and move towards a goal and put it down again, it would be sufficient to make a gripper that can tilt back (towards the robot).

If you intend that your robot will have to be able to pick up Lego blocks and build a structure with them, you'll need more DOF.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A short note on the purpose of this section==
This section is intended as a Psychology 101 level introduction to mental disorders. For a more complete course of study, go to the PSY 2065 section.

•	Criteria for defining psychological disorders depend on whether cultural norms are violated, whether behavior is maladaptive or harmful, and whether there is distress.
•	The medical model describes and explains psychological disorders as if they are diseases.
•	The vulnerability-stress model states that disorders are caused by an interaction between biological and environmental factors.
•	The learning model theorizes that psychological disorders result from the reinforcement of abnormal behavior.
•	The psychodynamic model states that psychological disorders result from maladaptive defenses against unconscious conflicts.
•	Psychologists use objective and projective tests to assess psychological disorders.

==What Is Abnormal?==
Abnormal Psychology is the study of psychological differences from the norm. Usually this means disorders, but also includes mental deviances that are still considered unusual, but do not seriously affect a person's functioning. 
A disorder is defined as a mental trait or other facet of mental functioning that occurs in the minority of the population and is detrimental to the well being of the self or of others.

See: [[../Criticisms of Psychology/]] for some critiques of this concept.

==The diagnostic systems==
===What is the diagnostic systems?===
Among the mental health professions (marriage and family therapy, clinical social work, professional counseling, psychology, and psychiatry) different diagnostic systems are used. The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is used in the USA. It is issued by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Outside the USA the most used system is the ICD (International Classification of Diseases [http://www3.who.int/icd/vol1htm2003/fr-icd.htm]). This is issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). 

The current editions of the systems are DSM-V and ICD 10.

===Types of Disorders===

==Disorders Diagnosed in Early Childhood= Note: the DSM-V no longer differentiates between adult onset and childhood onset disorders. This section needs major revision.
This category of disorders includes disorders that are usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood.
==== ADHD ====

'''ADHD in children'''

ADHD(attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a psychological complaint that usually starts in early childhood. As with many other disturbances, it has been more than a challenge to diagnose the prevalence of ADHD and it is estimated that three to ten percent of children show symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity or inattentiveness (Nair, 2006). It is evident that boys are more than twice as likely to be affected, than girls (Knölker, 2003). ADHD does not have a single cause, it is a medical disturbance, affecting several areas of the brain, especially the frontal part which is responsible for executive functioning that controls regulation of behavior, working, learning, planning and organizing. Currently it has a multifactoral and integrative clinical picture which includes genetic predispositions, neurobiological, psychological, as well as psychosocial and environmental factors, which are especially important concerning the progression of the disorder (Schneider, 2009). The DSM-IV currently states three different subtypes of the disorder. First, the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive type where the patient suffers from six or more of the inattentive symptoms but less than six of the symptoms of hyperactivity for at least six months. Second, the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, where the patient suffers from at least six symptoms of the hyperactivity and impulsivity scale but less than six on the inattentive scale for at least six months. Finally, the combined type, which is a combination of at least six symptoms on both scales and persisting for at least six months (Michael B. First, Allen Frances, &amp; and Harold Alan Pincus, M.D., 2002).

''Symptoms of the inattentive type''

* Difficulty paying attention in school or in general. Produced work is often chaotic and  filled with careless mistakes
* Rapidly distracted by all kinds of trivial stimuli, noises or people
* Difficulty  paying attention to one task or activity at a time
* Trouble finishing and concentrating on everyday tasks that require concentration and time management like homework, paperwork or other duties
* Frequently drifting from one unfinished task to another
* Procrastination
* Disorganized work manner
* Forgetfulness in daily activities
* Inability to complete tasks such as homework or other assignments
* Frequent drifts, not being able to be present and follow the conversation and not grasping the details or rules when it comes to activities in social situations

''Symptoms of the hyperactive type''

* Squirming and Fidgeting when seated
* Frequent aimless running and walking
* In teens, being restless and in children running, climbing and squirming when it is not appropriate
* Having difficulty engaging in any quiet or calm activity
* Always being on the go
* Excessive and pointless talking  
(Michael B. First, Allen Frances, &amp; and Harold Alan Pincus, M.D., 2002).

'''Causes'''
	
It has been found that about 50 percent of affected individuals suffer from a genetic dysfunction of the neuronal communication in the brain (Nadder, 1998). This is especially the case for the neuronal circuit that is responsible for motivation, cognition, emotions and motor behavior which includes the frontal lobe and the striatum. It is mostly acquired genetically, but prenatal complications during child delivery, pollutants, decreased birth weight, infections and deprivation or ailment of the central nervous system can also be possible risk factors. Research also confirmed a lack of dopamine or lower levels of receptors and transporters in the accumbens and midbrain.  Additionally, prenatal conditions like cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption have been related (Bush, 2005).

'''Treatment'''

ADHD can be classified in three levels of severity. Individuals, who are less severely affected, but have the genetic predisposition for the disorder and do not necessarily need treatment. Visible symptoms might include less inhibition and slight difficulties to concentrate. Individuals, who are more severely affected, need treatment. They might be more likely to suffer from comorbid disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety etc.), suicidal thoughts and are more prone to difficulties in school and loss of employment. However they usually do not have any social malfunctions or disruptive behavior. The severe affected individuals depend on treatment, their behavior is socially disruptive and they are at much greater risk for developing substance abuse or criminal tendencies. It has been found that the two most important aspects of development of the disorder are the age when it is detected, and the way the social surrounding reacts to it, up until to the point of diagnosis. With an extensive prophylaxis and the education of the patients social environment, it is possible to attenuate the symptoms (Lauth, 2002). A treatment-plan could for instance include some of the following (coaching, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, psychoeducation, psychosocial intervention, pharmacology). However, the attenuation can only go as far as the synaptic and cortical plasticity of the brain, because the seriousness of ADHD mostly depends on neurobiological aspects. In this regard, it is crucial to approach the treatment in a multimodal way. The patients' potentials should be detected and expanded, improvement of social skills and the treatment of possible comorbid disorders should be important aspects (Deutscher Ärzte Verlag, 2003). 

'''Medication'''

Medications that are commonly used to treat ADHD since the 1950´s are stimulants, which include methylphenidates and amphetamines. Non-stimulant drugs like atomoxetine are also available as alternative (Wigal, 2009). Stimulants have various side-effects, the most common ones include insomnia, euphoria, increased locomotion, restlessness, loss of appetite, psychosis, dependence, increased heart rate and blood pressure. Long-term side effects on the other hand have not been sufficiently established yet. The most common and known methylphenidate is Ritalin. Ritalin belongs to the immediate release tablets, together with Ritalina, Rilatine, Attenta, Methylin, Penid, and Rubifen. Their most important characteristic is that the majority of the beads are released immediately after intake and a small amount of beads are released again about five hours after intake. The other type of methylphenidates are sustained release tablets, namely Concerta, Metadate CD, Methylin ER, Ritalin LA, and Ritalin-SR.  These tablets have an immediate release of approximately 30 percent or even less and the rest is evenly distributed 10-12 hours after intake. This guarantees a much longer effect (Green List: Annex to the annual statistical report on psychotropic substances 2003). Another type of medication includes amphetamines like Adderall, which are also used for the treatment of ADHD and work similar as cocaine, but last longer. The effects on the central nervous system are diverse and independent of each other. They can be divided into three classes: psychoanaleptic, hallucinogenic and empathogenic. Just like methylphenidate, amphetamines increase norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. When amphetamines are active, the concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft increases (Robertson, 2009).

'''Culture and Society'''

The use and general perspective people have about stimulants differs from country to country. In the United States the medication is prescribed very fast and easily, however, in other countries, like the UK or Germany, it is very difficult and sometimes even illegal for adults to obtain them and is meant for very severe cases only (King, 2006). During authorization of the last Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) it was brought to light that some of the authors of the ADHD related chapters were paid by the pharmaceutical industry to write a rather subjective and brought diagnosis of ADHD. The goal was to make more children fit the criteria of the disorder and to substantially increase profits. For this reason, the authors that will publish the DSM-V in 2012 are obliged to disclose their income and are not allowed to earn more than 10000 US Dollar per year for manual embrace (Center for Science in the Public Interest 2008), (The New York Times 2008).

'''ADHD in adults'''

Children who have been diagnosed with ADHD in the United States are known to be less likely to graduate from high school, obtain a college degree and have higher chances of various negative life outcomes like being involved in car crashes, teen pregnancy, substance abuse etc. (Molina, 2009). The stigmatization of people and especially of peers with mental illness is common and has been a great problem in society. Mental illnesses can be unapparent like in the case of depression, or they can be obvious, like in the case of ADHD. High comorbidity of ADHD is responsible that patients are commonly mistreated for other mental illnesses like for instance depression. A study by Fischer revealed that mental health care professionals might still not be adequately capable of diagnosing ADHD and that they ought to take the presence of comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) as a warning for potential ADHD (Fischer,2007). The severity of ADHD in childhood predicts the likely outcome of the illness in adulthood. It became evident that around four percent of adult population suffers from it, and that this subgroup attracts numerous negative life outcomes e.g. lower academic and professional performance, higher divorce rates and lower socioeconomic status (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, 2005). Of those four percent overall affected, 80 percent present comorbid problems, and are often misdiagnosed with malfunctions like conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, antisocial personality disorder, substance abuse, anxiety disorders and most commonly MDD (Biederman, Faraone, Spencer, &amp; Wilens, 1993; Downey, Stelson, Pomerleau, &amp; Giordani, 1997). A subsequent study by Kessler found out that the majority of adults in the United States who suffer from ADHD remain untreated, even though they seek therapeutic help for many other comorbid disorders (Kessler et al, 2006).

==Tic Disorders==
===Tourette's Syndrome===
Tourette's Syndrome (TS) is a disorder characterized by the presence of at least two tics, one motor and one physical. The vocal tic is, however, more critical to the diagnosis of Tourette's. Tourette's syndrome sufferers usually have faster reflexes than other people. 
Tourette's syndrome sufferers have a roughly 40% occurrence rate of involuntary swearing, known as coprolalia. This relatively rare symptom has been abused by the media and is a source of much misunderstanding about TS.
Tourette's syndrome is also featured in a number of movies, such as 'What about Bob?', in which Bob, the main character, pretends to have Tourette's.

==Anxiety Disorders==
===Phobias===
Phobias are fears of a specific object or situation.  Most phobias have a heritable basis- identical twins separated at birth often develop the same phobia, regardless of environment.  Other evidence for the heritable argument is that many phobias are logical when the human ancestors are considered.  It makes sense that natural selection would favor genes that caused our ancestors to fear natural dangers like snakes, spiders, and other poisonous animals.
Strong memories of situations may also create a phobia.  For example, if a person was placed in a tight space as a toddler and nearly suffocated, a life-long fear of closed spaces may follow (claustrophobia).

===Panic Attacks===
Panic Disorder is characterized by a series of panic attacks.  A panic attack is an inappropriate intense feeling of fear or discomfort including many of the following symptoms: heart palpitations, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness.  These symptoms are so severe that the person may actually believe he or she is having a heart attack.  In fact, many, if not most of the diagnoses of Panic Disorder are made by a physician in a hospital emergency room.

===Obsessive Compulsive Disorder===
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by the presence of two things: Obsessions and Compulsions.
Obsessions are defined as recurring or persistent thoughts, images, or actions that significantly interfere with a person's day-to-day functioning. Some common obsessions are cleanliness, symmetry/order, and fear of falling seriously ill. The person will attempt to minimize or eliminate these unwanted thoughts through the use of compulsions.
Compulsions are the behaviors used to cope with obsessions. The most common compulsions are hand washing, checking (as in checking to make sure doors are locked several times a night), and counting.


While most people with OCD only have one to a few main obsessions, the disorder also interferes with many thoughts and actions unrelated to their obsessions. For example:

A person who obsesses over cleanliness will often be caught in a loop: First, they will wash their hands. As they finish, the thought occurs to them that the water may have been contaminated. So they wash again, and this time, upon finishing, they wonder if there were germs in the soap. Again, they wash their hands, and after drying, they will likely wonder who's been touching the towel. This goes on and on - if the person does not execute the compulsions, the obsessive thoughts won't allow them to focus on anything else.

But the pattern often shows in other situations: perhaps the person notices a knife laying out in the kitchen, and suddenly realizes that, if they wanted, they could use it to kill their entire family. This normally isn't a pleasant thought, and the person tries to push it from their mind. But the thought doesn't go away - it stays at the front of the person's mind until the person acts on it (hopefully by putting the knife away or going into another room). These thoughts aren't (or shouldn't be) nearly strong enough to make a person murder anyone, but they are very distracting, unpleasant, persistent, and often damaging. For reasons similar to this example, many people with OCD are uncomfortable around sharp objects or weapons.



Case studies to follow?

==Psychotic Disorders==
===Schizophrenia===
The schizophrenic disorders are characterized in general by fundamental and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and affects that are inappropriate or blunted. Clear consciousness and intellectual capacity are usually maintained although certain cognitive deficits may evolve in the course of time. The most important psychopathological phenomena include thought echo; thought insertion or withdrawal; thought broadcasting; delusional perception and delusions of control; influence or passivity; hallucinatory voices commenting or discussing the patient in the third person; thought disorders and negative symptoms. 

The course of schizophrenic disorders can be either continuous, or episodic with progressive or stable deficit, or there can be one or more episodes with complete or incomplete remission. The diagnosis of schizophrenia should not be made in the presence of extensive depressive or manic symptoms unless it is clear that schizophrenic symptoms antedate the affective disturbance. Nor should schizophrenia be diagnosed in the presence of overt brain disease or during states of drug intoxication or withdrawal. (from [http://www3.who.int/icd/vol1htm2003/fr-icd.htm WHO - ICD 10])

==  Impulse Control Disorders   ==

An Impulse Control Disorder can be loosely defined as the failure to resist an impulsive act or behavior that may be harmful to self or others (Hucker, S. J., 2004)&lt;ref&gt;	Hucker, S.J. (2004) “Disorders of impulse control”. In: Forensic Psychology by O’Donohue, W. and Levensky, E. (eds), Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Impulse-control disorders are psychological disorders characterized by the repeated inability to refrain from performing an act. An impulsive behavior or act is considered to be one that is not premeditated or not considered in advance and one over which the individual has little or no control. The concept of impulsivity covers a wide range of “actions that are poorly conceived, prematurely expressed, unduly risky, or inappropriate to the situation and that often result in undesirable consequences” (Daruna &amp; Barnes, 1993, p. 23)&lt;ref&gt;	Daruna, J. H., &amp; Barnes, P. A. (1993). A neurodevelopmental view of impulsivity. In W. G. McCown, J. L. Johnson, &amp; M. B. Shure (Eds.), The impulsive client: Theory, research, and treatment (pp. 23–37). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Impulsivity, by Grant (2008)&lt;ref&gt;	Grant, E. Jon., (2008), Impulse Control Disorders: A Clinician’s Guide to Understanding and Treating Behavioral Addictions, BOOK AND MEDIA REVIEW, pp 209&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to stimuli (either internal or external) without thinking of the negative consequences. Impulse control disorders share common core qualities such as repetitive or compulsive engagement in a behavior despite unwanted consequences, diminished control over the problematic behavior, an urge or craving state prior to commitment in the behavior, and a hedonic quality during the performance of the behavior in question. Subjective distress and impaired functioning are often a consequence of impulse control disorders, and their avoidance feeds the cycle of repetitive behaviors. Patients with these disorders continue to struggle with their desire to engage in the behavior that might have terrible outcomes (i.e. addictions, gambling) and it might cause emerging social, occupational, financial, or legal consequences.

Another definition of impulse-control disorders are defined by the American Psychiatric Association (2000)&lt;ref&gt;	American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (IV-TR). Washington DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; as “the failure to resist an impulse, drive, or temptation to perform an act that is harmful to the person or to others”. Typically the “individual feels an increasing sense of tension or arousal before committing the act, and then experiences pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the act” (p. 609). Following the act there may or may not be regret, self-reproach, or guilt.

Under many of the poor decision making and impulsive/short sighted behaviors there lays a perceptual distortion called delay discounting (Perna, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;	Perna, Robert, (2010), Impulsivity, Shorsighted Decisions, and Discounting. A review of Madden, Gregory and Bickel, Warren, (2010), Impulsivity: The Behavioral and Neurological Science of Discounting, PsychCritiques, Vol:55, No: 8, 1&lt;/ref&gt;. Delay discounting is an evaluation process whereby when considering an immediate behavior; a person minimizes the long-term risks or benefits associated with that decision. It is a decrease in the subjective value of a reinforcer (i.e., money, drugs) as a function of time to its delivery. Impulsive behaviors occur when individuals choose small but immediate rewards over long term rewards (or reducing possible long term risks).
Eysenck (1977)&lt;ref&gt;	Eysenck SB, Eysenck HJ: The place of impulsiveness in a dimensional system of personality description. Br J Soc Clin Psychol, 1977; 16:57–68&lt;/ref&gt; related impulsivity to risk taking, lack of planning, and making up one’s mind too quickly. Patton et. al.(1995)&lt;ref&gt;	Patton JH, Stanford MS, Barratt ES: Factor structure of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. J Clin Psychol 1995; 51:768–774&lt;/ref&gt; considered impulsivity in three components;

# Acting on the spur of the moment (motor activation)
# Not focusing on the task at hand (attention)
# Not planning and thinking carefully (lack of future planning)

Impulse Control Disorders are a specific group of impulsive behaviors that have been accepted as psychiatric disorders under the DSM-IV- TR. The following are included under the Impulse Control Disorders in the DSM-IV-TR (APA,2000)&lt;ref&gt;	American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (IV-TR). Washington DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;;

*Intermittent Explosive Disorder is characterized by discrete episodes of failure to resist aggressive impulses resulting in serious assaults or destruction of property.
*Kleptomania is characterized by the recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects not needed for personal use or monetary value.
*Pyromania is characterized by a pattern of fire setting for pleasure, gratification, or relief of tension.
*Pathological Gambling is characterized by recurrent and persistent maladaptive gambling behavior.
*Trichotillomania is characterized by recurrent pulling out of one's hair for pleasure, gratification, or relief of tension that result in noticeable hair loss.
*Impulse-Control Disorder Not Otherwise Specified is included for coding disorders of impulse control that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific Impulse-Control Disorders described above or in other sections of the manual.

===Etiology===

Grant (2008)&lt;ref&gt;	Grant, E. Jon., (2008), Impulse Control Disorders: A Clinician’s Guide to Understanding and Treating Behavioral Addictions, BOOK AND MEDIA REVIEW, pp 209&lt;/ref&gt; suggests similarities regarding impulse control disorders and the existence of a neurobiological feature also present in addiction. Therefore, he suggests that impulse control disorders can be considered as behavioral addictions. The positive responses obtained from treatment with opioid antagonists and glutamatergic agents suggests that the dopamine and possible glutamate systems affected by these medication may have a role in impulse control disorders as well as substance abuse and dependence to substances. The neural systems regulating impulsive, compulsive, and habitual behaviors likely have some differences; however, there seems be overlapping neurobiology (e.g., activation of the OFC) that might explain why several psychiatric disorders have comorbid impulsive and compulsive features (Torregrossa, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;	Torregrossa, M, M., Jennifer J. Quinn, and Jane R. Taylor (2008) Impulsivity, Compulsivity, and Habit: The Role of Orbitofrontal Cortex Revisited, BIOL PSYCHIATRY 2008;63:253–255&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Prefrontal Cortex- more specifically the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC)- is thought to play a role in the etiology of decision making and impulse control behaviors. According to Jentsch (1999)&lt;ref&gt;	Jentsch JD, Taylor JR (1999): Impulsivity resulting from frontostriatal dysfunction in drug abuse: Implications for the control of behavior by reward-related stimuli. Psychopharmacol 146:373–390.&lt;/ref&gt;, the Prefrontal Cortex is thought to be impaired in disorders of impulsivity and compulsivity such as drug addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as attentional disorders.
	
The biological theories formulated to explain the causes of impulse control (or lack of) problems are similar to those of substance use. Schmitz (2005)&lt;ref&gt;	Schmitz, J. M. (2005). The interface between impulse-control disorders and addictions: Are pleasure pathway responses shared neurobiological substrates? Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity, 12, 149-168.&lt;/ref&gt; posits a biologically based theory of ICD’s or as he calls them “behavioral addictions”. He hypothesized that the behavioral addictions are using the same neurological reward/pleasure pathways as do substance related disorders. These specific neurocircuits have been identified to take role in the reward/pleasure pathways involved in the reinforcing properties or drug abuse and drug craving. According to Koob (1992)&lt;ref&gt;	Koob, G. F. (1992). Drugs of abuse: Anatomy, pharmacology and function of reward pathways. Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 13, 177-184.&lt;/ref&gt;, the neurotransmitters which have a role in the reward pathways are dopamine, opioid peptides, glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). Drugs stimulate this pathway and cause the person to feel feelings of intense reward/pleasure. Addictive behaviors are thought to work in this manner too.

'''Reward Deficiency Hypothesis'''

The Reward Deficiency Hypothesis proposes that those individuals who have a malfunctioning reward/pleasure circuit are not satisfied with the normal rewards such as food and sex but rather they are in need of unnatural rewards that cause higher thrills and excitement (Becker, 1999; Comings &amp; Blum, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;	Becker, H. C. (1999). Alcohol withdrawal: Neuroadaptation and sensitization. CNS Spectrums, 4. 38-65. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	Comings, D. E., &amp; Blum, K. (2000). Reward deficiency syndrome: Genetic aspects of behavioral disorders. Progress in Brain Research, 126, 325-341&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schmitz (2005)&lt;ref&gt;	Schmitz, J. M. (2005). The interface between impulse-control disorders and addictions: Are pleasure pathway responses shared neurobiological substrates? Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity, 12, 149-168.&lt;/ref&gt;, impulse control disorders such as kleptomania, or pathological gambling have similar patterns to drug cravings associated with chemical dependency, therefore, they are thought to have their bases in the reward pathways. In example, when a kleptomaniac has the urge to steal, he/she is feeling the thrill and a high that is similar to high from drugs.

'''The Feeling State Theory (FST)'''

The Feeling State Theory posits that impulse control disorders were created when positive feelings form links with specific objects or behavior thus forming a state-dependent memory (Miller, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;	Miller, R. 2010, The Feeling-State Theory of Impulse-Control Disorders and the Impulse-Control Disorder Protocol, Traumatology, 16:3, pp 2-10&lt;/ref&gt;. This state dependent memory is formed of feelings and the event: which make up a unit called a ‘feeling state’. This is seen as the cause of impulse control disorders. During the creation of these ‘feelings states’ the person feels intense psycho-physiological arousal and can become fixation on this. Therefore, to feel it again, the will repeat the behavior to reach that state. FST includes the element of memory as well stating that the ‘feeling sate’ is composed of feelings associated with behaviors plus the memory of the behavior. For example, a person who thinks about the emotions and thoughts when he felt good could raise the memory and cause him to repeat the behavior and to be impulse in seeking the event.

===Connections between ICD and OCD, and Addiction===

Habits and impulsive behavior have been considered to be at the opposite ends of a behavioral spectrum however, the behaviors that define impulsivity and compulsivity have some commonalities. Compulsivity is the leading cause of obsessive-compulsive disorders where the person is compelled to do a certain act to relieve anxiety/stress even when the behavior seems inappropriate. They repeat these behaviors in a ritualistic manner and as mentioned above, the involve dysfunction in the OFC (Evans, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;	Evans DW, Lewis MD, Lobst E (2004): The role of the orbitofrontal cortex in normally developing compulsive-like behaviors and obsessive-compulsive disorder. &lt;/ref&gt;. When we consider impulsivity, it also includes an element of inability to inhibit a motor response and somewhat compulsive in nature. People suffering from an impulse control disorder have mentioned to obsess about performing the act (in relation to their disorder) and being feeling compelled to do so (Grant, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;	Grant JE, Potenza MN (2006): Compulsive aspects of impulse-control disorders. Psychiatry Clin North Am 29:539 –551.&lt;/ref&gt;.

One difference between the ICD’s and OCD’s is that individuals with ICD’s engaging in repetitive behaviors are considered to be egosyntonic; generally refers to behaviors, values, feelings that are in harmony with or acceptable to the needs and goals of the ego, or consistent with one's ideal self image or self concept. The person feels pleasure, gratification or relief at the time of committing the act. The repetitive behaviors or rituals in OCD’s are considered to be egodystonic (Grant, 2006; Blasczynski, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;	Blaszczynski A. Pathological gambling and obsessivecompulsive spectrum disorders. Psychol Rep 1999;84(1):107–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	Grant JE, Potenza MN (2006): Compulsive aspects of impulse-control disorders. Psychiatry Clin North Am 29:539 –551.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the compulsions experienced or expressed are not consistent with the individual's self-perception; the patient realizes the obsessions are not reasonable. Individuals with ICD are generally sensation seekers and that’s why they are impulsively repeating thrilling behaviors, where as OCD individuals are more interested in harm avoidance and repetition of behavior reduces anxiety for a certain time.

Drug addiction is also involves impulsivity (i.e. to take drugs), a compulsion that is pushing someone to take drugs after chronic usage and eventually developing into a habit that is further characterized by automatic responses to take drugs without considering the outcomes. ICDs and substance disorders have similar disturbances related to affective regulation. After performing ICD action and feeling the associated high patients have described the acute onset of depressive symptoms that is similar to those occurring during withdrawal from many substances, including depressed mood, feelings of guilt, fatigue. Another similarity has been the behaviors associated with tolerance and withdrawal. For example, pathological gamblers have reported that they need to progressively increase to larger sums of money in order to feel the desired ‘high’ (Goodman, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;	Goodman, A., 1997, Sexual addiction. In Lowinson JH, Ruiz P, Millmasn RB, Langrod, JG, eds Substance Abuse, A Comprehensive Textbook. Baltimore, MD: Williams and Wilkins, 1997:340-354&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to tolerance where to dosage of the substance has to be increased to get the same high). Also, the have reported to have physiological symptoms such as insomnia, anorexia, tremor, headaches, upset stomach, nightmares on discontinuation of gambling (Anderson, 1984)&lt;ref&gt;	Anderson G., Brown, R. I, 1984, Real and Laboratory gambling, sensation seeking and arousal. Br J Psychol. 75:401-410 &lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The conditional and provisional can be constructed in several ways. The bad news is that it can be tricky to choose which one to use. The good news is that even the less correct choices should be understandable. Here we'll try to explain the differences among these to give you an idea.

The main forms for &quot;if/when A then B&quot; are
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| style=&quot;color: gray&quot; rowspan=&quot;4&quot; | もし&lt;br /&gt;もしも
| A と B
|-
| Aぇば B
|-
| Aたら B
|-
| Aなら B
|}
Let's now look at each of these in turn.

The provisional and conditional forms are like the 〜て form in that they connect two sentences together. The second sentence is, however, not necessary if its meaning is contextually implied.

== Forms ==

=== Natural consequence ===

In cases describing a natural consequence one can use &quot;と&quot;. This is similar to English: &quot;Eat this apple and you'll be sick.&quot; which in Japanese would be &quot;このリンゴを食べると病気になります。&quot;

=== Provisional forms ===

'''Verbs''' take on the provisional form by changing the final syllable from the う-row to the え-row and adding &quot;ば&quot;. This applies to both consonant stem verbs, e.g. 行く -&gt; 行けば, and vowel stem verbs, e.g. 食べる -&gt; 食べれば, and 寝る -&gt; 寝れば.

'''Nouns and adjectival nouns''' take on the provisional form by using the provisional form of the copula, &quot;なら&quot;: &quot;勉強なら習う&quot;, &quot;if you study, you learn&quot;.

=== Conditional forms ===

The conditional form is formed by adding &quot;ら&quot; to the plain past tense (ending in 〜た), e.g. 行ったら, 食べたら, and 寝たら.

'''Nouns and adjectival nouns''' take the conditional form of the copula, either the polite &quot;でしたら&quot; or the plain &quot;だったら&quot;.

=== Unsorted... ===
{{Japanese example|
: いまいく。おそくない。
: いまいきます。おそくありません。 
:: I'll leave now.  I will not be late.

: いまい{{japanese verb style|provisional|ければ}}おそくありません。
: いまい{{japanese verb style|conditional|ったら}}おそくない。
:: If I leave now, I will not be late.
|}}

To use '''adjectives''' in a conditional expression, replace the final &quot;い&quot; with &quot;ければ&quot;.
{{Japanese example|
: ねむいです。ねる。
: ねむいです。ねます。
:: I'm tired.  I will sleep.

: ねむ{{Japanese verb style|provisional|ければ}}ねる。
: ねむ{{Japanese verb style|provisional|ければ}}ねます。
:: If I'm tired, I will sleep.
|}}

== Uncertainty ==

The word &quot;もし&quot; shows that the condition/provision is not necessarily true.

: もし、かなしかっ{{japanese verb style|conditional|たら}}、わらおう！ // If [you] are sad, smile!

Sometimes it takes the form もしも, which also means if.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Relative clause}}
Japanese ''relative clauses'' are formed by placing the modifying clause immediately in front of the noun it modifies. The modifying clause acts much like an adjective (which it can also consist of).
{{Japanese example|
: Present positive: {{furi|水|みず}}を{{furi|飲|の|む}}{{furi|人|ひと}} — The person who drinks water:
: Past positive: テレビを{{furi|見|み|た}}{{furi|人|ひと}} — The person who watched television
: Present continuous: {{furi|寝|ね|て}}いる{{furi|猫|ねこ}} — The sleeping cat}}

Relative clauses allow relatively complex ideas to be expressed simply.
{{Japanese example|1=
: &lt;span title=&quot;くるま- Car&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;を&lt;span title=&quot;か.う- to buy&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;買った&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;あに- Older brother&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;兄&lt;/span&gt;は&lt;span title=&quot;かねも.ち- Rich person&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;金持ち&lt;/span&gt;です。- The older brother who bought the car is rich.
: &lt;span title=&quot;はて.る- To end&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;果てない&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;ゆめ- Dream&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;夢&lt;/span&gt;が&lt;span title=&quot;とま.る- to stop&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;止まって&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;しま.う&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;しまいました&lt;/span&gt;。- The unending dream is ending.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your personal plan should be made up of two parts: 1. Where to go, and 2. How to get there. 
== Where to go ==
=== SMART Goals ===
When we set out to do something, it is to our benefit to set clear goals and to make a plan that will help us reach them. The “SMART” acronym below is a tool that we can use to make sure that we are covering all of the appropriate areas in the process. More information can be found in the [[w:Time management| time management on Wikipedia]]. Just remember that if you don’t make your goals specific, measurable, achievable, results-oriented, and time-limited, they are not really goals, but intentions, no more. 
: S  Specific
: M  Measurable
: A  Achievable
: R  Results-oriented
: T  Time-limited
An example:
: Specific I want to improve my natural speech patterns, active vocabulary, fluency, and correct written form. 
: Measurable Improve my TOEFL score by 10 percent. (Use on-line or offline testing tools to determine beginning numbers, then set a goal for improvement.)
: Achievable (The improvement in the measured numbers to be within reason.)
: Results-oriented I want practical, real-world improvement in my levels of oral and written English.
: Time-limited The follow-up testing will be done two months after the first testing.

Now, using the above example as a guide, write out your own  SMART goals for improving your English. Decide which [[../Areas of English Proficiency|areas of English proficiency]] will be your priorities. Write down '''how much you would like to improve in each of the areas.'''

== How to get there (personalizing your plan) ==
Following are specific steps that you can take to improve each of your targeted [[../Areas of English Proficiency| areas of English proficiency]]. 

=== Vocabulary (passive and active vocab)  ===
* Daily reading (news and online articles, books, NYTimes, HBR, Give and Take, Wikipedia.org, The Millionaire Next Door …)
* Writing summaries of articles and mini research papers

=== Fluency (finding words quickly) ===
* Conversation with others
* Your internal mental conversation
* Reading (news, business literature, novels, magazines, blogs …)
* Writing
* Presentations (make up your own or imitate someone else’s)
4113321

=== Natural speech patterns ===
* Reading regularly in English. Daily is a good goal, even if it is only fifteen minutes. Look for topics on interest on the Internet or in English books or magazines.
* Conversation and contact in English with native speakers, or at least with others who are learning. 
* Watching TV and movies in English (news, entertainment, documentaries…)
* Online audio news (NYTimes, VOANews, BBC News …) 
* Presentations of speeches copied from native presenters 
* Listening to and reading CD magazines like English2Go and Speak Up for natural flow and inflection
=== Written English (grammar and spelling) === 
* Grammar book exercises 
* Reading 
* Writing
*test

=== Pronunciation ===
* Conversation
* TV, music and movies
* Listening to and reading passages at the same time
* In general, all oral communication: listening and speaking

=== Flow of speech ===
* Conversation
* TV, music and movies
* Listening to and reading passages at the same time
* In general, all oral communication: listening and speaking
* Reading newspapers in front of mirror.

=== Culture ===
* Reading about culture explicitly in Internet, books, and magazines
* Observing culture implicit in written materials
* Entertainment from target countries 
* Interacting with natives

Focus your attention on the activities that will help you improve primarily in the top areas on your personalized list. This takes a bit of discipline, but allow your actions to be guided by where you want to go in your learning. Don’t spend all of your time reading articles about current news if your main objective is to improve your pronunciation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Should the first page be restructured? ==

Having the fulfilled prophecies table on the first page might seem rather overwhelming to the casual reader. Perhaps they should see the contents of [[Christianity/Overview]] instead?

Also the way it is now if someone goes to the overview first they might not even find the prophecies list as it's not anywhere in the TOC.

Anyway, see what you think. :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:53, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

== Should This Book Continue Without Radical Changes? == 

IMHO what content is here appears to be very much not NPOV. Esp. given the &quot;fulfilled prophecies&quot; table. The content appears to be specific to the perspective of some denominations of Christianity. 

While I think a humanities text on Christianity is not inappropriate, I believe it would need to be more descriptive of the religion in general being at least inclusive of the many denominations which claim the Christian tradition. Better yet, to my mind, would be for this &quot;book&quot; to be a section within a larger work on Comparative World Religions. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 21:06, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes I have been wondering about that for a while. However NPOV wordings of that section (&quot;prophecies that certain denominations have been fulfilled&quot; &quot;allegedly fulfilled prophecies&quot;) would sound rather awful. And Christianity is a vast enough topic that it gets its own book, indeed certain major denominations within it could even have their own books too one day. Just as we have a book on the C programming language and yet despite the fact that C++ is based on it we have that in a completely separate book. Related topics are only shoved together if they aren't very deep; Christianity has been the topic of countless multi-volume works. But yes I agree something does need to be done, as long as it can be done without making the text ungainly. The difficulty is that believers in Jesus have a difficult time writing in the pseudo-cynical manner that produces NPOV, as that goes somewhat against their deepest convictions. Hm. But it's something to work on. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:30, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

::Someone might be offended by &quot;Our Savior,&quot; so the change to &quot;The Saviour&quot; is crucified (prophecy), now does that imply The Savior of the world? In Luke the term is &quot;'''A''' Savior which is Christ the Lord,&quot; hanged if you do, hanged if you don't. Serving the Lord as in computer language meant reverently delivering a web page, too cute, replaced that bottom line with entry into &quot;How To&quot; translate the Bible. Certainly, without presenting the Messianic prophecies as fulfilled, one would virtually emasculate Christianity. On the pseudo-cynical side, two of the prophecies have no exact O.T. reference according to authorities, but the Bible says no scripture can be annulled (John 10:35 Weymouth N.T.) and who would want to?

:::Hm, that's another problem, yes that could still be offensive; while no longer implying that he is ''your'' saviour it is still implying that he is ''a'' savior, and if you're an athiest you'd think that's rubbish. Saying &quot;the Christian Saviour&quot; is horrendous, but would certainly fulfill the NPOV issue. Really I don't know how things like this can be fixed without some parts ending up sounding stupid. Gah... :( [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:15, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

::No plans to solve the problems of &quot;the world&quot; here. Unless, this is an allegory of life. Well yes, the Savior of &quot;the world&quot; reference relates to the Samaritan woman discourse of [[Christianity/John 4|John 4]]. Jesus starts the discourse with an exclusivity claim, &quot;Our&quot; salvation is regional, but His message and demeanor say otherwise and convince a whole town of outsiders (Samaritans) that He is the Savior of the world. It is all about worship, only different mountains to climb and if there are too many paths to enlightenment, I guess you end up worshipping the mountain. The first outreach after Pentecost was to those Samaritans by Philip the Evangelist (Acts 8:5) and the rest is history. Then, the sheep are those who follow Christ and the remainder, nominally, the goats, are Samaritans or the mix. Thus, even though at the judgment you are on your own, we could have the ideal world where all Christians are CHRISTIAN and all Samaritans (outsiders) are GOOD (Luke 10:30-37) and everyone has a mountaintop experience, now, do you feel better already. Obviously, the best option is &quot;The Savior,&quot; but something must be said for the Samaritans (out there).

==Poorly written==

I think that this who wikibook is poorly written; The contents structure looks quite adequate, but the articles are poorly written, not detailed, and there seems to be a good dose of added weird stuff. I think that this wikibook should be deleted and started again. Anonymous browsing user: --[[User:121.45.182.172|121.45.182.172]] 15:55, 23 May 2007 (UTC) - or perhaps it should just link into wikichristian which is much better organized and has more detail.

==Chapter 5: Later Christian Movements==

Mormons, since they do not share the orthodox Christian conception of the Triune God nor much else shouldn't be called a Christian movement any more than Bahai is. Same goes for Christian Scientists as they deny the dual nature of Christ. Adventists are possibly Christian depending on the particular sect.

Perhaps a new division is needed?

Chapter 5: Later Christian Movements (SDAs, Christian Fundamentalism, ???)

Chapter 6: Non-Christian Groups With Christian Roots (perhaps put it between the current 6 &amp; 7)
(Bahai
Jehovah's Witnesses
Mormons
Christian Science
Unitarians?
Quakers?
Others?)

If we are going to define Christianity as Christians have for 2000 years, then we cannot lump neo-Arians and others who deny basic facts about Christ as Christians.
:Could change heading back to (Later) Prophetic Movements as listed in 2006 which would cover the 3 sects as they are. &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;006633&quot;&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00AAAA&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00BBBB&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00DDDD&quot;&gt;k&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:16, 25 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">My primary area of interest is Software Quality, especially in regards to Usability.  I've got a background in pre-press publishing, but that was in the heyday of '''Aldus''' PageMaker.  Still, the urge to design has never left my bones.

I hope to bring an aesthetic eye to everything that I do, so I imagine I'll do the same here.  While I may not be able to spot dangling participles, I'm nearly always wrangled into spearheading User Documentation for the projects that I've worked on, due to my desire to communicate ideas clearly.

As a ''non-traditional'' student, technical (and mathematical) content isn't always my strongest subject.  However, I am delighted by learning and fascinated with this project.  I thought perhaps I could bring my &quot;beginner's mind&quot; to wiki books, and improve the education other life-long students such as myself.

Hopefully, if I spot some tangled turn of phrase, I'll help it more than I hurt it.</text>

      <comment>yet more modular robots</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A robot is generally designed for one particular activity, or at best a few closely related activities. This of course isn't the ideal situation as many jobs require a large number of very different activities. For example, building the walls of a house and installing plumbing and electricity require very different tools and techniques. In practice this means you'll end up designing either several different robots or a very complicated one. 

Modular robotics is one answer to such problems. Typical modular robots consist of a number of independent cubes, which can move and connect themselves in many different ways. Each of the cubes have their own power supply and intelligence and can have specific tools. When a problem is fed to its computer, it analyzes it and connects the cubes in such a way that it can solve the problem.

Ideally such a robot would consist of a very large number of very small identical cubes. This is similar to the way plants, animals or humans are consisting of many cells, which are practically identical, with the difference that specification would happen in software rather than in chemical composition.

The difference between fractal and modular robotics is that the former allows multiple sizes of cubes and the latter does not. 

Most people are familiar with the fact that sufficient quantities of clay bricks (architectural bricks) or Lego bricks can be used to approximate nearly any shape, and so our introduction to modular robotics was in terms of cubes.
Instead of making each cube independent, some researchers make pairs or triplets of cubes independent&lt;ref&gt;

Some people use the phrase &quot;modular robot&quot; to indicate that its interfaces have been standardized so elements can be swapped out without custom-made adapters.
(See
[[Space Transport and Engineering Methods/Advanced Manufacturing#Modular Robot]],
[[Seed Factories/Basics#Modular Design]],
[[Seed Factories/Notes3#Modular Design:]],
[[Seed Factories/Notes8#1A.3.4 Supply Internal Transport]],
etc.
).
Such a modular robot has:
* the wrist of a robot arm has a standard mounting pattern so several &quot;hands&quot; with different kinds of tools can be swapped out;
* the shoulder of a robot arm has a standard mounting pattern that can be attached to a fixed pillar or various motion bases;
* a standardized power connector makes it easy to swap between a small lightweight battery, a heavier longer-lasting battery, and mains power;
* etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motion with Constant Acceleration ==

In some situations, you will find that a particle is accelerating at a constant rate, so it is helpful to derive some basic relationships between the parameters of the problem.  The problem of a constantly accelerating particle is completely characterized by the total time traveled, the initial position, the initial velocity, and acceleration.  That is, we can figure out anything about particle at any time with just these quantities. 

We will start from the definition of the problem that the particle has constant acceleration:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = a = const.&lt;/math&gt;.

Integrating once, we get

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dr}{dt} = at + C &lt;/math&gt;.

By the definition of velocity, we have

&lt;math&gt; v = at + v_0 &lt;/math&gt;

(I have replaced C with &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; the initial velocity because at t = 0, &lt;math&gt;C = v(0)&lt;/math&gt; which is a constant, and it makes sense to call it &lt;math&gt; v_0&lt;/math&gt;).

Integrating again, we have

&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 + v_0 t + r_0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial position.

Now we can find position and velocity as functions of time, which is the complete solution to the problem.  However, it is often useful to introduce the distance traveled as an independent variable instead of time.  To do this, all we have to do is eliminate t from two equations above.  The result is

&lt;math&gt; v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(r - r_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

Much less useful, but standardly taught is to use the average velocity as an independent variable.  The average of a function between a and b is defined as

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) dx &lt;/math&gt;.

This is the limit of the arithmetic mean as the number of arguments goes to infinity.

Average velocity (averaged over time) is thus

&lt;math&gt; \bar{v} = \frac{r - r_0}{t} &lt;/math&gt;.

eliminating r and &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; with the equations of a and v as functions of time we get

&lt;math&gt; \bar{v} = \frac{1}{2} ( v + v_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

So, here's the list of results:

&lt;math&gt; v = at + v_0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 + v_0 t + r_0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(r - r_0) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{v} = \frac{r - r_0}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{v} = \frac{1}{2} (v + v_0).&lt;/math&gt;

I could come up with more independent variables (it's very easy!), but generally it's easier just to do the calculation when you need it, and not to memorize tables and tables of simple results.  On a similar note, you could calculate analogous results for a constant third derivative of position (commonly called jerk) or even constant nth derivative.  Or if the nth derivative equals a given function, such as acceleration &lt;math&gt;= ksin(cosh(t/t_0))&lt;/math&gt;.  It all reduces to doing a couple messy integrals, then some messy algebra.  The point is that the only reason working out constant acceleration is worth doing is because it comes up a lot, otherwise it is worthless.

==Motion in More Than One Dimension==

It is an intriguing result that the motion of a particle in one direction does not affect the motion in any perpendicular direction.  The classic example is if you shoot a gun level to the ground and drop a bullet at the same time, they hit the ground at the same time as if they started at the same height.  That is, the motion of the bullet horizontally has absolutely no affect on how it moves vertically.  You might ask why is it then that a paper airplane thrown and dropped do not hit the ground at the same time -- the answer is that the situation is fundamentally different because you have interaction with the air.

A mathematically precise way of saying this is that the velocity really is a vector.  It adds like a vector, and you can split it up into components like a vector.

Using this notion, let's derive the constant acceleration equations for vectors and you can see how vectors are very useful.

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = \mathbf{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 r_i}{dt^2} = a_i &lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripts indicate the ith component of the vector.

Integrating each component (or equivalently, integrating the vectors),

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{a} t + \mathbf{v_0} &lt;/math&gt;.

It's easy to see that everything is working out in exactly the same way it did for the 1 dimensional case, except we're doing it in every component!

Thus we have

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{a} t^2 + \mathbf{v_0} t + \mathbf{r_0} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v_0}) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \bar{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0}}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

and with some messy vector algebra,

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}} = v_0^2 (2  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{a}}  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} - \hat{\mathbf{a}}) + 2 \| \mathbf{a} \| (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) + 2 \| \mathbf{v} \| \| \mathbf{v_0} \| (\hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \hat{\mathbf{a}} - \hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{a}} \hat{\mathbf{v_0}})&lt;/math&gt;.

which simplifies down to:

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}  = \mathbf{v_0} \cdot \mathbf{v_0} + 2  \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) &lt;/math&gt;.

But that's what it is if you were wondering.  A hat above a vector is the vector divided by its magnitude, making it a unit vector in the direction of the original vector.

Welcome to the second lesson in our Portuguese language course. If you haven't already, have a look at [[Portuguese/Contents/L1/Lesson One - Saying Hello|Lesson One - Saying Hello]]

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;

== Dialogue 2==

'''Ricardo''': Tu gostas de chocolate? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Sim, gosto de chocolate. E tu? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Sim. Gostas de chocolate de leite ou chocolate branco?  &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Eu e a minha esposa gostamos de chocolate preto. &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': O chocolate preto é bom.&lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Até logo! &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Adeus! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Once again, don't worry if you don't pick up everything - or even anything. However some words are fairly obvious.

'''o chocolate''' - this means '''the chocolate'''.
The '''o''' we slipped in above means ''the'' in Portuguese - but here's the catch - only for certain words. Because in Portuguese we introduce a concept called 'noun gender' which means that every noun - that is, every word that represents a thing - animal, mineral, vegetable - is either masculine or feminine. This is a mostly abstract concept. However, there are some words like 'homem' ('man', which is masculine) and 'mulher' ('woman', which is feminine) that follow logical patterns (as do others that refer to something with a specific gender). Most words, however, like 'carvão' ('coal', which is masculine) and 'casa' ('house', which is feminine) seem to be completely random. That is why you always have to learn the gender of a word when you learn a word. 

Have a look at these examples.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''o gato''' - the cat (masculine)

'''os pêssegos''' - the peaches (masculine, plural)

'''a casa''' - the house (feminine)

'''as árvores''' - the trees (feminine plural)
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As you can see, the word for 'the' changes with every gender. It also changes depending on the NUMBER of things you are talking about. If there is more than one object we call it 'plural' and so the word for 'the' changes again. 

Unfortunately, the word for 'the' isn't the only thing that changes with gender. Adjectives - words that describe an object - change depending on what gender the object they are describing is.

Some more examples...

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''o gato é amarelo''' - the cat is yellow

'''os pêssegos são amarelos''' - the peaches are yellow

'''a casa é amarela''' - the house is yellow

'''as árvores são amarelas''' - the trees are yellow

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Can you see a pattern? We started with '''amarelo''' to translate &quot;yellow&quot;. Can you see the similarity between the word for &quot;the&quot; in this instance - '''o''' - and the ending of the adjective, ''amarel'''''o'''? &lt;br&gt; When the word for &quot;the&quot; changes to '''a''', so too does the end of the adjective - we get ''amarel'''''a'''. So to change an adjective from masculine to feminine, we just change the final letter from an '''o''' with the masculine form to an '''a''' in the feminine.

To get to the plural forms, add an '''s''' - ''amarel'''''os''' and ''amarel'''''as'''.
Try the following exercise out.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#B0E0E6&quot;&gt;

'''Fill in the following chart for the word '''''vermelho''''' - which means &quot;red&quot;.'''

1. Masculine Singular = ______________

2. Feminine  Singular = ______________

3. Masculine, Plural  = ______________

4. Feminine,  Plural  = ______________

'''Complete the following phrases by converting the word in the brackets, which is the masculine singular adjective, to the appropriate form of the adjective.'''


5. As meninas são _________ (bonito) - ''The girls are (pretty)''

6. O gato é __________ (branco) - ''The cat is (white)''

7. Os tios são __________ (educado) - ''The uncles are (polite)''

8. A casa é __________ (bonito) - ''The house is (pretty)''


'''Answers'''

1. vermelho 

2. vermelha

3. vermelhos

4. vermelhas

5. bonitas

6. branco

7. educados

8. bonita

&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/table&gt; 

How did you do? It's not that tricky if you keep in mind the link between the word for &quot;the&quot; and the ending of the adjective.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EED2EE&quot;&gt;
Before we move on to even more difficult ideas, let's have another quick pronunciation tip: if you have difficulty pronouncing the &quot;lh&quot; sound (like in '''vermelho'''), you can approximate it by pronouncing the &quot;ll&quot; sound from English words like ''billiard'' or ''million''. That is to say, it sounds similar to an &quot;l&quot; followed by a &quot;y&quot;.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Before we go, let's have a look at three things.

1. The Verb '''SER''' &lt;br&gt;
You may have noticed that, despite the fact that we said last lesson that the verb for &quot;to be&quot; is '''estar''', when we said &quot;The house is yellow&quot; we translated it as '''a casa é amarela'''. Shouldn't that be '''a casa está amarela'''? Unfortunately in Portuguese there are two verbs that translate to the English verb &quot;to be&quot;. One is '''estar''' - the other is '''ser'''.

Let's have a look at the verb table for SER in the Present Indicative Tense:

&lt;big&gt; '''SER - To Be''' &lt;/big&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 282px;&quot;

      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ou&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;é&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;é&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;We are&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;omos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (plural) are&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Vocês s&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ão&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;They are&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(also elas, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;voc&amp;ecirc;s)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Eles s&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ão&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

So when to use '''ser''' and when to use '''estar'''? 
One way to remember the difference is to remember where they came from. '''Ser''' comes from the Latin word 'esse'. In English, we derive the word ''essence'' from the same Latin root. '''Ser''' is used to talk about WHAT something or someone is. The verb '''estar''' that we met in Lesson One comes from the Latin '''stare''', from which we also get our English word '''status'''. '''Estar''' is used to talk about the state of something, HOW is it. Some examples...

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
Uses of '''SER'''

'''O sol é amarelo.'''
The sun is yellow.

'''Meu nome é Jim.'''
My name is Jim.

'''Nós somos portugueses.'''
We are Portuguese. 
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
Uses of '''ESTAR'''

'''A cerveja está gelada.'''
The beer is ice-cold.

'''Eu estou doente.'''
I am sick.

'''O livro está em cima da mesa.'''
The book is on the table. 
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

When talking about the location of something, use '''ser''' if the thing being located is always or usually there (like a building) but '''estar''' if (like a person, or animal) they tend to move around and are only in the spot for a period of time.
If you still find '''ser''' and '''estar''' confusing, go the this page - [[Portuguese/Contents/Ser and estar|Ser and Estar]]

2. The second thing we still haven't got around to the main point of this article - how to say we like something. In the dialogue 
Ricardo asks '''Tu gostas de chocolate?''' This means &quot;Do you like chocolate?&quot;

João responds, '''Sim, gosto de chocolate.''' This means &quot;Yes, I like chocolate.&quot;

So we have a formula for asking someone whether they like something. We can also respond.

&lt;table
 style=&quot;text-align: left; height: 110px; width: 621px;&quot;
 border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The response will be 

&lt;table
 style=&quot;text-align: left; height: 54px; width: 606px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
 cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;big&gt; '''Sim''', &lt;br&gt; ''Yes,''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;'''gosto''' &lt;br&gt; ''I like'' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;do/da/dos/das &lt;br&gt; ''(of)(the)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;width: 197px;&quot;
 colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;chocolate/bebida/livros/ma&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;s &lt;br&gt; ''chocolate/drink/books/apples''&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''N&amp;atilde;o,'''&lt;br&gt; ''No,''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;'''n&amp;atilde;o gosto''' &lt;br&gt; ''I don't like'' &lt;/big&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

OK, but why do we have the options of do/da/dos/das? Perhaps you have picked up on the endings of these words? They correspond to the words meaning &quot;the&quot;. But why do we say '''do''' instead of '''o''' or '''das''' instead of '''as'''? Well, because in English we talk of &quot;to like&quot; wheras in Portuguese the phrase is '''gostar de''' which means &quot;to like of&quot;. As a memory aid, you can think of the English phrase &quot;to be fond '''of'''&quot;, which, like the Portuguese &quot;gostar&quot;, does not make sense without that &quot;of&quot;. The word for &quot;of&quot; in Portuguese is '''de'''. However when it appears before the words '''o''', '''a''', '''os''' and '''as''' we contract it - we squeeze the two words up. So, for instance

'''gostar de a amiga''' - &quot;to like the friend&quot;. This is incorrect. Squish 'de' and 'a' into one word - 'da'. We now have '''gostar da amiga'''.


3. The final thing we need to look at is the order of adjectives. Usually in English the adjective (or describing word) comes BEFORE the word it is describing. For example.

The YELLOW dog. The POLITE mother. 

However in Portuguese the opposite (usually) happens.

'''O cão amarelo''' - The yellow dog (literally, &quot;The dog yellow&quot;)

''' A mãe educada''' - The polite mother. (literally, &quot;The mother polite&quot;)

Adjectives can also be placed BEFORE the word they describe. This will cause their meaning to change slightly. However, we will deal with that situation a little later on.

That is all for Lesson 2. Have a little rest then see how you fare on [[Portuguese/Contents/L1/Lesson Three - What Are You Going To Do?|Lesson Three.]]

==Introduction==
[[Image:Perturbed_Energy_Spectrum.png|framed|Perturbed Energy Spectum]]
Perturbation Theory is an extremely important method of seeing how a Quantum System will be affected by a small change in the potential. And as such the Hamiltonian.

Perturbation Theory revolves around expressing the Potential as multiple (generally two) separate Potentials, then seeing how the second affects the system.

It allows us to get good approximations for systems where the Eigenstates are not all easily findable.

In the real life not many hamiltonians are exactly solvable. Most of the real life situations requires some approximation methods to solve their hamiltonians. Perturbation theory is one among them. Perturbation means small disturbance. Remember that the hamiltonian of a system is nothing but the total energy of that system. Some external factors can always affect the energy of the system and its behaviour. To analyse a system's energy, if we dont know the exact way of solution, then we can study the effects of external factors(perturbation) on the hamiltonian. For an example, we can study the elastic properties of a spring by the application of load on that. By this way, we can approximately predict the properties of the concerned systems. Perturbation applied to a system is of two types: time dependent and time independent and hence the theory.
We have to split the hamiltonian into two parts. One part is a hamiltonian whose solution we know exactly and the other part is the perturbation term. By this way we can solve the problems with a very good approximation. For an example of this method in quantum mechanics, we can use the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom to solve the problem of helium ion.

==First Order Corrections==
===Energy===
The first order correction to energy is given by
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_n ^{(1)} = \langle n|V|n\rangle = \int \Psi_n ^{(0)^\star}(x) \hat V(x) \Psi_n ^{(0)}(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The first order correction to the wave function is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; C_k ^{(1)}= \frac{\langle k|V|n \rangle}{\epsilon_n ^{(0)}-\epsilon_k ^{(0)} } &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Proof===
Let H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a Hamiltonian where all eigenstates are known.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \hat H_0 \Psi_n ^{(0)} = \epsilon _n ^{(0)} \Psi_n ^{(0)} \qquad n \in\mathbb N \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (\hat H_0 + \hat V) \Psi = \epsilon \Psi \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now represent &amp;Psi; as a linear combination of all its parts
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \Psi = \sum c_m \Psi_m^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and put this into (2).

Consider a particle confined to a one-dimensional box with impenetrable walls.
When you solve the Schrödinger equation for the wavefunctions you get two sets of solutions: those of positive parity, and those of negative parity: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{P=1} = A \cos \left[\frac{(2n+1) \pi x}{a}\right] &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{P=-1} = A \cos \left(\frac{2n \pi x}{a}\right), &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where ''n'' is any positive integer and ''A'' is a normalisation constant. Now, we can have all of these infinite states and if you've ever studied Fourier Analysis you may have noticed, with these states you can form any function you wish---that is, the wavefunctions are complete. So what have we learned? Well, a lot actually: we have discovered the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian which can be used to determine the particle's time dependance.

==Derivation of the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation==

We start with the general Schrödinger Equation, and use separation of variables. We have

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; H \Psi = \hat \epsilon \Psi &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We separate &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; into two functions:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Psi ( x , t ) = T ( t ) X ( x ) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

So now the Schrödinger Equation is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; H T X = \hat \epsilon T X &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

We know from [[../Operators and Commutators|earlier]] that the &quot;interesting&quot; part of the energy operator &lt;math&gt;\hat \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a partial derivative with respect to time, and the &quot;interesting&quot; part of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a partial derivative with respect to position. As &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on position, it is not affected by &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not affected by &lt;math&gt;\hat \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

So we have:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; T H X = X \hat \epsilon T &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

We can multiply on the left by &lt;math&gt; T^{-1} X^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; to obtain

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; X^{-1} H X = T^{-1} \hat \epsilon T &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

Note that the left side only depends on x, on the right side only depends on t. We have two functions which are totally indenpendent, but are somehow equal to each other. This is only possible if both functions are equal to a consant, which we call E.

i.e.

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; X^{-1} H X = E&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T^{-1} \hat \epsilon T = E &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Naturally this implies

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; H X = E X &lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; \hat \epsilon T = E T &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We can then expand &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and solve this equation.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Solving Right Triangles==
In order to solve a right triangle using Trig, a simple acronym is used: SOHCAHTOA; SOH, standing for sine (opposite/hypotneuse), CAH, standing for cosine (adjacent/hypotneuse), and TOA, standing for tangent (opposite/adjacent).

This work is mainly done using a calculator, as there are no simple, analytical, formulas for the sine, cosine, and tangent functions.

To solve for angles of a right triangle, you would use the same method of SOHCAHTOA, except you use &lt;math&gt;sin^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (opp/hyp), &lt;math&gt;cos^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (adj/hyp) and &lt;math&gt;tan^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (opp/adj)

===Example Problems===
Example One: Finding the Missing Parts of a Right Triangle 

Find the missing angle and the sides in a right triangle with an acute angle of 38 degrees and an hypotenuse of 15 meters.

Solution:
::The other acute angle can be found by realizing that the sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore,
::180° = 38° + 90° + (m &lt; B) so (m &lt; B) = 52°. Using SOHCAHTOA, we see that 
::sin38° = opposite side length / Hypotenuse. Thus,sin38° = a/15 ==&gt; a = 15sin38° = 9.23 meters. To find the adjacent side 
::we use the cosine function and the formula cos38° = b/15 ==&gt; b= 15cos38° = 11.82 meters.

== Pythagorean Relationships ==
This is one step beyond the basic trig functions or ideas. It involves three equations that can be manipulated to suit the needs of the given problem. The three equations are as follows:

:sin²θ + cos²θ = 1
:1 + tan²θ = sec²θ
:1 + cot²θ = csc²θ

These can be easily manipulated to figure out a long range of complex problems. For this, we will use the example of 1 - sin²θ. When we look at the above equations, we see that it is very similair to the first one (sin²θ + cos²θ = 1). In fact, sin²θ has just been subtracted. Using this principle, we can thus solve the problem as cos²θ = 1-sin²θ. Easy, right?

=== Problems for Practice ===
Solve these equations using the Pythagorean relationships:

# tan²θ + 1 =
# sec²θ - 1 =
# csc²θ - cot²θ =
# sin²θ + cos²θ =
# sec²θ - tan²θ =
# sin²θ - 1 =

== Verifying More Complex Identities ==
We now move on to the more complex functions of the trigonometric world. To solve or prove these functions or equations, we have to use all of the math skills we learned before. We will need to use factoring, the Pythagorean relationships table, the inverse trig functions (sec θ = 1/cos θ, csc θ = 1/sin θ, cot θ = 1/tan θ ) and anything else we need to solve the problem.

This is very advanced math. To start this lesson off, lets look at an example:

Prove (make the right side look like the left without touching the left)

:sin θ /(sin θ + cos θ) = tan θ /(1 + tan θ)

We can see that tan θ is being divided by 1 + tan θ. To start the problem off, let’s get common denominators:

:tan θ /(cos θ/cos θ + sin θ/cos θ)

We can now combine the two equations on the bottom, so it looks like this:

:tan θ /((cos θ + sin θ)/cos θ)

To help simplify this down, put tan θ into terms of sin θ and cos θ:

:(sin θ/cos θ)/((cos θ + sin θ)/cos θ)

We can now multiply by the reciprocal to get rid of the bottom denominator:

:((sin θ/cos θ)*cos θ)/(((cos θ + sin θ)/cos θ)*cos θ)

Note that this is still being divided by sin θ + cos θ. When we multiply, the cos θ ’s will cancel each other out, so we are left with:

:sin θ/(sin θ + cos θ)

Which just happens to be the answer we were trying to prove!

While this may seem complicated, you only need to practice this more. Let's get an example that is a little more complicated: 

Prove (make the left side look like the right without touching the right side)

:(2 sin θ cos θ)/(sin²θ - cos²θ + 1) = cot θ

When we look at an equation like this, it may seem impossible. Lets go through the basics. When we look at the bottom, we see that we have a -cos²θ and a +1. When we look at the Pythagorean relationships table, 1 - cos²θ is equal to sin²θ:

:(2 cos θ sin θ)/(sin²θ + sin²θ)

We can then add the two sin²θ together:

:(2 sin θ cos θ)/(2 sin²θ)

We can then simplify this further into:

:cos θ / sin θ

We can do this because sin θ will cross out to have a single sin θ (2/2²=1/2, right?) and then the twos will cross out. That leaves with cos θ / sin θ, or cot θ !

=== Problems for Practice ===
# Prove (make the right side look like the left without touching the left side)
#: (1 - sin θ)/(cos θ) = cos θ /(1 + sin θ)
# Prove (make the left side look like the right without touching the right side)
#: (cot θ - tan θ)/(tan θ cos²θ) = csc²θ - sec²θ
# Prove (make the left side look like the right without touching the right side)
#: tan θ/(1 + sec θ) + (1 + sec θ)/tan θ = 2 csc θ
# Prove (make the left side look like the right without touching the right side)
#: tan²θ/(1 + tan²θ) = sin²θ

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Projectile Motion ==

Using the equations we derived in the last section, we can now use them to model the motion of a ''projectile''. A projectile is an object upon which the only force acting is gravity, which means that in all situations, the acceleration in the ''y'' direction, &lt;math&gt;a_y = -g&lt;/math&gt;. For simplicity, we will assume that the path of a projectile, also called its ''trajectory'', will always be in the shape of a parabola, and that the effect of air resistance upon the projectile is negligible. 

'''The Horizontal Motion'''

Since the only force acting upon the object is gravity, in the ''y'' direction, there is no acceleration in the ''x'' direction.

Let us assume that the projectile leaves the origin at time ''t'' = 0 and with speed ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then we have a vector '''v&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''' that makes an angle of &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with the ''x''-axis. Then, using a bit of trigonometry, we have the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta_i = \frac{v_{xi}}{v_i}&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_i = \frac{v_{yi}}{v_i}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging for the initial velocities, we get the initial ''x'' and ''y'' components of velocity to be

: &lt;math&gt;v_{xi} = v_i\cos \theta_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ v_{yi} = v_i\sin \theta_i&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x = v \cos(\theta) t&lt;/math&gt;


'''The Vertical Motion'''

There is a constant acceleration down, g which is the force of gravity.  Accelecration is the instantaneous rate of change of velocity so:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt} = a = g&lt;/math&gt;
therefore we can integrate acceleration with respect to time to get velocity
: &lt;math&gt;\int dv = \int g dt&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v = gt&lt;/math&gt;
Velocity is the instantaneous rate of change of displacement so:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dd}{dt} = v&lt;/math&gt;
We can also integrate velocity with respect to time to get displacement
: &lt;math&gt;\int dx = \int v dt&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int dx = \int gt dt&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{1}{2} g t^2&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Latin}}

==Future perfect==
The future perfect tense is used for an action that will have been completed in the future by the time something else has happened. 

English example: &quot;I '''will have seen''' the movie by the time it comes out.&quot;

To form the future perfect, take the perfect stem and add the future perfect endings:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-er&amp;#333;''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erimus''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-eris''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-eritis''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erit''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erint''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Note the similarities to the future tense of ''sum'', except for the third person plural ending ''-erint''&lt;ref&gt;''-int'' as an ending is rare; ''-erint'' and ''sint'' are two of the most common&lt;/ref&gt; in place of ''-erunt'', which serves as the perfect ending instead.

Hence: '''amāver&amp;#333;''', I will have loved; '''vīderitis''', you (pl.) will have seen


&lt;references/&gt;

==Pluperfect==
The pluperfect tense is used to describe something in the past that happened before another event in the past.

English example: &quot;I '''had graduated''' by the time I applied for a job.&quot;

To form the pluperfect, take the perfect stem and add the pluperfect endings:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-eram''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erāmus''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erās''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erātis''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erat''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;''-erant''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Hence: '''amāveram''', I had loved; '''vīderātis''', you (pl.) had seen



==Examples==
''De Acutiliano autem negotio quod mihi '''mandaras''' ('''mandaveras'''), ut primum a tuo digressu Romam veni, '''confeceram'''.'' (Cicero, ''Ad Atticum'' 1.5)

:&quot;But as to the business of Acutilius that you had entrusted with me, I had already taken care of it when I came to Rome first thing after your departure.&quot; Note the relationship of the pluperfect verbs ''mandaras'' (''-aras'' is a common contraction for ''-averas'') and ''confeceram'' to the perfect verb ''veni''.

''Ego certe meum officium '''praestitero'''.'' (Caesar, ''De Bello Gallico'' IV)

:&quot;I certainly will have prevailed in my duty.&quot;

'''Gospel of JOHN''' 


'''Chapter 1'''

==verses 1-10 (done)==
1 In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God.

2 The same was in the beginning with God.

3 All things came '''into being by Him''' and &lt;s&gt;by&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;'''through''' His creative power everything&lt;/s&gt; without him nothing was made that was made.

4 In Him was Life and that Life was the Light of the entire human race;

5 for even as the Light shines &lt;s&gt;on&lt;/s&gt; in darkness, the darkness has never overtaken it.

6 There appeared a man '''named John''', sent from God &lt;s&gt;'''as a witness''',&lt;/s&gt;

7 &lt;s&gt;sent for&lt;/s&gt; He came as a witness to testify concerning the Light &lt;s&gt;considering&lt;/s&gt; in order that that all might come to &lt;s&gt;&lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/s&gt; believe through Him.

8 John, himself, was not the Light, but &lt;s&gt;was sent&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;'''did come'''&lt;/s&gt; he came to bear witness &lt;s&gt;of&lt;/s&gt; concerning that Light.

9 &lt;s&gt;Yes,&lt;/s&gt; The true Light illuminating every person was, &lt;B&gt;then&lt;/B&gt;, coming into the world.

10 He was in the world&lt;s&gt;; He made the world,&lt;/s&gt; and the world came into being through him yet the world did not know Him.

==verses 11-20 (done)==
11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him,

12 though as many as would receive Him &amp;#8722; that is, to those who &lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt; in &lt;B&gt;the&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;His&lt;/s&gt; name &lt;B&gt;of Jesus&lt;/B&gt; &amp;#8722; He has given the right to become the children of God,

13 who are not born of blood, not born by physical urge, not born by the will of man, but are those reborn of God [read: the Word].

14 The Word became &lt;s&gt;flesh&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt; as man&lt;/B&gt; and lived for a time among us, so &lt;B&gt;full of grace and truth&lt;/B&gt; that we perceived His glory, glory as of the only born of the Father.

15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because He was in all things before me.’ ”

16 And from His abundance we have, every one of us, received grace upon grace.

17 For even though the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

18 While no one has ever seen God, the only Son by His very closeness to the Father has made Him known.

19 This is the testimony of John, when the leaders of Judea decided to send priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who he was.

20 He had to confess and did not deny the truth, but avowed, “I am not the Messiah.”

==verses 21-30 (done)==
21 They said, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He responded, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, his voice gone, “No.”

22 They continued to ask him, “Who are you, that we may answer those that sent us? What do you say for yourself?”

23 “I am THE VOICE,” he replied, “OF ONE CRYING ALOUD IN THE DESERT, MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD” (Isa. 40:3).

24 A delegation of &lt;s&gt;the&lt;/s&gt; Pharisees was sent, also, 

25 And demanded of him, “Why do you baptize, then, if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet?”

26 &quot;I baptize in water only,&quot; he replied, &quot;but in your midst stands One whom you do not recognize.
 
27 He who comes after me is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to unlatch.&quot;

28 These events occurred in Bethany beyond the river Jordan, where John was baptizing.

29 The next day John saw Jesus coming his way and said, &quot;See, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&quot;

30 &quot;This is He of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man ranking ahead of me for He was in all things before me.'
==verses 31-40 (done)==
31 Even if, at first, I did not recognize Him, my purpose in coming was to baptize in water so that He might be revealed to Israel.&quot;

32 John testifying further said, &quot;I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and remain on Him;
 
33 I did not know who He was, but the One who sent me to baptize in water told me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
 
34 This I witnessed while coming to the realization that He is the Son of God.&quot;

35 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples.
 
36 He looked upon Jesus as He walked by and said as before, &quot;See, the Lamb of God!&quot;

37 After hearing this, the two disciples followed Jesus.
 
38 Then, Jesus turned and seeing that they followed said, &quot;What is your need?&quot; Their reply, a &lt;s&gt;tentative&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;polite&lt;/B&gt;, &quot;Rabbi, (which is to say, Teacher) where are you staying?&quot; 

39 He said to them, &quot;Come and see.&quot; They went and saw where he stayed and remained there the rest of the day (for it was about four o'clock in the afternoon).

40 One of the two who followed Jesus after John spoke of the Lamb of God was Andrew, the brother of Simon. 
==verses 41-51 (done)==
41 Soon after the meeting with Jesus, Andrew found Simon and told him, &quot;We have found the Messiah&quot; (which is to say, the Christ); 

42 He then brought his brother to Jesus who gazing upon him intently said, &quot;You are Simon, son of Jona: You will be called Kepha,&quot; (meaning a rock, being tranalated Peter).

43 The following day Jesus decided to go to Galilee, and found Philip, and said to him, &quot;Follow Me.&quot; 

44 Now, Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 

45 Philip, in turn, found Nathana-el, and told him, &quot;We have found him, of whom Moses and the Prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&quot; 

46 Whereupon, Nathana-el said to him, &quot;Can any good &lt;s&gt;thing&lt;/s&gt; come out of Nazareth?&quot; Philip replied, &quot;Come and see.&quot;

47 Jesus saw Nathana-el coming and exclaimed, &quot;Look! An Israelite, not in name only, but true.&quot; 

48 Nathana-el asked, &quot;How do you know me?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;Even before Philip sought you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&quot; 

49 Nathana-el said, &quot;Rabbi, You are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.&quot; 

50 Jesus answered &lt;B&gt;saying&lt;/B&gt;, &quot;&lt;s&gt;If&lt;/s&gt;&lt;B&gt; Because&lt;/B&gt; I said, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,' and you &lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt;: What then? If you should see far greater things. 

51 In all truthfulness, I say that, hereafter, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Eschatology (from Greek, '''eskhatos''', last) is the term referring to the “doctrine of the last things.” The &quot;last things&quot; are important issues to Christian faith, although as a formal division of theology, eschatology is a relatively recent development.

==Theology==
Christian Eschatalogy is the study of Christian thought concerning biblical final events, including both individual destiny and the consummation of history based on God’s plan of redemption through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ. The Christian view of world history involves the Church and the spread of the Gospel as the primary agent in the triumph of good over evil, according to the Creator's divine purposes. The predictive element of the Book of Revelation leads up to the final establishment of the rule of God. 

==Doctrinal Eschatology==
There are a variety of different beliefs regarding the end times in Christianity.

The general timeline:

* [[/The OT perspective/]]
* [[/The NT perspective/]] 
* [[/The Christian Hope/]]
* [[/Signs of the Times/]]
* [[/The Coming of Christ or Parousia/]]
* [[/The Resurrection/]]
* [[/The State of the Dead/]]
* [[/The Judgment/]]
* [[/Punishment/]]
* [[/The Millennium/]]
* [[/The New Creation/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The faith of Israel initially looked to its culmination in the covenant of Abraham and entering the promise land as the chosen people, its salvation; but the major prophets defined the final goal of God’s purpose in history as “the Day of the Lord.” On that day, according to prophetic writing, they expected a direct and universal act of God. The eschatological age of salvation was to follow this designated day of judgment in which (1) God’s will is without question. (2) All nations will serve the God of Israel, (3) and learn His will. (4) A time of peace and justice spreads over the world, (5) also, peace in nature.(6) God’s people are secure, (6) and prosperous. (7) and the law of God will be written on their hearts. Their several exiles, occupations and subsequent dispersion tested these beliefs and late prophecy in Israel elevates the Davidic king as God’s representative who will rule in righteousness at the last day and end the persecution of a proud nation.

: ''Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. Dan. 9:24''

Although the book of Daniel is a minor read in the Hebrew Tanakh, it was written BC and the prophet does lay out belief in the Kingdom of God 

: ''And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. Dan. 2:44''

and the expected resurrection of the dead

: ''And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. Dan. 12:2''

through the agency of the Messiah or Son of Man. The teachings of Jesus extend the faith of the Old Testament, flesh it out, so to speak. The Apostle Paul, Pharisee of Pharisees, explains in Acts 23 that the Pharisees (legalists) believe in the resurrection of the dead and angelology and the Sadducees (temple worshipping skeptics) do not. What else could be said, except that Roman domination of Israel just before the birth of Christ produced a period of heightened expectations of divine deliverance from oppression.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== There is Hope ==

John, called the divine apostle, the beloved disciple receives a vision of the New Creation from Jesus, the author and the finisher of  that Christian faith outlined in the Book of Revelation consisting of the New Heaven and the New Earth featuring the holy city as the New Jerusalem, the focal point of all things made new. The Alpha and Omega declares it so. The most important object of [[../The Christian Hope/]] is not the millennium and the intricacies thereof but this New Creation where the Lamb's Book of Life is delineated as explained in Revelation 21 being interpreted by most believers, that for the people of God, Heaven is all health, peace, and love. Therefore, for those faithful, no wonder, in His time, He said, &quot;Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, Come, Lord Jesus.&quot; (Rev. 22:20)

      <text xml:space="preserve">From The New Testament - 
*Chapter of &quot;Hope&quot; (Romans 8: 10-28) (Modernity Version)
:10 Even though your body must die because of sin, if Christ is in you, your spirit has Life because of righteousness.
:11 And if the Holy Spirit is in you, He who raised up Christ from the dead will add to your mortal existence such abundant Life as comes with the indwelling of His Spirit.
:12 Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are under no obligation to live a life ruled by our baser instincts.
:13 For if you follow that path, death is near; but under the powerful sway of the Spirit, when you put those inclinations aside, you will live.
:14 For all who are led by the Holy Spirit are children of God.
:15 You have not entered a state of bondage again as a slave to fear. But you are conscious of being among the children of adoption, and by this we cry out, &quot;Abba! Father!&quot;
:16 The Holy Spirit, attune to the spirit within us, bears witness to the fact that we are children of God;
:17 and if children, then heirs also&amp;#8722;heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ; if indeed we share in Christ's sufferings, we too may share in His glory.
:18 What we suffer now I count as nothing in comparison with the glory which is soon to be revealed in us.
:19 The world is waiting to see the manifestation of the children of God.
:20 Creation itself seems futile (not of its own choice, but by the will of Him who made it so).
:21 Yet with hope that in the end all Creation would be set free from the effects of death and decay to enjoy the liberty that will come to the children of God in their ultimate glory.
:22 For we know that the whole of Creation groans together in the pains of childbirth even to this very hour.
:23 And more than that, we ourselves, though we possess the Holy Spirit as a foretaste of bliss, do inwardly sigh, while we wait for full vestment as concerns the disposition of our bodies.
:24 In hope we have been saved. For an object of hope is such no longer when it is seen; a person does not hope for what he or she already sees.
:25 But if we hope for something which we do not see, then we wait patiently for it. 
:26 In the same way the Holy Spirit also helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what prayers to offer nor in what way to offer them. Even the pleadings of the Spirit on our behalf are beyond words,
:27 yet, the Searcher of hearts knows what the Spirit's meaning is regarding the people of God, because spiritual intercession is in God's will.
:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, yes, to them who are called according to His divine purpose.

= =
*Titus 2 - &quot;Our Blessed Hope&quot;

:11 For the grace of God has come with saving power to all humankind, 
:12 teaching us to renounce all irreverence and worldly desires, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this present age,
:13 while we wait for the blessed hope&amp;#8722;the appearing in glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ;
:14 who gave Himself for us to rescue us from any harmful activity and purify for Himself a people that are zealous for good works.

:Can you fill in the next five words of that old hymn? If you can, chances are you might just be a Baptist or some Christian group that believes the blood of Christ saves you from your sins. For those who don't know the hymn, the next five words are &quot;than Jesus' blood and righteousness.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

Eureka, when the Chapters are set up, bordering on perfection, each chapter of Modernity has talk page for work on parallel version.[[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 02:14, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

The translation below is rather free. We are dealing here with the Word of God! Therefore explanations belong into a commentary, not into the text (that's not just my view, that's even a pre-Christian tradition). If the syntax requires words to be supplied that are not in the Koine, then they should be placed in brackets, e.g. &quot;creative power&quot; in Jn 1:3 - that's apart from missing in this verse the difference betweeen &quot;to come&quot; and &quot;to become&quot; (when a bus comes along, hurray, but it has been in existence before it came into view...), and changing a negative into a positive statement. In v. 6 the translator introduces an appearance but drops a pregnant sending. In v. 7 the sending itself replaces the more humble came - humble, since this time it is the bus-type coming, not the being created one. Next a Semitism, a tell-tale literary feature, has been eliminated: &quot;witness that he might witness&quot;. These few examples of liberties in the translation convince me that its value is limited to a literary exercise. The translator of the text below cannot be regarded as a servant of the original, I mean servant like doulos, you know: like Mary, like David, like in Isaiah?!!! [[User:Portress|Portress]] 22:36, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Great dialogue. I take free as a compliment. The Prologue is undertaken as a hymn, so certain liberties were entertained, call it rhythm, and being convinced that reduntant Semitism here (and only here) are unwarranted, the language must flow. Will incorporate your suggestions. Added &quot;being&quot; to verse 3, &quot;become&quot; is difficult, grammatically speaking, and The Living Bible did not put &quot;created&quot; in their verse 3 in brackets, whereas the word is literally &quot;generated&quot; (Strong's says, used with great latitude) and I wanted to present Jesus as the Word in His omnificence. So, witness to witness could be staircase parallelism in verse 6 and 7 (a new found rhythm), plus humbly using &quot;came&quot; in verse 8. Need 8 more people like Portress and David C. and Modernity can soar. In the quote on the [[Talk:Christianity|talk]] page, Weymouth, himself, said it is not necessary to be chained to literal translation from the original. The King James collaborators also took poetic license. Fond adieu.

On second thought &quot;came&quot; in verse 8 to &quot;did come,&quot; John the Baptist is presented as one of the least humble personages in the New Testament. In Luke, a baptism scene, he told the crowd to their face, You, generation of vipers. He came preaching fire and brimstone.

==Finalized==
Findings: &amp;#949;&amp;#965;&amp;#961;&amp;#949;&amp;#963;&amp;#953;&amp;#962;&lt;br&gt;
* Primacy of John here, adds the introductory name of Jesus (v. 12) dictated by an Aramism. Otherwise, He might be construed as conventionally surnamed (v. 17) Christ, rather than Yeshua bar-Yowceph.
* The Law is prescriptive (v. 17), a prescription for daily living in the moral sense.
* Logos is declared (v. 18, UKJV) and He is no more, referring to this visitation, of course.
* Convention calls for the widely acceptable Jesus Christ, whereas all references to The Christ are rendered, the Messiah.
* Omnificence is extra-biblical, but so is Shekinah. One must combine two phrases (v. 14) to achieve &quot;tented glory.&quot;
* Though, by acknowledging that implied glory, the Epistle of James becomes a relational sidebar equal to the most illustrious of apostles, Peter and John, who rise to the top in Chapter One.
* Proposed, new order of N.T. canon: John, Matthew, Mark, Luke, Acts, James, Peter, John (letters), Hebrews, Paul (letters), Jude, Revelation. The thematic &amp;#8722; Gospels (literary order) &amp;#8722; Epistles (historic order or closeness to Jesus) &amp;#8722; Apocalypse (Jude, Revelation). Why, even, if you save the best for last, then, Luke is the most beautiful story ever told and there is no Gospel without Paul. &amp;#913;&amp;#956;&amp;#951;&amp;#957; &amp;#945;&amp;#956;&amp;#951;&amp;#957;
* Astounding, Jesus may have been scripted, the two hour session (v. 39) could have outlined O.T. [http://religion.wikicities.com/wiki/Testimonia testimonia], which were written messianic anthologies, since some of Jesus' quotes do not match the older reference standards exactly.
* Aramaic primacy is not pushed, but it stands to reason, being a simple and poetic language employed by simple people who met something divine. Here, the lingua franca is introduced as sometimes containing lack of coherence and redundancy. If the Word of God leaped over five language barriers, who wins in the end?
* Guile (v. 47) is portrayed as a play on the name Jacob. The inspiration, well, nobody's perfect. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 00:25, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Okay??? ==

Can someone say on the page where you got the verses from? The Bible is a source on Wikisource. It should be noted that the verses are from the bible on Wikisource. Just a thought. Thanks!!!

'''Chapter 2'''

==verses 1-4 (done)==
1 Two days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there. 

2 Jesus and His disciples were also invited.
 
3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus said to her son, &quot;They have no wine.&quot; 

4 Jesus said, &quot;Dear woman, what is it to you or to me. My hour has not yet come.&quot;
==verses 5-8 (done)== 
5 His mother instructed the servants, &quot;Whatever He says, do it.&quot;

6 Six waterpots of stone were set out in the manner of Judean ceremonial washing, each about twenty gallons.

7 Jesus told the servants, &quot;Fill the pots with water.&quot; And they filled them to the brim.

8 Then He said, &quot;Now, take a portion to the table-master.&quot; And they did.
==verses 9-12 (done)==
9 When the master had tasted the water made wine without knowing the source, (albeit, the servants knew), he called the bridegroom: 

10 and said, &quot;The usual host at the very beginning serves good wine, and when the guests have drunk freely, then the inferior; but you saved the best until last.&quot;

11 Jesus performed this, the first of His [miraculous] signs, at Cana in Galilee; and as He revealed His glory, His disciples &lt;U&gt;believed&lt;/U&gt; in Him.

12 After Cana He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers, and His disciples; and they spent a few days there.
==verses 13-16 (done)==
13 Just about this time, the yearly Judean Passover was approaching and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

14 In the temple He found the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves: and the moneychangers were also sitting there.

15 And when He had plaited a whip of rushes, He drove those selling oxen and sheep out of the temple, and poured out the changers' money, and overturned the tables. 

16 Then, He said to those who sold doves, &quot;Take these things away. Do not make My Father's house, a house of merchandise.&quot; 
==verses 17-20 (done)==
17 And His disciples remembered that it was written, “ZEAL FOR GOD'S HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME” (Ps. 69:9). 

18 But the Judean hierarchy issued a challenge, &quot;Give us a sign for doing such things.&quot; 

19 Jesus said, &quot;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&quot; 

20 The hierarchs replied, &quot;Forty-six years was this temple in building, and you will rebuild it in three days?&quot;
==verses 21-25 (done)== 
21 Though, here, He spoke of the temple of His body.
 
22 So when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they &lt;U&gt;believed&lt;/U&gt; the Scripture and the &lt;B&gt;[&lt;/B&gt;prophetic&lt;B&gt;]&lt;/B&gt; words of Jesus.

23 Now when He was in Jerusalem, at the &lt;s&gt;Festival&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;Feast&lt;/B&gt; of the Passover, many became believers in Him through &lt;s&gt;watching&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;witnessing&lt;/B&gt; the miracles He performed.

24 Yet, Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all,

25 and did not need any &lt;s&gt;one's&lt;/s&gt; testimony concerning &lt;s&gt;a man&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;the people&lt;/B&gt;, for He of Himself knew what was in &lt;s&gt;the man&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;human nature&lt;/B&gt;.

|2:4 Jesus says unto her, ''Woman'', what have I to do with you? mine hour is not yet come.

|2:6 And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing ''two or three firkins'' apiece.

|&lt;small&gt;ceremonial cleansing of the hands&lt;/small&gt;

|2:7 Jesus says unto them, ''Fill'' the water pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

|-
|2:8 And he says unto them, ''Draw out now'', and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
|Draw [water&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;] out now&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;Alpha;&amp;nu;&amp;tau;&amp;lambda;&amp;eta;&amp;sigma;&amp;alpha;&amp;tau;&amp;epsilon;&lt;/B&gt;  (501) &lt;B&gt;&amp;nu;&amp;upsilon;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt;
|8 Then He said, &quot;Now, take a portion to the table-master.&quot; And they did.
|&lt;small&gt;wine: result of pouring&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast ''called the bridegroom'',
|calls the bridegroom&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;phi;&amp;omega;&amp;nu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota; &amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu; &amp;nu;&amp;upsilon;&amp;mu;&amp;phi;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (3566)
|9 When the master had tasted the water made wine without knowing the source, (albeit, the servants knew), he called the bridegroom:
|&lt;small&gt;social affair: fruit of the vine&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:10 And says unto him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, ''then that which is worse'': but you have kept the good wine until now.

|2:11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth ''his glory''; and his disciples believed on him.
|glory his&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;delta;&amp;omicron;&amp;xi;&amp;alpha;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (1391) &lt;B&gt;&amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;upsilon;&lt;/B&gt;

|&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;glory to God&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there ''not many days''.
|not many days&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;omicron;&amp;upsilon; &amp;pi;&amp;omicron;&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;&amp;alpha;&amp;sigmaf; &amp;eta;&amp;mu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;sigmaf;&lt;/B&gt; (2250)
|12 After Cana He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers, and His disciples; and they spent a few days there.
|&lt;small&gt;Capernaum: below sea-level&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:13 And the Jews' ''passover'' was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
|Passover [Pasca&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;Pi;&amp;alpha;&amp;sigma;&amp;chi;&amp;alpha;&lt;/B&gt; (3957)
|13 Just about this time, the yearly Judean Passover was approaching and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
|&lt;small&gt;Jerusalem: elevated&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:14 And found ''in the temple'' those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
|in the temple [outer&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;epsilon;&amp;nu; &amp;tau;&amp;omega; &amp;iota;&amp;epsilon;&amp;rho;&amp;omega;&lt;/B&gt; (2413)
|14 In the temple He found the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves: and the moneychangers were also sitting there.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|2:15 And when he had made a ''scourge of small cords'', he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
|scourge &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cords&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;phi;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;gamma;&amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda;&amp;lambda;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu; &amp;epsilon;&amp;kappa; &amp;sigma;&amp;chi;&amp;omicron;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;&amp;iota;&amp;omega;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(4979)
|15 And when He had plaited cords into a whip, He drove those selling oxen and sheep out of the temple, and poured out the changers' money, and overturned the tables.
|&lt;small&gt;MK. 11:15-17&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things behind; make not my Father's house an ''house of merchandise''.
|house-market [emporium&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;omicron;&amp;iota;&amp;kappa;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu; &amp;epsilon;&amp;mu;&amp;pi;&amp;omicron;&amp;rho;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;upsilon;&lt;/B&gt; (1712)
|16 Then, He said to those who sold doves, &quot;Take these things away. Do not make My Father's house, a house of merchandise.&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;Jerome: “majesty of Godhead gleamed”&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:17 And his disciples remembered ''that it was written'', The zeal of yours house has eaten me up.
|that being written&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;omicron;&amp;tau;&amp;iota; &amp;gamma;&amp;epsilon;&amp;gamma;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;mu;&amp;mu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (1125)
|17 And His disciples remembered that it was written, “ZEAL FOR GOD'S HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME” (Ps. 69:9).
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|2:18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, ''What sign'' show you unto us, seeing that you do these things?
|What sign&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;Tau;&amp;iota; &amp;sigma;&amp;eta;&amp;mu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (4592)
|18 But the Judean hierarchy issued a challenge, &quot;Give us a sign for doing such things.&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;Gospel of John:&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Book of Signs and no small miracle&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:19 Jesus answered and said unto them, ''Destroy this temple'', and in three days I will raise it up.
|Loosen the sanctuary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;Lambda;&amp;upsilon;&amp;sigma;&amp;alpha;&amp;tau;&amp;epsilon; &amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu; &amp;nu;&amp;alpha;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (3485)&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;B&gt;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&amp;nbsp;
|19 Jesus said, &quot;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;Messianic authority:&lt;br&gt;An enigma to all&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, ''and will you'' rear it up in three days?
|and will you&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;kappa;&amp;alpha;&amp;iota; &amp;sigma;&amp;upsilon;&lt;/B&gt; (1473)
|20 The hierarchs replied, &quot;Forty-six years was this temple in building, and you will rebuild it in three days?&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;Temple: begun 20 B.C.E.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: upstart&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:21 But ''he spoke'' of the temple of his body. 
|he had been speaking&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;epsilon;&amp;kappa;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; &amp;delta;&amp;epsilon; &amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda;&amp;epsilon;&amp;gamma;&amp;epsilon;&lt;/B&gt; (3004)
|21 Though, here, He spoke of the temple of His body.
|&lt;small&gt;Sign language&lt;br&gt;for the uninitiated&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and ''they believed the scripture'', and the word (o. logos) which Jesus had said.
|they believed the scripture&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;epsilon;&amp;pi;&amp;iota;&amp;sigma;&amp;tau;&amp;epsilon;&amp;upsilon;&amp;sigma;&amp;alpha;&amp;nu; &amp;tau;&amp;eta; &amp;gamma;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&amp;phi;&amp;eta;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1124)
|22 So when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/font&gt; the Scripture and the [prophetic] words of Jesus.
|&lt;small&gt;Here: afterthought is forethought.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed ''in his name'', when they saw the miracles which he did.
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;into &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;name his [person&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;sigma; &amp;tau;&amp;omicron; &amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&amp;omicron;&amp;mu;&amp;alpha;&lt;/B&gt; (3686) &lt;B&gt;&amp;alpha;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;upsilon;&lt;/B&gt;                            
|23 Now when He was in Jerusalem, at the Feast of  the Passover, many became &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believers&lt;/font&gt; in Him through witnessing the miracles He performed. 
|&lt;small&gt;AR.&amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;name&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;person&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Him&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|2:24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he ''knew all men'',
|knowing all [people&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;gamma;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;&amp;omega;&amp;sigma;&amp;kappa;&amp;epsilon;&amp;iota;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (1097) &lt;B&gt;&amp;pi;&amp;alpha;&amp;nu;&amp;tau;&amp;alpha;&amp;sigmaf;&lt;/B&gt;
|24 Yet, Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all,
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|2:25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew ''what was in'' man.
|what [rare use&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;] was in&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;tau;&amp;iota;&lt;/B&gt; (5101) &lt;B&gt;&amp;eta;&amp;nu; &amp;epsilon;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt;
|25 and did not need any testimony concerning the people, for He of Himself knew what was in human nature.
|&lt;small&gt;What: is divine knowledge.&lt;/small&gt;

&quot;Voodoo&quot; is derived from Vodun, the indigenous African word, meaning spirit. Vodun is a way of life in which a number of spirits or deities are called upon and celebrated, including ancestors or elders in the spiritual world. Various forms of magic are used for the betterment of those who follow it. It works for those who believe it.

==An Introduction to Voodooism==
Voodoo differs from West African Vodun in that it integrates Catholicism, Christianity and Native American concepts. Voodoo was largely practiced by African and Indian slaves in the southern regions of the United States and the West Indies. 


==Vodun Around The World==
The Gullah, African descendants living in South Carolina and Georgia are prominent voodooist. Louisiana also retains a population of African, Creole and French descendants who practice voodoo. Marie Laveau was a renowned creole voodoo priest in New Orleans in the 17th century. Today, she still has mainly admirers and followers. Voodoo is the major religion of Haiti and very common in Jamaica, Brazil, Puerto Rico and less common but prevalent in Cuba. Of course it remains common in it's place of origin, Africa. From the western coast of Ghana across to Nigeria, Vodun and other religions synchronized with Vodun are prevalent.

==Category==
Theist Animist

==Beliefs==
Vodun recognises one God with many helpers called Orishas. A single divine Creator, called variously Mawu or Nana Buluku is an androgynous being who in one tradition bore seven children and gave each rule over a realm of nature - animals, earth, and sea - or else these children are inter-ethnic and related to natural phenomena or to historical or mythical individuals. The creator embodies a dual cosmogonic principle of which Mawu, the moon, and Lisa, the sun, are respectively the female and male aspects, often portrayed as the twin children of the Creator.

Vodouists believe in, Bondye (Creator). Bondye does not intercede in human affairs. Vodouists direct their worship toward spirits subservient to Bondye, called Orishas and Loa. Every Loa is responsible for a particular aspect of life. Each Loa reflects the many possibilities inherent to the aspects of life over which they preside. In order to navigate daily life, vodouists cultivate personal relationships with the Orishas and Loa through the presentation of offerings, the creation of personal altars and devotional objects, and participation in elaborate ceremonies of music, dance, and spirit possession.  

==Controversy==
Vodou has often been associated in popular culture with Satanism, zombies and &quot;voodoo dolls&quot;. Zombie creation has been referenced, but is not a part of Vodoo or Vodun. Such manifestations fall under the auspices of the bokor or sorcerer, rather than the priest of the Orishas and Loa. The practice of sticking pins in voodoo dolls has history in folk magic. &quot;Voodoo dolls&quot; are often associated with New Orleans Voodoo and Hoodoo as well the magical devices of the poppet and the nkisi or bocio of West and Central Africa.

The general fear of Vodou in the US can be traced back to the End of the Haitian Revolution (1791). The US, seeing the tremendous potential Vodou had for rallying its followers and inciting them to action, feared the events at Bois-Caiman could spill over onto American soil. Fearing an uprising in opposition to the US occupation of Haiti, political and religious elites, along with Hollywood and the film industry, sought to trivialize the practice of Vodou. The elites preferred to view it as folklore in an attempt to render it relatively harmless as a curiosity that might continue to inspire music and dance.”[34]

Hollywood often depicts Vodou as evil and having ties to Satanic practices in movies such as The Skeleton Key, &quot;The Devil’s Advocate&quot;, The Blair Witch Project, The Serpent and the Rainbow, Child's Play, and Live and Let Die, and in children’s movies like The Princess and the Frog.

In 2010, following the 7.0 earthquake that devastated Haiti, negative attention to Vodou also followed. One of the more notable examples would be of televangelist Pat Robertson’s televised discourse on the subject. Robertson stated that the country had cursed itself after the events at Bois-Caiman because he claimed they had engaged in Satanic practices in the ceremony preceding the Haitian Revolution. &quot;They were under the heel of the French, you know Napoleon the third and whatever. And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the prince.' True story. And so the devil said, 'Ok it's a deal.' And they kicked the French out. The Haitians revolted and got something themselves free. But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after another&quot;

==Discipleship==
Following of Vodun is chiefly found in West Africa, Brazil, Southern United States and the Caribbean, particularly in Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Smaller minorities exist in Cuba and around the world. It is noted that more than 30 million people follow Voodooism worldwide, however the exact number is unknown.

#Uganda

#Togo
#Haiti

#Dominican Republic
#Puerto Rico

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm slightly confused.  Why is there an Arrays page and an Arrays_content page?  Which is the primary page?  Should the link in the template be changed?  It seems that the content of Arrays is older, and Arrays_content is the primary... but I'm not positive.  --[[User:Jonatin|Jonatin]] 15:13, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

:The [[Data Structures/Arrays]] page merely &quot;#includes&quot; the Arrays_content page, like this: ''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Computer Science:Data Structures:Arrays content}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. Other than that, the page is basically empty. The purpose is to provide a Printer Friendly page that &quot;#includes&quot; all chapters in a single page and to provide a Navigation friendly view where the chapter navigation bars appear. There is a chance that when you view the Arrays page that the information will appear out of date. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:08, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

===Procedure===

# Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350°F]].
# Grease a 9x5x3 [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|loaf pan]]
# Mix flour, salt, and baking powder and stir together well.
# Combine dry ingredients with beer and honey.
# Stir together until well mixed.
# Add more flour if necessary to make a good consistency.
# Spread batter in prepared pan.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] 40-45 minutes or until browned and a toothpick comes out of the center clean.
# Serve warm.

==Tips, Notes and Variations==

* Beer with live yeast (bottle-conditioned) and carbonation will make the best rise.
* This bread can have a very hard crust, making it somewhat difficult to slice. One thing that works well is to begin by dividing the loaf lengthwise, then turning each half loaf onto the newly formed flat side and cutting neat smaller (half-sized) slices.
* Darker beers, such as porter and stout, will produce darker breads. Subsequently, lighter beers, such as Pilsner and lager, will produce lighter breads.
* If self-raising flour is used instead of all-purpose flour, the salt and baking powder may be omitted.

I am interested very much in the Wiki Process and shared public knowledge bases, especially in the topic area of emergency medicine (EM).

Note 206.180.152.3 was me, inadvertently not signed in... another story there- later KW

I am joining Paris Lovett in the development of OCTEM, the Wikibook textbook of emergency medicine.

*Chunks
In particular, I am interested in breaking down the structure of the knowledge of emergency medicine into small chunks (factoids ?) with extensive hyperlinks and multiple schemes of organization of the factoids. I am interested in the ultimate user perspective to rapidly get to the exact piece of information desired in the format/organization desired.

The structure of the wikibook must match an easily used, easily understood cognitive paradigm.

For example, current physical textbooks in EM typically have chapters of 20-50 pages, with several types of organization, controlled by a table of contents (TOC). The TOC may be presented in two levels of detail- first a one page summary with just chapter title, one or two lines and page number to get there. A second level of detail may go for 8 or 10 pages and show every section within the chapters and a page number (to get there).  An index is in the back of the book, where words and phrases are given in alphabetic order with page numbers and maybe short identifiers of the entry.

These are logical structures to emulate and keep current automatically.  Links are better than page numbers.
----
I believe there should be multiple Tables of Contents - super-structures to the OCTEM, using different organisational methods to point into the articles.

For example, one could start with diseses and break them down to groups and subgroups with treatments ultimately discussed.

Or one could organize a TOC of drugs, by large classes and sub classes and then by indications (diagnoses) and ultimately point to the many of the same terminal articles, ie leaf-pages in these two different logical trees.

A third tree might break cardinal symptoms into groups, subgroups of symptoms or micro-syndromes, and proceed to diseases and treatments.  This perspective, of the same knowledge ultimately, starts from the pragmatic context of how we handle a particular patient, fitting his/her symptoms into patterns of possible diagnoses, deciding upon tests to further clarify, and then decide treatments.
----
A paper text book typically has chapters which may be organized in one or more of the above structures, but the text can only exist in one chapter and the user is left to the index to find related sections.

Super index pages may help &quot;disambiguate&quot; where the user really wants to go when looking up &quot;chest pain&quot; by giving a brief but helpful few words to give the context and content of eack link to the phrase chest pain, when there will be many.

I believe very thoughtful design by those of us who understand both database structure and emergency medicine knowledge should lay out a structure and maintain it as many authors fill in the blanks, in a form that is ultimately clear and useful to many readers.

I expect there to be hundreds of users for each real contributor/writers and a few designers to plan for the layout of the many writers.

The ultimate design should optimize the readers' experience first and the contributors second.

----
Ultimately, I believe a real textbook of medicine must be stabilized and controlled somehow. I, as a physician reader, cannot look up information that may have just been edited in error by a malicious or ignorant writer.  I want the textbook to be a reliable source of details. Facts such as drug doses for various indications and patient circumstances therefore must be correct and will be correct when thay are viewed and corrected by many. As an emergency physician in practice, ( a reader-role) I want to be able to quickly type &quot;magnesium seizures pregnancy&quot; and land right in a context I can quickly verify is what I want and find doses and strategy to use and depend upon for a particular patient. There are many times this will be more reliable than my memory for situations which do not occur frequently in practice.

I believe we can evolve and design a process for allowing wide open contributions to the textbook and still also have an editor role, electronically-supported process where a small committee is assigned responsibility for selected articles.  These editorial committees would typically include EM residency faculty members.  Submissions from anyone would be approved or vetoed electronically by committee members individually, as an enhanced function analogous to WatchLists in standard Wiki use. There would be many committees linked to each juried article. Other sections may be visible or just visible within Talk or discussion areas, but clearly delineated and not certified by the above process.

I believe this can be done with simple extensions to the WIki registration and history-tracking system.

A mode may distinguish the editorially-controlled portions or tabs such as history and discussion tabs which might show changes not approved by editorial subcommittee yet or even those not approved for general inclusion.
----
I do believe the OCTEM will need to be extracted from the WIkibook.org system, using a separate server to modify the software and control the user registration somewhat.  The software is open source and the current model is compatible with changing ultimately to a controlled system, as the content as well as the wiki software are open source and may be taken and enhanced as I have suggested.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called KW. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name KW~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The mandible or the lower jaw bone behaves as a ring. As much as you try, it is almost impossible to break a glass bangle (a ring-like object) in a single place - it always breaks at the diametrically opposite segment. Similarly, the mandible tends to break in two places when injured. When it does not break in two places, injury similar to a fracture has been absorbed by the temporomandibular joint, which compromises the joint and its function significantly.

The weak points on the mandible are where the nerves enter and leave its substance: at the entrance of the inferior alveolar nerve, and at the exit of the mental nerve. When the fracure passes through a tooth root, it is likely to be &quot;compound&quot; in nature, meaning that it communicates with the mouth. Here, the risk of infection is very high, and untreated fractures not only malunite, but may never unite, and lead to life threatening neck space infections.

Mandibular fractures require individualised treatment, dependant on the age of the patient, the dentition, the oral hygiene, and the timing of surgery (how distant to the injury).

Most fractures can be reduced and fixed in place (titanium plates and screws are employed, so there is no risk of &quot;rejection&quot;, and little risk of infection) from the inside of the mouth, avoiding any scars. However, those fractures that happen just below the head of the mandible(the subcondylar fractures) will require external approaches, as would certain other types of fractures.

Most patients will then be permitted soft, mushy food for 4 weeks, after which a fairly normal lifestyle may be resumed.

The defining factor of how well the procedure has been will be very obvious from the &quot;occlusion&quot; of the patient, which is the resting position of the jaws in relation to each other: the patient will be able to sens the return to normalcy soon after surgery.

__NOTOC__
'''Blender HotKeys''' - ''Relevant to Blender 2.37a&lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt; - Compiled from Blender Online Guides''

== Window HotKeys ==

Certain window managers also use the following hotkeys.
So '''ALT-CTRL''' can be substituted for '''CTRL''' to perform the
functions described below if a conflict arises.
: '''CTRL-LEFTARROW'''. Go to the previous Screen.
: '''CTRL-RIGHTARROW'''. Go to the next Screen.
: '''CTRL-UPARROW''' or '''CTRL-DOWNARROW'''. Maximise the window or return to the previous window display size.
: '''SHIFT-F4'''. Change the window to a Data View

== Universal HotKeys ==

The following HotKeys work uniformly in all Blender Windows, if the Context allows:
: '''CTRL-LMB'''. Lasso select: drag the mouse to form a freehand selection area.
** '''ESC.'''
** This key always cancels Blender functions without changes.
** ''or'': FileWindow, DataView and ImageSelect: back to the previous window type.
**  ''or'': the RenderWindow is pushed to the background (or closed, that depends on the operating system).
: '''SPACE.''' Open the Toolbox.
: '''CTRL-SPACE.''' Opens menu with manipulator type choices. (Press 2, 3, 4, or 5 to change the widget type) &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
: '''ALT-SPACE.''' Opens menu with manipulator orientation choices. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
: '''TAB.''' Start or quit EditMode.
: '''F1.''' Loads a Blender file. Changes the window to a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT-F1.''' Appends parts from other files, or loads as Library-data. Changes the window to a FileWindow, making Blender files accessible as a directory.
: '''F2.''' Writes a Blender file. Change the window to a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT-F2.''' Exports the scene as a DXF file
: '''CTRL-F2.''' Exports the scene as a VRML1 file
: '''F3.''' Writes a picture (if a picture has been rendered). The fileformat is as indicated in the DisplayButtons. The window becomes a File Select Window.
: '''CTRL-F3 (ALT-CTRL-F3 on MacOSX)'''. Saves a screendump of the active window. The fileformat is as indicated in the DisplayButtons. The window becomes a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-F3.''' Saves a screendump of the whole Blender screen. The fileformat is as indicated in the DisplayButtons. The window becomes a FileWindow.
: '''F4.''' Displays the Logic Context (if a ButtonsWindow is available).
: '''F5.''' Displays the Shading Context (if a Buttons Window is available), Light, Material or World Sub-contextes depends on active object.

: '''ALT-SHIFT-A.''' The current window, plus all 3DWindows go into Animation Playback mode.
: '''IKEY.''' Insert Key menu. This menu differs from window to window.
: '''JKEY.''' Toggle the render buffers. Blender allows you to retain two different rendered pictures in memory.
: '''CTRL-O.''' Opens the last saved file.
: '''QKEY.''' OK? Quit Blender. This key closes Blender. Blender quit is displayed in the console if Blender is properly closed.
: '''ALT-CTRL-T.''' TimerMenu. This menu offers access to information about drawing speed. The results are displayed in a pop-up.
: '''CTRL-U.''' OK, Save User defaults. The current project (windows, objects, etc.), including UserMenu settings are written to the default file that will be loaded every time you start Blender or set it to defaults by pressing '''CTRL-X.'''
: '''CTRL-W.''' Write file. This key combination allows you to write the Blender file without opening a FileWindow.
: '''ALT-W.''' Write Videoscape file. Changes the window to a FileWindow.
: '''CTRL-X.''' Erase All. Everything (except the render buffer) is erased and released. The default scene is reloaded.
: '''CTRL-Y.''' Redo. Mac users may use CMD-Y.
: '''CTRL-Z.''' Undo. Mac users may use CMD-Z.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-Z.''' Redo. Mac users may use SHIFT-CMD-Z

== Object Mode HotKeys ==

These hotkeys are mainly bound to the 3D Viewport Window, but many work on Objects in most other windows, like IPOs and so on, hence they are summarized here.
: '''HOME'''. All Objects in the visible layer are displayed completely, centered in the window.
: '''PAGEUP'''. Select the next Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT-PAGEUP'''. Adds to selection the next Object Key.
: '''PAGEDOWN.''' Select the previous Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT-PAGEDOWN.''' Adds to selection the previous Object Key.
: '''ACCENT.''' (To the left of the '''1KEY''' in US keyboard) Select all layers.
: '''SHIFT-ACCENT.''' Revert to the previous layer setting.
: '''TAB.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''ALT-E.'''
: '''AKEY.''' Selects/deselects all.
: '''CTRL-A.''' Apply size and rotation. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are assigned to the ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.). At first glance, it appears as if nothing has changed, but this can have considerable consequences for animations or texture mapping. This is best illustrated by also having the axis of a Mesh Object be drawn (EditButtons-&gt;Axis). Rotate the Object and activate Apply. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are 'erased'.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-A.''' If the active Object is automatically duplicated (see AnimButtons-&gt;DupliFrames or AnimButtons- &gt;Dupliverts), a menu asks Make duplis real?. This option actually creates the Objects. If the active Mesh Object is deformed by a Lattice, a menu asks Apply Lattice deform?. Now the deformation of the Lattice is assigned to the vertices of the Mesh.
: '''SHIFT-A.''' This is the AddMenu. In fact, it is the ToolBox that starts with the `ADD' option. When Objects are added, Blender starts EditMode immediately if possible.
: '''BKEY.''' Border Select. Draw a rectangle with the LeftMouse; all Objects within this area are selected, but not made active. Draw a rectangle with the RightMouse to deselect Objects. In orthonormal ViewMode, the dimensions of the rectangle are displayed, expressed as global coordinates, as an extra feature in the lower left corner. In Camera ViewMode, the dimensions that are to be rendered according to the DisplayButtons are displayed in pixel units.
: '''SHIFT-B.''' Render Border. This only works in Camera ViewMode. Draw a rectangle to render a smaller cut-out of the standard window frame. If the option DisplayButtons-&gt;Border is ON, a box is drawn with red and black lines.
: '''CKEY'''. Centre View. The position of the 3DCursor becomes the new centre of the 3DWindow.
** '''ALT-C.''' Convert Menu. Depending on the active Object, a PopupMenu is displayed. This enables you to convert certain types of ObData. It only converts in one direction, everything ultimately degrades to a Mesh! The options are:
*** Font -&gt; Curve
*** MetaBall -&gt; Mesh The original MetaBall remains unchanged.
*** Curve -&gt; Mesh
*** Surface -&gt; Mesh

**'''CTRL-C.''' Copy Menu. This menu copies information from the active Object to (other) selected Objects.
*** ''Fixed components are:''
**** Copy Loc: the X,Y,Z location of the Object. If a Child is involved, this location is the relative position in relation to the Parent.
**** Copy Rot: the X,Y,Z rotation of the Object.
**** Copy Size: the X,Y,Z dimension of the Object.
**** DrawType: copies Object Drawtype.
**** TimeOffs: copies Object time offset.
**** Dupli: all Duplicator data (Dupliframes, Dupliverts and so on)
**** Mass: Real time stuff.
**** Damping: Real time stuff.
**** Properties: Real time stuff.
**** Logic Bricks: Real time stuff.
**** Constraints: copies Object constraints.
*** ''If applicable:''
**** Copy TexSpace: The texture space.
**** Copy Particle Settings: the complete particle system from the AnimButtons.
*** ''For Curve Objects:''
**** Copy Bevel Settings: all bevelling data from the EditButtons.
*** ''Font Objects:''
**** Copy Font Settings: font type, dimensions, spacing.
**** Copy Bevel Settings: all bevelling data from the EditButtons.
*** ''Camera Objects:''
**** Copy Lens: the lens value.
: '''SHIFT-C.''' CentreZero View. The 3DCursor is set to zero (0,0,0) and the view is changed so that all Objects, including the 3Dcursor, can be displayed. This is an alternative for '''HOME.'''
: '''DKEY.''' Draw mode menu. Allows to select draw modes exactly as the corresponding menu in the 3D viewport header does.
: '''SHIFT-D.''' Add Duplicate. The selected Objects are duplicated. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''ALT-D.''' Add Linked Duplicate. Of the selected Objects linked duplicates are created. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''CTRL-D.''' Draw the (texture) Image as wire. This option has a limited function. It can only be used for 2D compositing.
: '''ALT-E.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''TAB.'''
: '''FKEY.''' If selected Object is a mesh Toggles Face selectMode on and off.
: '''CTRL-F.''' Sort Faces. The faces of the active Mesh Object are sorted, based on the current view in the 3DWindow. The leftmost face first, the rightmost last. The sequence of faces is important for the Build Effect (AnimButtons).
** '''GKEY'''. Grab Mode. Or: the translation mode. This works on selected Objects and vertices. Blender calculates the quantity and direction of the translation, so that they correspond exactly with the mouse movements, regardless of the ViewMode or view direction of the 3DWindow. Alternatives for starting this mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a straight line.
** The following options are available in translation mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL:''' in increments of 1 grid unit.
**** '''SHIFT:''' fine movements.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL:''' in increments of 0.1 grid unit.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Moving along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Moving along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Moving along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the current translation to the X,Y or Z axis. Blender calculates which axis to use, depending on the already initiated mouse movement. Click MiddleMouse again to return to unlimited translation.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a third '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric
*** key directly. '''TAB''' will switch between values, '''ENTER '''finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS:''' These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** ''Grabber can be terminated with:''
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER:''' move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC:''' everything goes back to the old position.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY:''' starts Grab mode again.
**** '''SKEY:''' switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''RKEY:''' switches to Rotate mode.
: '''ALT-G.''' Clears translations, given in Grab mode. The X,Y,Z locations of selected Objects are set to zero.
: '''CTRL-ALT-G.''' Translation Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
** '''SHIFT-G.''' Group Selection
*** ''Children:'' Selects all selected Object's Children.
*** ''Immediate Children:'' Selects all selected Object's first level Children.
*** ''Parent:'' Selects selected Object's Parent.
*** ''Shared Layers:'' Selects all Object on the same Layer of active Object

** '''IKEY.''' Insert Object Key. A keyposition is inserted in the current frame of all selected Objects. A PopupMenu asks what key position(s) must be added to the IpoCurves.
*** ''Loc:'' The XYZ location of the Object.
*** ''Rot:'' The XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''Size:'' The XYZ dimensions of the Object
*** ''LocRot:'' The XYZ location and XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''LocRotSize:'' The XYZ location, XYZ rotation and XYZ dimensions of the Object.
*** ''Layer:'' The layer of the Object.
*** ''Avail:'' A position is only added to all the current IpoCurves, that is curves which already exists.
*** Mesh, Lattice, Curve or Surface: depending on the type of Object, a VertexKey can be added
: '''CTRL-J.''' Join Objects. All selected Objects of the same type are added to the active Object. What actually happens here is that the ObData blocks are combined and all the selected Objects (except for the active one) are deleted. This is a rather complex operation, which can lead to confusing results, particularly when working with a lot of linked data, animation curves and hierarchies.
: '''KKEY.''' Show Keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects. If all of them were already ON, they are all turned OFF.
: '''SHIFT-K.''' A PopupMenu asks: OK? Show and select all keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects, and all Object-keys are selected. This function is used to enable transformation of the entire animation system.
: '''LKEY.''' Makes selected Object local. Makes library linked objects local for the current scene.
** '''CTRL-L.''' Link selected. Links some of the Active Object data to all selected Objects, the following menu entry appears only if applicable.
*** ''To Scene:'' Creates a link of the Object to a scene.
*** ''Object IPOs:'' Links Active Object IPOs to selected ones.
*** ''Mesh data:'' Links Active Object Mesh data selected ones.
*** ''Lamp Data:'' Links Active Object Lamp data to selected ones.
*** ''Surf Data:'' Links Active Object Surf data selected ones.
*** ''Material:'' Links Active Object Material to selected ones.

** '''SHIFT-L.''' Select Linked. Selects all Objects somehow linked to active Object.
*** ''Object IPO:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's IPOs.
*** ''Object Data:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active  Object's ObData.
*** ''Current Material:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's current Material.
*** ''Current Texture:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing  active Object's current Texture.
: '''MKEY.''' Moves selected Object(s) to another layer, a pop-up appers. Use '''LMB''' to move, use '''SHIFT-LMB''' to make the object belong to multiple layers. If the selected Objects have different layers, this is ORed in the menu display. Use ESC to exit the menu. Press the &quot;OK&quot; button or '''ENTER''' to change the layer seting. The hotkeys ('''ALT'''-)('''1KEY, 2KEY''', ... - '''0KEY''') work here as well (see 3DHeader).
: '''CTRL-M.''' Mirror Menu. It is possible to mirror an Object along the X, Y or Z axis.
: '''NKEY.''' Number Panel. The location, rotation and scaling of the active Object are displayed and can be modified.
: '''ALT-O.''' Clear Origin. The `Origin' is erased for all Child Objects, which causes the Child Objects to move to the exact location of the Parent Objects.
: '''SHIFT-O.''' If the selected Object is a Mesh toggles SubSurf onn/ off. '''CTRL-1''' to '''CTRL-4''' switches to the relative SubSurf level for display purpouses. Rendering SUbSurf level has no HotKey.
** '''CTRL-P.''' Make selected Object(s) the child(ren) of the active Object. If the Parent is a Curve then a popup offers two choices:
*** ''Normal Parent:'' Make a normal parent, the curve can be made a path later on.
*** ''Follow Path:'' Automatically creates a Follow Path constraint with the curve as target. If the Parent is an Armature, a popup offers three options:
*** ''Use Bone:'' One of the Bones becomes the parent. The Object will not be deformed. A popup permits to select the bone. This is the option if you are modeling a robot or machinery
*** ''Use Armature:'' The whole armature is used as parent for deformations. This is the choiche for organic beings.
*** ''Use Object:'' Standard parenting. In the second case further options asks if Vertex groups
should not be created, should be created empty or created and populated.
** '''ALT-P.''' Clears Parent relation, user is asked if he wishes to keep or clear parent-induced transforms.
*** ''Clear Parent:'' the selected Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent. since the transformation of the Parent disappears, this can appear as if the former Children themselves are transformed.
*** ''... and keep transform:'' the Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent, and an attempt is made to assign the current transformation, which was determined in part by the Parent, to the (former Child) Objects.
*** ''Clear Parent inverse:'' The inverse matrix of the Parent of the selected Objects is erased. The Child Objects remain linked to the Objects. This gives the user complete control over the hierarchy.
: '''SHIFT-P.''' Push/Pull Transformations. It is a bit like scaling, except that every element is moved the same distance toward or away from the center. The distance they move is controlled by moving the mouse toward you (pull away from center) or away from you (push toward center). &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;

** '''RKEY.''' Rotate mode. Works on selected Object(s). In Blender, a rotation is by default a rotation perpendicular to the screen, regardless of the view direction or ViewMode. The degree of rotation is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try moving around the rotation midpoint with the mouse. The rotation pivot point is determined by the state of the 3DWiewport Header buttons. Alternatives for starting this mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a C-shaped curve.
** The following options are available in rotation mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL''': in increments of 5 degrees.
**** '''SHIFT''': fine movements.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL''': in increments of 1 degree.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Rotating along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Rotating along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Rotating along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the current rotation to the horizontal or vertical view axis.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains rotation to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains rotation to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a third '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. '''ENTER''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS''': These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** ''Rotation can be terminated with:''
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER''': move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC''': everything goes back to the old position.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY''': switches to Grab.
**** '''SKEY''': switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''RKEY''': starts Rotate mode again.
: '''ALT-R.''' Clears Rotation. The X,Y,Z rotations of selected Objects are set to zero.
: '''CTRL-ALT-R.''' Rotation Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
** '''SKEY.''' Size mode or scaling mode. Works on selected Object(s). The degree of scaling is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try to move from the (rotation) midpoint with the mouse. The pivot point is determined by the settings of the 3D Viewport header pivot Menu. Alternatives for starting scaling mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a V-shaped line.
** The following options are available in scaling mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL''': in increments of 0.1.
**** '''SHIFT-CTRL''': in increments of 0.01.
**** '''SHIFT-X:''' Locking the X axis in place. Scaling along Y, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Y:''' Locking the Y axis in place. Scaling along X, Z axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
**** '''SHIFT-Z:''' Locking the Z axis in place. Scaling along X, Y axis only. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the scaling to X, Y or Z axis. Blender calculates the appropriate axis based on the already initiated mouse movement. Click '''MMB''' again to return to free scaling.
*** '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' constrains scaling to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a second '''XKEY, YKEY, ZKEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''NKEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. '''ENTER''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS''':These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** Scaling can be terminated with:
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER''': move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC''': everything goes back to the old dimension.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''GKEY''': switches to Grab.
**** '''SKEY''': starts Size mode again.
**** '''RKEY''': switches to Rotation.
: '''ALT-S.''' Clears Size. The X,Y,Z dimensions of selected Objects are set to 1.0.
: '''CTRL-ALT-S.''' Scale Manipulator. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;
: '''CTRL-SHIFT-S.''' To Sphere Transformations. An interactive version of the To Sphere tool, working both in Edit Mode (on all data types) and in Object Mode. &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;

** '''SHIFT-S.''' SnapMenu:
*** Sel-&gt;Grid: Moves Object to nearest grid point.
*** Sel-&gt;Curs: Moves Object to cursor.
*** Curs-&gt;Grid: Moves cursor to nearest grid point.
*** Curs-&gt;Sel: Moves cursor to selected Object(s).
*** Sel-&gt;Center: Moves Objects to their barycentrum.
: '''TKEY.''' Texture space mode. The position and dimensions of the texture space for the selected Objects can be changed in the same manner as described above for Grab and Size mode. To make this visible, the drawingflag EditButtons-&gt;TexSpace is set ON. A PopupMenu asks you to select: &quot;Grabber&quot; or &quot;Size&quot;.
: '''CTRL-T.''' Makes selected Object(s) track the Active Object. Old track method was Blender default tracking before version 2.30. The new method is the Constrain Track, this creates a fully editable constraint on the selected object targeting the active Object.
: '''ALT-T.''' Clears old style Track. Constraint track is removed as all constrains are.
: '''UKEY.''' Makes Object Single User, the inverse operation of Link
** ('''CTRL-L''') a pop-up appears with choices.
*** ''Object:'' if other Scenes also have a link to this Object, the link is deleted and the Object is copied. The Object now only exists in the current Scene. The links from the Object remain unchanged.
*** ''Object &amp; ObData:'' Similar to the previous command, but now the ObData blocks with multiple links are copied as well. All selected Objects are now present in the current Scene only, and each has a unique ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.).
*** ''Object &amp; ObData &amp; Materials+Tex:'' Similar to the previous command, but now Materials and Textures with multiple links are also copied. All selected Objects are now unique. They have unique ObData and each has a unique Material and Texture block. 
*** ''Materials+Tex:'' Only the Materials and Textures with multiple links are copied.
: '''VKEY.''' Switches in/out of Vertex Paint Mode.
: '''ALT-V.''' Object-Image Aspect. This hotkey sets the X and Y dimensions of the selected Objects in relation to the dimensions of the Image Texture they have. Use this hotkey when making 2D Image compositions and multi-plane designs to quickly place the Objects in the appropriate relationship with one another.
: '''WKEY.''' Opens Object Booleans Menu.
: '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected? Deletes selected objects.
: '''ZKEY.''' Toggles Solid Mode on/off.
: '''SHIFT-Z.''' Toggles Shaded Mode on/off.
: '''ALT-Z.''' Toggles Textured Mode on/off.

== Edit Mode - General==

Again, Most of these hotkeys are useful in the 3D Viewport when in Edit Mode, but many works on other Blender Object, so they are summarized here. Many Object Mode keys works in Edit mode too, but on the selected vertices or control points; among these Grab, Rotate, Scale and so on. These hotkeys are not repeated here.
: '''TAB''' or '''ALT-E.''' This button starts and stops Edit Mode.
: '''CTRL-TAB.''' Switches between Vertex Select, Edge Select, and Face Select modes. Holding SHIFT while clicking on a mode will allow you to combine modes.
: '''AKEY.''' Select/Unselect all.
: '''BKEY-BKEY'''. Circle Select. If you press BKEY a second time after starting Border Select, Circle Select is invoked. It works as described above. Use NUM+ or NUM- or MW to adjust the circle size. Leave Circle Select with '''RMB''' or '''ESC'''.
: '''CTRL-H.''' With vertices selected, this creates a &quot;Hook&quot; object. Once a hook is selected, CTRL-H brings up an options menu for it.
: '''NKEY.''' Number Panel. Simpler than the Object Mode one, in Edit Mode works for Mesh, Curve, Surface: The location of the active vertex is displayed.
: '''OKEY.''' Switch in/out of Proportional Editing.
: '''SHIFT-O.''' Toggles between Smooth and Sharp Proportional Editing.
: '''PKEY.''' SeParate. You can choose to make a new object with all selected vertices, edges, faces and curves or create a new object from each separate group of interconnected vertices from a popup. Note that for curves you cannot separate connected control vertices. This operation is the opposite of Join ('''CTRL-J''').
: '''CTRL-P.''' Make Vertex Parent. If one object (or more than one) is/are selected and the active Object is in Edit Mode with 1 or 3 vertices selected then the Object in Edit Mode becomes the Vertex Parent of the selected Object(s). If only 1 vertex is selected, only the location of this vertex determines the Parent transformation; the rotation and dimensions of the Parent do not play a role here. If three vertices are selected, it is a `normal' Parent relationship in which the 3 vertices determine the rotation and location of the Child together. This method produces interesting effects with Vertex Keys. In EditMode, other Objects can be selected with CTRL-RMB.
: '''CTRL-S.''' Shear. In EditMode this operation enables you to make selected forms `slant'. This always works via the horizontal screen axis.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and can be returned to via UKEY. Mesh Objects have better Undo, see next section.
: '''WKEY.''' Specials PopupMenu. A number of tools are included in this PopupMenu as an alternative to the Edit Buttons. This makes the buttons accessible as shortcuts, e.g. EditButtons-&gt; Subdivide is also `WKEY, 1KEY'.
: '''SHIFT-W.''' Warp. Selected vertices can be bent into curves with this option. It can be used to convert a plane into a tube or even a sphere. The centre of the circle is the 3DCursor. The mid-line of the circle is determined by the horizontal dimensions of the selected vertices. When you start, everything is already bent 90 degrees. Moving the mouse up or down increases or decreases the extent to which warping is done. By zooming in/out of the 3Dwindow, you can specify the maximum degree of warping. The CTRL limiter increments warping in steps of 5 degrees.

== EditMode - Mesh ==

This section and the following highlight peculiar EditMode Hotkeys.
: '''CTRL-NUM+.''' Adds to selection all vertices connected by an edge to an already selected vertex.
: '''CTRL-NUM-.''' Removes from selection all vertices of the outer ring of selected vertices.
: '''ALT-CTRL-RMB.''' Edge select.
: '''CKEY.''' If using curve deformations, this toggles the curve Cyclic mode on/off.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Selected. &quot;Extrude&quot; in EditMode transforms all the selected edges to faces. If possible, the selected faces are also duplicated. Grab mode is started directly after this command is executed.
: '''SHIFT-EKEY.''' Crease Subsurf edge. With &quot;Draw Creases&quot; enabled, pressing this key will allow you to set the crease weight. Black edges have no weight, edge-select color have full weight.
: '''CTRL-EKEY.''' Mark LSCM Seam. Marks a selected edge as a &quot;seam&quot; for unwrapping using the LSCM mode.
: '''FKEY.''' Make Edge/Face. If 2 vertices are selected, an edge is created. If 3 or 4 vertices are selected, a face is created.
: '''SHIFT-F.''' Fill selected. All selected vertices that are bound by edges and form a closed polygon are filled with triangular faces. Holes are automatically taken into account. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession.
: '''ALT-F.''' Beauty Fill. The edges of all the selected triangular faces are switched in such a way that equally sized faces are formed. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession. The Beauty Fill can be performed immediately after a Fill.
: '''CTRL-F.''' Flip faces, selected triangular faces are paired and common edge of each pair swapped.
: '''HKEY.''' Hide Selected. All selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
: '''SHIFT-H.''' Hide Not Selected: All non-selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
: '''ALT-H.''' Reveal. All temporarily hidden vertices and faces are drawn again.
: '''ALT-J.''' Join faces, selected triangular faces are joined in pairs and transformed to quads
** '''KKEY.''' Knife tool Menu.
*** ''Face Loop Select:'' ('''SHIFT-R''') Face loops are highlighted starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Face Loop Cut:'' ('''CTRL-R''') Face loops are highlighted starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (exact):'' ('''SHIFT-K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges are cut at intersections with mouse line. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (midpoints):'' ('''SHIFT-K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges intersecting with mouse line are cut in middle regardless of true intersection point. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an unselected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''SHIFT-L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''CTRL-L.''' Select Linked Selected. Starting with all selected vertices, all vertices connected to them are selected too.
: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Opens a popup asking for the axis to mirror. 3 possible axis group are available, each of which contains three axes, for a total of nine choices. Axes can be Global (Blender Global Reference); Local (Current Object Local Reference) or View (Current View reference). Remember that mirroring, like scaling, happens with respect to the current pivot point.
: '''ALT-M.''' Merges selected vertices at barycentrum or at cursor depending on selection made on pop-up.
: '''CTRL-N.''' Calculate Normals Outside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `outward'.
: '''SHIFT-CTRL-N.''' Calculate Normals Inside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `inward'.
: '''ALT-S.''' Whereas '''SHIFT-S''' scales in Edit Mode as it does in Object Mode, for Edit Mode a further option exists, '''ALT-S''' moves each vertex in the direction of its local normal, hence effectively shrinking/fattening the mesh.
: '''CTRL-T.''' Make Triangles. All selected faces are converted to triangles.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and all subsequent changes are saved on a stack. This option enables you to restore the previous situation, one after the other.
: '''SHIFT-U.''' Redo. This let you re-apply any undone changes up to the moment in which Edit Mode was entered
: '''ALT-U.''' Undo Menu. This let you choose the exact point to which you want to undo changes.
** '''WKEY.''' Special Menu. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Subdivide:'' all selected edges are split in two.
*** ''Subdivide Fractal:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced randomly.
*** ''Subdivide Smooth:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced along the normal.
*** ''Merge:'' as '''ALT-M.'''
*** ''Remove Doubles:'' All selected vertices closer to each other than a given threshold (See EditMode Button Window) are merged '''ALT-M.'''
*** ''Hide:'' as '''HKEY.'''
*** ''Reveal:'' as '''ALT-H.'''
*** ''Select Swap:'' Selected vertices become unselected and vice versa.
*** ''Flip Normals:'' Normals of selected faces are flipped.
*** ''Smooth:'' Vertices are moved closer one to each other, getting a smoother object.
*** ''Bevel:'' Faces are reduced in size and the space between edges is filled with a smoothly curving bevel of the desired order.

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Vertices:'' all vertices are deleted. This includes the edges and faces they form.
*** ''Edges:'' all edges with both vertices selected are deleted. If this `releases' certain vertices, they are deleted as well. Faces that can no longer exist as a result of this action are also deleted.
*** ''Faces:'' all faces with all their vertices selected are deleted. If any vertices are `released' as a result of this action, they are deleted.
*** ''All:'' everything is deleted.
*** ''Edges and Faces:'' all selected edges and faces are deleted, but the vertices remain.
*** ''Only Faces:'' all selected faces are deleted, but the edges and vertices remain.
: '''YKEY.''' Split. This command splits the selected part of a Mesh without deleting faces. The split parts are no longer bound by edges. Use this command to control smoothing. Since the split parts have vertices at the same position, selection with '''LKEY''' is recommended.

== EditMode - Curve ==

: '''CKEY.''' Set the selected curves to cyclic or turn cyclic off. An individual curve is selected if at least one of the vertices is selected.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Curve. A vertex is added to the selected end of the curves. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is executed.
: '''FKEY.''' Add segment. A segment is added between two selected vertices at the end of two curves. These two curves are combined into one curve.
: '''HKEY.''' Toggle Handle align/free. Toggles the selected Bezier handles between free or aligned.
: '''SHIFT-H.''' Set Handle auto. The selected Bezier handles are converted to auto type.
: '''CTRL-H.''' Calculate Handles. The selected Bezier curves are calculated and all handles are assigned a type.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an non-selected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected together with all the vertices of the same curve.

: '''VKEY.''' Vector Handle. The selected Bezier handles are converted to vector type.
** '''WKEY.''' The special menu for curves appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices.
*** Switch direction. The direction of the selected curves is reversed. This is mainly for Curves that are used as paths!

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''Segment:'' a curve segment is deleted. This only works for single segments. Curves can be split in two using this option. Or use this option to specify the cyclic position within a cyclic curve.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== EditMode - Metaball ==

: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.

== EditMode - Surface ==

: '''CKEY.''' Toggle Cyclic menu. A PopupMenu asks if selected surfaces in the `U' or the `V' direction must be cyclic. If they were already cyclic, this mode is turned off.
: '''EKEY.''' Extrude Selected. This makes surfaces of all the selected curves, if possible. Only the edges of surfaces or loose curves are candidates for this operation. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is completed.
: '''FKEY.''' Add segment. A segment is added between two selected vertices at the ends of two curves. These two curves are combined into 1 curve.
: '''LKEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an non-selected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected together with all the vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''SHIFT-L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected together with all vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''MKEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.
: '''SHIFT-R.''' Select Row. Starting with the last selected vertex, a complete row of vertices is selected in the `U' or `V' direction. Selecting ''Select Row'' a second time with the same vertex switches the `U' or `V' selection.
** '''WKEY.''' The special menu for surfaces appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices
*** Switch direction. This will switch the normals of the selected parts.
*** Mirror. Mirrors the selected vertices

** '''XKEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following choices:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== VertexPaint Hotkeys ==

: '''SHIFT-K.''' All vertex colours are erased; they are changed to the current drawing colour.
: '''UKEY.''' Undo. This undo is `real'. Pressing Undo twice redoes the undone.
: '''WKEY.''' Shared Vertexcol: The colours of all faces that share vertices are blended.

== EditMode - Font ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Blender 2.36 HotKeys ==

Ok, I converted this Hotkeys from official [http://www.blender.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=documentation&amp;file=index Blender PDF] file. Please use official Hotkeys names in your articles! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 14:21, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

== ideas for organization ==

I'd like to start a discussion about how this book should be organized.  Perhaps the organization should be changed, or maybe it should stay the way it currently is.  Here's an idea:

Create a page for each shortcut.  The URL would be formatted very specifically; for example:

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Edit Mode/EKEY]]

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Vertex Paint Mode/VKEY]]

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Object Mode/SHIFT-DKEY]]

This way there could be very detailed information about each of the shortcuts in the different modes.

Then on the Mode Pages, for example the Edit Mode page, the shortcuts could be listed by function....

'''Edit Mode'''

'''''Mesh Modeling'''''

A

*AKEY - select all

E

*EKEY - extrude

etc...

: It's good idea to explain more detailed information about every HotKey, maybe even with examples or links to tutorial examples, but I think that is also good to have all HotKeys in one place (as it is) and from here links to more detailed explanations as you said [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]]. I would like to see here also keyboard drawing with color marked HotKeys large enough that can be printed and used on actual keyboard. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 17:30, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:: I just learned something using Template:whatever and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, let me try it out, I think this will help. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 13:28, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

::: Check this out.  Follow the subpages I've created and take a look at the way these &lt;nowiki&gt;{{templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; work.  We can then embed the same hotkey instructions on any Blender book page anywhere in wikibooks using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Check it out: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_HotKeys/new

: Cool! This looks nice and useful! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:59, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

== Blender 2.37a HotKeys Update ==

New HotKeys are marked with &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:21, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)</text>

== To Do ==

* Probably is good idea to mark author, quality, version, level, format (pdf, flash, java)...etc of tutorials somehow. UTF-8 caracters are useful, but problem is that Window$ IE usually don't show them all.

Here are some useful UTF-8 caracters for this purpose:
: ✓ ✗ ☺ ☹ ✩ ✐ ❀ ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ ❺ ❻ ❼ ❽ ❾ ❿

or we could have Window$ safe caracters:

: !? - ok, but probably not the best
: ! - good
: !! - excellent
: ***** - five stars for the best
: 2.36 - Blender version compatibility

== ElYsiun Discussion ==

We also talk about this Module on [http://www.elysiun.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=40007 www.elysiun.com].

== Sorry Popski ==

(Official Blender Documentation) Sorry for deleting w/o discussing, but those links are wierd... One is linking to the first of two parts of the current blender doc. One other is for the old blender doc, but the one at the top (which i kept) is linking to a page -&gt; linking to all official docs. Either we remove the two second links (again), or add all the links on the &quot;official docs&quot; page which the first link is reffering to.

: It's ok, you were right about Blender Documentation Links, but discussion before delete is a fair play here, also don't be just a number and sign up, it's free. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 15:41, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== How to write a Blender WikiBook? ==

It's easy. Just make link with [[Blender 3D: BookName]] in [[Blender 3D]] module and start to write. But if you will write some Blender tutorial it's probably better place to put it in [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] WikiBook where is proper place for all ''classical'' Blender tutorials. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 15:41, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Multilingual links ==

=== French ===

In [[Blender 3D: Tutorial Links List]] are only links to English tutorials. I noticed that some users started to add there also tutorials in other languages. So I will move them temporary here since there is no such WikiBooks.

It was not meant to merge it since we started. I's not the same concept of this two books.
--&gt;

As you may be aware, '''[[Wikipedia:Blender (program)|Blender]]''' is the first and only fully integrated 3D graphics creation suite allowing modeling, animation, rendering, post-production, realtime interactive 3D, and game creation and playback with cross-platform compatibility - all in one tidy package.

This '''Blender MemoBook''' is part of my personal Memo Ssschratchhhh WikiBook. Maybe you will find it useful. You can edit it if you already have your own MemoBook, tip or proper link to add@this level! This level means that you can find this MemoBook useful after you went carefully thru Blender [http://www.blender.org/manual/getting_started/basics/index.html Interface] for the very first time and you want something nice to render or animate with your Digital Studio Masterpiece - Blender! This Blender MemoBook doesn't want to be YaBt (Yet another Blender tutorial), but more like MemoBook with references to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Tutorial Links List|tutorial links]] (to support short HOWTOs) and tips which related tutorials maybe didn't include or are worth repeating. I want to keep this MemoBook as compact as possible, but still smooth and friendly enough to be read.

Also don't worry if [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Introduction|you want to edit]] this MemoBook, feel free and welcome, [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/ MediaWiki] has all history backed up. MediaWiki is quite easy to install. How? Read [[Starting and Running a Wiki Website|this]] WikiBook.

== From Pawn to Queen, Frog or Freddy maybe... ==

== General Tips ==

* Here is what I found to be the '''Golden Rule''' of Blender:
: ''&quot;'''Keep one hand on your keyboard and one on your mouse.'''&quot;''
* '''Blender [http://www.blender.org/manual/contents.html Manual].'''
* '''Blender [[Blender 3D: HotKeys|Hotkeys]] &amp; [http://www.katsbits.com/tutorials/blender/useful-keyboard-shortcuts.php Useful Blender Shortcuts]'''
* '''Blender [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Tutorial Links List|Tutorial Links List]]'''
* '''Google is your friend'''. Search for blender filetypes like this: ''scene filetype:blend''

== Ok, let's do it! ==

I didn't work in ''real'' 3D for many years (I've used Cubicomp and Topas in my professional past) and even with all my 3D experiences using Blender doesn't look like easy task... But anyway, you will never know how to swim if you don't jump into the water, as someone said, so I'll try to make a beautiful Staunton chess set for my first Blender lesson. Hard &amp; original task, huh? :) But before you start i would like to invite you to read beautiful writing for a new artists,  [http://glenmoyes.com/articles/to_those_learning_3d.shtml To Those Learning 3D] written by Glen Moyes.

'''Before you really start''', it's a good idea to set home paths for textures, fonts, render, yfexport, python, texplugins, sounds, seqplugins, and tmp ''(be careful: default /tmp is deleted after reboot, it's better to set it somewhere else, like /home/blender/render)''. You can find this options in User Preferences: '''CTRL-ALT-U'''. I find it useful if it's '''MMB''' ''(middle mouse button)'' set to '''Pan View''' instead the default '''Rotate View'''. I also prefer '''Dolly''' rather than '''Continue''' View Zoom. After these changes you can save default scene with '''CTRL-U'''.

For the reference image I've downloaded some proper Staunton set photos from the net. You can use photos as references in Blender too, but for the Blender SVG import test I will use [[Wikipedia:Inkscape|Inkscape]] for the 2D chess set render.

=== Staunton chess set ===

First I will make a pawn. Why? Heh, because it's the greatest piece! You don't believe me? Well, the pawn can be promoted to any piece except the king, can't it? So... :)

Ok, I can't say that Blender 2.35 doesn't read Inkscape SVG, but the import is not perfect yet, so it looks that I will have to wait for perfect import till some next Blender release.

I didn't want to make a 2D pawn polygon again, so I repaired the broken Inkscape SVG in Blender 2.35 version also can't read open SVG polygons which are needed for my pawn...

I used Blender basic Mesh Tool [http://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/spin.html Spin], which is probably not the best option if you want to have huge number of objects made that way. For such purpose is better to use [http://www.blender.org/manual/modifiers/generate/subsurf.html Catmull-Clark Subdivision Surfaces] because of Subdivision Surfaces control, but for this very first test was ok.

Ok, I did it! Staunton Pawn is born. Not bad for the first try! I had problems with merging doubled points ('''Edit mode &gt; WKEY &gt; Merge'''); &lt;s&gt;maybe it is better to leave them doubled&lt;/s&gt;. There must be easier way to delete them. I'll check this with the next piece - bishop, zebra, robot, house, or mouse. You can download chess set from [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Blender_3D:_ActionBook/Verse here]. ''(You can remove doubles if you select all vertices &amp; ('''Edit mode &gt; WKEY &gt; Remove Doubles'''), but you need to be careful that you start to build at center '''SHIFT-CKEY''')''.

[[Image:Pawn05.jpg|170px|YafRay glass pawn]]&lt;br&gt;''Glass pawn''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Materials ====

* The '''plastic pawn''' is without texture and the scene has two lights, one ''omni'' (omnidirectional) light for better ambient light and one stronger spot light which casts shadows. Shadows in this scene were made with ''Buf. Shadow'' setting (Lamp buttons) where you have good control over shadow softness.

* For the '''rusty pawn''' I've used the same scene with two lights and a rust texture map (I've made a larger tile 2400x3200 px texture in [[Wikipedia:GIMP|Gimp]], but I found it later that is better to use ''power of 2'' sizes for textures: 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048, ... etc.) from [http://www.mayang.com/textures/index.htm www.mayang.com] where you can find a lot of free, large &amp; useful textures for your models. '''Map input''' setting for this rust texture is ''cube''; settings for '''map to''' are ''col'' and ''nor'', this stands for using colors and normals (bump mapping). This stage went without problems, but I needed a lot of experimenting with settings. I found it out that you need to rotate texture through 90 degrees in Blender if you want to have original texture position!! (Blender ver. 2.35).

* The '''Amber pawn''' is made using Subdivisions instead of '''SPIN''' command. It stands in the same scene but there is more lights and background curved plane. For this material I've used ''reflection mapping'' '''F5 &gt; World buttons; F5 &gt; Material buttons &gt; Mirror Trans''' and ''Ramp Shader''. Do you know how many lights are used for the Amber pawn?

* The '''Glass pawn''' stands in the same scene but is rendered with '''Yafray''' renderer which finally works in Blender 2.35, but still not by default(!!). For this you have to switch off the '''xml''' button '''Scene (F10) &gt; Render &gt; Yafray &gt; xml'''.  Results with Yafray are good, but it's a large time consumer - read slow. For Yafray rendering I needed to set different light settings to those in the previous scene because the Yafray render is much darker than the default Blender renderer. This you can correct a bit in the same menu as is ''xml'' button with ''Gam'' and ''Exp'' sliders (Gamma correction and Exposition), but probably you will need to add more energy to lights too. I set ''Exp'' to 4.0 and the spot light ''Energy'' to 5.5 (in the previous scene was 1.4 for the same lighting arrangement). This glass pawn is without texture, but I added one photon spot light from the same direction but little lower. Photon light doesn't shine as normal light but traces light photons through material refraction. You can see results on the background surface and on model itself. I set the pawn material refraction to 1.5 '''Shading (F5), Material buttons &gt; Mirror Transp &gt; IOR''' which is the value for glass as you can see in [[#Material Refraction Values Table|Material Refraction Values Table]]. I found good tutorials about this topic on [http://www.blender3d.com/cms/Materials.247.0.html www.blender3d.com].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:center;margin:0 1em 1em 0;text-align:center;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Staunton_set4.jpg|700px|Staunton chess set]]&lt;br&gt;''Completed Staunton chess set, prepared for a good [[NeoRandom Chess]] game!''&lt;/div&gt;

* All chess pieces were made with the same subsurface principle: '''Shift AKEY &gt;&gt; Add &gt; Mesh &gt; Cylinder''' and '''EKEY''' for extrude, but the difference is in the number of vertices. The pawn is started with 4 vertices, the knight with 8, bishop with 16, king with 8, queen with 10, and the rook with 12. Four vertices for the pawn is not enough for a rounded bottom (read about this problem [[#Other FAQ|here]]). The knight was made with the extrude function '''EKEY''' and with some tweaked vertices. I also added two additional Face Loop Cuts '''KKEY &gt; Face Loop Cut''' for head details. The bishop was made the same way. Here I also used the knife function '''KKEY &gt; Knife (Exact)''' for the bishop head cut. The rook could be started with 18 vertices for a better result on the parapets (the upper part of the rook). Material for this chess set was taken from [[#Staunton chess set|amber pawn]], the only change is color hue.

=== Cobra ===

Did you expect to find here '''Queen''' or '''Zebra'''? Oh no, my friend. Here is '''Cobra''', or the so-called '''Shelby Cobra Blueprint''' which is needed to build your new Cobra 3D car model. One day I was looking for a good Cobra Car Blueprint, but I found only one with a small resolution, so I decided to draw a Cobra Blueprint in SVG format with another great 2D vector software package [[Wikipedia:Inkscape|Inkscape]]. You can download the '''Cobra Blueprint''' SVG files [http://openclipart.org/search/?query=shelby here] at '''Openclipart.org'''.

[[Image:Shelby Cobra 260.jpg|center|700px|Shelby Cobra 260, by Igor Križanovskij]]

There are quite a lot of car tutorials around, but best so far that I found is a tutorial for a car made by '''Speedtiti''' ''(sometimes you can find him on [irc://irc.freenode.net/blenderchat IRC])''. I missed some details in his tutorial, but I think his approach to car modeling is right one. In the picture above you can see my Cobra progress so far. Perhaps as you are building your car model you will need some of these [[Blender_3D: Tutorial Links List#Cars|tutorials]] and also [https://www.blender.org/support/tutorials/ this], as well as one about car lights at '''3dcar-gallery.com'''. Finally there is an excellent site with tons of blueprints [http://www.suurland.com/ online]!

: ''Have fun with building '''Cobra''' and don't forget to make some useful entries in the Memo Book!''

=== Face of Gilbert ===

The '''Face of Gilbert''' was my first try to make an organic form with '''Blender'''. I didn't use any reference pictures. The main reason for this is that almost every tutorial uses reference pictures and I wanted to see what I could do without them.  
[[image:Face01.jpg|right|350px|Gilbert]]
What did I learn from this exercise? Well, '''Blender''' is very strong modeling tool compared to software that I had used before ''(yes, that's an old book:)''. [http://www.blender.org/manual/modifiers/generate/subsurf.html Catmull-Clark Subdivision Surfaces] is an excellent tool for organic forms and gives you precise control over surface curves, but you have to be careful about two things: '''First''', when you model the front side of the model you have to be careful about the back side vertices at the same time! Why? Because if you start with box modeling like I did in this exercise, you will have a flat backside full of vertices in the same plane after you finish the front side face modeling and this is rather difficult to change later. The same is true for the left and right side of the model. Only later I found a very useful [http://topology-guides.tumblr.com/ Topology Guides]. '''Second''', if you want to model some exact shapes, especially rounded circles, don't start with a Box but try with a Tube or use command [http://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/spin.html SPIN]. Read more about this problem [[#Other FAQ|here]]. In my case it was also a good idea to control surfaces from inside of the model, especially when modeling concave slopes like ears. Thru processing I didn't delete any vertices and I've used mainly these commands for modeling: '''KKEY''' for loop cut, '''EKEY''' for extrude (in my case used only for the ear), '''GKEY''' for editing vertices and '''SKEY''' for scale ''(with the SKEY you also control symmetrization of vertices)''. You can check [https://www.blender.org/support/tutorials/] some tutorials for the basic idea how I've made Gilbert.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0;text-align:center;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Victor_Render_4.jpg|350px|Victor the Brave]]&lt;br&gt;''Holly smoke! I think I can fly!''&lt;/div&gt;
The scene and material for this model are quite simple. I have used two lights: one spot and one omnidirectional. I have also included a grey-blue back plane for an additional 3D effect. Face material is made with [http://www.blender.org/manual/render/blender_render/materials/properties/ramps.html Ramp Shaders] ('''F5 &gt; Ramps'''). I didn't care much about materials this time, but I will try [http://blenderscripting.blogspot.com/ SSS python script] for this purpose later. This face is made with '''Blender 2.36''' but it will be even easier to do it with the additional features in Blender's next release 2.37! ''Yesss!!''

=== Victor the Brave ===

Yes, '''Blender 2.37a''' is even more enjoyable for modeling than the previous versions. At this point I can tell you for sure that Blender is really a Big Software Bundle. This also means that you will never be able to master ''all'' of Blender's finest filigree features and options unless you are hmm, God? With integrated Python there's just too many options... and there's still more and more to come!

I've made the '''Victor The Brave''' character for the purpose of learning animation, and pure fun of course! What did I learn? I found another of Blender's Modeling Golden Rules! '''Less is More, but Optimal is the Best!''' So when you model have in mind that less vertices you use, the closer to perfection you will be, but don't forget to press Optimal button from time to time ('''F9; Mesh; Optimal''' :)

I also found it out that is '''VERY''' important how you start modeling your model if you want to finish it with a good, smooth &amp; optimal mesh ''(this is also important for composition)''. There are many ways to finish your model, but only few that are optimal. Victor the Brave'' (all his body parts)'' was started from one and only one sphere, yes sphere.

Unfortunately there is no single way to model optimally. Different models, different approaches. The ''[[#Face of Gilbert|Face of Gilbert]]'' was started from a box (8 vertices), but was hard for me to control the shape of the whole head. So I started to model ''Victor'' from sphere with 8x8 vertices. I'm satisfied with this result also because of the quite short render times which will be important in the next stages. On the other hand, the model of the ''[[#Cobra|Cobra]]'' was started from circle (not a sphere) with 8 vertices. Optimal? Did I say that my way is optimal? :) I used a tool [http://www.blender.org/manual/modeling/curves/editing/introduction.html?highlight=taper Taper] for the snake-like form. In this scene there are seven lights (one spot light) with two contrast colors (cold, warm). Materials involved experimenting with [http://www.blender.org/manual/render/blender_render/materials/properties/ramps.html Ramp Shaders] and [http://www.blender.org/manual/physics/particles/introduction.html Particle System]. You can check out [http://www.androidblues.com/howto.html Steven Stahlberg's] excellent tutorials. Anyway, if you still have some questions about how this works we can use this Blender MemoBook [[Talk:Blender 3D: MemoBook|talkpage]].

Well, '''Blender 2.4''' is on its [http://www.blender3d.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=18&amp;sid=e4450b93f2b288aac496845c643eea49 way]! With a big jump! In the next Blender release we can expect a lot of great new features! First and most important for my next step in this MemoBook is new armature system. We'll be able to animate more comfortably with it. Then I have to congratulate '''[irc://irc.freenode.net/blenderclasses timmeh]''' for embedding IRC &amp; additions in Blender. I also keenly waiting on [http://www.blender.org/manual/physics/particles/physics/fluid.html Fluid Dynamics]. On the horizon is also and interesting project [http://blender.org/modules/verse/ Verse], which will hopefully be able to join together many, many users in one ''real time'' working team. I just have a feeling that Blender will be in every single school &amp; elsewhere around the globe very soon.

== My progress FAQ ==

'''''Notice:''' This part also cover Blender versions 2.4+. Some functions may not work with an older Blender versions.''

=== Basic FAQ ===

* '''How do I close a polygon?'''
: Select 2 vertices you want to close and press '''FKEY'''.
* '''How do I open closed polygon?'''
: ''One option:'' Select two vertices, press '''XKEY''' and choose Edge in the menu not to delete the vertices but only the edge.
: ''Another one:'' Select two vertices, make subdivide and then delete section.
* '''How to make a hole?'''
: ''One option:'' Delete face(s).
: ''Second option:'' Select face(s) and press '''PKEY''' (separate). That way you will separate face(s) from mesh.
: ''Third option:'' Select edge and press '''VKEY'''. That way you will make hole in the edge. ''(new feature)''
* '''How to separate faces from a mesh?'''
: Select faces and press '''PKEY'''.
* '''How to join separated meshes?'''
: Select meshes and press '''CTRL-JKEY'''.
* '''How to join vertices?'''
: Select vertices and press '''WKEY''' &gt;&gt; '''Merge'''.
* '''How the heck do I edit those Bézier Curves already?'''
: You can add points to the curve by selecting one of the two endpoints, then holding '''CTRL''' and clicking '''LMB''' 
: ''Curve Modes:'' '''HKEY, VKEY, SHIFT-H; CKEY''' (close) or Read [http://download.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/ch09.html#section_bezier here].
* '''How to move 3D cursor in center XYZ (0,0,0)?'''
: '''SHIFT-CKEY''' is the answer.
* '''How to move center of the object?'''
: Under Editing (press '''F9'''), Curve and surface - New Center 
* '''How to rotate 2D polygon around one axis and make object that way?'''
: Draw open(!) polygon; Convert it into a mesh (press '''ALT-C''' in Object Mode); Select all vertices (press '''AKEY''') and check on top bar for number of vertices (this is important for deleting this polygon later); Switch to top view ('''NUM 7''') (you can't do this in other views!); Select one verticle; The cursor should be placed along the center of the polygon profile, and snapping the cursor to that location with '''SHIFT-S''' &gt;&gt; Cursor -&gt; Selection.; Press '''[http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/x2868.html SPIN]''' button (don't forget to set 360 degrees rotation and proper steps number - around 36); Annoying part is removing double vertices:  To merge (weld) two vertices together, select both of them by holding '''SHIFT'''  and '''RMB''' on them. Press '''SKEY''' to start scaling and hold down '''CONTROL''' while scaling to scale the points down to 0 units in the X,Y and Z axis. '''LMB''' to complete the scaling operation and click the &quot;Remove Doubles&quot; button in the EditButtons window. Alternatively, you can press '''WKEY''' and select &quot;Merge&quot; from the appearing Menu. You can then choose in a new menu if the merged node will have to be at the center of the selected nodes or in the location of the cursor. The first choice is better in my case.
* ''' How do I force camera to track an object?'''
: Select camera in object mode then hold '''SHIFT''' and select object; press '''CTRL-T'''.
* ''' How do I un-force camera to track an object?'''
: Under menu '''Constraint (F7)''' press button ('''x''') delete, ''(I didn't have luck with shotcut) :/ ''
* '''Holy smoke, there are no shadows?!'''
: You will not see [http://www.blender.org/manual/render/blender_render/lighting/lamps/area/raytraced_shadows.html shadows] casting by [http://www.blender.org/manual/render/blender_render/lighting/index.html lights] if you do not switch the Ray button on (Scene ('''F10''') - Render Menu - Ray); you also have to check if you set object material to receive shadows (Shading ('''F5''') - Shaders - Shadow) ; another option is to use Buffer Shadow, this option is very value sensitive.
* '''How to Redo?''' 
: '''CTRL-Y'''. Redo. Mac users may use ''CMD-Y''.; '''SHIFT-CTRL-Z'''. Redo. Mac users may use ''SHIFT-CMD-Z''; You can even use '''ALT-U''' ''(Global Undo History List)''.
* '''How to switch to the reverse side view?'''
: Press '''CTRL + Numpad Number'''.
* '''How to align view to selected?'''
: Select face(s) &amp; press '''SHIFT-VKEY'''.
* '''How to move faces along their normals?'''
: Select face(s) &amp; press '''ALT-S'''.
* '''How to lock only one axis (x, y or z)?'''
: '''GKEY''' ''(or SKEY, EKEY,...)'' &amp; then press '''SHIFT-X''' ''(or SHIFT-Y, SHIFT-Z)''.
* '''How to apply modifiers on object?'''
: In Object Mode press '''ALT-C''' or press button '''Apply''' in Modifiers menu.

=== Other FAQ ===

* '''How to append character with armatures into another scene?'''
: One way is to append Scene ''('''SHIFT-F1''' &gt;&gt; '''Scene''')'' and link it together ''('''Object Mode''' &gt;&gt;&gt; '''Object''' &gt;&gt; '''Make Links''' &gt; '''To Scene'''...)''.
* '''How do I control curvature over subsurf surface?'''
: In Edit Mode select vertice(s) and press '''SHIFT-E''' then drag mouse to change value ''(0.0 - 1.0)''.
* '''Can I get perfect circle roundness from the bottom to the top of the pawn?'''
: No, not if you started with mesh having less than 4 corners - try starting with '''SPACE''' &gt;&gt; '''Add Cylinder''' (8 vertices).
* '''Where is my wallet?'''
: Check your pocket, wallet. :)
* '''Can I download models and textures from this MemoBook?'''
: Yes, try [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Blender_3D:_ActionBook here].
* '''Where can I find newest Blender builds?'''
: Check [http://www.graphicall.org/builds/index.php this] site.
* '''Where can I find friends?'''
: Hmm, this depends on many factors ''(where you are, how old are you, etc)''. Try with [[Relationships/Where Couples Met|this]] book.

== Part II: [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Blender_3D:_ActionBook ActionBook!!] ==

Old &amp; new '''Blender''' tools have a bunch of new stuff implemented since '''versions 2.4+'''. Changes and new candies in armatures, NLA, new Nodes &amp; other powerful tools can give you amazing spectrum of new options, but watch out, also traps! In the next part of this book I'll try to cover other advanced Blender options &amp; features in animations, nodes, composing, etc...

== Blender icon ==

I have removed the 'Blender icon' image from this page. It is not the Blender icon or logo, and looks like it has been made by a third party.

==[[wikipedia:RJ11,_RJ14,_RJ25|RJ-11 (Registered Jack 11)]]==
'''RJ-11''' is a physical interface often used for terminating telephone wires. 
It is probably the most familiar of the registered jacks, being used for single line [[Network_Plus_Certification/Media_and_Topologies/Wide_Area_Networks#POTS_.28Plain_Old_Telephone_Service.29|Plain Old Telephone Service]] (POTS) telephone jacks in most homes across the world.

'''RJ-14''' is similar, but for two lines, and '''RJ-25''' is for three lines.  The telephone line cord and its plug are more often a true RJ-11 with only two conductors.

This means that to play a song on the SNES, you need a program for the SPC700 that manipulates the DSP, and you need code for the 65816 that transfers the SPC700 program to the SPC700.  Fortunately, there are thousands of programs for the SPC700 freely available online in the form of SPC files, solving half our problem.

= SPC files =
SPC files contain the state of the SPC700, typically at the very beginning of a song in an SNES game.  By restoring the state in an SPC700 and DSP emulator -- a.k.a. an SPC player -- you can listen to the song without the SNES ROM.  We can likewise use SPC files to restore the SPC state inside of the SNES to play the song.  You can get SPC files either by capturing them yourself using an SNES ROM and emulator or by downloading one of the thousands online at [http://www.snesmusic.org/v2/ SNESMusic.org].

= Extracting SPC700 state from an SPC file =

The SPC700 file contains the SPC hardware state as well as a variety of additional information, such as title, game name, author, capturer, etc.  An in-depth description of the format can be found at [http://www.snesmusic.org/files/spc_file_format.txt SNESMusic.org], but the relevant fields for our purposes are:

{| width=&quot;80%&quot;

We need to get this data from inside an SPC file and put it into our ROM.  You ''could'' write a script to extract this data from the SPC file and turn it into a text file of assembly data directives, and &lt;tt&gt;.include&lt;/tt&gt; in your assembly file.  However, the &lt;tt&gt;.incbin&lt;/tt&gt; directive in the WLA assembler makes this process much simpler, since it allows us to include pieces of binary files directly into our ROM.  Here is how we include the above data:

 ; The SPC file from which we read our data.
 .define spcFile &quot;test000.spc&quot;
 
 dspData:  .incbin spcFile skip $10100 read $0080
 audioPC:  .incbin spcFile skip $00025 read $0002
 audioA:   .incbin spcFile skip $00027 read $0001
 audioX:   .incbin spcFile skip $00028 read $0001
 audioY:   .incbin spcFile skip $00029 read $0001
 audioPSW: .incbin spcFile skip $0002a read $0001
 audioSP:  .incbin spcFile skip $0002b read $0001

Notice that we have not included the SPC RAM data in the data definitions above.  Because the SPC RAM data (64k) is larger than the SNES's ROM bank size (32k), we need to break it in half and store it in two banks of its own, separate from the rest of our code and data:

 ; The first half of the saved SPC RAM from the SPC file.
 .bank 1
 .section &quot;musicData1&quot;
 spcMemory1: .incbin spcFile skip $00100 read $8000
 .ends
 
 ; The second half of the saved SPC RAM from the SPC file.
 .bank 2
 .section &quot;musicData2&quot;
 spcMemory2: .incbin spcFile skip $08100 read $8000
 .ends

= The Main Program =

We use most of the code from the SNES Initialization Tutorial for our main program:

 Start:
     ; Initialize the SNES.
     Snes_Init
 
     jsr     LoadSPC
 
     ; Set the background color to green.
     sep     #$20        ; Set the A register to 8-bit.
     lda     #%10000000  ; Force VBlank and set brightness to 0%.
     sta     $2100
     stz     $2121
     lda     #%11100000  ; Load the low byte of the green background color.
     sta     $2122
     lda     #%00000000  ; Load the high byte of the green background color.
     sta     $2122
     lda     #%00001111  ; End VBlank, setting brightness to 100%.
     sta     $2100
 
     ; Loop forever.
 Forever:
     jmp Forever

We have added a line to call a subroutine to load the SPC data, just before the graphics code from the initialization tutorial.  The advantage of including this graphics code is that it does something on the screen after the music loads.  Thus, when we execute the ROM, it tells us visually either that the music was loaded successfully or that execution halted somewhere in the music code.

= Uploading the SPC700 state =

The SNES and the SPC700 communicate via four byte-wide channels, which we will call Audio0, Audio1, Audio2, and Audio3.  On the SNES side, these are represented by the memory-mapped registers $2140-$2143, while the SPC represents them as $00f4-$00f7.  Although there are four channels, there are actually eight values being stored behind the scenes -- four bytes for the channels from the SNES to the SPC and four bytes for the channels from the SPC to the SNES.  For example, when the SNES writes a value to its Audio0, it is saved in one location so the SPC can read it from its Audio0.  Likewise, when the SPC writes a value to its Audio0, it is saved in another location so the SNES can read it from its Audio0.  Thus the value that is read from a channel's memory-mapped register may not be the value that was last written there.

== The SPC's communication routine ==

When the SNES is reset, the SPC maps a 64-byte chunk of ROM -- called the &quot;IPL ROM&quot; -- to locations $ffc0-$ffff and executes it. While it's mapped there, reads come from this ROM rather than normal RAM. It performs the necessary initialization of the SPC:

* Set the stack pointer to $01ef.
* Zero memory locations $0000-$00ef.
* Wait for data from the SNES.

The IPL ROM routine is capable of copying blocks of data from the SNES into SPC memory and then starting execution at a given location.  The documents of the SNES Devkit at [http://snescentral.edgeemu.com/Development SNES Central] are somewhat confusing regarding the exact communication protocol of the SPC.  You can view the routine by disassembling the IPL ROM bytecode included in the source code of SNES or SPC emulators or in SPC files themselves.  Here, however, is a summary of the algorithm the SPC uses:

# Initialization:
#* Set AudioOut0 to $aa and AudioOut1 to $bb.
#* Wait until AudioIn0 is $cc.
# Prepare to copy a block:
#* Read the 16-bit destination address from AudioIn2 (low byte) and AudioIn3 (high byte).
#* Copy AudioIn0 to AudioOut0.
#* If AudioIn1 is zero, start execution at the destination address.
# Copy a block:
#* Wait until AudioIn0 is zero.
#* Set a byte-sized counter to zero.
# Copy a byte:
#* Wait while the counter is greater than AudioIn0.
#* If the counter equals AudioIn0:
#** Copy a byte from AudioIn1 to the memory location.
#** Increment the counter and the memory location.
#** Go to Step 4.
#* Otherwise (when the counter is less than AudioIn0), go to Step 2.

A particularly astute and/or paranoid programmer will observe that when the SPC's byte-sized counter rolls over (increments from $ff to $00), it becomes less than the value in AudioIn0, which may cause an error: Unless the SNES updates AudioIn0 in time, the SPC routine may think the block has ended, while the SNES is still sending data.  When this happens, the SNES and SPC may end up waiting for each other in different parts of the protocol, freezing the system ''(this may be incorrect -- see note on discussion page)''.

To prevent a lockup, then, the SNES must update Audio0 as fast as possible.  This means pre-copying the data to the fastest memory available and disabling interrupts whenever using the IPL ROM's protocol.  Alternatively, you could restrict yourself to copying blocks of less than 255 bytes so that the counter never rolls over, or you could install a better communications routine in SPC RAM and use that instead.

== The SNES's communication routine ==

Now that we have examined the protocol from the SPC's side, we need an SNES routine to interface with it.  First, we will examine a routine similar to the one used in open-source demos (and, presumably, actual SNES games).  Then, we will make a slight modification to it that simplifies our code.

Here is the general algorithm used in open-source demos:

# Wait until Audio0 is $aa, signifying that the SPC has completed its initialization.
# Initialize a byte-wide counter to $cc.
# If there are no more blocks to send:
#* Send the 16-bit execution address to Audio2 and Audio3.
#* Send $00 to Audio1.
#* Send the counter to Audio0.
#* Wait until the counter value is echoed on Audio0.
#* End routine.
# Otherwise:
#* Send the 16-bit destination address to Audio2 and Audio3.
#* Send $01 to Audio1.
#* Send the counter to Audio0.
#* Wait until the counter value is echoed on Audio0.
#* Reset the counter to zero.
# If there are bytes left in the current block:
#* Send the current byte to Audio1.
#* Send the counter to Audio0.
#* Wait until the counter value is echoed on Audio0.
#* Move on to the next byte.
#* Increment the counter.
#* Go to step 5.
# Otherwise:
#* Add $03 to the counter.  If the counter is now zero, add $03 again.
#* Move on to the next block.
#* Go to step 3.

(Note: there's nothing magical about the value $03.  We can add almost any value to the counter -- the important thing is that the counter value the SNES sends needs to be greater than the value the SPC expects it to be, which is how the SPC knows the block has ended.)

This routine sends all the blocks at once.  It would be nice, however, if we had a routine that just copied one block so that we could do other things between transferring blocks.  If we tried to modify the above routine to do this, though, we would either need to know the address of the next block ahead of time or we would need to save the terminating byte of the previous block and send it with the next one.  A simple solution to this problem is to send exactly one block, then give the start of the communications routine ($ffc9) as the address at which to begin execution.  This resets the protocol state, so that we do not need to store any information between sending blocks.

=== The communications routine in assembly ===

This section describes in detail our assembly routine to copy a block of memory from SNES RAM to SPC RAM.

First, we need to consider the parameters to our routine.  We will need to pass the source location, the destination location, and the length of the block to copy.  Since there is 64k of SPC RAM, the destination and length will fit in 16-bit variables, so we can pass those in the X and Y registers.  The source memory location, on the other hand, is 24 bits long, since we will be reading from the expanded RAM block from $7f:0000-$7f:ffff.  Thus, we define a location in the zero page where we can store the three bytes of a pointer to our source data:

 .define musicSourceAddr $00fd

While we are at it, we can define the values of the audio ports and CPU flags, so that our code uses recognizable identifiers instead of hex values:

 .define AUDIO_R0 $2140
 .define AUDIO_R1 $2141
 .define AUDIO_R2 $2142
 .define AUDIO_R3 $2143
 
 .define XY_8BIT $10
 .define A_8BIT  $20

While writing the routine, we frequently will be waiting for the SPC to echo back the value we just sent to the Audio0 register.  Rather than write this code repeatedly, we can put it in a macro, and the assembler will make the necessary substitutions:

 .macro waitForAudio0M
 -
     cmp     AUDIO_R0
     bne     -
 .endm

With these initial definitions out of the way, we can write our routine.  Here is the initialization phase, which waits until the SPC is ready to accept data, then sends the destination address.  Note that we can send the two bytes of the destination address with a single 16-bit write to Audio2.

 CopyBlockToSPC:
     ; musicSourceAddr - source address
     ; x - dest address
     ; y - count
 
     ; Wait until audio0 is 0xbbaa
     sep     #A_8BIT
     lda     #$aa
     waitForAudio0M
 
     ; Send the destination address to AUDIO2.
     stx     AUDIO_R2
 
     ; Transfer count to x.
     phy
     plx
 
     ; Send $01cc to AUDIO0 and wait for echo.
     lda     #$01
     sta     AUDIO_R1
     lda     #$cc
     sta     AUDIO_R0
     waitForAudio0M
 
     ; Zero counter.
     ldy     #$0000

Here is the communication routine's main loop, which sends a byte and waits for the SPC's response, then updates the memory and counter values.  Note that we can swap the high and low bytes of ''a'' with the ''xba'' operation, even though ''a'' is in 8-bit mode at the time.  Again, we use the trick of writing a 16-bit value to send to Audio0 and Audio1 in a single operation.

 CopyBlockToSPC_loop:
     ; Load the high byte of a with the destination byte.
     xba
     lda     [$fd],y
     xba
     
     ; Load the low byte of a with the counter.
     tya
 
     ; Send the counter/byte.
     rep     #A_8BIT
     sta     AUDIO_R0
     sep     #A_8BIT
 
     ; Wait for counter to echo back.
     waitForAudio0M
 
     ; Update counter and number of bytes left to send.
     iny
     dex
     bne     CopyBlockToSPC_loop

Finally, we end the block and tell the SPC to start execution at the beginning of the SPC's communication routine, resetting the protocol:

     ; Send the start of IPL ROM send routine as starting address.
     ldx     #$ffc9
     stx     AUDIO_R2
     
     ; Clear high byte.
     xba
     lda     #0
     xba
 
     ; Add a value greater than one to the counter to terminate.
     clc
     adc     #$2
 
     ; Send the counter/byte.
     rep     #A_8BIT
     sta     AUDIO_R0
     sep     #A_8BIT
 
     ; Wait for counter to echo back.
     waitForAudio0M
 
     rts

== Sending the SPC state ==

The SPC state consists of three parts:

* The memory
* The DSP registers
* The CPU registers

The hardest thing to restore is the CPU state, since it changes just by executing the SPC communications routine.  Also, restoring the program counter means that the SPC then will be executing the stored code, not the communications routine, so we can't send anything else after we have restored the program counter.  Thus, we need to restore the CPU state last, after we have set up everything else.  Whether we restore the memory or DSP registers first doesn't matter too much, but it will turn out to be convenient to restore the memory first.

=== Sending memory state ===

Earlier we noticed that the SPC communications routine could freeze if the SNES doesn't send data fast enough.  This means that any data we send needs to be stored in RAM; it can't be directly copied to the SPC from its original location in ROM.  Thus, we use the following routine to assemble the two 32k banks of ROM containing the SPC memory state into one 64k segment in SNES RAM:

 CopySPCMemoryToRam:
     ; Copy music data from ROM to RAM, from the end backwards.
     rep   #$XY_8BIT        ; xy in 16-bit mode.
     ldx.w #$7fff           ; Set counter to 32k-1.
 -   lda.l spcMemory1,x     ; Copy byte from first music bank.
     sta.l $7f0000,x
     lda.l spcMemory2,x     ; Copy byte from second music bank.
     sta.l $7f8000,x
     dex
     bpl -
     rts

Now, we can use the macro we wrote earlier to transfer the SPC memory state:

     ; Copy RAM between 0x0002 and 0xffc0.
     sendMusicBlockM $7f $0002 $0002 $ffbe

We do not transfer the first two and last sixty-four bytes of memory because they are used by the communications routine:  the last sixty-four bytes contain the routine itself and the first two bytes are used during the routine to store the destination address.

Most SPCs will not overwrite the communications routine, so we will simply not restore that section of memory.  It is quite possible, on the other hand, that an SPC will use the first two bytes of RAM, since they are in the zero page and easy to access.  Therefore, we will set those bytes when we restore the CPU state, taking care not to overwrite them in the SNES RAM until then.

Note that because we are overwriting the block $f0-$ff, we actually write to a number of memory-mapped registers.  This has the effect of restoring the timer state, as well as one DSP register.  It also manipulates the Audio0-3 ports, but this doesn't seem to interfere with the memory transfer process, probably because the SNES is only listening for a certain value on Audio0.

=== Sending DSP state ===

To set the value of a DSP register, you first need to write its number to address $f2 of the SPC's memory, then you need to write its value to address $f3 of the SPC's memory.  Because these addresses are right next to each other, we can restore a DSP register value by using our memory-copying routine to send a block of two bytes to $f2.  We repeat this process for each of the 128 DSP registers:

 InitDSP:
     rep     #XY_8BIT            ; x and y in 16-bit mode
     ldx     #$0000              ; Reset DSP address counter.
 -
     sep     #A_8BIT
     txa                         ; Write DSP address register byte.
     sta     $7f0100             
     lda.l   dspData,x           ; Write DSP data register byte.
     sta     $7f0101             
     phx                         ; Save x on the stack.
 
     ; Send the address and data bytes to the DSP memory-mapped registers.
     sendMusicBlockM $7f $0100 $00f2 $0002
 
     rep     #XY_8BIT            ; Restore x.
     plx
 
     ; Loop if we haven't done 128 registers yet.
     inx
     cpx     #$0080
     bne     -
     rts

=== Sending SPC initialization routine ===

Our SPC initialization routine restores the parts of the SPC state that would be altered just by running the SPC's communications routine.  We will pass the SPC's control to the initialization routine after we are done copying everything, and the routine, as its final step, will jump to the saved program counter location.  Here are the things our initialization routine needs to do:

* Restore the first two bytes of RAM.
* Restore the stack pointer (S).
* Push the restored PSW register onto the stack.
* Restore the A register.
* Restore the X register.
* Restore the Y register.
* Pop the PSW register value into its register.
* Jump to the saved program counter location.

We'll write the routine starting at (arbitrary) memory location $7f0000.  Since we'll be needing the first two bytes at that location (that we have been careful thus far not to overwrite), we will first save these on the stack.  Since we'll restore the first byte first, we push it last:

 MakeSPCInitCode:
     sep     #A_8BIT
 
     ; Push [01] value to stack.
     lda.l   $7f0001
     pha
 
     ; Push [00] value to stack.
     lda.l   $7f0000
     pha

Next, we write the code to restore the first byte.  Looking up the ''mov dp,#imm'' opcode in an SPC reference, we see that the opcode byte is $8f, so we write that, followed immediately by the first argument byte (imm -- the value to restore), then the second argument byte (dp -- the address to which to write the byte):

     ; Write code to set [00] byte.
     lda     #$8f        ; mov dp,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0000
     pla
     sta.l   $7f0001
     lda     #$00
     sta.l   $7f0002

We do the same thing for the second memory byte:

     ; Write code to set [01] byte.
     lda     #$8f        ; mov dp,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0003
     pla
     sta.l   $7f0004
     lda     #$01
     sta.l   $7f0005

As there is no opcode to write a value to S directly, we first move the stack value into X -- ''mov x, #imm'' ($cd) -- then we move X into the stack register -- ''mov sp, x'' ($bd).

     ; Write code to set s.
     lda     #$cd        ; mov x,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0006
     lda.l   audioSP
     sta.l   $7f0007
     lda     #$bd        ; mov sp,x
     sta.l   $7f0008

Now we write code to push the program status ward (PSW) register value onto the stack, so that we can pop it later.  We need to push the value before we restore the other registers because we overwrite X in the process of pushing the value.  We can't pop the value until after the other registers are restored, since the ''mov'' instruction that we use to restore them changes the PSW register.

     ; Write code to push psw
     lda     #$cd        ; mov x,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0009
     lda.l   audioPSW
     sta.l   $7f000a
     lda     #$4d        ; push x
     sta.l   $7f000b

Here we write the code to restore the registers:

     ; Write code to set a.
     lda     #$e8        ; mov a,#imm
     sta.l   $7f000c
     lda.l   audioA
     sta.l   $7f000d
 
     ; Write code to set x.
     lda     #$cd        ; mov x,#imm
     sta.l   $7f000e
     lda.l   audioX
     sta.l   $7f000f
 
     ; Write code to set y.
     lda     #$8d        ; mov y,#imm
     sta.l   $7f0010
     lda.l   audioY
     sta.l   $7f0011

Writing the code to restore PSW from the stack is fairly straightforward:
     ; Write code to pull psw.
     lda     #$8e        ; pop psw
     sta.l   $7f0012

Finally, we write the code to send control to the saved program counter position:

     ; Write code to jump.
     lda     #$5f        ; jmp labs
     sta.l   $7f0013
     rep     #A_8BIT
     lda.l   audioPC
     sep     #A_8BIT
     sta.l   $7f0014
     xba
     sta.l   $7f0015
     rts

After this routine is called, then, the region $7f0000-$7f0015 contains the initialization routine, so sending it using our communications routine is fairly straightforward.  We must, however, have somewhere in the SPC RAM to put it.  Here, we gamble that the region of memory just before the IPL ROM code is not in use:

 ; The address in SPC RAM where we put our 15-byte startup routine.
 .define spcFreeAddr $ffa0

Calling the routine:

     ; Build code to initialize registers.
     jsr     MakeSPCInitCode
 
     ; Copy init code to some region of SPC memory that we hope isn't in use.
     sendMusicBlockM $7f $0000 spcFreeAddr $0016

= Starting SPC execution =

Now that we have restored the memory and DSP state, and we have written an initialization routine to complete restoration, all we need to do is to tell the SPC to begin execution at our initialization routine.  We do this by modifying our communications routine to send no blocks, but rather immediately start execution at the given address:

 StartSPCExec:
     ; Starting address is in x.
 
     ; Wait until audio0 is 0xbbaa
     sep     #A_8BIT
     lda     #$aa
     waitForAudio0M
 
     ; Send the destination address to AUDIO2.
     stx     AUDIO_R2
 
     ; Send $00cc to AUDIO0 and wait for echo.
     lda     #$00
     sta     AUDIO_R1
     lda     #$cc
     sta     AUDIO_R0
     waitForAudio0M
 
     rts

At this point, the SPC should start playing the music originally stored in the SPC file.

= Analysis =

This technique is really only good for playing one song on a ROM; after you start playing an SPC file, it is hard to stop it, upload another song, or play a sound effect.  This is because the code in the SPC only understands the communications protocol of the game from which it is captured.  To discover the protocol, you would have to reverse-engineer the code of either the SPC state or the original SNES ROM, and even then there is no guarantee that the protocol would support whatever you wanted to do.  Writing a custom protocol for the audio in a game would be a good subject for a future tutorial.

== Problems ==

There are a number of reasons why the SPC state, restored in the manner described here, would refuse to play:

* The original SPC program used either the IPL ROM area or the area where we stored our initialization code.  If it used the initialization area, we can write the code to another location, and this should allow the SPC to play.  Restoring the IPL ROM region is harder because you need a communications routine somewhere else in SPC memory to allow you to do this.  In either case, we can't get away from the fact that some space in RAM is needed for initialization and will not match the original RAM.

* The state of the SPC when control is passed to the original code does not exactly match the state when it was captured, since the DSP and timers begin updating their values immediately upon restoration.  If the SPC was waiting for some state change, like a timer or DSP value, then it may miss it and lock up.

* It is possible for the SNES to play music entirely by sending values to the SPC in real-time.  For instance, it could modify the DSP registers as we did when we were restoring them, except it would modify them over time so as to produce music, much as other SPC code would.  In this way, the SPC could produce music with the IPL ROM communications routine as the only code in its memory.  Such SPC files would not even play in a player, since they rely on the SNES for information.

The masters of the Renaissance regarded their era as a golden age, and looked back on the previous age as &quot;dark&quot; by comparison.  Thus it is considered to be the &quot;middle&quot; transitional period between late antiquity and the modern world. It had feudal and manorial systems as socio-economic forms. Feudalism generally describes the relation held between a lord and his vassal. Manorialism placed significant emphasis upon self-sufficiency of manors, the underlying structure of economic establishment.

In addition to new socio-economic forms and models, new agricultural methods also came into existence, including the moldboard plow, which allowed a greater arriation of crops, and the three-field system, a manner in which one-third of available farmland was left fallow (unplated) to reduce the risk of soil erosion or over-usage.

==Early Middle Ages==

===Rise of the Germanic Kingdoms===

Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes became the dominate force in Europe. The greatest of these was the Frankish Empire. The earliest Frankish king was King Clovis (481 - 511). Clovis was known for the Salic Law, which listed out crimes and their various punishments.

The Frankish Empire relied on dukes to defend the borders of the empire and the Mayor of the Palace to run much of the daily business of the Empire. By 640, the Mayor of the Palace was the de facto ruler of the empire. In 751, Mayor of the Palace Pipin was appointed king of the Franks by the Pope.

===Age of Charlemagne===

Pepin's son, Charlemagne, was the greatest of the Frankish kings. He expanded the Frankish empire to northern Italy and Spain as well as to parts of Germany. In 800, the Pope appointed Charlemagne Holy Roman Emperor in return for some help putting down a riot in Rome. Charlemagne also took an interest in art and education, opening a palace school at Aix-la-Chapelle.

Another important advancement made by Charlemagne was in the area of justice. At the time, conpurgation was the common practice. In conpurgation, a group of witnesses would gather to swear a defendant's innocence. If that wasn't sufficient, trial by fire, water, or combat was employed. Charlemagne set up a board of judges to listen to testimony and decide the verdict.

Charlemagne's empire didn't last long after he died. His son, Louis the Pious, lost land to Muslims in the south, Vikings in the north, and Slavs to the east. When Louis died in 840, his three sons battled for the throne. The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the empire between them. Lothar received the Rhine river valley and the Frankish holdings in the Alps and Italy. The other brothers received the land to the east and west. By 870, the holdings were simply East and West Frankland.

===Viking Raiders===

The Vikings (also known as Norse or Northmen) were Germanic Scandinavian seafarers who raided and settled many regions of Northern Europe during the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries.  Norse settlers founded communities and maintained important trade routes all the way from Greenland east to the heart of Russia, and developed a fearsome reputation as warriors and plunderers.  Their descendants played crucial roles in the later history of France, England, Ireland and the Russian principalities, and they were the first Europeans to visit and settle in North America.

Denmark and Scandinavia had lain well outside the borders of the Roman Empire.  By the end of the eighth century, the region contained many small tribal kingdoms.  Farming and fishing comprised most of the economy. Growing populations and limited fertile land were probably the cause of a Norse movement to find new homes across the sea.  The first major Viking raid was recorded in 793 when raiders sacked the wealthy monastery at Lindisfarne on the Yorkshire coast.  As the 9th century wore on, Francia and Anglo-Saxon England came under yearly attack by Vikings whose swift ships appeared without warning off the coast, landing warriors whose skill and ruthlessness prompted the prayer, &quot;from the fury of the Northmen, protect us, o lord.&quot;  

By the 860s Danish Vikings had implanted themselves to stay in northeast England.  After a series of wars against the Anglo-Saxon kings, the two sides agreed to a truce where the country was divided and the &quot;Danelaw&quot; area of Viking control recognized, if not formally ceded.  The 10th century saw similar developments in Francia; there the Norse settlement -- ''Normandie'' -- was on the Channel coast between Le Havre and the Cotentin Peninsula.  

==Feudalism in Europe==

Each lord had, more or less, complete control over his lands. However, weaker lords would become vassals of the stronger lords. A lord would protect his vassal. In return vassals were expected to supply soldiers in time of war and serve his lord in times of peace.

===Medieval Society===

When people think of the Middle Ages, the knight is one of the first things that come to mind. Most noblemen became knights. The path to knighthood began by serving a knight as a page. Pages had to learn to battle, ride a horse, be polite to ladies, sing, dance, and play chess. Once he learned to do this, he became knighted by another knight and blessed by a priest. Knights did not do common work. When they weren't fighting, they often hunted.

Medieval ladies were expected to run their house and tend to the ill. In their leisure time, they enjoyed falconry, chess, checkers, and dice. They were also very interested in fashion.

Besides what has been mentioned above, entertainment mostly consisted of banquets. The feasts were elaborate and lasted hours at a time. After everyone had eaten, jesters or minstrels would entertain the guests.

=== The Manor System ===
The manor or estate system refers to life on a manor, it could be said that it was the logical evolution of the continuing fractioning of land rights and government, something that was already common, even if under a somewhat distinct system, for instance the [[w:Roman villa|Roman villa]].

Each manor had a lord who ruled over it, by hereditary rights, concession or payment. The people who worked on the manor were serfs. Serfs were responsible for tending the lord's fields as well as doing maintenance on the manor's buildings, they were bound to the land, forced to work there for their entire lives. Unlike slaves, serfs could not be bought or sold individually, they had freedom of movement but due to having no land of their own (and at time no right to acquire it) or any other means of surviving independently, they were forced into servitude. 

The manor system quickly became common during the Middle Ages, but the system adapted to changes in legal rule and society, thought the European expansion to the Colonial age, the United States of America plantations and to the large landowner in Brazil, the system has survived in some form or other until today.

==The Church in Medieval Life==

===Monasteries and Convents===

Monasticism became quite popular in the Middle Ages, with religion being the most important force in Europe. Monks and nuns were to live isolated from the world to become closer to God. Monks provided service to the church by copying manuscripts, creating art, educating people, and working as missionaries. Convents were especially appealing to women. It was the only place they would receive any sort of education or power. It also let them escape an unwanted marriage.

During the rule of Pope Innocent III (1198 - 1216), the two most famous monastic orders were founded. They were called the medicant, or begging, orders because they begged for the food and clothes. They would usually travel in pairs; preaching, healing the sick, and helping the poor. Francis of Assisi founded the Franciscans, who were known for their charitable work. The Dominicans, founded by St. Dominic, focused on teaching, preaching, and suppressing heresy.

===Papal Supremacy===

The Pope, through the church, was as powerful as any nation and more powerful than most. The church taught that the only way to get to Heaven was through the sacraments that the Catholic church provided. The sacraments had to be paid for, which accounted for part of the church's vast wealth. Other reasons were that everyone paid the church ten percent of their income and no one taxed church property.

One dramatic example of the Pope's power was the Investiture Controversy. In 1076, Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV attempted to take the power to give a bishop the symbols of his office. Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Henry. Henry begged for forgiveness for three days and was forced to accept Gregory's terms.

The ultimate display of power by the medieval papacy was the crusades. From 1096 to 1272, no less than twelve crusades took place. Any man who participated was promised forgiveness for any sins committed before or during the crusade. As a mission to put Jerusalem under Christian control, the crusades were a failure. Jerusalem was in Christian control for less than 50 years. However, the crusades put the people of Europe in contact with the Muslim world. They were exposed to new ideas and developed a taste for new products. In this capacity, something good came from the crusades.

This is a tasty dish that the whole family will love. It might go well served with rice, especially if the rice is loose and firm.

You'll need about 1/2 the placenta of a 6.2 pound baby, or 1/3 the placenta of a 9.3 pound baby. Chopped and packed, this is just a bit more than 1/3 cup. (but like any raw meat, you don't exactly chop it &amp;mdash; try sniping away at it with a kitchen scissors)

==Ingredients==
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] chopped fresh human [[Cookbook:Placenta|placenta]]
*2/3 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] whites
*1/8 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]

==Procedure==
#Wash the placenta well, in a [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]], then shake it to drain. (it will still leak juices)
#Stir the egg whites with a fork until they are without lumps.
#Mix all ingredients well, squishing them by hand.
#Add a decent amount of oil to a suitable frying pan.
#Set a burner to high heat, and put the pan on it.
#Start frying, stirring as if stir-frying or scrambling an egg.
#The small amount of liquid (seeping from the placenta, plus the egg whites) will come to a boil. You might turn down the heat slightly at this point.
#Let the liquid boil away and/or solidify onto the broccoli and placenta.
#When it looks yummy, serve it.

==Warning==
As with any meat from uncontrolled sources (such as hunting or scavenging) people should be cautious of risks involved. Certain blood borne diseases can live in blood and tissue outside the body for some time. Be sure that sensible precautions have been taken.

      <text xml:space="preserve">how do the notes in harmonics on frets 5,7, and 12 get lower sounds, yet theyare going up the neck, which usually has a higher sound?
:When you pluck a guitar string it oscillates, but not as a pure, single-frequency sine wave (as the picture might lead you to believe).  Rather, we get the fundamental, plus all its harmonics (i.e., double frequency, triple frequency, quadruple frequency, etc).  I hope this doesn't cause confusion, but in physics, the word harmonic is used to indicate the relationship between frequencies.  So when I say &quot;harmonic&quot; here, I'm not talking about the technique described on this page, but rather, I'm talking about frequencies.  

:Back to plucking an open string.  Suppose we pluck the A string.  If the guitar is tuned so that A is 440 Hz, plucking the A string will generate 440Hz, 880Hz, 1320Hz, 1760 Hz, etc.  Each of these are the harmonics of 440 Hz (i.e., 1x440, 2x440, 3x440, 4x440, etc).  Each frequency will be at a different loudness though (generally each harmonic is a bit quieter than the one that came before).  This combination of frequencies is what gives any instrument its tone.

:Now suppose you touch the string over the 12th fret and pluck it.  None of the odd-numbered harmonics can be made.  It knocks out the 440 and 1320Hz components, because the &quot;touched&quot; portion of the string has to move for these sounds to be created, only it can't because your finger was in the way and dampened it out.  However, the even harmonics can still be made, because the center of the string doesn't need to move to make those frequencies.  Said differently, you will cancel out all the harmonics that are not a multiple of two.  It might help to look at the picture again:
[[File:Guitar Open String and 12th Fret Harmonic Oscillation.png|thumb|400px|right]]
:See how the middle of the string isn't moving in the lower picture?  When you move to a different fret, you will cancel a different set of harmonics.  If you touch the string one third of the way from the nut to the bridge, it's exactly the same as if you touch the string one third of the way from the bridge to the nut.  In either case you will cancel out the fundamental plus all the harmonics that are not divisible by three.  Touch it a quarter of the way to the nut or the tail, and you cancel out all the harmonics that are not multiples of 4.  Since there are fewer harmonics that are divisible by 4 than there are that are divisible by two, touching the string there will be quieter (you've dampened out more of the harmonics).  

:If you touch the string at a distance one fifth from the nut (or two fifths, or three fifths, or four fifths), you cancel everything that is not a multiple of five.

:Sorry for the bad explanation.  Maybe someone else can explain it better. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:33, 25 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

&quot;Ala ma - this sounds least natural. There is a tendency in Polish to drop the subject rather than the object and rarely you know the object but not the subject. If the question was &quot;Kto ma kota ?&quot; (who has a cat ?), the answer should be &quot;Ala&quot; alone, without a verb.&quot;

I do not agree with this opinion. For question &quot;kto ma kota?&quot; (who has a cat) you can answer &quot;Ala&quot; as well as &quot;Ala ma&quot;. Both answers are correct. How do I know that? I am Polish.

'''Introduction:'''
'''Prasadam'''
Krishna consciousness is sometimes called the 'kitchen religion'. Since the movement's founder, Srila Prabhupada, first cooked for his young disciples in New York, the movement has gone on to become famous for its delicious, pure vegetarian food.

In Vaisnavism, food is more than just food; it is prasadam, the Lord's mercy. In keeping with the philosophy of offering everything to God, Krishna, devotees offer everything they eat before they eat it. In this way the food is considered sanctified.

'''What kind of food?'''
Vaisnavas follow a strict vegetarian diet; no meat, fish or eggs. Onions, garlic, and mushrooms are also avoided due to their adverse effects on the consciousness of the eater.


'''How do we offer our food?'''
The most important ingredient in any offering is the devotion of the cook and of the person doing the offering (this may of course be the same person). It is also important that the persons offering the food are in good consciousness. This is helped by such considerations as making sure the kitchen is clean, the ingredients are pure, and that the cook is wearing clean clothes. It also helps to have peaceful music or chanting going on during the preparation of the meal. As the idea is that we are cooking for Krishna it is very important that no-one else tastes the preparation before it is offered.

A simple offering can be made by placing the food on a plate (preferably one that is only used for this purpose) in front of a picture of Krishna and chanting the Hare Krishna Mantra a few times while asking Krishna to please accept this humble offering.

A slightly more elaborate offering can be made by chanting each of the following prayers three times while ringing a small bell.
Prayer to Srila Prabhupada, (or your own guru)

nama om visnu-padaya krsna-presthaya bhu-tale
srimate bhaktivedanta-svamin iti namine
namas te sarasvate deve gaura-vani-pracarine
nirvisesa-sunyavadi-pascatya-desa-tarine
Prayer to Lord Caitanya

namo maha-vadanyaya
krishna-prema-pradaya te
krishnaya krishna-chaitanya-
namne gaura-tvishe namaha
Prayer to Lord Krishna

namo brahmanya-devaya
go-brahmana-hitaya ca
jagad-dhitaya krsnaya
govindaya namo namah
Chant Maha Mantra

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare

But remember, the most important part of a successful offering is the devotion!

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is known as mahā-vadānyāvatāra, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. 
CC Adi 7.4, Purport: As preachers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we first offer our obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting this Pañca-tattva mantra; then we say Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. There are ten offenses in the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, but these are not considered in the chanting of the Pañca-tattva mantra, namely, śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is known as mahā-vadānyāvatāra, the most magnanimous incarnation, for He does not consider the offenses of the fallen souls. Thus to derive the full benefit of the chanting of the mahā-mantra (Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare), we must first take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, learn the Pañca-tattva mahā-mantra, and then chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. That will be very effective.</text>

== Set Questions / Examples ==

In all the high school physics \ mathematics we should add examples questions and such like.. 
when i have time i will try and add some.

== Making This Article More Like A Text Book  ==
yes, the standard abbreviation for hour is ''h'', it should be edited.

and by the way, this article in form and template is much similar to the articles of wikipedia. indeed the opening paragraph of this article is a verbatim copy of wikipedia article on kinematics. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics see for yourself.] We need lots of drawing and diagrams and much talk and talk and talk to make it more like an elementary physics text.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]]

'''Zuppa Toscana''' is a soup available at The Olive Garden restaurant.

==Ingredients==
*1 lb. Spicy Italian Sausage - Crumbled
*1/2 lb. Smoked Bacon - Chopped (One can also use precooked bacon bits for this)
*1 qt. Water
*(2) 14.5 Oz. Cans Chicken Broth
*(2) lg. Russet [[Cookbook:Potato|Potato]]es - Cubed
*2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] Cloves - Crushed
*1 med. Onion - Chopped
*2 cups Chopped Kale or Swiss Chard
*1 cup Heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|Cream]]
*Salt and pepper to taste

==Procedure==
#In a [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] over medium-high heat, brown sausage, breaking into small pieces as you fry it. Drain and set aside.
#In skillet over medium-high heat, brown bacon. Drain and set aside.
#Place water, broth, potatoes, garlic, and onion into a pot. Simmer over high heat until potatoes are tender.
#Add sausage and bacon to the pot. Simmer for 10 minutes.
#Add kale/chard and cream to the pot. Seasons with salt and pepper; heat through.

''Bon appétit!''

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Potatoes can be substituted with cauliflower for a low carbohydrate version of this soup.  I also used 1/2 mild 1/2 spicy turkey sausage instead of pork sausage. Sometimes, fennel is used.

=Measuring Instruments=
==Ammeters==
Ammeters are devices that measure current. Current in electronics is usually measured in mA which are called milliamperes, which are 1/1000s of an ampere.&lt;br/&gt;..... Basically an ammeter consists of a coil that can rotate inside a magnet, but a spring is trying to push the coil back to zero. The larger the current that flows through the coil, the larger the angle of rotation, the torque (= a rotary force) created by the current being counteracted by the return torque of the spring.&lt;br/&gt;..... Usually ammeters are connected in parallel with various switched resistors that can extend the range of currents that can be measured. Assume, for example, that the basic ammeter is &quot;1000 ohms per volt&quot;, which means that to get the full-scale deflection of the pointer a current of 1 mA is needed (1 volt divided by 1000 ohms is 1 mA - see &quot;Ohm's Law&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;..... To use that ammeter to read 10 mA full-scale it is ''shunted'' with another resistance, so that when 10 mA flows, 9 mA will flow through the shunt, and only 1 mA will flow through the meter. Similarly, to extend the range of the ammeter to 100 mA the shunt will carry 99 mA, and the meter only 1 mA.

==Ohmmeters==
Ohmmeters are basically ammeters that are ''connected to an internal battery, with a suitable resistance in series''. Assume that the basic ammeter is &quot;1000 ohms per volt&quot;, meaning that 1 mA is needed for full-scale deflection. When the external resistance that is connected to its terminals is zero (the leads are connected together at first for calibration), then the internal, variable, resistor in series with the ammeter is adjusted so that 1 mA will flow; that will depend on the voltage of the battery, and as the battery runs down that setting will change. The full scale point is marked as zero resistance. If an external resistance is then connected to the terminals that causes only half of the current to flow (0.5 mA in this example), then the external resistance will equal the internal resistance, and the scale is marked accordingly. When no current flows, the scale will read infinity resistance. The scale of an ohmmeter is NOT linear.Ohmmeters are usually useful in checking the short circuit and open circuit in boards.

==Multimeters==
[[Image:Multimeter.jpg|thumb|A digital multimeter]] 
Multimeters contain Ohmeters, Voltmeters, Ammeters and a variety of capabilities to measure other quantities.  AC and DC voltages are most often measurable.  Frequency of AC voltages.  Multimeters also feature a continuity detector, basically an Ohmmeter with a beeper if the multimeter sees less than 100&amp;nbsp;Ω then it beeps otherwise it is silent.  This is very useful for finding whether components are connected when debugging or testing circuits.  Multimeters are also often able to measure capacitance and inductance.  This may be achieved using a Wien bridge.  A diode tester is also generally onboard, this allows one to determine the anode and cathode of an unknown diode.  A LCD display is also provided for easily reading of results.

=Electronics Laboratory Instruments=

==Oscilloscope==
The instrument is used to view AC waveforms.  For better explanation of the oscilloscope.

==Spectrum Analyzer==

:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_analyzer Wikipedia:Spectrum_Analyzer]

==Signal Generator==
This instrument is used to generate low voltage AC signals.  Most common signal generators can create sinusoidal(sine), triangular and square waves of various frequencies.  They are used in conjunction with the oscilloscope to test analogue circuits.
:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_generator Wikipedia:Signal_Generator]

==Logic Probe==
This instrument generates high and low logic states to test digital circuits. If a logic probe is not available a square wave through a signal generator can be used.  Square waves can also be used to test the response time of a digital circuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Free monoid spanned by a set==
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space and &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_n&lt;/math&gt; be a basis of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Given any vector space &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and any elements &lt;math&gt;w_1,\ldots,w_n \in W&lt;/math&gt;, there is a linear transformation &lt;math&gt;\varphi : V \rightarrow W&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}, \, \varphi(v_i) = w_i&lt;/math&gt;. One could say that this happens because the elements &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_n&lt;/math&gt; of a basis are not &quot;related&quot; to each other (formally, they are linearly independent). Indeed, if, for example, we had the relation &lt;math&gt;v_1 = \lambda v_2&lt;/math&gt; for some scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (and then &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_n&lt;/math&gt; wasn't linearly independent), then the linear transformation &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; could not exist.

Let us consider a similar problem with groups: given a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; spanned by a set &lt;math&gt;X = \{x_i : i \in I\} \subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; and given any group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and any set &lt;math&gt;Y = \{y_i : i \in I\} \subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;, does there always exist a group morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi : G \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall i \in I, \, \varphi(x_i) = y_i&lt;/math&gt;? The answer is no. For example, consider the group &lt;math&gt;G = \mathbb{Z}_n = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which is spanned by the set &lt;math&gt;X = \{1\}&lt;/math&gt;, the group &lt;math&gt;H = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (with the adition operation) and the set &lt;math&gt;Y = \{2\}&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists a group morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi : \mathbb{Z}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1) = 2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;n2 = n \varphi(1) = \varphi(n \, 1) = \varphi(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is impossible. But if instead we had choose &lt;math&gt;G = \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, then such a group morphism does exist and it would be given by &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t) = 2t&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, given any group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;y \in H&lt;/math&gt;, we have the group morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\varphi(t) = y^t&lt;/math&gt; (in multiplicative notation) that verifies &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1) = y&lt;/math&gt;. In a way, we can think that this happens because the elements of the set &lt;math&gt;X = \{1\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (that spans &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) don't verify relations like &lt;math&gt;nx = 1&lt;/math&gt; (like &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;) or &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt;. So, it seems that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a group more &quot;free&quot; that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Our goal in this section will be, given a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, build a group spanned by the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that it will be the most &quot;free&quot; possible, in the sense that it doesn't have to obey relations like &lt;math&gt;x^n = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt;. To do so, we begin by constructing a &quot;free&quot; monoid (in the same sense). Informally, this monoid will be the monoid of the words written with the letters of the alphabet &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, where the identity will be the word with no letters (the &quot;empty word&quot;), and the binary operation of the monoid will be concatenation of words. The notation &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt; that we will use for the element of this monoid meets this idea that the elements of this monoid are the words &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are letters of the alphabet &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Here is the definition of this monoid.

'''Definition'''  ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set.''
# ''We denote the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-tuples &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_i \in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt;.''
# ''We denote &lt;math&gt;()&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.''
# ''We denote by &lt;math&gt;FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\{x_1 \ldots x_n : n \in \mathbb{N}, x_i \in X\}&lt;/math&gt;.''
# ''We define in &lt;math&gt;FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; the concatenation operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x_1\ldots x_m * y_1\ldots y_n = x_1\ldots x_m y_1\ldots y_n&lt;/math&gt;.''

Next we prove that this monoid is indeed a monoid. It's an easy to prove result, we need to show associativity of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;1*x=x*1=x&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proposition''' ''&lt;math&gt;(FM(X),*)&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid with identity &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Proof''' The operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is associative because, given any &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_m,y_1 \ldots y_n,z_1 \ldots z_p \in FM(X)&lt;/math&gt;, we have

: &lt;math&gt;(x_1 \ldots x_m * y_1 \ldots y_n) * z_1 \ldots z_m&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= x_1 \ldots x_m y_1 \ldots y_n * z_1 \ldots z_m&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= x_1 \ldots x_m y_1 \ldots y_n z_1 \ldots z_m&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= x_1 \ldots x_m * (y_1 \ldots y_n z_1 \ldots z_m)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= x_1 \ldots x_m ( y_1 \ldots y_n * z_1 \ldots z_m)&lt;/math&gt;.

It's obvious that &lt;math&gt;(FM(X),*)&lt;/math&gt; has the identity &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;1 * x_1 \ldots x_n = x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt; by the definition of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Following the idea that the monoid &lt;math&gt;(FM(X),*)&lt;/math&gt; is the most &quot;free&quot; monoid spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we will call it the free monoid spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. We denote the free monoid spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(FM(X),*)&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Examples'''
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;FM(X) = \{1,x,xx,xxx,\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; and, for example, &lt;math&gt;xx * xxx = xxxxx&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x,y,z\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;1,x,y,z,xxx,yxz,xyzzz \in FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; and, for example, &lt;math&gt;xxx * yxz = xxxyxz&lt;/math&gt;.

==Free group spanned by a set==

Now let us construct the more &quot;free&quot; group spanned by a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, what we will do is insert in the monoid &lt;math&gt;FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; the inverse elements that are missing in it for it to be a group. In a more precise way, we will have a set &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt; equipotent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, choose a bijection from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt; and in this way achieve a &quot;association&quot; between the elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the elements of &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt;. Then we face &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n \in FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n \in X&lt;/math&gt;) as having the inverse element &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_1},\ldots,\overline{x_n} \in X&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n \in X&lt;/math&gt; is is associated with &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_1} \ldots \overline{x_n}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Let us note that the order of the elements in &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;reversed&quot; because the inverse of the product &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n = x_1 * \cdots * x_n&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;x_n^{-1} * \cdots * x_1^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;x_1^{-1},\ldots,x_n^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_1},\ldots,\overline{x_n}&lt;/math&gt;. The way we do that &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; be the inverse of &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n&lt;/math&gt; is to take a congruence relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; that identifies &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n \overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and pass to the quotient &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \bar X)&lt;/math&gt; by this relation (defining then, in a natural way, the binary operation of the group, &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [v]_R = [u * v]_R&lt;/math&gt;). By taking the quotient, we are formalizing the intuitive idea of identifying &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n \overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, because in the quotient we have the equality &lt;math&gt;[x_1 \ldots x_n \overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}]_R = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt;. Let us give the formal definition.


'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. Let us take another set &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; equipotent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and disjoint from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow \overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a bijective application.''
# ''For each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; let us denote &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt;, for each &lt;math&gt;x \in \overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; let us denote &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and for each &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n \in FM(X \cup \overline{X})&lt;/math&gt; let us denote &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_n} \ldots \overline{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\overline{x_1 \ldots x_n}&lt;/math&gt;.''
# ''Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be the congruence relation of &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \overline{X})&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;G = \{(u * \bar u,1) : u \in X \cup \overline{X}\}&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection of all the congruence relations in &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \overline{X})&lt;/math&gt; wich have &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as a subset. We denote the quotient set &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \overline{X})/R&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt;.''


Frequently, abusing the notation, we represent an element &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; simply by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.

Because the operation &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [v]_R = [u * v]_R&lt;/math&gt; that we want to define in &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \bar X)/R&lt;/math&gt; is defined using particular represententes &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of the equivalence classes &lt;math&gt;[u]_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[v]_R&lt;/math&gt;, a first precaution is to verify that the definition does not depend on the chosen representatives. It's an easy verification.


'''Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. It is well defined in &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; the binary operation &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [v]_R = [u_r * v_r]_R&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the congruence relation of the previous definition).''

'''Proof''' Let &lt;math&gt;u,u',v,v' \in FM(X)&lt;/math&gt; be any elements such that &lt;math&gt;[u]_R = [u']_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[v]_R = [v']_R&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;uRu'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;vRv'&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a congruence relation in &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \bar X)&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;u*vRu'*v'&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;[u*v]_R = [u'*v']_R&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;


Because the definition is valid, we present it.


'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. We define in &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; the binary operation &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [v]_R = [u_r * v_r]_R&lt;/math&gt;.''


Finally, we verify that the group that we constructed is indeed a group.


'''Proposition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt; is a group with identity &lt;math&gt;[1]_R&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;\forall [u]_R \in FG(X), \, {[u]_R}^{-1} = [\bar u]_R&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Proof'''
# &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt; is associative because &lt;math&gt;\forall [u]_R,[v]_R,[w]_R \in FG(X), \, ([u]_R \star [v]_R) \star [w]_R = ([u * v]_R) \star [w]_R = [([u]_R * [v]_R) * w]_R =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;[u * (v * w)]_R = [u]_R \star [v * w]_R = [u]_R \star ([v]_R \star [w]_R).&lt;/math&gt;
# Let us see that &lt;math&gt;[1]_R&lt;/math&gt; is the identity &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; be any element. We have &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [1]_R = [u * 1]_R = [u]_R&lt;/math&gt; and, in the same way, &lt;math&gt;[1]_R \star [u]_R = [u]_R&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; be any element and let us see that &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [\bar u]_R = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [\bar u]_R = [u * \bar u]_R&lt;/math&gt; and, by definition of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u * \bar u R 1&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;[u * \bar u]_R = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \star [\bar u]_R  = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt; and, in the same way, &lt;math&gt;[\bar u]_R \star [u]_R = [1]_R&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;


In the same way that we did with the free monoid, we will call free group spanned by the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the more &quot;free&quot; group spanned by this set.


'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. We call free group spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt;.''


'''Example''' Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Let us choose any set &lt;math&gt;\bar X = \{y\}&lt;/math&gt; disjoint (and equipotent) of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow \bar X&lt;/math&gt; be any (in fact, the only) bijective application of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt;. Then we denote &lt;math&gt;f(x) = y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and we denote &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\bar y&lt;/math&gt;. We regard &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as inverse elements. Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be the congruence relation of &lt;math&gt;FM(X \cup \bar X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;G = \{(1,1),(x \bar x,1),(xx \bar x \bar x,1),\ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;FG(X) = FM(\{x,\bar x\})/R&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &quot;words&quot; written in the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\{[x]_R,[\bar x]_R\}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;[1]_R,[x]_R,[\bar x]_R, [xx\bar x xx]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

We have &lt;math&gt;G \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; and, for example, &lt;math&gt;(xx \bar x,1) \in R&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;(x\bar x,1) \in G \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; (therefore &lt;math&gt;x \bar x R 1&lt;/math&gt;) and because &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a congruence relation, we can &quot;multiply&quot; both &quot;members&quot; of the relation &lt;math&gt;x \bar x R 1&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and obtain &lt;math&gt;xx \bar x R x&lt;/math&gt;. We see &lt;math&gt;x \bar x R 1&lt;/math&gt; as meaning that in &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; We have &lt;math&gt;xx \bar x = x&lt;/math&gt; (more precisely, &lt;math&gt;[xx \bar x]_R = [x]_R&lt;/math&gt;), and we think in this equality as being the result of one &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &quot;cut out&quot; with &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;xx \bar x&lt;/math&gt;.

Given &lt;math&gt;u \in FM(X \cup \bar X)&lt;/math&gt;, let us denote the exact number of times that the &quot;letter&quot; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; appears in &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;|u|_x&lt;/math&gt; and let us denote the exact number of times the &quot;letter&quot; &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; appears in &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;|u|_\bar x&lt;/math&gt;. Then &quot;cutting&quot; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'s with &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt;'s it remains a reduced word word with &lt;math&gt;|u|_x - |u|_\bar x&lt;/math&gt; times the letter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;|u|_x - |u|_\bar x &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, let us us consider that there aren't any letters &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and remains &lt;math&gt;-(|u|_x - |u|_\bar x)&lt;/math&gt; times the letter &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt;). Let us denote &lt;math&gt;|u|_x - |u|_\bar x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;|u|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt;. We have
# &lt;math&gt;[u]_R = [v]_R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;|u|_{x - \bar x} = |v|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt; and
# &lt;math&gt;\forall [u]_R,[v]_R \in FG(X), \, |uv|_{x - \bar x} = |u|_{x - \bar x} + |v|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt;.
In this way, each element &lt;math&gt;[u]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the integer number &lt;math&gt;|u|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt; and the product &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; of two elements &lt;math&gt;[u]_R,[v]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; correspondent to the sum of they associated integers numbers &lt;math&gt;|u|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|v|_{x - \bar x}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, it seems that the group &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;similar&quot; to &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z},+)&lt;/math&gt;. indeed &lt;math&gt;(FG(X),\star)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorph to &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z},+)&lt;/math&gt; and the application &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|_{x - \bar x} : FG(X) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a group isomorphism.


==Presentation of a group==

Informally, it seems that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the  &quot;free&quot; group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; imposing the relation &lt;math&gt;nx = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Let us try formalize this idea. We start with a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that spans a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that que want to create and a set of relations &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (such as &lt;math&gt;x^n = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;xy = yz&lt;/math&gt;) that the elements of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; must verify and we obtain a group &lt;math&gt;G/R&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and that verify the relations of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely, we write each relation &lt;math&gt;u = v&lt;/math&gt; in the form &lt;math&gt;uv^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt; (for example, &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt; is written in the form &lt;math&gt;xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;) and we see each &lt;math&gt;uv^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; as a &quot;word&quot; of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have to be a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we can not consider the quotient &lt;math&gt;FG(X)/R&lt;/math&gt;, so we consider the quotient &lt;math&gt;FG(X)/N&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. In &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt;, we will have &lt;math&gt;uv^{-1}N = 1N&lt;/math&gt;, which we see as meaning that in &lt;math&gt;G/N&lt;/math&gt; the elements &lt;math&gt;uv^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; are the same. In this way, &lt;math&gt;FG(X)/N&lt;/math&gt; will verify all the relations that we want and will be spanned by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (more precisely, by  &lt;math&gt;\{xN : x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt;). Let us formalize this idea.


'''Definition''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. We call presentation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and denote by &lt;math&gt;&lt; X:R &gt;&lt;/math&gt;, to a ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(X,R)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a set, &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G \simeq FG(X)/N&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Given a presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;X:R&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, we call spanning set to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and set of relations to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.''


Let us see some examples of presentations of the free group &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; and the groups &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m \oplus \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;. We also use the examples to present some common notation and to show that a presentation of a group does not need to be unique.


'''Examples'''
# Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. &lt;math&gt;&lt;X:{\emptyset}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;FG(X) \simeq FG(X)/\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\{1\}&lt;/math&gt; is the normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x\}:\emptyset &gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z},+) \simeq FG(\{x\})&lt;/math&gt;, more commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x:\emptyset&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. Another presentation of &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z},+)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x,y\}:\{xy^{-1}\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, more commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y:xy^{-1}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, in the presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y:xy^{-1}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; we insert a new element &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the spanning set, but we impose the relation &lt;math&gt;xy^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as having not introduced the element &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and have stayed by the presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;x:\emptyset&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;&lt;X:\{x^n\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x^n = x \star \cdots \star x \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times) is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;\{x^n\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;N = \{\ldots,\bar{x}^{2n},\bar{x}^n,1,x^n,x^{2n},\ldots\} \simeq n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;FG(X) \simeq \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \simeq FG(X)/N&lt;/math&gt;. Is more common to denote &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x\} : \{x^n\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x : x^n&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; distinct) and &lt;math&gt;R = \{xyx^{-1}y^{-1}\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;&lt;X:R&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, what we do is impose comutatibility in &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;xyx^{-1}y^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, obtaining a group isomorph to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. It's more usually denote &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x,y\} : \{xyx^{-1}y^{-1}\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y : xyx^{-1}y^{-1}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;X = \{x,y\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R = \{xyx^{-1}y^{-1},x^m,y^n\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;&lt;X,R&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, what we do is impose comutability in the same way as in the previous example, and we impose &lt;math&gt;x^m = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^n = 1&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; instead &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. It's more common denote&lt;math&gt;&lt;\{x,y\}:\{xyx^{-1}y^{-1},x^m,y^n\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y:xyx^{-1}y^{-1},x^m,y^n&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;&lt;\{a,b,c\}:\{aa,bb,cc,abac,cbab\}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, more commonly written &lt;math&gt;&lt;a,b,c:a^2,b^2,c^2,abac,cbab&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;, the group of the permutations of &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; with the composition of applications. To verify this, one can verify that any group with presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;a,b,c:a^2,b^2,c^2,abac,cbab&gt;&lt;/math&gt; as exactly six elements &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ac&lt;/math&gt;, and that the multiplication of this elements results in the following Cayley table that is equal to the Cayley table of &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;. Just to give an idea how this can be achived, a group with presentation &lt;math&gt;&lt;a,b,c:a^2,b^2,c^2,abac,cbab&gt;&lt;/math&gt; as exactly the elements &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ac&lt;/math&gt; because none of this elements are the same (the relations &lt;math&gt;a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = abac = cbab = 1&lt;/math&gt; don't allow us to conclude that two of the elements are equal) and because &quot;another&quot; elements like &lt;math&gt;bc&lt;/math&gt; are actually one of the previous elements (for example, from &lt;math&gt;cbab = id&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;cb = ab&lt;/math&gt;, and taking inverses of both members, we have &lt;math&gt;b^{-1}c^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which, using &lt;math&gt;a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = id&lt;/math&gt;, this is, &lt;math&gt;a = a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b = b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, results in &lt;math&gt;bc = ba&lt;/math&gt;). Then, using the relations of the presentation, one can compute the Cayley table. For example, &lt;math&gt;a (ab) = b&lt;/math&gt; because we have the relation &lt;math&gt;a^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Another example: we have &lt;math&gt;b(ac) = a&lt;/math&gt; because we can multiply both members of the relation &lt;math&gt;abac = id&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and then use &lt;math&gt;a^2 = id&lt;/math&gt;. One could have suspected of this presentation by taking &lt;math&gt;a = (1 \ 2)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b = (1 \ 3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = (2 \ 3)&lt;/math&gt; and then, trying to construct the Cayley table of &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;, found out that it was possible if one know that &lt;math&gt;a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = abac = cbab = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

It's natural to ask if all groups have a presentation. The following theorem tell us that the answer is yes, and it give us a presentation.


'''Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;(G,\times)&lt;/math&gt; be a group.''
# ''The application &lt;math&gt;\varphi : FG(G) \rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\varphi([x_1]_R \star \cdots \star [x_n]_R) = x_1 \times \cdots \times x_n&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n \in G&lt;/math&gt;) is an epimorphism of groups.''
# ''&lt;math&gt;&lt;G:\textrm{ker} \, \varphi&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;(G,\times)&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Proof'''
# &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is well defined because every element of &lt;math&gt;FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; as a unique representations in the form &lt;math&gt;[x_n] \star \cdots [x_n]_R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n \in G&lt;/math&gt;, with the exception of &lt;math&gt;[1]_R&lt;/math&gt; appears several times in the representation, but that doesn't affect the value of &lt;math&gt;x_1 \times \cdots \times x_n&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;[x_1]_R \star \cdots \star [x_m]_R,[y_1]_R \star \cdots \star [y_n]_R \in FG(X)&lt;/math&gt; be any elements, where &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_m,y_1,\ldots,y_n \in G&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;\varphi(([x_1]_R \star \cdots \star [x_m]_R) \star ([y_1]_R \star \cdots \star [y_n]_R)) = (x_1 \times \cdots \times x_m) \times (y_1 \times \cdots \times y_n) =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\varphi([x_1]_R \star \cdots \star [x_m]_R) \times \varphi([y_1]_R \star \cdots \star [y_n]_R)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism of groups. Because &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in G, \, \varphi ([x]_R) = x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a epimorphism of groups.
# Using the first isomorphism theorem (for groups), we have &lt;math&gt;FG(G)/\textrm{ker} \, \varphi \simeq \varphi(G) = G&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;&lt;G:\textrm{ker} \, \varphi&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is a presentation of &lt;math&gt;(G,\times)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;


The previous theorem, despite giving us a presentations of the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, doesn't give us a &quot;good&quot; presentation, because the spanning set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is usually much larger that other spanning sets, and the set of relations &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ker} \, \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is also usually much larger then other sufficient sets of relations (it is even a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;FG(G)&lt;/math&gt;, when it would be enough that it span an appropriated normal subgroup).

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the &quot;emulated&quot;/&quot;actual&quot; console categories are kind of silly, in that all are &quot;actual&quot; consoles, and all will probably be emulated at some point, and in fact emulators already exist for the Playstation, Game Cube, and Dreamcast.  Maybe a chronological/alphabetical list would be better?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==INKEY$==
Getting real time information from the user is a little more difficult.  To do so, we will use the INKEY$ command, which checks to see if a user typed a key and provides the keypress to the program.  

Look at this code and then we will look at it in depth:

  DO
    LET k$ = INKEY$
  LOOP UNTIL k$ &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
  SELECT CASE k$
    CASE &quot;q&quot;
      QuitProgram
    CASE &quot;c&quot;
      MakeCircle
    CASE &quot;s&quot;
      MakeSquare
  END SELECT

The first part is the DO-LOOP which constantly polls INKEY$ for a return value.  In the basic use, INKEY$ returns an empty string if no keys are being pressed and continues with the program.  Once a key is pressed, INKEY$ will return that key immediately.   

== The keyboard buffer == 

What is INKEY$ doing and how does it work?

While the INKEY$ command looks like it returns the key currently being pressed, this is not the case. It is used by the program to answer the question, &quot;What is IN the KEYboard buffer?&quot;   To understand this you will need to understand what a basic buffer is and why it is used.

In older systems (not necessarily the IBM PC) a single chip processed keyboard input, and controlled the LED lights for caps lock and number lock.  Because a computer does many things at once (e.g., take input from the mouse, crunch numbers, call subroutines, display new information on the screen), it needs to be able to remember what was pressed on the keyboard while it is busy.  This chip contained some memory (called a buffer) that allow keeping track of a limited number of keypresses. 

Within the Dos platform under IBM PCs, the hardware has changed slightly.  Instead of a hardware buffer, pressing or releasing a key will interrupt the running program to add a keystroke to a software buffer located in the BIOS.  This procedure is usually unnoticed by the user and has minimal impact on system performance.  However, this buffer allows for 15 characters - attempting to overflow it when the computer is busy will cause a short beep and drop any further characters. 

The INKEY$ command uses this buffer as a FIFO (First In First Out) buffer.  As an example let's say you have a game that has a bouncing ball on the screen and a paddle at the bottom.  The computer program constantly has to update the screen to show the movement of the ball.  While it does this the program passes by an INKEY$ command to see what value is returned.  If the user has pressed a key since the last time the command was invoked it will return that key.   Let's say the ball is moving over to the right and the user needs to press the &quot;R&quot; key to tell the program to move the paddle right.  Since the program is busy moving the ball and updating the screen, it does not instantaneously notice that the user has pressed the key.  Instead, the key press is stored in the keyboard buffer, and retrieved a few milliseconds (or microseconds) later when the INKEY$ command is used.  

In many programs (as above), INKEY$ will appear nested in a loop.   It is requested over and over again.    This allows the program to get user input one character at a time.   Using our example above, the user may need to press R over and over again until the paddle is under the ball.  On the other hand, the user may press R too many times and need to press L to move it left.   Because the INKEY$ command is using a FIFO buffer it will always retrieve the keys pressed in the same order as they where typed.

In summary, the INKEY$ command will always return and remove the first character in the keyboard buffer.   Generally speaking, it is used over and over to retrieve every key that has been pressed, and to allow a user to interact with a program in a close approximation to &quot;real time.&quot;  If there is no key in the keyboard buffer, INKEY$ it will return an empty string (no character).

== Scancodes ==
Some keypresses are not associated with an ASCII character.  When one of these keys is pressed, INKEY$ returns a string with two characters = the first character is a null (ASCII code 0), and the second is the raw scan code for the keyboard.  A full listing of the scancodes can be found within the QBASIC help file - you can also determine the scan codes by examining the results of INKEY$ as you press those keys in question.

{{NOTE|Some keys cannot be directly detected by INKEY$.}}

== Dialogue 3==
'''Ricardo''': Olá! Como vai? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Bem, obrigado. E você? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Bem. O que vai fazer no sábado? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Eu vou passear com a minha mãe. E você? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Vou ao cinema. &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Não gosta de nadar? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Não, eu e a minha esposa não gostamos de nadar. &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Eu e a minha família gostamos de nadar.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In this dialogue João and Ricardo are talking about what they are going to do. What day? Well, let's have a look at the days of the week before we go any further.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;

      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;

      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;

      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wednesday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#ebe8cc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#ebe8cc&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;segunda-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;ter&amp;ccedil;a-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;quarta-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;quinta-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#cadbcc&quot;&gt;sexta-feira&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#ebe8cc&quot;&gt;s&amp;aacute;bado&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#ebe8cc&quot;&gt;domingo&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Note: If it's clear that you are talking about days of the week, you don't actually have to say 'feira'. 

So Ricardo says

'''Ricardo''': Olá. O que vai fazer no sábado?

Olá of course means 'hello'. 

'''O que você vai fazer (no sábado) ?'''

This is a very useful phrase that basically means 'What are you going to do (on Saturday)?' You can of course replace the 'sábado' with whichever day you want to use. 'No' is a contraction of 'em' (in) and 'o' ('the', masculine). Weekend days are masculine, whereas week days are feminine, so you'll say 'no domingo' (on Sunday) but 'na segunda(-feira)' (on Monday).

The answer will be something along the lines of:

'''(Eu) vou (fazer, nadar, comer)'''

This means 'I am going'. 'Vou' is one part of the word 'ir' which means 'to go' in Portuguese. Just like in English, we say what we will do by saying 'going to', in Portuguese we can use the verb 'ir' (which, as a verb, changes for each person that it refers to, like 'estar' and 'ser') to talk about the future. First we need to look at how to conjugate (change for each person) the verb 'ir'. Remember the tree analogy? 'Ir' is called the ''infinitive'' - the trunk - of the verb. We can't just simply use it, we have to change it.

 '''IR - Present Indicative Tense'''
 '''Eu vou''' - I go
 '''Tu vais''' - You (familiar) go
 '''Você vai''' - You (informal) go
 '''Ele/Ela vai ''' - He/She goes
 '''Nós vamos''' - We go
 '''Vocês vão''' - You (plural) go
 '''Eles/Elas vão''' - They (group of males or mixed) / They (group of females) go

You need to memorize the conjugations for this verb because it is IRREGULAR - it has no pattern to it.

You may also recognize a word from the dialogue. Ricardo asked João, 

'''Como vai?''' - How are you doing (literally &quot;How are you going?&quot;)

This is another way to ask how someone is. Do you remember '''Como está?''' from the first lesson? Remember that '''como''' means &quot;how&quot;. So '''como vai?''' literally means &quot;How are you going?&quot;. It can be replied to exactly like &quot;Como está&quot;.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EED2EE&quot;&gt;
&lt;center&gt; '''PRONUNCIATION TIP''' &lt;/center&gt;
You may be asking how the word '''vão''' is pronounced. Whenever an accent has a tilde (that's the squiggly thing above the &quot;a&quot;) you ''nasalize'' the vowel.  This may be the hardest phonem for a non-native to pronounce. What this means precisely is very difficult to explain. If you speak French you will know how that (in French) the word ''marron'' is pronounced without the 'n' on the end. Instead the sound of the &quot;o&quot; comes out of your nose rather your mouth. With any luck we will be able to get some sound files up soon to show you this difficult pronunciation
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Now that we know how this verb conjugates for every person, we can use it to say what someone is going to do.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;559&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Eu vou&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;I am going...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;
 width=&quot;307&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;nadar- &lt;i&gt;to swim&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
falar com um amigo - &lt;i&gt;to talk with a friend&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;beber - &lt;i&gt;to drink&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;ir ao cinema - &lt;i&gt;go
to the cinema&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td width=&quot;247&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt; N&amp;oacute;s vamos&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;We are going...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Of course you can use any of the conjugations we have learned, not just '''eu vou''' and '''N&amp;oacute;s vamos'''.

Try out the following exercise

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#B0E0E6&quot;&gt;

Fill in the following phrases using the appropriate form of the verb 'ir'.

1. '''Vocês ______ beber.''' - ''You (plural) are going to drink''

2. '''Eu ______ comer no domingo.''' = ''I am going to eat on Sunday.''

3. '''Ricardo e João ______ ___________''' - ''Ricardo and João are going to swim''. {Hint: Which type of conjugation is the phrase &quot;Ricardo and João&quot;?)

4. '''____ vais falar com um amigo''' - ''You are going to talk with a friend''

5. '''Ela ______ ler na terça-feira.''' - ''She is going to read on Tuesday.

6. '''__ ______ ________ fazer ____ ________?'' ''What are you going to do on Thursday?

7. '''______ _______ ____ ________ ____ ____________''' - You (use você) are going to go to the cinema on Friday.

Answers

1. vão

2. vou

3. vão nadar

4. tu

5. vai

6. O que vais fazer na quinta-feira?

7. Você vai ao cinema na sexta-feira.

''If you got the last sentence right, well done! You have successfully translated your first sentence from English to Portuguese''

&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/table&gt;

The infinitive forms of verbs - like '''gostar''', '''ser''' and '''ir''' - are used quite a bit in Portuguese - but usually only when there is another verb before them. For instance, we know that we use the infinitive after the verb 'ir'.
We also know how to say &quot;I like something&quot;. But how do we say &quot;I like to do something&quot;?
This is nearly as simple as saying &quot;I am going to do something&quot;. Except here we use the verb '''gostar''' (remember, this means ''to like'') instead of '''ir''' - and we slip the word '''de''' in as well.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;559&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Eu gosto de&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;I like&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;
 width=&quot;307&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;ler - &lt;i&gt;to read&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
falar - &lt;i&gt;to talk&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;dormir - &lt;i&gt;to sleep&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;ir ao cinema com um amigo - &lt;i&gt;to go
to the cinema with a friend&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Error==

I think this is wrong
f)São vinte para as quatro. is labled as 4:40. Whereas what the portuguese phrase says is vinte (twenty) to (quatro) four

*It should be f)São vinte para as cinco. [[User:152.78.126.18|152.78.126.18]] 18:12, 11 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a Watchdog Timer? ==
A watchdog timer is a device that triggers a system reset if it
detects that the system has hung. A program running on the system
is supposed periodically to service the watchdog timer by writing a
&quot;service pulse.&quot; If the watchdog is not serviced within a particular
period of time, the watchdog assumes that the system has hung, and
triggers a system reset.

== What is Softdog? ==
Usually, watchdog timers are implemented as add-on cards, or as on-chip
peripherals within microcontrollers. But if there is no hardware
watchdog, the Linux kernel can provide a software watchdog implemented
using kernel timers.

== Linux Watchdog Mechanism ==
In Linux, the watchdog driver provides a character driver interface to
the user space. When some data is written to the watchdog driver, the
watchdog driver services the watchdog hardware. The user space
application periodically writes some data to the watchdog driver,
depending upon the watchdog timeout period. If for some reason the user
space application hangs, the watchdog device does not get serviced and
hence triggers a system reset.

Usually the application that writes to the watchdog driver is a
watchdog daemon which monitors processes in the system, as well as 
other parameters such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, and so on.

== How Softdog Works ==
When the softdog driver is opened, softdog schedules a kernel timer to
expire after a specified timer margin. When some data is written to
the driver, the softdog driver re-schedules the timer. The user space
watchdog daemon periodically writes to the driver, and the timer is
continuously rescheduled and hence the timer callback is never
called. If the watchdog daemon stops writing to the driver, the timer
expires and the callback is called. In the timer callback, the system
is restarted.  Here's a link to an article on [http://techthoughts.typepad.com/managing_computers/2007/10/how-to-use-a-wa.html  ways to use a watchdog timer effectively].

== Source files ==

In the 2.6 kernel the softdog driver is located in
&lt;code&gt;drivers/char/watchdog/softdog.c&lt;/code&gt;. [http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/char/watchdog/softdog.c?v=2.6.11 Here's a link to the softdog driver on LXR]

== Initialization ==
 static int __init watchdog_init(void)
 {
         int ret; 
 
         /* Check that the soft_margin value is within it's range ; 
            if not reset to the default */
         if (softdog_set_heartbeat(soft_margin)) {
                 softdog_set_heartbeat(TIMER_MARGIN);
                 printk(KERN_INFO PFX &quot;soft_margin value must
                      be 0&lt;soft_margin&lt;65536, using %d\n&quot;,
                        TIMER_MARGIN);
         } 
 
         ret = register_reboot_notifier(&amp;softdog_notifier);
         if (ret) {
                 printk (KERN_ERR PFX &quot;cannot register
                                                reboot notifier (err=%d)\n&quot;,
                         ret);
                 return ret;
         }
         
         ret = misc_register(&amp;softdog_miscdev);
         if (ret) {
                 printk (KERN_ERR PFX &quot;cannot register miscdev
                                                             on minor=%d (err=%d)\n&quot;,
                         WATCHDOG_MINOR, ret);
                 unregister_reboot_notifier(&amp;softdog_notifier);
                 return ret;
         }
 
         printk(banner, soft_noboot, soft_margin, nowayout);
        
         return 0;
 }

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Amuhr86. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Amuhr86~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

A classic dessert, with a light texture and a mild flavor.  This recipe is for &quot;boiled&quot; custard, but ironically, as Mrs. F.L. Gillette said in ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13923/13923-h/13923-h.htm The Whitehouse Cookbook]'', &quot;it must ''not'' boil or it will curdle.&quot;  See more on custard in general [[Cookbook:Custard|here]].

== Ingredients ==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] or 500 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1/4 to 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
*1 [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)
*1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] (optional)
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (optional)

== Procedure ==  
# Heat milk and salt (if using) in a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]] until bubbles form around the edges.
# Beat eggs with sugar until uniform.
# Gradually mix approximately 1/2 cup hot milk into the egg mixture to [[Cookbook:Tempering|temper]] it.
# Slowly stir egg mixture into remaining hot milk.
# Optionally, mix cornstarch and water and stir into custard.
# Stir over heat until thickened (should coat the spoon), ''without'' bringing to a boil.
# Remove from heat, and continue stirring to dry the custard slightly.
# Stir in vanilla before the dish has cooled completely.
# Serve warm or chilled.

==Variations==
*Replace vanilla extract with almond or maple extract, [[Cookbook:Brandy|brandy]] or grated [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon zest]].

*Stir 1/2 cup of sugar in a small frying pan until it becomes liquid and just begins to smoke. Stir it into the hot milk before adding the egg mixture.

__NOTOC__
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|Cuisine of France]]

A '''quiche''' is a [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]], [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|unsweetened]] [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]] [[Cookbook:Dessert#Pies, Tarts|pie]], often made with savory fillings.  Originally served in Germany, quiche was adopted by neighboring France and is now considered a traditional French dish.  The French (and now English) word ''quiche'' comes from a dialectal form (''Küchle'') of the German word for [[Cookbook:Dessert#Cakes, cupcakes|cake]] (''Kuchen'').  Quiche became popular in Britain after World War II and in the United States during the 1960s and 70s.

==Ingredients==

*1 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (320 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (approximately 30% [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|fat]])
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] chopped ''fresh'' [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Dash|dash]] ground [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/8 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*1 prepared frozen pie crust
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (180 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) freshly-grated [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss cheese]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|375&amp;deg; Fahrenheit]] (190&amp;deg; Celsius)
#Place the eggs, cream, tarragon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]; blend ''as briefly as possible'' until they form a homogeneous mixture
#In the pie crust, create alternating layers of the shredded cheese and the mixture from the blender until the crust is full
#Bake the quiche for 35-40 minutes; a toothpick or fork inserted into its middle should come out &quot;clean&quot;
#Remove the quiche from the oven and let it cool for at least 20 minutes before serving

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Use nutmeg sparingly.
*Fresh tarragon will be better than dried tarragon.
*Placing a very hot pan in under the quiche will give it greater volume.
*Try making quiches with [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s, sautéed [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]], and shredded sharp [[Cookbook:Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]]; feel free to experiment.

==Warnings==
*The quiche mixture may drip over the edge of the pie crust while cooking; place it on a cookie sheet or place foil on the oven rack below it.
*The quiche will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven; be careful not to overcook it or cut it before it has had a chance to set.
*[[Cookbook:Half and Half|Half-and-half]] (cream with approximately 12% fat) can be substituted for regular cream to make this dish less fattening; however, be cautious of using milk because low-fat dairy products curdle more easily.

* It's ok for me to vote for my own book, right?  Anyways, the book has been very beneficial to Blender hopefuls, and it is listed first above all the other tutorials on the official Blender 3D site ( see http://blender3d.org/cms/Tutorials.243.0.html ).  I get emails all the time thanking me for putting this together:

&quot;Thanks for your time and effort on the Blender guide on WikiBooks. I've used many 3d packages(Maya, 3ds) but have wanted better understanding,.. quickly of Blender. Your guide has been instrumental in this act, and in several hours I'm really starting to get a feel for what Bender is capable of.&quot;

&quot;Im completely new to 3D imaging on the computer. Your tutorial was clear and easily understood. Just at the right level for me, explaining the basics without being patronising. Perfect, Thanks.&quot;

... and so my (obviously biased) vote goes to [[Blender 3D/Noob to Pro]].  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 12:37, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

* Yes! This is a great book. I've tried using the so-called &quot;manual&quot; for B3D but this is a lot easier to use. [[User:MeMoria|MeMoria]] 16:06, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

** Thank you! If you actually look at this Wikibook, you can read totally through it in about 3 minutes. I can't see how four ''actual'' people could have ''honestly'' voted for this when all the other nominations are so much more deserving. While I admit to being a [[w:Wikipedia:Sock_puppet|sockpuppet]], I think Starandstripe and Starfish77 need to admit to it too. For both, their first (and sometimes only) edits were votes and praise for this contentless Wikibook. --[[User:Sockpuppet3|Sockpuppet3]] 12:39, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)
** I think I'll have to agree with Sockpuppet3. He does look like the third sockpuppet. Not only are [[Special:Contributions/Starfish77|Starfish77's]] and [[Special:Contributions/Starandstripe|Starandstripe's]] contributions only their votes, but Starfish77's vote came just four minutes after Charlie123's (the primary author) last edit of the day--a comment giving further praise to his book. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 18:36, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)
*** Even if he did register multiple accounts, the rules say that any logged in user can vote. Maybe the rules should be changed so that only users with at least 100 edits can vote? [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 22:38, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

&quot;Depression is a mood disorder&quot;, so start many descriptions of the illness.  That is a gross understatement.
Depression does indeed seriously affect your mood, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.  A clinical
depression can be an incapacitating illness, affecting your ability to perform tasks that require concentration
and rendering you unable to work. 

By writing this document we hope to provide you with the knowledge everyone should have about their
mental well-being. Depression is not an unavoidable fate.  It is physical.

The good news is that you can recover and yes, even learn to be happier
than you have ever been before.

== Introduction ==

In order to begin any explanation of the nature of depression, it is advisable to begin by establishing some common terms, distinctions, and popular definitions. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But most of all what must be stressed are the meanings and differences between them.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;

The volume of misconceptions, stereotypes and prejudices that the vast majority of people have concerning the topic of depression in the medical sense is truly astounding. &lt;br&gt;

To begin, we must make a very clear distinction between Depression and Clinical/Bipolar Depression. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Colloquially, they are used indiscriminately.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Anyone who has experienced Clinical/Bipolar Depression will tell you that the two are absolutely nothing alike. &lt;br&gt;

*&quot;&lt;b&gt;Depression&lt;/b&gt;&quot; (used in a non medico-legal sense) as the word is commonly used in day to day jargon refers to momentary bouts of the blues or melancholy.&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(and this meaning/understanding is not for any form of medico-legal related fields.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
**Every human being experiences this from time to time, it is completely normal and after a little while without need of medical intervention you will be back to normal. 
*&lt;b&gt;Unipolar/Bipolar Depression&lt;/b&gt; (using as in medico-legal sense) is not anything remotely similar to plain old &quot;&lt;b&gt;Depression&lt;/b&gt;.&quot; &lt;br&gt;

Clinical/Bipolar Depression is a medical condition as true as diabetes &lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(DM Type-II) &lt;/font&gt; or cancer &lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(e.g. breast cancer, testicular cancer etc.)&lt;/font&gt;. 

&lt;u&gt;&quot;Normal&quot; depression is psychological&lt;/u&gt; whereas &lt;u&gt;Clinical/Bipolar Depression is both psychological and physiological&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;i&gt;it is well documented that drastic alterations occur in the brain as well as other changes occur in the rest of the body.&lt;/i&gt;

The importance of these distinctions is paramount &lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(most important)&lt;/font&gt;, you cannot gain an understanding of these conditions without it. 

I will urge people who are reading this and who are fortunate not to have experienced  clinical/bipolar depression, to keep this distinction clear in your minds while reading the rest of this book, any related material, and most of all when interacting with those who are diagnosed.

&lt;b&gt; Please pay Attention! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
For the remainder of this document &lt;u&gt;for the sake of simplicity when the word &quot;depression&quot; is used it will refer to the medical condition of Clinical or Bipolar Depression&lt;/u&gt;, and the term &lt;u&gt;&quot;normal depression&quot; will refer to the everyday non diagnosed human experience&lt;/u&gt;. 

Now that the most important distinction and definitions are out of the way lets establish some others. 

There are two major types of medical depression
#Clinical Depression 
#Bipolar Disorder 

&lt;i&gt;Clinical Depression is an outdated term but is still commonly used. Similarly Bipolar Disorder(BD) was formerly referred to as Manic Depression, but Manic Depression is still widely used to refer to it.&lt;/i&gt;

The correct terms to use as accepted by the medical community are: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Major Depressive Disorder(MDD)&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Unipolar Depression&lt;/b&gt; instead of Clinical Depression, and &lt;b&gt;Bipolar disorder&lt;/b&gt; instead of Manic Depression.

As I said before there are two major kinds of medical Depression, MDD and Bipolar Disorder. &lt;br&gt;
What's the Difference? 

In a nut shell &lt;b&gt;Bipolar Disorder&lt;/b&gt; is the same as &lt;b&gt;MDD&lt;/b&gt; except that it has two alternating phases; Depression and Mania. 

The experiences are usually the same symptoms that occur with MDD, except that they alternate with Manic Symptoms. 

Without going into too much detail at the moment, for our purposes now just think of Mania as the opposite of Depression or an extremely good mood. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The phrase extreme highs and lows sums it up quite nicely for our purposes. We'll go into a little bit more detail about mania later but I don't want to leave you thinking the Mania is all fun and games. Even though you do have an elevated mood there are some very negative symptoms that also come along with Manic periods which will be explained latter. &lt;/i&gt;

While there are some documented differences between MDD and the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder, for our understanding they are not relevant and will not be addressed in this book. Both MDD and Bipolar depression are more similar than not, have the same basic symptoms and are usually treated in a similar fashion. Unless otherwise specified when the term depression is used it refers to both Major Depressive Disorder and the Depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder. 

If you've noticed I said that MDD and BP are the two major kinds of medical depression. There is another milder but still medically relevant form of depression known as &lt;b&gt;dystimia&lt;/b&gt; which we'll touch upon briefly later. 

Perhaps then some assume that:

Statistics point out that approximately one out of every six people will have a depression (with varying
degrees of seriousness) at least once in their lifetime.  The magnitude of this number is all the more
shocking if one confronts it with the general ignorance about the problem.  Even people
well-informed about other health issues will often be caught totally by surprise by a depression.
I know, I was one of them.  Since our early school years we get tons of information about healthy
eating, on the perils of smoking and heavy drinking, on avoiding sunburn, etc., etc.  But mental
health, largely because of the prejudice surrounding any kind of mental illness, is to a large
extent ignored.  This is more of a tragedy if one realises how far-reaching are the implications
for a person's life and productivity, and most importantly, how depression could be avoided altogether
if only people knew how to recognize the early symptoms.

As you read through this document, please always bear in mind that
whenever the term ''depression'' is used it refers specifically to the physical illness more properly
described as ''[[w:en:clinical depression|clinical depression]]''.  One also finds the very same word ''depression'' used
in the context of other mental disorders (such as ''[[w:en:manic-depression|manic depression]] ''[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/bipolar.cfm]) of which this document does not cover.  It is '''very important''' to keep this distinction in mind.  As an example,
consider the people who suffer from bouts of melancholy all through their lives.  They often describe
their subjective feeling as that of being ''depressed''.  However, when one takes a closer look
at more objective indicators, they may not show the symptoms of a clinical depression.  This document
does not apply to them.


One of the enduring myths about clinical depression is that you can cure it simply by convincing a depressed person that life is good and worth living. Likewise, a depressed person will not be magically cured if all of their problems are suddenly solved.  In fact, it was my experience (and that of many others) that the factors which contributed to the depression were long past and resolved.  However, they had their physical toll in the brain, and that could not be suddenly undone.

Our misuse of language compounds the problem.  All too often a perfectly healthy person (brain-wise, of course)will say that they feel depressed when really all they're experiencing is a passing case of the blues. It is far from my intention to dictate how people should use language, but this example illustrates my case. Curiously, one of the tell-tale symptoms of clinical depression is the inability to have strong emotions, including sadness and the blues.

Another important aspect to remember about depression is that it is not an on/off condition. There is a continuum between a perfectly healthy brain and one from a severely depressed person.  I estimate that in modern society, those who could be classified as in perfect mental health are probably the minority.  Moreover, just like physical fitness goes through ups and downs throughout a lifetime, the mental health of a typical individual will also fluctuate.  It is only when the fluctuation dips significantly low for an extended period that the diagnosis of a depression is typically made.  Elaborating further on this note, the good news is that a very large number of people who strictly speaking are not depressed and have largely satisfactory lives, could still feel better and happier if they took better care of their brains. The advice herein contained is also for them.

You may wonder why I have bothered to write such a lengthy description of depression if I advise people to seek professional help anyway.  In a sense, you are asking for a ''rationale'' for this document.  Well, I would not have written it if I thought it was irrelevant, dangerous, or simply superfluous- Quite the contrary. I see good reasons that justify it, as follows.

*The focus of the document is an objective description of clinical depression, explaining the physical illness which progressively takes its toll on the brain. If more people were aware of this fact, they would not be as complacent when the first symptoms appear. Moreover, they would feel less stigmatised and reluctant about seeking professional help.

*By being better informed, people would realise the importance of seeking '''competent''' help.  Many General Practitioners and even Psychologists are not properly informed about depression, and they can even inadvertently give their patients plenty of bad advice. Worst of all, the situation can worsen dramatically before the patient even realises what is wrong with the advice they are given.  This happens frequently, believe it or not. The only solution is for people to be better informed and able to spot whether or not their GP is competent enough to treat them.

*The enormous cost of health care in affluent societies often translates into health insurers pressuring for the cheaper solution of relying solely on antidepressants.  In countries where the GP stands as the ''gate-keeper'' for specialised treatment, people may find it difficult to convince their GP to send them to a specialist.  The result is treatment based largely on medication, with little or no coaching.

*Lifestyle plays a large role in the development of depression.  Again, by better understanding the problem from an objective perspective, people will more easily assimilate the need to take good care of their sleep and to avoid overloading their brains.

The remainder of this instalment is structured as follows.  I will begin by explaining what exactly is a depression and how the problem develops in the first place.  Special attention will be given to a description of the most typical symptoms which accompany each stage of
the illness.  The next step is more personal: it describes the lifestyle changes I had to make to help my brain recover instead of sinking deeper into the illness.

== What is Depression? ==

Depression is a very real medical condition that involves both psychological and biological factors. It is not simply &quot;in your head&quot;. Numerous studies have shown significant changes occur to the anatomy of the brain during the course of depression. Depression is a whole body illness, not only affecting the brain. Those with depression experience a wide variety of physical and mental symptoms. Strong emphasis should be placed on the fact that depressed mood is only one symptom of many involved in an illness that encompasses many.

According to the &lt;b&gt;World Health Organization (W.H.O.)&lt;/b&gt;
Depression is a &lt;i&gt;common mental disorder&lt;/i&gt; that presents with &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

=== The Stress System: Adrenaline and Cortisol ===
[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Stress_Compensation.png|right|frame|Figure 4: Chronic stress can diminish your maximum normal capacity.]]


The stress system relies on two key hormones: ''adrenaline'' and ''cortisol''.
In short, adrenaline works in the short term, while cortisol has large momentum and works
in the long term.  (Adrenaline is also known as ''epinephrine'' in North America.
To be exact, the terms ''noradrenaline'' and ''norepinephrine'' are used to refer
specifically to the neurotransmitter as opposed to the hormone, since they are different molecules.
Moreover, there are many other neurotransmitters involved: check reference [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00083A00-318C-1F30-9AD380A84189F2D7] for details.
The purists will excuse my exclusive use of the word ''adrenaline'' throughout the text).

It is important to realise that the stress system can also be activated if your brain
perceives danger or any kind of threat.  In the first stage, this triggers the release
of adrenaline into the bloodstream to prepare the body for action. As a result,
your heart beats faster, you begin to sweat, your breath becomes shallower, and your
senses become more acute.
This is the so-called ''fight or flight'' response to the stressor event, and
was quite adequate during most of our evolution, when these events were quite
specific and usually short-term: escaping from a lion, chasing away a rival gang, or
facing up to the impudent adolescent trying to woo your mate.  Problems with
chronic stress arise because in a modern society we cannot escape easily from the stressor,
be it an overbearing boss, crowded cities, or traffic jams.  Furthermore, no matter
how hard we try to delude ourselves with the pretence of civilisation, at heart we
are still primates, and consequently, factors such as social status also play an important
role as sources of stress.  Moreover, primates have evolved the capacity to stress up the
body in ''anticipation'' of a possible danger [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00083A00-318C-1F30-9AD380A84189F2D7].  Again, this was
an advantageous adaptation in the context where it evolved, but nothing but trouble for
the modern human.

The effect of the stress hormones on the brain is curious and not what you might expect.
The initial surge of adrenaline can make you feel good. 

[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Cortisol.png|right|frame|Figure 2: The relationship between adrenaline and cortisol.]]
Just as your levels of adrenaline start coming down, so rises the amount of cortisol flowing
through your veins.  Moreover, cortisol has a much larger momentum than adrenaline, which
means that even though it builds up slowly, it also takes a long time to go back to normal.
And should you constantly be engaging in activities which require adrenaline, so will your
levels of cortisol slowly increase.  In a sense, you can think of cortisol as a measure of
the weighted average of your recent levels of adrenaline.  I have tried to capture this
feature in Figure 2.

Together with the rise of cortisol and the decrease of adrenaline, come the nasty side-effects
of the stress hormones.  It is at this moment that you feel bad, anxious, and
having lots of negative thoughts.  And this is perhaps one of the critical features
of stress which flies against common sense: you only feel its bad aspects
when your body is ''stressing down'' and progressing towards a more relaxed state.
When you are building up on adrenaline, in effect ''stressing up'', you might
even be feeling good!  This explains what is popularly known as the ''adrenaline rush''
and the consequent ''adrenaline crash''.

Having too much cortisol flowing through your veins has another nasty side-effect:
the recovery time from any adrenaline surge increases.  In a sense, the relation
between adrenaline and cortisol goes both ways: the adrenaline curve influences
the cortisol curve, and vice-versa.  Figure 3 tries to capture this reaction effect
by showing the adrenaline response curve for three individuals subjected to the
same physical exercise.  Notice how the more serious the depression (which translates
into higher levels of cortisol, as you will soon understand), the longer it
takes for the body to go back to normal.

[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Adrenaline_Response.png|none|frame|Figure 3: The adrenaline response curve for various degrees of depression.]]
   


On the speculation front, recent findings may have implicated neuron death as the physical
underpinning of depression.  Furthermore, it seems that the opposite process, termed
''neurogenesis'', is crucial for the recovery, and happens naturally in healthy individuals [3,6].
Furthermore, evidence indicates that sleep is fundamental for neurogenesis to take place.

[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Buildup.png|right|frame|Figure 5: In the last stages of clinical depression, the maximum capacity is virtually nil, and the adrenaline (anxiety) transforms itself into a 'fire'.]]

At this stage you are in possession of all the ingredients necessary to understand how
depression develops.  The negative effect of the stress hormones on the maximum normal
capacity is the key to comprehend the ''buildup'' process that makes a depression
feed on itself, like a [[w:en:positive feedback|positive feedback]] mechanism.

Let us go back to [[:Image:Demystifying_Depression-Stress_Compensation.png|Figure 4]].  Imagine that you would chronically go over your limits, thus forcing your body to constantly rely on the stress hormones to compensate for the lack of serotonin.  On the long term, your maximum capacity would therefore be reduced, making it much more likely that you would have to resort to the stress system to compensate.  And thus the feedback begins: your maximum capacity is diminished, forcing you to use the stress system all the time; and because of all the stress hormones flowing through your veins, your brain has no chance of recovering, and your maximum capacity diminishes even further.

This may sound very mechanical, but I would say that it is '''the key element
that leads to the development of a full-blown clinical depression'''.
Alas, it is also something that most doctors fail to realise.  And if you are still
clinging to &quot;psychological&quot; notions about the illness, it is time you put them
into perspective.  Psychology plays a role in the factors that lead to the initial
dip of your work capacity, but after a certain stage the problem just feeds on itself,
and it is crucial to understand that to avoid falling prey of this downward spiral.

Even though the graphs might give the impression that this is a phenomenon that
happens very quickly, in reality the process typically takes many years to
develop.  Moreover, the progressive increase of the levels of stress hormones
in your body provide a very good advance warning, if only you know how to read them.
I will now provide a basic description of what to expect (and what to do!) at
each stage of the process.  Beware that different people have different symptoms,
so your mileage may vary.

==Early stages==
In the very early stages, a depression will not feel like a depression at all. The small amounts of stress hormones could in theory be measured&amp;mdash;your blood pressure would be slightly higher than otherwise&amp;mdash;but in practise it would be difficult &quot;to extract the signal from the noise&quot;.  Subjectively, you might feel a bit down and tired, especially during those periods when you are ''crashing down'' from the adrenaline, but most people would still not say that they feel depressed.  Also, you would start sleeping a bit less than usual, and not feeling quite as fresh when you wake up.

The problem is not very serious yet, and I think that most people could recover on their own if they were to simply take a long holiday and to make sure that they sleep well.  There is some evidence that '''if done properly''' moderate amounts of aerobic exercise might help at this stage.  However, be sure to read [[../The Role of Sports/]] section before you decide to embark on any
exercise routine.  In fact, I would rather advise people not to begin exercising than to risk having them over do it and making their condition worse. I know this flies against some commonly held beliefs, but '''sports alone can worsen a depression'''.  If you do not believe now, read carefully both installments of this document and you might understand what I mean.

==Elevated stress hormones==
As the amount of stress hormones increases, you will start feeling some of their
nasty side-effects.  This is largely person-dependent, but most people start
having problems with their digestive system, headaches, and having more frequent
nightmares.  Since stress depresses the immune system, people also tend to fall
sick with infections more often [http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~hanko/Bio/stress.html].  Only a minority of people suffer from sleep
paralysis [http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~acheyne/S_P.html], but it is also a good indicator of elevated stress hormones.
An objective measure such as blood pressure should be controlled: it will definitely
be higher than normal, and a good doctor would not fail to recognise it.  At this
stage you are very clearly sleeping less than normal, waking up early in the morning,
feeling tired and &quot;lazy&quot; about getting up.  Subjectively, you should notice that you
do not feel things quite as intensively as you used to: you feel empty, morose, and
definitely &quot;depressed&quot; most of the time.  Other subjective indicators include loss
of appetite and sex-drive, feelings of guilt, lowered self-esteem, and detachment
from hobbies or friends [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/HealthInformation/Depressionmenu.cfm].

At this stage you should not be complacent about the problem.  '''The best thing
you can do is to go see your doctor'''.  Take also into consideration that you
have been putting too much pressure on your brain.  Really do give it a rest: take
a long holiday, make sure you sleep well, and be careful not to get any extra
responsibilities.  Antidepressants are very effective at this stage, especially
if combined with minor lifestyle changes. '''(And yet another reason why
you should see your doctor!)'''

==Problem aggravates==
As the ''buildup'' towards a depression continues, you get to the point
where it is impossible not to notice that there is something definitely wrong.
At this point, most people start having serious problems with anxiety, stress,
panic attacks, hyperventilation, bouts of psychosis, etc.  Your sleep will
definitely be a mess, your blood pressure will be high, and your ability to
focus at work seriously compromised.

'''One should definitely seek professional help at this stage'''. In particular, do not make the assumption that your GP will be qualified to treat you.  They may, or they may not.  Unfortunately, many doctors still do not quite understand what is going on.  My experience in this area was
quite bad: I spent more than one year jumping from doctor to doctor, with the problem constantly aggravating, and getting all kinds of bad
advice.  In short, '''you need to stop'''. Your maximum capacity will probably be so low that you cannot even work full time.
Also, specifically ask your doctor for antidepressants.  In the country where I live, the Netherlands, this is bit of a taboo subject, so depending on where you live, you might need to convince your doctor not to be stingy and stubborn. Should they suggest that you start exercising, '''just ignore that advice'''. It is a very good indicator that they do not have a clue of what is going on. Also, you will need to make changes to your lifestyle. The [[../Recovery Guide/]] section describes one author's personal experience in that regard.

==Last stages==
In the last stages, the maximum capacity is practically nil, and the level of
stress hormones so high that people cease to be able to function.  The stage
of a clinical depression is very difficult to describe in words, but I will
do my best.  The anxiety transforms itself into a &quot;fire&quot; which constantly
burns inside your head; you will feel desperate, much more than you ever
felt in your life, as if you could never be happy again; and you will definitely
be suicidal, to the point of actually planning suicide or even attempting it
(with success in many cases, tragically).  During this stage, people can
barely sleep, if at all.

To an outsider, the fact that a clinically depressed person is pretty much
confined to bed is often misinterpreted.  People often think that a clinical
depression is a simply a state of apathy.  Quite on the contrary: remember
that the blood pressure and heart rate of a depressed person are extremely
high.  Rather than apathy, depression is an overwhelming fire which will not
subside and burns you from the inside.

Unfortunately, it is only at this stage that many people finally concede
that they need professional help to treat them.  Needless to say, you will
need to make drastic changes to your lifestyle if you want to recover.
You should also be very patient: it will take a long time before things go
back to normal.
'''Most important of all, a clinical psychiatrist is the proper
specialist to accompany you during this period.'''

== Recovery Guide ==

There are plenty of people with depression who are not being properly
treated.  Antidepressants revolutionized medicine's approach to the treatment of depression,
and even though they are generally effective and an indispensable tool, sole reliance on drugs
neglects valuable lifestyle advice.  This is important consideration for those with all levels of depression.

The first step tried in recovering from depression should be telling someone and then getting help from a doctor if possible.

In order to recover from a depression, one must first understand the problem.

The following three sections cover the different aspects of the lifestyle changes.
The first category deals with general advice which one should always have present.
I The next section deals with the daily routine.  Even though more flexible in nature, I quickly realized
that there were good reasons behind my counselor's insistence that I followed
its guidelines.   At last, the third section focuses on tips for good sleep.
These are by no means specific to a clinical depression.

=== General Lifestyle Advice ===

These are just the general tips that might help with depression.
It might take a while to get used to them, but in time they will become second nature.  Moreover, remember that
depression is not an on/off condition: this same advice is also useful for healthy people who wish to remain
that way.  Obviously, a healthy person does not need to follow them very strictly, but they remain nevertheless
good lifestyle advice.



*'''Try to avoid stress'''

Stress may exasperate depression

*'''Exercise'''

*'''Get Sunshine'''

*'''Do things you enjoy'''

*'''Practice relaxation exercises'''

Yes, I am referring to stuff like meditation and yoga.  They actually work, despite all
the silly new-age nonsense that surrounds them.  If you cannot stand the airy-fairy aspects,
try to find a good expert who does not preach them.

Personally, I found that one of the most relaxing things you can do is to lie in the sunshine.
This might not be an option if it is winter and/or you happen to live in a cold country,
but if you can, do it as much as is safely possible.  (But take into account the usual advice
concerning the dangers of catching too much sun, obviously!  Like in all things, moderation is the key).

'''Make a conscious effort to do things with pleasure'''

This could take a fair amount of brainwashing, but the idea is that before each activity, no matter
how small, you think ''I love doing this'' or ''I order myself to feel good, right now''.  For best results, say it loudly.  Also, only do
things when you really feel pleasure in doing them, and do them only for as long as that pleasure
remains.  Should you lose interest or feel tired, then stop.

'''Take appropriate medication'''

If your gut reaction is that antidepressants are evil, consider informing yourself properly.
The truth is that modern drugs are quite effective and generally safe (I am referring in
particular to SSRIs and more recent classes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor]). They do have side-effects,
but these are usually mild and quite bearable compared with the illness itself.  For best
results, have a clinical psychiatrist prescribe them to you: they are generally well informed of the
different side-effects and can choose the drug best suited to your case.  Also, remember that
antidepressants usually require around three weeks before they have an effect.  Three weeks
are an eternity for someone with a depression, but do not stop taking them just because you
do not see an immediate result.

=== Daily Routine ===

I will now make a brief description of the typical daily routine.  This advice assumes that the person
is in a serious condition, but there are still a few good pointers to extract even for mildly depressed
individuals.  Also, as the condition improves, one does not need to be as rigorous as in the early stages.

*'''Take your time to do the morning activities'''

You surely do not want to rev up your body immediately after waking up!  Take your time to get up,
to shower, to get dressed, and to breakfast.  If it takes you less than one hour and
a half to perform these activities, then you are doing them too quickly.

*'''Take a walk in the morning'''

The idea is to have a ''qualitative walk''.  Pay attention to the colours around you,
to the smells, the sounds, the shapes, the people, etc.  This will help to diffuse your
thoughts, and to avoid the obsessive thinking that accompanies depression.  Also, since
you must limit physical activity, walking every morning is important for your body to
burn excess sugar.  Walk for about half an hour, and do not forget: lie down for another
half an hour afterwards!  (Remember [[:Image:Demystifying_Depression-Adrenaline_Response.png|Figure 3]]: your body will take longer than usual to
get back to normal).

*'''Find an activity that gives you pleasure'''
Like gardening,
painting, or bird-watching.

*'''Eat properly and avoid heavy meals'''

Digestion is also quite demanding on your body, and therefore it is better to have
more meals rather than bigger meals.  Also, a depression is really a bad time to
be thinking of diets.  Eat well and make sure you get all your nutrients.

Some people also swear by the importance of drinking water regularly during the day.
The rationale is that dehydration is a stress event, thus triggering the physiological
reaction we aim to avoid.

*'''Have a ''siesta'''''

Even if you cannot sleep, it is important that you lie down for a while until your body
is (relatively) rested.  We all have a natural dip after lunch, and it is a pity that
some modern societies have lost the ''siesta'' habit.

=== Tips for Good Sleep ===

To conclude, I will present just a few tips on how to get a good night's sleep.
These are especially important during a depression, but again, they also apply
to anyone.

*'''No activities before going to sleep'''

You must avoid at all cost any adrenaline coming into your system before sleep time.
Be especially careful of anything exciting or stressful.
Yes, this includes most of television and even reading!
Avoid also any physical exercise less than an hour before going to sleep.  Always
have in mind that a person with a depression will need longer than normal for
the body to recover from any physical effort.  Even healthy individuals
should avoid doing sports at least a couple of hours before going to bed.

*'''Follow a steady sleep routine'''

Try going to bed always at the same time everyday.  We all know how working in shifts
and jet-lag affect sleep: do not emulate them by going to bed at random times each day!

*'''Give your body time to crash down'''

You cannot fall asleep while there is too much adrenaline running through your veins.
It can take a while (even hours) before you crash down, and often people lie awake in
bed waiting for sleep to come.  The problem is that after a while it is very easy to
start obsessing about not sleeping, which is a sure way of keeping yourself awake.

The idea is to only get ready for sleep once you have crashed down and feel tired.
Before you actually get into bed, just lie there for a while (even with your clothes on),
until you feel relaxed and tired.

*'''Go to bed early'''

There are several reasons why this is a good practise: foremost to be able to wake naturally
rather than with an alarm clock; but also to avoid being out of sync with the solar cycle,
and to give your body time to crash down.

*'''Make your bedroom your sanctuary'''

Do not have an office in the same room as where you sleep.  Dedicate one room
simply for sleeping, and make it as uncluttered as possible.

*'''Sleeping Medication'''

Sleep is the most important part of your day.  If all other methods and tips on how to get a good night's sleep fail; talk to your doctor about taking a low dose sleeping medication.

== The Recovery Process ==

Depending on your age, your general health status, how serious the depression was, and how well the recovery
progresses, it typically takes between two months and two years before you can be fully recovered.  Do not despair,
however, because this certainly does not mean that during all this period you will feel as bad as in the beginning.
The first few months are the hardest, but after that things will slowly improve, and little by little you will get
your happiness and normality back.  Moreover, remember that you only feel the nasty aspects of a depression
when you go over your limits: you just have to be patient and to realise that your limits will indeed be very
short during an extended period.

As the recovery progresses, you will feel not only that you can perform more concentration intensive
activities and during longer periods, but also that your subjective mood improves.  At some point
you will be able to start working again, only for a couple of hours each day in the beginning, but
increasingly more until you can work full time again.  Finally, your mood should start approaching
normality towards the later stages of the recovery: you should regain the feelings of ''fullness'',
vibrancy, and what is sometimes called the ''elan vital''.

== Conclusion ==
The moral of the story is fairly straightforward: depression is a physical illness which should
be taken seriously and be treated as soon as the first symptoms arise.  Like most other ailments,
it feeds on ignorance and complacency, which is all the more tragic if one considers that we
have the medical knowledge and the means to make it a thing of the past.  Humanity has been
tormented too much already.

* Just because wikibooks can be edited by anybody, doesn't mean they are.  (The graphs are totally bogus.) by 128.119.165.135
:That disclaimer was definitely a good one. Although the author warns the reader at some points about following conjecture, it feels like most of this book is conjecture, fuzzy logic, and the result of a nonprofessional. The author scolds professionals, as if those who have made a career out of psychology don't know their subject; yet the author himself seems to have little experience. If he could back up his statements by citing his sources, I would be more impressed. -[[User:Monk|Monk]] 05:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== This book is not a good source of information ==
Let me make this clear right now: The majority of this book was written by one person (Name of Feather), a person who is not a professional, has not cited any articles from scientific journals. In fact, his sources are all secondary, and they all suck ([[#invalid_sources|Really, they do]]). '''There is no indication that this guy has any idea what he's talking about'''. He talks big, as if he knows the subject. But where's the proof? This entire book is just one rambling speech after another about what he ''thinks'' depression is. Where is the proof that any of this bull is true? He speaks about all this brain chemistry mumbo-jumbo, and acts as if it instantly means that all his conclusions are accurate. But he backs up almost NONE of his claims with evidence.

Do not listen to this guy. Listening to this guy would be equivalent to taking medical advice about your broken leg from a Janitor who says he took a biology course in high school. Although Name of Feather may act like he knows the subject, it sure as hell seems he doesn't. If he had any actual professional experience, instead of just deciding that he'd go on the internet and spew whatever he decides is right, he'd have evidence and actual statistics, he'd have '''objective evidence''' and not just anecdotes about his own personal version of &quot;the truth&quot; about depression.

If you are depressed, do  not make decisions about what to do off of this book. There's no evidence that the author understands the subject any more than you do. The author just *thinks* they understand the subject, but that doesn't mean anything. Go to an actual doctor, an actual professional; or if you're not into quacks, who have spent years studying this stuff, at least don't listen to this nut who thinks he has &quot;all the answers&quot; because he uses fancy words like &quot;serotonin&quot; and &quot;neurogenesis.&quot; I don't care if he read a news article or two about it. I don't care if he took some course in psychology ten or twenty years ago. You should listen to actual professionals, or to many different people who have had depression. But don't let some stranger from the internet, who has not shown that his ideas are valid in any way, tell you what to do with your life.--[[User:Monk|Monk]] 06:21, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

I agree. I am wondering if large portions of this book need removed until they can be written properly. [[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 08:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I agree, and would have said it if nobody else had.  But in defence of the author, depression is a very individual thing.  I was diagnosed with depression as a child and I am now over 60.  It didn't stop me working.  My story would be very different.  The other day I looked at a book by an English sufferer.  His story was very different again, and just as irrelevant to mine.  Depression is not capable of precise description like a broken leg or an infection.  I have yet to come up with a formal definition of it.

===On the subject of rants===
Hey Monk, before you &quot;contribute&quot; any further, would you mind counting the number of times
that readers are advised to seek professional help if they think they have a depression?
I go as far as advising them to seek a competent professional (i.e. a psychiatrist) instead
of being treated only by their (cheaper) GPs.

That being said, show the advice herein contained to a modern psychiatrist.
They will not disagree with it.
--[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 21:40, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

:'''On the subject of proof, by Monk'''

:You seem to be very confused as to where the burden of proof lies here. It's not my job to disprove the contents of your book to show that the contents are untrustworthy. It's your job to prove the contents of your book to show that they're trustworthy in the first place. You can't just put any content up here and expect everyone to treat it as authoritative and the truth until they can get an expert to vouch against it. You need to back up your statements with proof. Doing that is your job, not mine. If you cannot provide good proof for your scientific statements, you can not expect others to treat anything you say as scientifically reputable.

:Secondly, I don't give a damn if you advise readers to see a professional a hundred times, that doesn't make your knowledge any more professional. You are not qualified to &quot;inform&quot; people about the subject to any degree, because as far as I'm concerned, you may know nothing about it. You may just be making this up. You may just be &quot;remembering it&quot; from some casual chat you had with a few psych doctors months ago, but that means essentially nothing as to qualifications. You have shown NO qualifications to educate others on the subject. Normally, qualifications are irrelevant as long as you can back up your claims with objective evidence, but so far you have not actually backed up your claims with anything but a vague hand-motion to a few mainstream-level science magazines, and some other worthless sources.

:Depression is a sensitive subject. I think I'm justified in warning other people when you go around telling them what to do with their lives without providing any evidence that you know what you're talking about. I don't care if you throw in &quot;Oh, but you should really see a doctor&quot; at the beginning, you're still instructing them on something that you may know nothing about. If you have enough evidence to support the claims you make in this book, that's great, but you have to show that evidence, and it has to be valid evidence. Every claim has to be supported by previously collected data, proof, and scientific papers, rather than be anecdotal.

: Irrelevant of whether the book is designed to appeal to the masses, the information within is of a sensitive scientific subject, and should be scientifically accurate. Like any scientific piece, although it may be up to others to investigate whether your evidence and data is valid and whether it supports or does not support your conclusion (something I have done, and in this case I have found that it's mostly invalid evidence), it's up to you to prove your arguments in the first place. You have failed to do that. If you can not support your claims about depression, you are not qualified to speak on the subject, and you are not qualified to tell people how to live their lives when under such a mentally precarious condition. 

:I don't need to prove you wrong for your claims to be dubious. If you can not prove that you are correct in the first place, your claims are automatically put into doubt. Until you can back your claims up, and ''back them up well'', this book is an unreliable source of information. -[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 20:15, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

&lt;div id='invalid_sources' \&gt;

I am male, and in Australia.  I have had depression for 45 years, but I still don't take an hour and a half to get up in the morning.  I am sure that what Name of Feather has written agrees with his experience, and no doubt, what he has written is what a psychiatrist would say to him.  It is good if it gets men to acknowledge that they can be depressed, too.  But it is not of general application.  On the ordinary Wikipedia, it would be labelled &quot;weasel words&quot; - putting the author's views forward as general knowledge (although I hate the expression itself.)  How does he know that a modern psychiatrist would not disagree with his advice?  Is he a psychiatrist, or so familiar with psychiatric thought generally?  He hasn't quoted the basis of this statement, just as with any of his others.  I have already mentioned one area where I would receive different advice.

What worries me is that advice to wrap oneself in cotton wool, as he recommends, is exactly the wrong treatment for depression.  It depends on the depth of depression involved, and I was lucky enough to keep working.  But so many depressed people are sitting patiently waiting for a cure, and doing nothing with their lives in the meantime.  Depression is an interaction of brain chemistry, circumstances and attitude.  Change any one, and you change the other two.  Although &quot;positive thinking&quot; or &quot;counting our blessings&quot; often achieves nothing against depression, nevertheless attitude is still within our control.  Depression practically wipes me out for about 3 days every month, but like a woman with periods that are just as disabling, I don't let it stop me the rest of the time.  I try to look on it as a disability, rather than an illness.

I find the term &quot;a depression&quot; strange.  I suppose that it is legitimate like &quot;a cancer&quot; or &quot;an AIDS&quot;.  It must be a local thing.  We don't use it here. - [[Douglaid]]

===Sources suck because....===
His sources suck, and here's why -- The author has only supported his statements with the following references:
*created a few haphazard links to a &quot;science news&quot; website, and a page which reprints a &quot;science news&quot; magazine. Where &quot;science news&quot; refers to a magazine that reformats, rewrites, and rewords science knowledge as to make consumable for easy reading by the public.
*created a few links to wikipedia articles
*created a link to a student's assignment at a college (Not an authoritative source in any way!).
*The only possibly valid reference he uses is [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/depression.cfm This NIMH] site, and you would be better off reading that page than this &quot;book&quot;.
This guy only cites one good source, but his book doesn't even reflect the contents of that source. All the other sources are either secondary or meaningless. Looks like he has no idea what he's talking about.

--[[User:Monk|Monk]] 06:36, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

===Exercise only for 'mild' depression?===

My psychiatrist told me that regular aerobic exercise is as good for moderate depression as an SSRI, according to studies.  This book states the
proper role of exercise is much more limited, without seeming to back that
up with proper research.  

[[User:207.34.148.245|207.34.148.245]] 19:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

== Todo ==
*Change the tone of the book, especially the first person perspective.
**Agreed.

== Retitle? ==

I think that a title like ''Introduction to Depression'' would serve this book better and bring it more inline with the textbook nature of wikibooks. What does everyone else think? [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 07:17, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:'''Change Title''' The title ''Introduction to Depression'' is less marketing-pitch and honest. One more vote for this, and I'll move the title if nobody else does. -[[User:Monk|Monk]] 05:41, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== Retitle plus other suggestions ==

Concerning the retitle, that is fine by me!

Some other suggestions (for now):

* I will make proper figures out of the ASCII art.  I know how they should look like, so I should do it.
* Merge parts 1 and 2.

Later on there are other things that could be done:

* Create a section for each of the available treatments (meds, etc)
* Add information on the existing antidepressants (though Wikipedia already has quite a lot)

== New navigation template ==

I created a prototype navigation template and put it on the first two pages of this book. Here it is as an example:

{{User:Triddle/wip|[[Demystifying Depression:Normal Neuron Communication|Normal Neuron Communication]]|[[Demystifying Depression:Introduction|Introduction]]}}

What does everyone else think? [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 20:22, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Template ==

Using a template is a good idea, of course.

About the particular format of the template, I would suggest
that all links use the same font size.  Also, &quot;First Page&quot;
should be renamed &quot;Top&quot;, as that is the standard nomenclature
used by most tools (eg. tex2html).

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 10:21, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Communication between editors ==

I personally find the use of the talk page a very limited
form of communication.  What about creating a mailing list
(a yahoo group or something) for the purpose of synchronising
the editing process?

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 10:23, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Concerning the title ==

Well, I am not adamant about it, but perhaps we should
leave the title as it is.  It has already picked up
some &quot;brand recognition&quot;... :-)

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 10:44, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Namespace ==

Looking at the [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] page, we should move
all pages back to the original &quot;Demystifying Depression/Section Name&quot;.
That is the preferred format for new books.

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 10:54, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:After reading the Naming Conventions page and [[Wikibooks:Hierachy_naming_scheme]] it seems that using : is going to be easier for this project than using /. Why? The | trick will be of great use when creating links to pages inside the book. Quick overview of how links work:

* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; - links to Foo
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo|Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo but displays Bar
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo:Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo:Bar
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo:Bar|Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo:Bar but only displays Bar (note trailing |)
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo/Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo/Bar
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo/Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo/Bar but displays Foo/Bar, can't use trailing /
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foo/Bar|Bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to Foo/Bar but displays Bar

Now think of the difference between 

{{User:Triddle/wip|[[Demystifying Depression:What Is Depression|What Is Depression]]|[[Demystifying Depression]]}}

and

{{User:Triddle/wip|[[Demystifying Depression/What Is Depression|What is depression]]|[[Demystifying Depression]]}}

As well as the other benefits listed by [[Wikibooks:Hierachy_naming_scheme#Real_custom_namespaces]]. It really seems to me that setting this up in its own namespace is the way to go. [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 16:32, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I didn't know it was possible to create custom namespaces.  In that case, it is definately the way to go!
[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 08:53, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Announce book ==

I think it is time to announce the book and add it to the bookshelves, don't you agree?

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 11:03, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I do not agree due to the huge amount of unsupported and perhaps false information.[[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 09:10, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

==Notation fixer==
I ran this program on all the articles to update the old style reference notation. I hope someone else can find it useful in the future. [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 06:56, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Before you make changes... ==

Being a wikibook and all that means that one expects people
to make changes/corrections as they see fit.  However, if not
for anything else at least for the sake of politeness, it
would be very much appreciated if radical changes were first
proposed in this talk page.  (See the history for an example
of what I'm referring to).

Thank you,

[[User:Name of Feather|Name of Feather]] 18:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

Radical changes are however needed to this book please make them.[[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 08:44, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I think some doctor should put some specific counter arguments against some of the specific the book is claiming. I sense that the author of this book deeply believes what he or she wrote, so he or she deserves some scientific arguments.  May be those sections that can not be proved or were just made up should be marked as that are controversial. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 15:24, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

== What should be done with this book? ==

I think that this book needs almost completely rewritten and reorganized as an introduction to depression. Or it needs to be removed from wikibooks.
My reason for this is it contains large amounts of unsighted or original research and information based on individual experience. According to the &quot;What Wikibooks is not&quot; section of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] large parts of this book do not qualify for being part of a Wikibook. At the vary least it needs removed from the completed books book shelf. What are other peoples opinions [[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 09:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I would not remove this book. The claims it is making could be true, based on 'individual experience'.  If scientifically proven that the book claims are incorrect then I would remove it. In the meantime it could be moved to a controversial state. There are some precedence, where 'individual experiences' were strongly rejected and eventually turned out to be true. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 15:40, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

== I'd move to remove... ==

I read this book with some care.  I see very little merit in it and much potential for disseminating misconceptions and unfounded speculation about a very important subject.  Does the nature of wiki mean that we have no reponsibility to try to ensure good quality information?  Despite the caveats, this book is seriously likely to misinform people including sufferers about a potentially very dangerous illness.

== Unfortunately not a 'wikibook' ==

I personally think that this work has its merits in giving a new public perspective (as far as I am aware) on depression. Upon reading the [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]], however, I do not think that it qualifies unless properly cited or founded, as it is certainly not a textbook, rather an interesting essay. Simply put, I do not think that this is the place for the book; but I do think that it should be part of a public reading list somewhere on depression (I assume somewhere on Wiki), if not simply for the debate it causes.

== My editing spree ==

In case any one noticed I went through and just destroyed everything I though was obviously wrong or does not fit the guidelines for what should be on wiki books. I realize this was not the most democratic method but it needed done and I was in the mood. The whole book still need restructured perhaps in the form of three major sections What is Depression, Treatments, Other Issues. It also all needs cited. If disagree with any of my changes feel free to revert. The book is currently a mess with many pages now blank in need of deletion but I could not figure out how to do that so perhaps some one more knowledgeable can help with that. [[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 11:44, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
: I do not agree all the deletions. Deleting something because being in the mood is the definitation of vandalism. I think a warning on the discussion page before deletion is the wiki policy we should follow.  [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 16:20, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

I understand revert anything you feel is actually within the guide lines of things that should be on wiki books. Relize however the most of the information I deleted was in direct confrontation with much higher quality article on wikipedia. It just seemed to me that there had been a consensus for a while for deletion but no one had done anything. [[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 17:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

== If this stays it is certainly inappropriately indexed ==
As a psychiatrist, and a wikipedia member I must say that the inclusion of this book under Health is completely unfair to to people seeking high quality information. It does provide one person's perspective without scientific data or sources, and it may have some value in shedding light on the publics viewpoint. However, this is not a book about Health. At best this should fall under Self-Help or perhaps Editorial. I refrain to get into the argument about whether this should be completely removed or not, but it certainly has no place whatsoever within the category of health.
[[User:Slippy007|Slippy007]] March 30, 2007

I personally feel that this book had some good information before it was mostly all deleted by Lonjers.  However, if the requirements for inclusion here are the same as Wikipedia, than original research is not welcome and thus this book should be outright deleted.  I don't know why it hasn't been put up for deletion given the general consensus.  However, there is a [[Wikibooks:Deletion_policy|deletion policy]] in effect here.  As I do not believe it should be deleted I'm not going to put it up myself, but there you have it. [[User:Spoom|Spoom]] ([[User talk:Spoom|talk]]) 18:17, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

== I am depressed and THIS IS THE BEST PIECE OF INFORMATION I FOUND ==

I am depressed for years. Due to traumas and ongoing personal issues... I am educated person and read everything I could find about depresion ... I am went to therapy - 8 different highly qualified medical professionals and 2 MD who gave me meds. Results? -traditional medical community has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING USEFULL for me. I just learn to copy not to recover.
So I think they should even post here.

== The Controversy about Antidepressants ==

This is largely country-dependent: in some countries their use is widespread and generates little
discussion; in others, many factors contribute to making them practically taboo words.  The country
where I live, the Netherlands, tends towards the taboo end of the spectrum.  The reason has a lot
to do with the prevalent (and backwards if you ask me) Calvinist mentality.  I know that in
other places, such as most of North America and Southern Europe they are much more readily
accepted.  Your mileage may vary.

The controversy is typically framed in the following ways: doctors nowadays over-prescribe
antidepressants, instead of following the psychotherapy route; antidepressants are just
a ploy from the evil pharmaceutical multinationals; our societies are drifting towards
a &quot;Brave New World&quot; scenario where drugs are used to keep the populace happy and unable
to rebel.  Well, my personal opinion is that there is some substance to some of these
worries, but they are largely exaggerated and fail to acknowledge one very important
fact: antidepressants are very effective in treating clinical depression.  This is not
a matter of opinion: it has been demonstrated in several double-blind clinical trials.

First, on the issue of over-prescription.  I would say that they are both over-prescribed
and under-prescribed.  The problem is that most doctors do not understand depression well,
and will prescribe drugs to people whose brains are healthy, and fail to provide them
to people who could actually benefit from them.  Take people who are mourning, for example.
In most cases, these people do not have a depression.  Grief is something perfectly normal,
and its onset is all too sudden to cause a depression (remember that a depression typically
takes ''years'' to develop).  Likewise, consider giving antidepressants to very young
people: the brain of a child or even a teenager has such a fantastic ability to repair
itself that it takes quite a pounding for a depression to develop.  In these cases,
antidepressants and all their unavoidable side effects are more likely to hurt than to help.
On the other hand, there are people who have minor problems with stress and anxiety,
or whose blood pressure is above normal for no apparent reason.  They are often simply
told that they should watch out for salt in their diets, or to take up yoga or meditation.
This advice might help, but only to a certain degree.  I suspect that a course of an
antidepressant would have a stronger and more lasting effect.

Moving on to the subject of side-effects.  Modern antidepressants are generally well-tolerated
and safe to use.  They do have side-effects, which depending on the drug and the person can
be significant enough that people discontinue taking the medication.  However, this is yet
another issue where proper handling by a competent professional will make a huge difference.
What one often finds is that people are given the wrong drug for their case.  Imagine for example
an overweight patient being given an antidepressant which increases appetite, or someone
who has a satisfactory sex life and is given a drug which upsets their libido.
What is required is matching the profile of the patient with the expected side-effects of
the drug.  Granted, there is plenty of variation among individuals, but the overall
pattern is still strong enough that we can categorically say what will be the most likely
side-effects of a given antidepressant.  A straightforward discussion with a good professional
will go a long way towards finding a drug tuned to your particular case, thus minimising
the negative side-effects and decreasing the chances of premature discontinuation.

Finally on to the subject of psychotherapy.  As someone who had a depression, I can assure
you that there is nothing more patronising and irritating than people who bring up
the &quot;psychological help&quot;.  A depressed person will definitely need professional help,
but mostly for a proper explanation of the problem, to learn relaxation techniques,
to know how to listen to their bodies, and to be coached in the lifestyle changes
required for giving their brains a chance to recover.
Once they are recovered, perhaps some therapy might be needed to make sure
that whatever behavioural patterns which contributed to the development of the illness
will not recur.  However, and I cannot stress this enough, therapy is not a
substitute for medication, and &quot;psychological help&quot; is a misunderstanding.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Harðor. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Harðor~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Slicker? ==

:&quot;While KDE's interface is normally considered slicker and more polished to that of GNOME possibly due to the underlying Qt toolkit, GTK is a very popular toolkit for Linux and so most apps have better integration with GNOME.&quot;
Hmmm... how can we say this in a less-biased way? --[[User:Jcarroll|Jcarroll]] 05:18, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

== Task Bar ==

:&quot;GNOME takes the Mac OS X approach, placing the task bar on top of the screen and a separate bar for currently-open applications (the Task Bar).&quot;

Isn't this is entirely under the control of the user?  I'm pretty sure that it is, since I've configured my gnome/ubuntu install to have a single combined windows-style task bar at the bottom of the screen.</text>

== Panoramic Renderings ==

=== This Article is Out Of Date ===

Panoramic features were changed somewhere between 2.37a and 2.42. More information, including how to actually use panorama, can be found in this thread in the forums: http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?p=797886

=== Building the Example Scene ===

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaA.png|thumb|300px|right|The example scene, see from above]]

Ever wondered how that cool looking 360 degree panoramas that you see on some websites are made?  Well, I don't know either, so someone else will have to tell about that. What I found out though is how to make Blender output a 360 degree panoramic image - quite probably this at least is the first step when making something like on those websites.

Now, let's try to progress like in a tutorial, as in the other pages of this Wikibook. So, fire up Blender, and look at the well known initial box scene. Or rather, change it somehow. Assuming you have read the book in order, it shouldn't be hard to get something like in the picture.

{{clr}}

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaB.png|thumb|300px|right|The example camera, seen from the side]]

I placed the camera and the light both above the origin, deleted the cube, and added 8 cylinders, all around the origin. One way to do this is to place one cylinder, then duplicate and rotate it around the origin. For this to work, set the rotation center to the 3D-cursor (with the Pivot button), and position the 3D cursor at the origin (use '''SHIFT+S''' to make the 3D cursor snap to the grid).Place the first cylinder using '''GKEY''' and then holding '''CTRL''' while moving the mouse. Change to object mode, then use '''SHIFT+D''' to duplicate it. Next, press '''RKEY''' to rotate it, then hold '''CTRL''' while rotating it by 45 degrees. Repeat the same for the remaining cylinders. Use '''G''' to move the light. Use '''NKEY''' to enter the camera values like shown, so it looks parallel to the ground.

{{clr}}

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaC.png|thumb|300px|right|The complete scene with a ground cylinder]]

Speaking of ground, lets also add a ground. I added another cylinder, below the other ones, as shown. It's easy to add by switching to front view ('''NUM1'''), duplicating a cylinder ('''SHIFT+DKEY'''), and then moving it holding '''CTRL''' pressed again, so it snaps to the grid. To scale it, use the '''SKEY''' , but hit '''SHIFT+ZKEY''' to lock the z scaling, and hold '''CTRL''' pressed while scaling in x and y direction so you can snap to the exact size you want.

Now, to have a complete scene, we need some colors. I made the ground cylinder green, the 8 example cylinders gray, and also added a noise normal to the ground. This doesn't really matter here though, just needed some example scene for the 360° camera.

{{clr}}

Something more interesting is the sky texture, because Blender's sky can be made to seamlessly wrap around with 360 degree. Belows is a screenshot of the sky settings I used. To get there, click on the Shading button, then select World.

[[Image:BlenderButtonsShadingWorld.png|The Shading-&gt;World Button]]

To change the texture, click the textures button or press '''F6''', then add a new texture with the small button with two arrows, and select the type (e.g. &quot;Marble&quot; or &quot;Clouds&quot;) instead of &quot;None&quot; for the texture. Go back to the World pane, and enable the Real and Blend buttons. And don't forget to use nice colors, I used blue and white. Now it looks a bit like white clouds in a blue sky.

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaD.png|The example sky]]

[Maybe should add here more details? What is important so you don't get a seam at the 0 - 360 degree point? How do you map pre-made sky textures?]

And we are already done, this is the example scene. All that is left to do is to render it as a panorama.

{{clr}}

=== Panoramic Rendering ===

Go to the render settings ('''F10'''), and click the Pano button. Change the Xparts value to 4. The value in Xparts will tell how many times the camera will 'turn' horizontally when rendering. The Yparts value would do the same vertically. Each part (Xparts or Yparts) will render the size of the whole image you set. To make things easier, make the output image size quadratic and set both X and Y Aspect to 100. E.g. make your image size 600x600, but not 800x600, otherwise the following will not work.

[[Image:BlenderCameraSettings.png|right|The camera settings]]

If you want a seemless 360 degree view, it is important to know how many degrees one single image spans. For example, if you know one image is 90 degree, then you can set Xparts to 4, and the result will be a single panoramic picture, and with the right panorama viewer, you can spin around in it endlessly.

But, how do you make a single picture 90 degree? The angle a picture spans is called field of view (FOV). And it is a property of the camera. To change it, select your camera, then click the edit button (or hit '''F9'''). Make sure you haven't set your camera to orthographic (the &quot;Ortho&quot; button), since FOV only exists with a normal camera.

You can directly enter the FOV in Blender's camera settings (as of version 2.42) - Toggle the 'D' button on, next to the parameter called '''Lens'''. Type in 90 to get a 90 degree FOV. Now hit '''F12''' to render our test image.

If you want, you can also try it out with any other scene. Place the camera somewhere in the middle with a good view all around, set the camera's '''Lens''' to 90, and go into the render settings ('''F10'''). Set '''Xparts''' to 4, enable '''Pano''', and render. You should get an image 4 times as wide as a normal image, and the left and right edges should fit together seemlessly. Also note that Blender doesn't know if it should apply the FOV as horizontal or vertical viewing angle, but we always want it to be the horizontal angle. Therefore just make the single images of the panorama quadratic, as mentioned above - then horizontal and vertical FOV is the same and Blender gets it right.

This is the resulting panoramic image:

[[Image:BlenderPanoramaE.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Panorama with 4 parts.]]

'''Warning: Didn't convert following lens settings to the new possibility with the 'D'-button for passing the FOV value directly.'''
One problem remains, the image will be quite distorted. This is because a FOV of 90 degree is too high. Let's try with 45 degree and 8 XParts instead. As you will have noticed when playing around with the Lens parameter before, setting Lens to 8 instead of 16 will not achieve this, it will make the FOV even bigger. Setting it to 32 looks better, but definitely is not 45 degree. The picture to the right explains how FOV and Lens relate to each other:

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LensAndFOV.png|thumb|150px|right|The '''Lens''' parameter of the Blender camera.]] --&gt;

The camera is at the bottom, the red angle is our desired FOV, and the length of the green line is what the Lens parameter represents in Blender. Therefore, the formula to calulcate Lens when we know FOV:

:&lt;b&gt;Lens&lt;/b&gt; = 16 / tan(&lt;b&gt;FOV&lt;/b&gt; / 2)

For a FOV of 45 degree, we therefore get a Lens of 38.627. Now, write that into the Lens field in the camera settings, and render with 8 XParts. This time it will render an output image which is 8 times as wide as a normal output image, and again it will be a seamless 360 degree all around panorama of your scene. And this time with less distortion. With the above formula, you can now use any number of XParts you want - just divide 360 by the number of parts, and calculate the Lens parameter for the resulting FOV. Note that you also need to take the Aspect settings into account, unless you set it to 100 and create a quadratic output, as we did.

Some Lens settings:

* 4 parts: 16
* 8 parts: 38.627
* 16 parts: 80.437

The output with 8 parts can be seen below.

==Overview of Blood==
The primary function of blood is to supply oxygen and nutrients as well as constitutional elements to tissues and to remove waste products. Blood also enables hormones and other substances to be transported between tissues and organs. Problems with blood composition or circulation can lead to downstream tissue malfunction. Blood is also involved in maintaining homeostasis by acting as a medium for transferring heat to the skin and by acting as a buffer system for bodily pH.

The blood is circulated through the lungs and body by the pumping action of the heart. The right ventricle pressurizes the blood to send it through the capillaries of the lungs, while the left ventricle re-pressurizes the blood to send it throughout the body. Pressure is essentially lost in the capillaries, hence gravity and especially the actions of skeletal muscles are needed to return the blood to the heart.

[[Image:Heart-and-lungs.jpg‎|thumb|right|Blood circulation from the heart to the lungs.]]
===Gas Exchange===
'''Oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''' is the most immediate need of every cell and is carried throughout the body by the blood circulation.  Oxygen is used at the cellular level as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain (the primary method of generating ATP for cellular reactions). Oxygen is carried in the blood bound to hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells. Hemoglobin binds oxygen when passing through the alveoli of the lungs and releases oxygen in the warmer, more acidic environment of bodily tissues, via simple diffusion.

'''Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''' is removed from tissues by blood and released into the air via the lungs. Carbon dioxide is produced by cells as they undergo the processes of cellular respiration (particularly the Kreb's Cycle). The molecules are produced from carbons that were originally part of glucose. Most of the carbon dioxide combines with water and is carried in the plasma as bicarbonate ions. An excess of carbon dioxide (through exercise, or from holding ones breath) quickly shifts the blood pH to being more acidic (acidosis). Chemoreceptors in the brain and major blood vessels detect this shift and stimulate the breathing center of the brain (the medulla oblongata). Hence, as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels build up and the blood becomes more acidic, we involuntarily breathe faster, thus lowering CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels and stabilizing blood pH. In contrast, a person who is hyperventilating (such as during a panic attack) will expire more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than being produced in the body and the blood will become too alkaline (alkalosis).

==Blood Composition==

'''Blood''' is a circulating tissue composed of fluid plasma and cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets). Anatomically, blood is considered a connective tissue, due to its origin in the bones and its function. ''Blood'' is the means and transport system of the body used in carrying elements (e.g. nutrition, waste, heat) from one location in the body to another, by way of blood vessels. 


Blood is made of two parts:

# Plasma which makes up 55% of blood volume.
# Formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells, and platelets) which combine to make the remaining 45% of blood volume. 

===Plasma makeup===
'''Plasma''' is made up of 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains bloods osmotic integrity, others clot, etc), 1% carbon-dioxide, and 1% elements in transit. One percent of the plasma is salt, which helps with the pH of the blood.  The largest group of solutes in plasma contains three important proteins to be discussed.  There are: ''albumins'', ''globulins'', and ''clotting proteins''.

''Albumins'' are the most common group of proteins in plasma and consist of nearly two-thirds of them (60-80%).  They are produced in the liver.  The main function of albumins is to maintain the osmotic balance between the blood and tissue fluids and is called ''colloid osmotic pressure''.  In addition, albumins assist in transport of different materials, such as vitamins and certain molecules and drugs (e.g. bilirubin, fatty acids, and penicillin).

''Globulins'' are a diverse group of proteins, designated into three groups:  gamma, alpha, and beta.  Their main function is to transport various substances in the blood.  Gamma globulins assist the body's immune system in defense against infections and illness. 

''Clotting proteins'' are mainly produced in the liver as well.  There are at least 12 substances, known as &quot;clotting factors&quot; that participate in the clotting process.  One important clotting protein that is part of this group is ''fibrinogen'', one of the main components in the formation of blood clots.  In response to tissue damage, fibrinogen makes fibrin threads, which serve as adhesive in binding platelets, red blood cells, and other molecules together, to stop the blood flow.  (This will be discussed in more detail later on in the chapter.)

''Plasma'' also carries Respiratory gases; CO2 in large amounts(about 97%) and O2 in small amounts(about 3%), various nutrients(glucose, fats), wastes of metabolic exchange(urea, ammonia), hormones, and vitamins.

===Red Blood Cells===


====Overview====

'''Red blood cell (erythrocyte)''' also known as &quot;RBCs&quot;. RBCs are formed in the '''myeloid tissue''' or most commonly known as red bone marrow, although when the body is under severe conditions the yellow bone marrow, which is also in the fatty places of the marrow in the body will also make RBCs. The formation of RBCs is called '''erythropoiesis''' ( ''erythro / red; poiesis /'' ''formation''). Red blood cells lose nuclei upon maturation, and take on a biconcave, dimpled, shape. They are about 7-8 micrometers in diameter. There are about 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells. RBCs live about 120 days and do not self repair. RBCs contain hemoglobin which  transports oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, such as to the muscles, where it releases the oxygen load.The hemoglobin gets its red color from their respiratory pigments.


'''Shape'''

RBCS have a shape of a disk that appears to be “caved in” or almost flattened in the middle; this is called ''bi-concave''.  This bi-concave shape allows the RBC to carry oxygen and pass through even the smallest capillaries in the lungs. This shape also allows RBCs to stack like dinner plates and bend as they flow smoothly through the narrow blood vessels in the body. RBCs lack a nucleus (no DNA) and no organelles, meaning that these cells cannot divide or replicate themselves like the cells in our skin and muscles. RBCs have a short life span of about 120 days, however, as long as our myeloid tissue is working correctly, we will produce about 2-3 million RBCs per second. That is about 200 billion a day! This allows us to have more to replace the ones we lose. 


'''Main Component'''

The main component of the RBC is '''hemoglobin''' protein, of which there are about 250 million per cell. The word hemoglobin comes from &quot;hemo&quot; meaning blood and &quot;globin&quot; meaning protein. Hemoglobin is composed of four protein subunits: polypeptide globin chains that contain anywhere from 141 to 146 amino acids. Hemoglobin is responsible for the cell’s ability to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin, iron, and oxygen interact with each other, forming the RBCs' bright red color. You can call this interaction by product '''oxyhemoglobin'''. Carbon Monoxide binds with hemoglobin faster than oxygen, and stays bound for several hours, making hemoglobin temporarily unavailable for oxygen transport. One red blood cell contains about 200 million hemoglobin molecules. If all this hemoglobin was in the plasma rather than inside the cells, blood would be so &quot;thick&quot; that the heart would have a difficult time pumping it through. The thickness of blood is called viscosity. The greater the viscosity of blood, the more friction there is, and more pressure is needed to force blood through.

====Functions====
The main function is the transportation of oxygen throughout the body and the ability of the blood to carry out carbon dioxide which is called '''carbamino – hemoglobin'''. Maintaining the balance of blood is important. The balance can be measured by the acid and base levels in the blood. This is called '''pH'''. Normal pH of blood ranges between 7.35-7.45; this normal blood is called '''Alkaline''' (less acidic then water). A drop in pH is called '''Acidic'''. This condition is also called '''Acidosis'''. A jump in pH higher then 7.45 is called &quot;'''Alkalosis'''&quot;. To maintain the homeostasis (or balance,) the blood has tiny molecules within the RBC that help prevent drops or increases from happening.

[[Image:Red White Blood cells.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right diagram of '''Erythrocyte, Thrombocyte, and Leukocyte]]

'''Destruction'''

Red blood cells are broken down and hemoglobin is released. The globin part of the hemoglobin is broken down into amino acid components, which in turn are recycled by the body. The iron is recovered and returned to the bone marrow to be reused. The heme portion of the molecule experiences a chemical change and then gets excreted as bile pigment (bilirubin) by the liver. Heme portion after being broken down contributes to the color of feces and your skin color changing after being bruised.

===White Blood Cells===

'''Shape'''

White blood cells are different from red cells in the fact that they are usually larger in size 10-14 micrometers in diameter. White blood cells do not contain hemoglobin which in turn makes them translucent. Many times in diagrams or pictures white blood cells are represented in a blue color, mainly because blue is the color of the stain used to see the cells. White blood cells also have nucleii, that are some what segmented and are surrounded by electrons inside the membrane.

====Functions====

'''White blood cells (leukocytes)''' are also known as &quot;WBC's&quot;. White blood cells are made in the bone marrow but they also divide in the blood and lymphatic systems. They are commonly amoeboid (cells that move or feed by means of temporary projections, called pseudopods (false feet), and escape the circulatory system through the capillary beds. The different types of WBC's are '''Basophils''', '''Eosinophils''', '''Neutrophils''', '''Monocytes''', '''B-''' and '''T-cell lymphocytes'''. Neutrophils, Eosinophils, and Basophils are all '''granular''' leukocytes. Lymphocytes and Monocytes are '''agranular''' leukocytes.  Basophils store and synthesize histamine which is important in allergic reactions.  They enter the tissues and become &quot;mast cells&quot; which help blood flow to injured tissues by the release of histamine. Eosinophils are chemotoxic and kill parasites. Neutrophils are the first to act when there is an infection and are also the most abundant white blood cells. Neutrophils fight bacteria and viruses by ''phagocytosis'' which mean they engulf pathogens that may cause infection. The life span of a of Neutrophil is only about 12-48 hours. Monocytes are the biggest of the white blood cells and are responsible for rallying the cells to defend the body. Monocytes carry out phagocytosis and are also called macrophages. Lymphocytes help with our immune response. There are two Lymphocytes: the B- and T- cell. B-Lymphocytes produce antibodies that find and mark pathogens for destruction. T-Lymphocytes kill anything that they deem abnormal to the body.

WBCs are classified by phenotype which can be identified by looking at the WBCs under a microscope. The Granular phenotype  are able to stain blue. The Agranular phenotype are able to stain red. Neutrophils make up 50-70% of Granular cells Eosinophils make up 2-4%, and Basophils 0-1%. Monocytes make up 2-8% of Agranular cells. B and T Lymphocytes make up 20-30%.   As you can see, there is a great deal of differentiation between WBCs. These special cells help our bodies defend themselves against pathogens. Not only do they help our immune system but they remove toxins, wastes, and abnormal or damaged cells. Thus, we can say that WBCs' main function is being Phagocytic which means to engulf or swallow cells.

===Platelets===
[[Image:Platelet blood bag.jpg|thumb|150px|A 250 ml bag of newly collected platelets.]]
Platelets, also called thrombocytes, are membrane-bound cell fragments. Platelets have no nucleus, they  are between one to two  micrometers in diameter, and are about 1/10th to 1/20th as abundant as white blood cells. Less than 1% of whole blood consists of platelets. They result from fragmentation of large cells called Megakaryocytes - which are cells derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. Platelets are produced at a rate of 200 billion per day. Their production is regulated by the hormone called Thrombopoietin. The circulating life of a platelet is 8–10 days. The sticky surface of the platelets allow them to accumulate at the site of broken blood vessels to form a clot.  This aids in the process of hemostasis (&quot;blood stopping&quot;).  Platelets secrete factors that increase local platelet aggregation (e.g., Thromboxane A), enhance vasoconstriction (e.g., Serotonin), and promote blood coagulation (e.g., Thromboplastin).

==Hemostasis (Coagulation or Clotting)==

Hemostasis is the natural process of stopping blood flow or loss of blood following an injury. (''hemo'' = blood; ''stasis'' = standing). It has three stages: (1) vascular spasm, vasoconstriction, or intense contraction of blood vessels, (2) formation of a platelet plug and (3) blood clotting or coagulation. Once the flow of blood has been stopped, tissue repair can begin. 

'''Vascular spasm or Vasoconsriction:'''
In a normal individual, immediately after a blood vessel has been cut and endothelial cells are damaged, vasoconstriction occurs, thus slowing blood flow to the area. Smooth muscle in the vessel wall goes through spasms or intense contractions that constrict the vessel. If the vessels are small, spasms compress the inner walls together and may be able to stop the bleeding completely. If the vessels are medium to large-sized, the spasms slow down immediate outflow of blood, lessening the damage but still preparing the vessel for the later steps of hemostasis. These vascular spasms usually last for about 30 minutes, long enough for the next two stages of hemostasis to take place.

'''Formation of a Platelet Plug:'''
Within 20 seconds of an injury, coagulation is initiated. Contrary to popular belief, clotting of a cut on the skin is not initiated by air or drying out, but by platelets adhering to and activated by collagen in the blood vessels endothelium. The activated platelets then release the contents of their granules, which contain a variety of substances that stimulate further platelet activation and enhance the hemostatic process. 

When the lining of a blood vessel breaks and endothelial cells are damaged, revealing collagen proteins in the vessel wall, platelets swell, grow spiky extensions, and start clumping together. They start to stick to each other and the walls of the vessel. This continues as more platelets congregate and undergo these same transformations. This process results in a platelet plug that seals the injured area. If the injury is small, a platelet plug may be able to form and close it within several seconds. If the damage is more serious, the next step of blood clotting will take place. Platelets contain secretory granules. When they stick to the proteins in the vessel walls, they ''degranulate'', thus releasing their products, which include ADP (adenosine diphosphate), serotonin, and thromboxane A2. 

'''A Blood Clot Forms:'''
If the platelet plug is not enough to stop the bleeding, the third stage of hemostasis begins: the formation of a blood clot. First, blood changes from a liquid to a gel. At least 12 substances called ''clotting factors'' take part in a series of chemical reactions that eventually create a mesh of protein fibers within the blood. Each of the ''clotting factors'' has a very specific function. We will discuss just three of the substances here: prothrombin, thrombin, and fibrin. Prothrombin and fibrinogen are proteins that are produced and deposited in the blood by the liver. 

*''Prothrombin'': When blood vessels are damaged, vessels and nearby platelets are stimulated to release a substance called ''prothrombin activator'', which in turn activates the conversion of ''prothrombin'', a plasma protein, into an enzyme called ''thrombin''. This reaction requires calcium ions. 

*''Thrombin'': ''Thrombin'' facilitates the conversion of a soluble plasma protein called ''fibrinogen'' into long insoluble fibers or threads of the protein ''fibrin''.

*''Fibrin'': Fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to form its active form, &quot;fibrin.&quot;  Fibrin threads wind around the platelet plug at the damaged area of the blood vessel, forming an interlocking network of fibers and a framework for the clot. This net of fibers traps and helps hold platelets, blood cells and other molecules tight to the site of injury, functioning as the initial clot. This temporary fibrin clot can form in less than a minute, and usually does a good job of reducing the blood flow. Next, platelets in the clot begin to shrink, tightening the clot and drawing together the vessel walls. Usually, this whole process of clot formation and tightening takes less than a half hour.

The use of adsorbent chemicals, such as zeolites, and other hemostatic agents, are also being explored for use in sealing severe injuries quickly.

==ABO Group System==

The '''ABO blood group''' is represented by substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). These substances are important because they contain specific sequences of amino acid and carbohydrates which are antigenic. As well as being on the surface of RBCs, some of these antigens are also present on the cells of other tissues. A complete blood type describes the set of 29 substances on the surface of RBCs, and an individual's blood type is one of the many possible combinations of blood group antigens.  Usually only the ABO blood group system and the presence or absence of the Rhesus D antigen (also known as the Rhesus factor or RH factor) are determined and used to describe the blood type. Over 400 different blood group antigens have been found, many of these being very rare. If an individual is exposed to a blood group antigen that is not recognized as self, the individual can become sensitized to that antigen; the immune system makes specific antibodies which binds specifically to a particular blood group antigen and an immunological memory against that particular antigen is formed. These antibodies can bind to antigens on the surface of transfused red blood cells (or other tissue cells) often leading to destruction of the cells by recruitment of other components of the immune system. Knowledge of a individual's blood type is important to identify appropriate blood for transfusion or tissue for organ transplantation.

===Surface Antigens===
 
Several different RBC surface antigens stemming from one allele (or very closely linked genes) are collectively labeled as a blood group system (or blood group). The two most important blood group systems were discovered during early experiments with blood transfusion, the ABO group in 1901 and the Rhesus group in 1937 . These two blood groups are reflected in the common nomenclature A positive, O negative, etc. with letters referring to the ABO group and positive/negative to the presence/absence of the RhD antigen of the Rhesus group. Development of the Coombs test in 1945 and the advent of transfusion medicine led to discovery of more blood groups. 
 
[[Image:Blood_Compatibility.svg‎|thumb|right|Compatibility of blood types.]]

'''Blood Group AB''' individuals have both A and B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their blood serum does not contain any antibodies against either A or B antigen. Therefore, a individual with type AB blood can receive blood from any group (with AB being preferable), but can only donate blood to another group AB individual. AB blood is also known as &quot;Universal receiver.&quot; 

'''Blood Group A''' individuals have the A antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the B antigen. Therefore, a group A individual can only receive blood from individuals of groups A or O (with A being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals of groups A or AB. 

'''Blood Group B''' individuals have the B antigen on their surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the A antigen. Therefore, a group B individual can only receive blood from individuals of groups B or O (with B being preferabe), and can donate blood to individuals of groups B or AB. 

'''Blood group O''' individuals do not have either A or B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, but their blood serum contains IgM antibodies against both A and B antigens. Therefore, a group O individual can only receive blood from a group O individual, but they can donate blood to individuals of any ABO blood group (ie A, B, O or AB). O blood is also know as &quot;Universal donor.&quot;

===Inheritance===

Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene with three alleles: i, IA, and IB. The gene encodes an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. 

IA gives type A,
IB gives type B,
i give types O

IA and IB are dominant over i, so ii people have type O, IAIA or IAi have A, and IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes because A and B  are codominant, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. Thus, it is extremely unlikely for a type AB parent to have a type O child (it is not, however, direct proof of illegitimacy): the cis-AB phenotype has a single enzyme that creates both A and B antigens. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group.

'''Rh Factor'''

Many people have the Rh Factor on the red blood cell. Rh carriers do not have the antibodies for the Rh Factor, but can make them if exposed to Rh. Most commonly Rh is seen when anti-Rh antibodies cross from the mothers placenta into the child before birth. The Rh Factor enters the child destroying the child's red blood cells. This is called Hemolytic Disease.

===Compatibility in Blood/Plasma Transfusions ===

Blood transfusions between donor and recipient of incompatible blood types can cause severe acute immunological reactions, hemolysis (RBCT destruction), renal failure, shock, and sometimes death. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the complement system to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.

A patient should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a transfusion reaction. If time allows, the risk will further be reduced by cross-matching blood, in addition to blood typing both recipient and donor. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's blood with a sample of the donor's blood and checking to see if the mixture agglutinates, or forms clumps. Blood bank technicians usually check for agglutination with a microscope, and if it occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient. Blood transfusion is a potentially risky medical procedure and it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so in cross-matching labeling is standardized using a barcode system known as ISBT 128.

When considering a plasma transfusion, keep in mind that plasma carries antibodies and no antigens. For example you can't give type O plasma to a type A, B or AB, because a person with type O blood has A and B antibodies and the recipient would have an immune response. On the other hand an AB donor could give plasma to anyone, since they have no antibodies.

The table to the right is for plasma transfusions, and it's just the opposite for RBC transfusions. It doesn't take the Rh factor into effect, though, because most people don't have antibodies for the Rhesus factor (it only happens upon exposure).


====Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn====

Often a pregnant woman carries a fetus with a different blood type to herself, and sometimes the mother forms antibodies against the red blood cells of the fetus, leading to low fetal blood counts, a condition known as hemolytic disease of the newborn.

Hemolytic disease of the newborn, (also known as HDN) is an alloimmune condition that develops in a fetus when the IgG antibodies produced by the mother and passing through the placenta include ones which attack the red blood cells in the fetal circulation. The red cells are broken down and the fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anemia. The fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe and fetal death from heart failure - hydrops fetalis - can occur. When the disease is moderate or severe many erythroblasts are present in the fetal blood and so these forms of the disease can be called erythroblastosis fetalis.

Before birth, options for treatment include intrauterine transfusion or early induction of labor when pulmonary maturity has been attained, fetal distress is present, or 35 to 37 weeks of gestation have passed. The mother may also undergo plasma exchange to reduce the circulating levels of antibody by as much as 75%.

After birth, treatment depends on the severity of the condition, but could include temperature stabilization and monitoring, phototherapy, transfusion with compatible packed red blood, exchange transfusion with a blood type compatible with both the infant and the mother, sodium bicarbonate for correction of acidosis and/or assisted ventilation.

Rh negative mothers who have had a pregnancy with or are pregnant with a Rh positive infant, are given Rh immune globulin (RhIG) also known as Rhogam, during pregnancy and after delivery to prevent sensitization to the D antigen. It works by binding any fetal red cells with the D antigen before the mother is able to produce an immune response and form anti-D IgG. A drawback to pre-partum administration of RhIG is that it causes a positive antibody screen when the mother is tested which is indistinguishable from immune reasons for antibody production.

==Diseases of the Blood==
===Von Willebrand Disease===

The most common inherited bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease affects both men and women equally.  Von Willebrand disease is similar to hemophilia in that it involves a definciency in the ability of blood to clot properly.  Those affect by von Willebrand disease will have one or more of the following- low levels of von Willebrand factor (a protein that helps the blood to clot), and/or their von Willebrand factor doesn't work properly.  While it is mostly an inherited disease (with factors contributed by both parents), von Willebrand disease may be an aquired syndrome in rare cases. 

There are three types of von Willebrand disease: Type 1, which is the mildest and most common form of the disease; Type 2, which has four subtypes (2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N) and ranges from mild to moderate in severity; and finally, Type 3, which is very rare and is the most severe form.

;Type 1:
In type 1 von Willebrand disease, there is a low level of von Willebrand factor. The level of factor VIII may also be lower than normal. This is the mildest and most common form of the disease. About 3 out of 4 people diagnosed with von Willebrand disease have type 1. 

;Type 2:
In type 2 von Willebrand disease, a defect in von Willebrand factor causes it to not work properly. Type 2 is divided into 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N. Each is treated differently, so knowing the exact type is important.

People with type 1 and type 2 von Willebrand disease may have the following mild-to-moderate bleeding symptoms: easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums after a dental procedure, heavy menstrual bleeding in women, blood in their stools or urine (from bleeding in the intestines, stomach, kidneys or bladder), excessive bleeding after a cut or other accident or surgery.

;Type 3:
People with type 3 von Willebrand disease usually have no von Willebrand factor and very low factor VIII. Type 3 is severe and very rare.

Symptoms of type 3 von Willebrand disease might include any of the symptoms of types 1 and 2, and also include severe bleeding episodes for no reason, which can be life threatening if not treated immediately. Bleeding into soft tissues or joints (hemarthrosis), causing severe pain and swelling, is another symptom.

;Treatment:

Many people with von Willebrand disease do not require treatment to manage the disease.  However, if treatment is ncessary, it may include a range of different interventions depending on the severity.  These involve medicine to increase the level of von Willebrand factor in the blood (DDAVP), medicine to prevent the breakdown of clots (called antifibrinolytic drugs), medicine to control heavy menstrual bleeding in women (often birth control pills), or injection of clotting factor concentrates (containing von Willebrand factor and factor VIII).

===Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation===

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), also called consumptive coagulopathy, is a pathological process in the body where the blood starts to coagulate throughout the whole body. This depletes the body of its platelets and coagulation factors, and there is a paradoxically increased risk of hemorrhage. It occurs in critically ill patients, especially those with Gram-negative sepsis (particularly meningococcal sepsis) and acute promyelocytic leukemia.

===Hemophilia===

Hemophilia is a disease where there is low or no blood protein, causing an inability to produce blood clots. There are two types of Hemophilia: Type A, which is a deficiency in factor VIII and Type B, (Christmas disease) a deficiency on factor IX. Because people with hemophilia have an impaired ability to make blood clots, even a little cut may take hours or days to fully clot, and a small bump or jar to the body could cause severe bruising that doesn't heal for months. Internal muscle bleeds are the most common symptom though, causing swelling and varying degrees of pain. 

Hemophilia is passed down from mothers to their sons.  Hemophilia is sometimes known as the &quot;Royal Disease&quot;. This is because Queen Victoria, Queen of England (1837-1901), was a carrier of hemophilia. The hemophilia disease was passed down to her son Leopold who ended up dying at age 31. Queen Victoria also had two daughters who were carriers. These daughters passed hemophilia into the Spanish, German, and Russian royal families. One of the most famous stories is that of the Russian royal family. Alexandra, granddaughter to Queen Victoria, married Nicholas (Tsar of Russia in the 1900s). Alexandra was a carrier of the disease and passed the disease to their first son, Tsarevich Alexi, who was heir to the throne of Russia. The family tried to keep their son's secret from the people, but Alexi suffered with serious bruises and extreme pain. The family found help from a monk named Rasputin.  He kept their secret and gained a great deal of power over the family, making them think he was their only hope. During this time of great turmoil in Russia,  Nicholas and Alexandra spent most of their attentions on their son, and not on the people. It wasn't long before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 began.

===Factor V Leiden===

The opposite of Hemophilia, Factor V Leiden is the name given to a variant of human factor V that causes a hypercoagulability disorder. In this disorder the Leiden variant of factor V, cannot be inactivated by activated protein C. Factor V Leiden is the most common hereditary hypercoagulability disorder amongst Eurasians. It is named after the city Leiden (The Netherlands), where it was first identified in 1994 by Prof R. Bertina et al.  Those that have it are at a slightly higher risk of developing blood clots than those without.  Those that test positive for factor V should avoid (oral contraceptives, obesity, smoking, and high blood pressure.)

===Anemia===

Anemia (AmE) or anaemia (BrE), from the Greek (Ἀναιμία) meaning &quot;without blood&quot;, refers to a deficiency of red blood cells (RBCs) and/or hemoglobin. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the tissues, causing hypoxia.  Since all human cells depend on oxygen for survival, varying degrees of anemia can have a wide range of clinical consequences. Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) has to be present to ensure adequate oxygenation of all body tissues and organs.

The three main classes of anemia include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production (ineffective hematopoiesis). In menstruating women, dietary iron deficiency is a common cause of deficient red blood cell production.

===Sickle cell=== 

[[Image:Sicklecells.jpg|right|framed|Image of RBC's with Sickle Cell mutations.]]

Sickle-cell disease is a general term for a group of genetic disorders caused by sickle hemoglobin (Hgb S or Hb S). In many forms of the disease, the red blood cells change shape upon deoxygenation because of polymerization of the abnormal sickle hemoglobin. This process damages the red blood cell membrane, and can cause the cells to become stuck in blood vessels. This deprives the downstream tissues of oxygen and causes ischemia and infarction. The disease is chronic and lifelong. Individuals are most often well, but their lives are punctuated by periodic painful attacks. In addition to periodic pain, there may be damage of internal organs, and/or stroke. Lifespan is often shortened with sufferers living to an average of 40 years. It is common in people from parts of the world where malaria is or was common, especially in sub-Saharan Africa or in descendants of those peoples. 

Genetics:
Sickle-cell disease is inherited in the autosomal recessive pattern, depicted above.  The allele responsible for sickle cell anemia is autosomal recessive. A person who receives the defective gene from both father and mother develops the disease; a person who receives one defective and one healthy allele remains healthy, but can pass on the disease and is known as a carrier. If two parents who are carriers have a child, there is a 1-in-4 chance of their child developing the illness and a 1-in-2 chance of their child just being a carrier.

===Polycythemia===
Polycythemia is a condition in which there is a net increase in the total circulating erythrocyte (red blood cell) mass of the body. There are several types of polycythemia.

;Primary Polycythemia:
In primary polycythemia, there may be 8 to 9 million and occasionally 11 million erythrocytes per cubic millimeter of blood (a normal range for adults is 4-5 million), and the hematocrit may be as high as 70 to 80%. In addition, the total blood volume can increase to as much as twice as normal. The entire vascular system can become markedly engorged with blood, and circulation times for blood throughout the body can increase up to twice the normal value. The increased numbers of erythrocytes can increase of the viscosity of the blood to as much as five times normal. Capillaries can become plugged by the very viscous blood, and the flow of blood through the vessels tends to be extremely sluggish.

As a consequence of the above, people with untreated Polycythemia are at a risk of various thrombotic events (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), heart attack and stroke, and have a substantial risk of Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis). The condition is considered chronic; no cure exists. Symptomatic treatment (see below) can normalize the blood count and most patients can live a normal life for years.

;Secondary polycythemia:
Secondary polycythemia is caused by either appropriate or inappropriate increases in the production of erythropoietin that result in an increased production of erythrocytes. In secondary polycythemia, there may be 6 to 8 million and occasionally 9 million erythrocytes per cubic millimeter of blood. A type of secondary polycythemia in which the production of erythropoietin increases appropriately is called physiologic polycythemia. Physiologic polycythemia occurs in individuals living at high altitudes (4275 to 5200 meters), where oxygen availability is less than at sea level. Many athletes train at higher altitudes to take advantage of this effect — a legal form of blood doping. Actual polychthemia sufferers have been known to use their condition as an athletic advantage for greater stamina.

Other causes of secondary polycythemia include smoking, renal or liver tumors, or heart or lung diseases that result in hypoxia. Endocrine abnormalities, prominently including pheochromocytoma and adrenal adenoma with Cushing's Syndrome, are also secondary causes. Athletes and bodybuilders who abuse anabolic steroids or erythropoietin may develop secondary polycythemia.

;Relative polycythemia:
Relative polycythemia is an apparent rise of the erythrocyte level in the blood; however, the underlying cause is reduced blood plasma. Relative polycythemia is often caused by fluid loss i.e. burns, dehydration and stress polycythemia.

===Leukemia===                                   

Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal proliferation of blood cells, usually white blood cells (leukocytes). It is part of the broad group of diseases called hematological neoplasms. Damage to the bone marrow, by way of displacing the normal marrow cells with increasing numbers of malignant cells, results in a lack of blood platelets, which are important in the blood clotting process. This means people with leukemia may become bruised, bleed excessively, or develop pin-prick bleeds (petechiae).

White blood cells, which are involved in fighting pathogens, may be suppressed or dysfunctional, putting the patient at the risk of developing infections.
The red blood cell deficiency leads to anaemia, which may cause dyspnea. All symptoms may also be attributable to other diseases; for diagnosis, blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy are required.

==Glossary==

'''Albumin:''' a major blood protein responsible for the maintenance of osmotic (water) pressure in the blood

'''Anemia:''' a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin caused by lack of iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 in the diet, or by red blood cell destruction; associated with decreased ability of blood to carry oxygen

'''B-Cell:''' cell responsible for the distribution of antibodies

'''Basophil:''' this white blood cell enters damaged tissues and releases a histamine and other chemicals that promote inflammation in the body to fight pathogens

'''Blood:''' the means and transport system of the body used in carrying elements - nutrition, waste, heat - from one location in the body to another by way of blood vessels

'''Eosinophil:''' white blood cell that is involved in the immune response against parasitic worms (such as tapeworms and roundworms). Named because it stains with the red dye &quot;eosin.&quot; 

'''Factor V Leiden''' most common genetic hypercoagulability disorder.

'''Formed Elements:''' the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets found in blood

'''Hematocrit:''' measurement of the % of red blood cells found in blood

'''Hemoglobin (Hb):''' iron-containing pigment in red blood cells that combines with and transports oxygen

'''Hemophilia:''' genetic disorder in which the affected individual may have uncontrollable bleeding; blood does not clot

'''Hemostasis:''' the process by which blood flow is stopped; also describes the clotting of blood

'''Lymphocytes:''' cells of the Lymphatic system, provide defense against specific pathogen or toxins

'''Monocytes:''' The largest white blood cell. Becomes a macrophage when activated. Engulfs pathogens and debris through phagocytosis, also involved in presenting antigens to B and T lymphocytes.

'''Neutrophils:''' the most common white blood cell; they are phagocytic and engulf pathogens or debris in the tissues; also release cytotoxic enzymes and chemicals to kill pathogens

'''NK-Cells:''' also known as &quot;Natural Killer Cells&quot;, these T lymphocytes are responsible for surveillance and detection of abnormal tissue cells; important in preventing cancer

'''Phagocytosis:''' process by which amoeboid-like cells engulf and ingest, and thereby destroy, foreign matter or material

'''T-Cell:''' cells that mediate by coordinating the immune system and enter the peripheral tissues. They can attack foreign cells directly and control the activities of other lymphocytes

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whenever trying to evaluate data that has been collected, often patterns appear, such as a -1 slope when making a scatter plot of &lt;math&gt;1/d_i=1/f-1/d_o&lt;/math&gt; in ray optics. It may often be the goal to find a mathematical function that &quot;fits&quot; the data. That is to say a function whose values are close to the data values at the corresponding values and independent values. This is often referred to as the &quot;least squares&quot;, and the reason for which is explained later.

==Sales Example==
A store sells whatsits at P=3.49 each and the average number of whatsits sold (the volume) per day is V=100. Therefore the total money received T=P times V=349.00 ..... If the price is reduced then, maybe, more whatsits will be sold, but T may be more or less. Obviously if P=0 then T will also be zero. The following was the result:

         P          V           T
       2.99        130        388.70
       3.29        123        404.67
       3.49        100        349.00
Obviously the &quot;best&quot; price is somewhere between 2.99 and 3.49. 
..... [[Curve fitting]] provides an equation for T versus P for each of the many models that are available for comparison.
===Linear model===
The linear model is based on &lt;u&gt;the &quot;best&quot; straight line&lt;/U&gt;. Using a calculator that can do [[regression]], we find for the above data that the closest line of the graph showing T versus P is
:T=605.268605263 - 68.9289473684 * P, and the correlation is shown as about 60% for this model.

Let us examine it in more detail:
    &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;u&gt;Actual T&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;u&gt;Calculated T&lt;/u&gt;       &lt;u&gt;Difference&lt;/u&gt;     &lt;u&gt;Difference&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
   2.99   388.70  399.17105263159  - 10.4710526316   109.642943214
   3.29   404.67  378.49236842106    26.1776315789   685.268395081
   3.49   349.00  364.70657894738  - 15.7065789474   246.696622231
Adding the differences, we find that their sum is nearly zero, indicating that it is the &quot;best&quot; linear model. Squaring a negative number always gives a positive number. so that the '''SUM OF SQUARES''' will give us an indication of the '''GOODNESS OF FIT'''. Here the '''SUM OF SQUARES''' is 1041.60796053, and we can compare the different models, selecting finally the model that has the '''LEAST SQUARES'''.

If you do NOT have a calculator or a computer that can do regression, then.....

====Calculation of the least square line to fit the given points:====
LOOKING FOR a and b in the equation of the straight line y=a+b*x:

We have, in the above example:
     x       x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;      y       y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;             xy
 
   2.99   8.9401  388.70  151087.69     1162.213
   3.29  10.8241  404.67  163757.8089   1331.3643
   3.49  12.1801  349.00  121801        1218.01
   ----  ------- -------  -----------   ---------
   9.77  31.9443 1142.37  436646.4989   3711.5873

We have:
n = number of points = 3&lt;br/&gt;ax=average of x=9.77/3=3.25&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ay=average of y=1142.37/3=380.79&lt;br/&gt;x1=sum of x=9.77&lt;br/&gt;x2=sum of x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=31.9443&lt;br/&gt;y1=sum of y=1142.37&lt;br/&gt;y2=sum of y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=436646.4989&lt;br/&gt;s1=sum of xy=3711.5873&lt;br/&gt;z1=s1-(x1*y1/n)=3711.5873-(9.77*1142.37/3)= -8.731&lt;br/&gt;z2=x2-(x1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/n)=31.9443-9.77&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/3=0.12&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b=z1/z2=-68.9289473682

a=ay-b*ax=380.79-(-68.9289473682)*3.25&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;=605.268605263

 Thus we have y=605.268605263-68.92894736828*x as the best line to fit the given points of this example.

===Parabolic Model===
If we have n points, then a polynomial of (n-1) degree will fit these n points exactly. We are given in this example 3 points, and a polynomial of the 2nd degree (parabola) should give us an exact fit. The calculator provides the equation&lt;br/&gt;(-663.1666666653)x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4217.91999999x-6294.10448332, giving us
    &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;u&gt;Actual T&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;u&gt;Calculated T&lt;/u&gt;       &lt;u&gt;Difference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
   2.99   388.70   388.6999999956      4.4E-9 = zero plus rounding error
   3.29   404.67   404.6699999951      4.9E-9 = zero plus rounding error
   3.49   349.00   348.999999995       5.0E-8 = zero plus rounding error
That is a perfect fit, with the '''LEAST SQUARES''' indicating that this model be used.

===Other models===
Some of the many other models are based on the exponential function, logarithms, and various manipulations of the independent and/or the dependent variable(s). The &quot;best fit&quot; is usually the one that provides the '''LEAST SQUARES'''. Also weighting of the data could be used when some points on a graph are more important than others (such as, maybe, end points, for example).
:Caution: Some calculators may require for Curve fitting consecutive, equally spaced, independent variables. Always compare the original graph with the &quot;fitted&quot; graph.

'''Gravlax''' is [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] that is cured in salt and sugar. It is a common dish throughout Scandinavia. Gravlax is easy to make and makes a festive dish that is an excellent to serve at parties with many people. The process of curing fish in salt and sugar (''grava'') is not limited to salmon and works fine with any fatty fish although salmon is definitely the most common choice. Gravlax has been particularly popular and common in the northern regions of Scandinavia whose cold and fresh waters produce salmon of excellent quality. The basic recipe here has been used for generations and has its origins in the northernmost part of Sweden. Gravlax can be used either as a main dish or as an appetizer.

== Ingredients ==
* 8 hg (1.75 lb) of fresh [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] file
* 30 ml (2 Tbs) of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 30 ml (2 Tbs) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 45 ml (3 Tbs) of [[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]]
* 30 cl (1 1/4 cups) of [[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits|gin]] (optional)
* 5 ml (1 tsp) of whole or crushed [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]] seeds
* 20-40 g (0.75 to 1.5 oz.) of [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]]

== Procedure ==
[[Image:Gravlax1.jpg|thumbnail|Thawed salmon with the required ingredients.]]
[[Image:Gravlax2.jpg|thumbnail|Apply salt and sugar.]]
[[Image:Gravlax3.jpg|thumbnail|Apply pepper and juniper berries.]]
[[Image:Gravlax4.jpg|thumbnail|Cover with dill.]]
[[Image:Gravlax5.jpg|thumbnail|Place one piece on top of the other.]]
[[Image:Gravlax6.jpg|thumbnail|Seal the salmon in a plastic bag and refrigerate.]]
[[Image:Gravlax7.jpg|thumbnail|Serve thin slices of the cured salmon.]]
Use the thick part of the salmon filet found towards the head, it should be approximately 2-5 cm (about an inch) thick. Cut the filet into two equally sized parts (if you are making gravlax for many people it is fine to use two filets instead). Don't use the part closest to the tail, since it is not thick enough. Now freeze the salmon for at least four days at -18C or colder to kill any parasites.

After deep freezing the salmon remove it from the freezer and let it thaw, preferably overnight in the refrigerator. The salmon does not have to be completely thawed for the next step.

Place the salmon, skin down, on a table. Rub the salt and sugar mix onto the pieces, then apply the juniper berries and pepper. Finally cover with dill. 
Put one piece on top of another, flesh side to flesh side (so the skin it outside on both pieces), and place in a plastic bag. Toss any leftover &quot;ingredients&quot; into the bag along with the gin. Seal the bag and place it in the refrigerator. Now let the salmon cure in the mixture, turning the bag over once, preferably twice, a day; for four days.

After four days the salmon is ready to serve. If you are not going to eat it immediately (it lasts a couple of days) move it to a fresh plastic bag or jar, removing the salty liquid that have formed in the original bag. If you keep it in the original bag the risk is that it may be too salty once you are about to serve it.

Use a sharp knife to slice thin slices from the salmon at an angle. During slicing also remove any leftover bones. The larger the piece of salmon the larger the angle and the larger surface area for the produced slices. Large slices looks better when served.

As a main dish, serve with [[Cookbook:Potato Stew|potato stew]], boiled potatoes and [[Cookbook:gravlax sause|gravlax sause]] or in a [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]]. As an appetizer serve on crispbread or [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]].

Potato stew with some additional [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] is excellent addition to gravlax.

== Variations ==
The gin can be substituted for the acids in lemons or limes (like a ceviche).

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sfinx. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sfinx~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

==Voting Rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

COMMENTS... This book is very well develped  already. [[User:MeMoria|MeMoria]]

'''Support''' I think this book has a lot of potential and is a book that any editor should be able to help with. --[[User:Mattwj2002|Mattwj2002]] 05:03, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Everyone can help with this one. [[Samba]] is an important technology, so let's get it some recognition!
*Why don't you contribute something to it then?

#'''Support''' - This book, while it has a German title, and was written in German, already has a paragraph by paragraph translation of most or all of the text.  What we really need to do here is clean it up, remove the German text, and move the book and chapters to English titles, and we'll have a very nice Wikibook to show off. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 16:51, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

===[[Introduction to Philosophy]]===

#'''Support''' - This book is a little underdone and could be easily edited by many. As a major part of the humanities area it should be one of our larger books. [[User:Serge|Serge]]  07:44, 27 Jun 2005 (EST)
#[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 03:16, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)
#'''Support''' Much need be considered when building this book, much of which has been excluded from it. I would like to see more persons working on this collaboration. It is sad to see something that many people are trying to push fall short. I see this as a keystone to many young minds, and the way it is being formed is ridiculous. It needs much support from the WikiBooks community. Consequently, I am forced to vote for it as a collaboration of the month canidate, not for the fact that it is well-formed, but for the fact it need be seen and helped.

#[[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 14:21, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) (support). Following rejection of this book from &quot;Book of the month&quot;, due to its lack of content, why not make it a collaboration and therefore solve this problem? This is also the first travel book for Wikibooks.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Erichmj. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Erichmj~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

:Hello, Name of Feather.
:I believe I saw some articles that made up this book in Kuro5hin while I was looking around (or more properly, was referred).
:This seems to be an informative and friendly book on an important subject.
:Depression does need to be demystified. I fully understand that the moods/affective side is the tip of the iceberg.
:How very true that it's chronic brain overload...
:It would be easy to upload charts and graphs representing what you intended.

== Don't forget to sign your comments ==

Hi N.O.F.,

It is standard practice to sign your comments when ever you make a change to a talk page. With out this it makes it hard to figure out who is adding what comments. You do this with 4 tilde like &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it looks like this: [[User:Triddle|Triddle]] 01:35, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Thanks for your contributions ==

Name of Feather, thanks for your work donating this information in your book to the site! I appreciate it and think that many other people will appreciate it and benefit from it as well. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:37, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

Now, to our usual dialogue.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
== Dialogue ==
'''Ricardo''': Que horas são, João?&lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Agora, são dez para as seis.&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': A sério? Minha mulher e eu vamos ao cinema às seis e cinco.&lt;br&gt;
'''João''': A que horas começa o filme?&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Às seis e dez.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In Portuguese, the way you tell the time is similar to English. You first say the hour number, then the word '''e''' and finally the minute number. Ex: '''São sete e vinte.''' - It's seven twenty. 
For half an hour, you say '''e meia''' in the place of &quot;and a half&quot; or '''e trinta''' as in thirty and in case the minute number is very close to the full hour (bigger than 30), it is more common to say the remaining time to the next hour, using the structure: São + remaining time in minutes + '''para a(s)''' + next hour. Ex: '''São duas e meia.''' - It's two and a half. '''São cinco para as quatro''' - It's five to four.
Also, there are synonyms for midnight and midday in Portuguese: '''meia-noite''' and '''meio-dia''', respectively. These words are used the same way. Ex: '''É meio-dia.''' - It's midday.

Now, let's do some exercises:

1)Tell the times below in Portuguese:

a)10:30 PM&lt;br&gt;
b)8:55 AM&lt;br&gt;
c)3:15 AM&lt;br&gt;
d)7:25 AM&lt;br&gt;
e)1:00 PM&lt;br&gt;
f)4:40 PM&lt;br&gt;
g)12:50 PM&lt;br&gt;
h)11:55 AM&lt;br&gt;

Answers:

1)&lt;br&gt;
a)São dez e meia.&lt;br&gt;
b)São cinco para as nove.&lt;br&gt;
c)São três e quinze.&lt;br&gt;
d)São sete e vinte e cinco.&lt;br&gt;
e)É uma hora.*&lt;br&gt;
f)São vinte para as cinco.&lt;br&gt;
g)São dez para uma.&lt;br&gt;
h)São cinco para meio-dia.&lt;br&gt;

*Note that since one hour is singular, the verb '''ser''' is in the singular form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">
The audio components of a robot are those parts that allow it to make sounds, either for entertainment purposes or to convey information.

This can be done through simple sound chips: cheap integrated circuits which allow certain sounds to be played with very few external components. These are commonly used in toys.

Other means are memory chips storing samples, a DAC and an amplifier, an MP3 player or voice synthesiser software on a portable PC.

==The Theoretical Edge==
Generating simple sounds is easy. All you need is an oscillator in the range 20 to 20.000Hz, an amplifier and a speaker. Such a circuit can generate any tone that a human can hear. By changing the frequency of the oscillator you change the emitted tone. Qbasic has a command that does just this: sound. Sound lets you specify a few parameters, with the most important being the frequency. By changing this frequency over time simple sound effects could be produced.

A better way to generate sound is sampling:

A sound wave has an intensity that varies over time. A microphone (with preamplifier) can convert this intensity to an electric signal with the same shape. An Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) can then convert this electric signal in a digital number. This is, however, not a continuous process but a discrete process, this means that every x ms the amplitude (voltage or current) of the signal is measured and converted to a digital number. This results in a digital approximation of the original signal. How good this approximation is depends on how frequently the signal is sampled. Of course more samples means more memory space is consumed and also more expensive hardware is needed. The price of an ADC depends on precision (how many bits represent the sample) and how many samples it can take per second (there are more parameters, but those are pretty much out of scope for this book).

Now you have an array of numbers. Of course now you want to turn this array back into sound. This is done with a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC). This part converts a digital value back into an electric signal. After this DAC there is a filter to smooth the wave, an amplifier and a speaker. Feed the array sample by sample to the DAC at the same rate as they were sampled and you hear the original sound back.

The advantage of this approach is it's (relative) simplicity. The disadvantage is its enormous memory consumption.

More advanced methods would be storing encoded sound (e.g. MP3). This is more tricky since it needs a decoder, yet these days integrated circuits with complete mp3 decoders exist, which makes this an interesting method to look for.

==The Different Components==
''this section should cover some basic info on these circuits and ICs''

===Preamplifier===
A preamplifier is used when a signal with very small amplitude has to be amplified. Preamplifiers are very linear (they cause very little distortion in the signal) but are very inefficient with power. They amplify a signal, coming from e.g. a microphone, which commonly has an amplitude of 1mV or less to a more useful amplitude of 100mV and up. Since they are so inefficient preamplifier circuits aren't used for power amplifiers.

===Amplifier===
Amplifiers allow a low power signal to be outputed through a speaker with significant power. Amplifiers commonly allow some distortion of the signal in order to preserve power. (except for class A amplifiers which consume a lot of power, but have little distortion).

Amplifiers can be built with ICs, discrete components or bought as a module.

===Analog to Digital Converter ADC===
An analog to digital converter (short: ADC) converts an analog signal to a digital value. ADCs have a certain accuracy, expressed in ''bit'', e.g. 8bit, 10bit and 16bit. This means that the ADC will have a binary number with 8, 10 and respectively 16 bits. The highest value represented by this binary number correspondents to the reference voltage put on a special input of the ADC. e.g. If we have an 8bit ADC and we put on this special input 5V, then the value 255 means 5V. It's precision will be 1/255 * 5 V or 0.02V. Each time we add 1 to the binary number, the represented voltage increases by 0.02V.&lt;BR&gt;
A second point about ADCs is their timing. ADCs take some time to do a conversion. The faster they are, the more accurate they digitalise the signal (or in other words the higher the frequency of a signal can be), and the more expensive they are.

===Digital to Analog Converter===
The DAC converts a digital value into a voltage level. The work either with a reference voltage or &quot;rail-to-rail&quot;, which means that their highest digital input value represents a voltage level (almost) equal to the DACs supply voltage. 
Simulare to the ADC the DAC has a certain accuracy in ''bit'' and requires some time to make a conversion.

===Oscillators===
An oscillator generates a repetitive signal. This can be of pretty much any shape you want, but most common shapes are sine, square, saw-tooth and triangle waves and many different forms of pulses.

===Dedicated sound Chips===
There are many ICs specially designed for producing sound effects.

*Oscillators: These output a signal with a user definable frequency. By varying the frequency you can make different sound effects.
*Sound chips: These output particular sound effects (e.g. motor sounds). These can't be changed.
*Sound recording and playback chips: These can record sounds for a short period of time (some can record several different samples) and can play these back afterward.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How do I clone maintenance records from one xymon to the other one ? ==
The front-end web GUI is to collect information and  in the end send out bb command with &quot;disable&quot; syntax.
=== Found out the maintenance status of a host ===
* bb xymon-server-name &quot;hobbitdboard color=blue fields=hostname,testname,disabletime,dismsg&quot; 
=== Disable a host ===
* bb xymon-server-name &quot;disable hostname.testname $timeframe $REASON&quot;
=== Enable a host ===
* bb xymon-server-name &quot;enable hostname.testname&quot;


=== Enable All hosts with blue record that in maintenance mode ===
Why ?, Useful when you need to populate the records from hobbit server A to B.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;

#
# NAME
#      bluesync.sh  - A shell script to replicate Primary Xymon Serverblue record
#                     to Secondary standby Xymon server.
#
#
# REVISION HISTORY
#      07/12/2009    Base on getblue.sh and putblue.sh by Ralph Mitchell &lt;ralphmitchell (at) gmail.com&gt;
#                    http://www.hswn.dk/hobbiton/2009/07/msg00214.html
#      10/19/2009    T.J. Yang merge two scripts into one for Xymon  High Availability setup.
#
# USAGE
#      This script is tested on Solaris 10 OS.
#      put this shell script in hobbitlaunch.cfg as section like following.
#
# [bluesync]
# #     DISABLED
#       ENABLE
#       ENVFILE /etc/opt/hobbitserver42/hobbitserver.cfg
#       CMD /opt/hobbitserver42/ext/bluesync/bluesync.sh
#       LOGFILE $BBSERVERLOGS/bluesync.sh.log
#       INTERVAL 5m
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Xymon keep its blue(maintenance) in memory, not in a file. This script
#     is to copy the blue records from primary Xymon A server into Xymon B secondary one.
#     This script is for use when running Active-Active type of Xymon server
#     High Availability setup. Xymon B is same as Xymon A except
#     the alerting function is disabled. There is another script running on Xymon B to
#     detect the outage of Xymon A and enable Xymon B to become primary one.
#
#
# Algorithems:
# 1. Pull blue records from Xymon1 and dump them into Xymon2's ext/bluesync directory.
# 2. Process the lifetime fields' value
#     if lifetime is -1 and greater then zero
#       then run &quot;bb hobbit2.test.com &quot;disable hosname.test lifetime message&quot;
#            to keep the blue record.
#     if  liftime =0
#       the run &quot;bb hobbit2.test.com &quot;enable  hostname.*d&quot;  to enable this host blue record
#           since it is expired or was enabled on xymon1 server.
#

# RETURN CODE
#       SUCCESS (=0) - script completed sucessfully
#       ERROR   (=1) - error... bad things happened
#       WARNING (=2) - warning... something's not quite right, but it's

== How to have pca work with xymon ? ==
[http://www.par.univie.ac.at/solaris/pca/ pca] is a perl script that can report and install patch missing patches from Sun's patches databases for all versions of Solaris OS.

There are two ways to integrate pca with xymon monitoring tool.

=== Server side patch analysis ===
Run &quot;showrev -p&quot; and &quot;pkginfo -x&quot; on xymon client and run pca.pl on xymon server to analyze missing patch for all the clients.

=== Client side patch analysis ===
Run pca.pl on xymon client for missing patches analysis and send in lists of missed patch to xymon server.
* pca software and its dependent software need to be deployed as part of xymon client package.
* pca.pl need to be configure to query internal Solaris patch database reside on xymon server.
* Need to set up a local pca proxy server to store all the patch zip files and main solaris patch database.
* use pca command to update missing patch after getting approvals to update the missing patches.

=== Pros and Cons for Server and Client side methods ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; width: 100%;&quot;
|-
! Integration approach
! Server side analysis
! Client Side analysis
|-
! Client changes needed
| Modify -sunos.sh to send in &quot;showrev -p&quot; and &quot;pkginfo -x&quot; output.
| Run &quot;pca -L&quot; and more HTML code correction in wrapper script or run &quot;pca -M&quot; (with a patch change to pca.pl) on Xymon client as a client side ext module.
|-
! Server side change needed
| Write a server side module to process the data of &quot;showrev -p&quot; sent from clients.
| Xymon server will create a &quot;pca&quot; column with missed patch send from Xymon client.
|-
! Load on Xymon server
| This will add the missing patch calculation time for all clients on the Xymon server.
| Load to xymon server is minimum because the calculation task is done on Xymon clients.
|-
! pca script changes
| No pca.pl script change is needed. We only update the new pca.pl one time on the Xymon server.
| &quot;pca -L&quot; won't generate Xymon client compatible HTML code. We need to either correct this in the wrapper script or patch the pca perl code.
|-
! client to server traffic
| The raw data output of &quot;showrev -p&quot; will be sent every 5 minutes!
| The message size is only the missed patches list, not the whole output of &quot;showrev -p&quot; and every 5 minutes.

== Transparent Authentication against Active Directory 2003 with Apache and CentOS 5 ==
Here, I (Stewart L) will explain the steps I went through to get a Linux server joined to our Active Directory 2003 infrastructure and to authenticate users against the domain without them being required to enter credentials.

As I said, this is against an AD 2003 structure. If you are operating in a 200 or NT domain, this might not work for you, but it should point you on your way.

I'll make a few assumptions at this point for the example.
* You are setting up a webserver to be named web1.example.com.
* Your domain is called EXAMPLE and your kerberos Realm is named EXAMPLE.COM
* You have a domain account named EXAMPLE\Bob that is authorized to add machines into the domain.
* Your Domain controller is dc1.example.com.

=== Install Packages ===
You obviously need apache installed. You will also need the mod_auth_kerb package to authenticate against the domain. It is also much easier if you use the system-config-authentication tool in the authconfig-gtk package.

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;yum -y install mod_auth_kerb authconfig-gtk&lt;/source&gt;

=== Join the Machine to the Domain ===
Before you can join a machine to a domain, you must have a few items taken care of...
* The hostname (excluding the domain) should be 15 characters or less.
* The system clocks should be synchronized. Use NTP for this.
* Your /etc/hosts file needs to be properly set up. You should have a localhost entry pointing to 127.0.0.1 and an entry that has your fully-qualified host name pointing to its assigned IP address.

With that out of the way, we can begin configuring authentication.

# Run system-config-authentication as root.
# On the Authentication tab, Enable Kerberos and Winbind
# Configure Kerberos.
##REALM = EXAMPLE.COM
##Check the boxes for using DNS to resolve hosts to realms and locate KDCs.
##KDC and Admin Sevrer can be left blank
##Click ok.
#Configure Winbind
##Domain = EXAMPLE
##Security Model = ads
##ADS Realm = EXAMPLE.COM
##Domain Controllers = dc1.example.com
##Click ok
#Edit your /etc/samba/smb.conf file and make sure that your netbios name is the same as your hostname. This should be the host part only, not the domain.

=== Join the Domain ===
As the root user, run the following commands. You will have to enter a password for Bob after both commands.
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
kinit EXAMPLE\Bob
net ads join -U EXAMPLE\Bob
&lt;/source&gt;
That's it! You're on the domain now. By default you have to have a local account on the box to authenticate against AD, meaning if there is not a bob account on web1.example.com, bob cannot log in with his domain password.

=== Configure an AD User ===
This is where things become a little convoluted. We are going to create a user account in AD that the web server will use for authentication. There are a number of different versions and service packs out there for Windows Server 2000 and 2003. I got a lot of my information from http://grolmsnet.de/kerbtut/ so check there if you have problems with this part.

*Create a user in AD named http_web1.
*Set this account so that the password never expires.
*On the command line of the Domain Controller, run this line
:&lt;source lang=dos&gt;ktpass -princ HTTP/web1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM -mapuser EXAMPLE\http_web1 -crypto DES-CBC-MD5 -ptype KRB5_NT_SRV_HST -pass * -out c:\temp\http_web1.heytab&lt;/source&gt;
*This will create a keytab file in C:\temp that you need to move to your webserver and place in /etc/http.

=== Configure Apache ===
Your configuration should look something like this...
&lt;code&gt;
   &amp;lt;Location /&amp;gt;
   AuthName &quot;Welcome to EXAMPLE&quot;
   AuthType Kerberos
   Krb5Keytab /etc/httpd/http_web1.keytab
   KrbAuthRealm EXAMPLE.COM
   KrbMethodNegotiate On
   KrbSaveCredentials off
   KrbVerifyKDC off
   Require valid-user
   &amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Naturally, you can change the Authname to whatever you like. Check http://modauthkerb.sourceforge.net/ for more info on specific configurations

=== Configure Firefox (Optional) ===
#Type about:config in the URL bar
#Modify the following &quot;Preference Name&quot;
#*network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris - Example.com
#*network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris - Example.com
#*network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris - Example.com

== How do I prevent red/purple alert storm from Xymon server ? ==
=== What ===
*red alert storm:
** caused by death of a few switches and bad bb-hosts configuration that missing router dependency directive.
** human error on configuring fping access control list.
*purple storm: 
** caused by Xymon server went into very high CPU load itself that prevent itself from running the Xymon daemon themselves properly thus all machines went into purple due lack of message update within 30 minutes.

=== How to fix ===
* Deploy mail filter to restrict the volume of alerts Xymon  server can send out.

== How do I update xymon client's configuration file from xymon server ? ==
=== Why ? ===
* To make global variable changes on all hobbit clients.
** Examples: To configure all your clients to send hobbit messages from one  to two Xymon servers. This will need to modify hobbitclient.cfg on all clients. If you have small pool of clients, manually editing by login into each machines is ok. but for a pool at size of 3000 clients, this change is better done via clienudpate or cluster shell plus rsh approach.
** This wiki page is to verify if xymon's clientupdate really work for this need.

=== What need to be done ? ===
* Update hobbit-client.cfg on hobbit clients with new hobbit-client.cfg locate in central hobbit server. The new hobbit-client.cfg contain new configuration to send hobbit messages to two hobbit server.
** diff of old and new hobbit-client.cfg file.
&lt;pre&gt;
bash-2.05$ diff hobbitclient.cfg hobbitclient.cfg.new

        $BB $BBDISP &quot;$LINE&quot;                     # SEND IT TO BBDISPLAY
fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== RTFM first ===
* http://www.hswn.dk/hobbit/help/manpages/man1/clientupdate.1.html
* Looks feasible from about manpage.

=== Procedures ===
To manage updating clients without having to logon to each server, you can use the clientupdate utility. This is how you setup the release of a new client version.
# make sure the xymon client external scripts send  message to &quot;BBDISPLAYS&quot;, not just &quot;BBDISP&quot; variable.
## this require the review of external(home-grown) script got deployed to be modified to send messages to two xymon servers.
# Create the new client: Setup the new client $BBHOME directory, e.g. by copying an existing client installation to an empty directory and modifying it for your needs. It is a good idea to delete all files in the tmp/ and logs/ directories, since there is no need to copy these over to all of the clients. Pay attention to the etc/ files, and make sure that they are suitable for the systems where you want to deploy this new client. You can add files - e.g. extension scripts in the ext/ directory - but the clientupdate utility cannot delete or rename files.
# Package the client: When your new client software is ready, create a tar-file of the new client. All files in the tar archive must have filenames relative to the clients' $BBHOME (usually, ~hobbit/client/). Save the tarfile on the Hobbit server in ~hobbit/server/download/somefile.tar. Dont compress it. It is recommended that you use some sort of operating-system and version-numbering scheme for the filename, but you can choose whatever filename suits you - the only requirement is that it must end with &quot;.tar&quot;. The part of the filename preceding &quot;.tar&quot; is what Hobbit will use as the &quot;clientversion&quot; ID.
# Configure which hosts receive the new client: In the client-local.cfg(5) file, you must now setup a clientversion:ID line where the ID matches the filename you used for the tar-file. So if you have packaged the new client into the file linux.v2.tar, then the corresponding entry in client-local.cfg would be clientversion:linux.v2.
# Wait for hobbitd to reload client-local.cfg:   hobbitd will automatically reload the client-local.cfg file after at most 10 minutes. If you want to force an immediate reload, send a SIGHUP signal to the hobbitd process.
# Wait for the client to update:  The next time the client contacts the Hobbit server to send the client data, it will notice the new clientversion setting in client-local.cfg, and will run clientupdate to install the new client software. So when the client runs the next time, it will use the new client software.

=== Getting started with clientupdate ===


* find out the hobbiclient version, we are running 4.2.0 from output of &quot;clientupdate --level&quot;

== How can I create a hobbit client custom test script? ==
{{main|System Monitoring with Hobbit/HOWTO/Custom Monitoring Scripts for Hobbit}}
Anything that can be automated via a script or a custom program can be added into Hobbit. A lot of extension scripts are available for Big Brother at the www.deadcat.net archive, and these will typically work without modifications if you run them in Hobbit. Sometimes a few minor tweaks are needed - the Hobbit mailing list can help you if you dont know how to go about that.

But if you have something unique you need to test, writing an extension script is pretty simple. You need to figure out some things:

* What name will you use for the column?
* How will you test it?
* What criteria should decide if the test goes red, yellow or green?
* What extra data from the test will you include in the status message ? 

A simple client-side extension script looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/sh
 
COLUMN=mytest	# Name of the column
COLOR=green		# By default, everything is OK
MSG=&quot;Bad stuff status&quot;

# Do whatever you need to test for something
# As an example, go red if /tmp/badstuff exists.
if test -f /tmp/badstuff
then
   COLOR=red
   MSG=&quot;${MSG}

   `cat /tmp/badstuff`
   &quot;
else
   MSG=&quot;${MSG}

   All is OK
   &quot;
fi

# Tell Hobbit about it
$BB $BBDISP &quot;status $MACHINE.$COLUMN $COLOR `date` ${MSG}&quot;

exit 0
&lt;/source&gt;

You will notice that some environment variables are pre-defined: BB, BBDISP, MACHINE are all provided by Hobbit when you run your script via hobbitlaunch. Also note how the MSG variable is used to build the status message - it starts out with just the &quot;Bad stuff status&quot;, then you add data to the message when we decided what the status is.

To run this, save your script in the &lt;code&gt;~hobbit/client/ext/&lt;/code&gt; directory (i.e. in the &lt;code&gt;ext/&lt;/code&gt; directory off where you installed the Hobbit client), then add a new section to the &lt;code&gt;~hobbit/client/etc/clientlaunch.cfg&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;~hobbit/server/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg&lt;/code&gt; on the server) file like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[myscript]
   ENVFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/etc/hobbitclient.cfg
   CMD $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/ext/myscript.sh
   LOGFILE $HOBBITCLIENTHOME/logs/myscript.log
   INTERVAL 5m
&lt;/source&gt;

Optionally you may want to add a description for the new column your custom script creates.
On the hobbit *server* edit the file &lt;code&gt;$BBHOME/columndoc.csv&lt;/code&gt; adding a line like:
&lt;pre&gt;
myscript;The &lt;b&gt;myscript&lt;/b&gt; column shows the status of my custom script.;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== How to write server side module ? ==
Server-side scripts look almost the same as client-side scripts, but they will typically use the bbhostgrep utility to pick out hosts in the bb-hosts file that have a special tag defined, and then send one status message for each of those hosts. Like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/sh

BBHTAG=foo           # What we put in bb-hosts to trigger this test
COLUMN=$BBHTAG	# Name of the column, often same as tag in bb-hosts

$BBHOME/bin/bbhostgrep $BBHTAG | while read L
do
   set $L	# To get one line of output from bbhostgrep

   HOSTIP=&quot;$1&quot;
   MACHINEDOTS=&quot;$2&quot;
   MACHINE=`echo $2 | $SED -e's/\./,/g'`

   COLOR=green
   MSG=&quot;$BBHTAG status for host $MACHINEDOTS&quot;

   #... do the test, perhaps modify COLOR and MSG

   $BB $BBDISP &quot;status $MACHINE.$COLUMN $COLOR `date`

   ${MSG}
   &quot;
done
 
exit 0
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that for server side tests, you need to loop over the list of hosts found in the bb-hosts file, and send one status message for each host. Other than that, it is just like the client-side tests.

This script is saved in ~/hobbit/server/ext/my_script.sh, and you add its description in ~hobbit/server/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[foo]
   ENVFILE $BBTHOME/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
   CMD $BB/ext/my_script.sh
   LOGFILE $BB/logs/myscript.log
   INTERVAL 5m
&lt;/source&gt;

The service can now be added to the bb-hosts file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
127.0.0.1 my_server # foo
&lt;/source&gt;

=== How can I test a custom script before adding it to the running agent ? ===
Before activating a new custom script it is useful to check its functionality and output on stdout.

To run a script on the command line, you have to load all the xymon environment and replace the $BB command by &quot;echo&quot;.

You can easily do this on-the-fly by inserting this code snippet and then test your script by running it on the command line:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
TEST=1 ./my_script.sh
&lt;/source&gt;
 
There is nothing you have to change in your script if you want to add it to your hobbitlaunch.cfg after testing.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/sh
...
# Test-Mode ?
# TEST=0 =&gt; works in cooperation with Xymon agent (default)
# TEST=1 =&gt; for testing, results to stdout (run &quot;TEST=1 ./bb-testname.sh&quot; on cmd-line)
# TEST&gt;1 =&gt; for testing, but sending results to Xymon server without activating script in hobbitlaunch.cfg
TEST=${TEST:-&quot;0&quot;}
if [ &quot;$TEST&quot; -gt &quot;0&quot; ]
then
  BBHOME=&quot;$HOME/xymon/server&quot;
  . $BBHOME/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
  BBQUERYCMD=$BB
  [ &quot;$TEST&quot; = &quot;1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; BB=&quot;echo&quot;
fi
...
&lt;/source&gt;

This works for client-scripts as well as for server side scripts.

Of course you have to change the path settings to your environment.

&lt;/pre&gt;
* Check that the data arrives in Hobbit server.

== Use a Big Brother script without converting it to hobbit==

Run the latest Big Brother client on your hobbit server.  Execute the desired script from this client, it will report to hobbit.
e.g. using the latest &quot;bb-mrtg.pl&quot; script to monitor your mrtg graphs

== Add Custom Graphs ==

Read the man page for hobbitd_rrd

== Add support for a database backend ==

I haven't done it, but it will be very, very easy to implement. For
reporting you just want to know what status changes have occurred, so
you simply need to come up with a Hobbit &quot;worker module&quot; that receives
messages from the Hobbit &quot;stachg&quot; channel, and stores them in your
database.

Worker modules can be written in whatever language you fancy, although
I'd advise against shell-scripts for performance reasons. Perl,
Python, C, C++, Java ... pick your favourite programming tool.

All the module needs to do is read the messages off it's standard
input filehandle, and store them in the database. Each message is
formatted like this:

  @@stachg|timestamp|sender|origin|hostname|testname|expiretime|color|prevcolor|changetime
  &lt;new status message&gt;
  @@

So it is very easy to pick out the first line and grab all of the
information you will normally need from that.

There's a sample module provided with the Hobbit sources, see the
&quot;hobbit-4.0-RC4/hobbitd/hobbitd_sample.c&quot; file which illustrates how
to build a worker module in C.

== Installing Hobbit as client with a BB server ==

There are a few gotchas if you want to use Hobbit as client
with a BB server: the Hobbit client usually gets its configuration
from the server, and the standard protocol is different. To make
it backwards compatible requires a few workarounds on hobbit client side.

Example for Debian Unix OS, adjust as required otherwise.

Start as root
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  apt-get install gcc make
  apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
  useradd -m hobbit
  su - hobbit
&lt;/source&gt;
We are hobbit!
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  tar zxfv .../hobbit-4.2.0.tar.gz
  cd hobbit-4.2.0
  ./configure --client
&lt;/source&gt;  
:Answer client
:Answer hobbit
:Answer /home/hobbit
:Answer 10.0.4.5 (replace with the IP address of your BB server)
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  make
  make install
  cd
  chmod +w client/runclient.sh
  vi client/runclient.sh
&lt;/source&gt;
:Add MACHINEDOTS=&quot;f.q.d.n&quot;, i.e. the client's fqdn
:Add --local on the line that starts hobbitlaunch
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;  vi client/etc/hobbitclient.cfg&lt;/source&gt;
:Add BBMAXMSGSPERCOMBO=1
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;  exit&lt;/source&gt;

We are root again!

Create /etc/init.d/hobbit as:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
  #!/bin/sh
  su hobbit -c &quot;/home/hobbit/client/runclient.sh $1&quot;
  
  chmod +x /etc/init.d/hobbit
  update-rc.d hobbit defaults
  
  /etc/init.d/hobbit start
&lt;/source&gt;

== Monitor Hobbit clients in a DMZ using reverse SSH tunnels ==

''Note: Other methods for doing this type of thing are documented on the [[System_Monitoring_with_Xymon/Administration_Guide#Encryption_and_Tunnelling|System_Monitoring_with_Xymon/Administration_Guide]] page.''

Operating system:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
&lt;br&gt;
Hobbit version:  Hobbit 4.2.0

In some scenarios you may want to monitor Hobbit clients that are seperated from the Hobbit server by a firewall (e.g. Hobbit clients located in a DMZ) and where you cannot open port 1984 inbound from the Hobbit clients to the Hobbit server.  An alternative would be to use reverse SSH tunnels, using [http://xymonton.org/addons:ssh_tunnel Padraig Lennon's ssh_tunnels.sh script].

Note that for the purpose of this document, the hobbit user's home directory is assumed to be &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/hobbit&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Passwordless SSH Authentication ===

For the hobbit user, set up passwordless SSH authentication between the Hobbit server and the Hobbit clients.

On the Hobbit server, generate a private/public keypair with an empty password:
&lt;pre&gt;
# su - hobbit

$ ssh-keygen -t dsa

Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/id_dsa):
Created directory '/usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  &lt;-- Ensure that you create an empty passphrase, i.e. just hit Enter.
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x:xx:xx hobbit@servername
&lt;/pre&gt;

This should create the following files in the .ssh directory located in the hobbit user's home directory:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ls -ld /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh
drwx------ 2 hobbit hobbit 4096 Aug 14 12:16 /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh

$ ls -lR /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh
/usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh:
total 12
-rw------- 1 hobbit hobbit  668 Aug 14 12:14 id_dsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 hobbit hobbit  603 Aug 14 12:14 id_dsa.pub
&lt;/pre&gt;
If for some reason the creation of the keypair fails, try manually creating the .ssh folder in the hobbit user's home directory before generating the keypair.  Ensure that the folder is owned by the hobbit user and group, and that its permissions are correct:
&lt;pre&gt;
# chown hobbit:hobbit /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh
# chmod 700 /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now you want to copy the generated public key (id_dsa.pub) to the Hobbit client.  Ensure that the .ssh folder exists for the hobbit user on the Hobbit client with the same permissions as above, and then copy id_dsa.pub to the Hobbit client:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scp /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/id_dsa.pub hobbit@hobbitclient:/usr/lib/hobbit/
&lt;/pre&gt;
On the Hobbit client:

Rename the public key copied from the Hobbit server from &quot;id_dsa.pub&quot; to &quot;authorized_keys&quot;:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ mv /usr/lib/hobbit/id_dsa.pub /usr/lib/hobbit/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;
Move the authorized_keys file to the hobbit user’s .ssh directory:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ mv /usr/lib/hobbit/authorized_keys /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/
&lt;/pre&gt;
Check that the authorized_keys file has the correct permissions (chmod 644):
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ls -l /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/authorized_keys
-rw-r--r--  1 hobbit hobbit 603 Aug 14 12:20 /usr/lib/hobbit/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/pre&gt;
From the server, SSH to the client.  You should add the client's host key to the server's known_hosts file when prompted, but should not be prompted for a password.

=== Configure the Hobbit client ===

Add the following line to /usr/lib/hobbit/client/etc/hobbitclient.cfg on the Hobbit client:
&lt;pre&gt;
BBDISP=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Configure /etc/default/hobbit-client as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
HOBBITSERVERS=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Restart the hobbit-client service on the Hobbit client.

=== Configure the Hobbit server ===

Copy the ssh-tunnels.sh script to the following location on the Hobbit server, and make sure that its permissions are correct (chmod 755):
&lt;pre&gt;
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5469 Aug 14 12:30 /usr/lib/hobbit/server/ext/ssh-tunnels.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;
Modify /etc/hobbit/hobbitlaunch.cfg:
&lt;pre&gt;
[ssh-tunnel]
    ENVFILE /usr/lib/hobbit/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
    CMD $BBHOME/ext/ssh-tunnels.sh
    LOGFILE $BBSERVERLOGS/ssh-tunnels.log
    INTERVAL 1m
&lt;/pre&gt;
Add entries for the Hobbit clients to the /etc/hobbit/bb-hosts file (use &quot;noconn&quot; if pings aren't allowed from server to client):
&lt;pre&gt;
xx.xx.xx.xx    clientname       # noconn ssh-tunnel
&lt;/pre&gt;
If the Hobbit clients' names cannot be resolved by the Hobbit server, add entries for those clients to the Hobbit server's /etc/hosts file:
&lt;pre&gt;
xx.xx.xx.xx    clientname
&lt;/pre&gt;

As of ssh-tunnel.sh version 0.0.3 you can specify a non-standard ssh port to connect to. Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
xx.xx.xx.xx    clientname       # noconn ssh-tunnel:2222
&lt;/pre&gt;


You could also create a DNS entry for the client, whichever is easier.

As the hobbit user, manually SSH to each Hobbit client at least once, and when prompted add the Hobbit client's host key to the Hobbit server's known_hosts file:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ssh clientname
The authenticity of host 'clientname (xx.xx.xx.xx)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x:xx:xx.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  yes
&lt;/pre&gt;
Restart the hobbit service on the Hobbit server:
&lt;pre&gt;
# service hobbit restart
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Confirm functional ===
Consult /var/log/hobbit/ssh-tunnels.log for any error messages, e.g.
&lt;pre&gt;
ssh: clientname: Name or service not known
&lt;/pre&gt;
Solution:
Ensure that the Hobbit server can resolve the Hobbit client's name, e.g. add an entry for the Hobbit client to the Hobbit server's /etc/hosts file.
&lt;pre&gt;
Host key verification failed.
&lt;/pre&gt;
Solution:
Manually SSH to the Hobbit client from the Hobbit server at least once and add the Hobbit client's host key to the Hobbit server's known_hosts file when prompted.

You can verify that the ssh tunnels have been successfully created:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ ps -ef | grep ssh
hobbit    2187     1  0 Aug14 ?        00:00:02 ssh -fnNR 1984:hobbit:1984 clientname
hobbit    2805     1  0 Aug14 ?        00:00:02 ssh -fnNR 1984:hobbit:1984 clientname2
&lt;/pre&gt;
You should also see a new column called &quot;ssh-tunnel&quot; generated in the Hobbit server's web interface.

== Mobile phone clients ==

If you want to check your hobbit / Xymon-Status from your mobile phone you can use the following apps:

=== Android ===
XyMon by dot knowledge: http://www.dot-knowledge.de/Home/android/xymon-monitor (There you find a link to the Android market place)

Xydroid by Rune B. Broberg: http://mihtjel.dk/xydroid/ - a recent project of delivering Xymon statuses on Android phones.

#Add cooking oil to wok. Wait a few seconds for oil to heat up.
#Add remaining '''Spice''' ingredients to wok and stir fry for 30-seconds.
#Add '''Chicken/Marinade''' to wok and stir fry for about 4-minutes (until chicken is cooked through).
#Add '''Vegetables''' to wok and stir fry for about 2 or 3-minutes.
#Stir '''Sauce''' and add to wok. After the sauce comes to a boil, cook for about 1-minute (until sauce thickens).
#Stir to coat other ingredients with thickened sauce.
#Pour onto large platter and serve immediately.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Serve with steamed or [[Cookbook:Fried rice|fried rice]].

==Warnings==
* Don't eat the dried, small red chili peppers unless you like spicy-hot foods. They are mainly used to season the pot and are not usually eaten.
* Use care in handling the raw chicken. Wash hands and utensils that come into contact with raw chicken. Don't allow raw chicken or its juices to come into contact with other foods, unless they are to be cooked afterwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The questions posed in Chapter 2. Plant cells are discussed further on this page. Remember, some questions are intended to be thought-provoking and more than one answer may be &quot;correct&quot;. Students and contributors are encouraged to expand upon the discussions here.

 1. Can you think of reasons why macroscopic organisms are multicellular? 

We know that building any structure from small, similar or identical units will confer advantages on that structure over a similar structure molded in one piece, despite the fact that the former approach is likely to be more time consuming to undertake. Consider building a house out of clay (mud), something that is done in many parts of the world where the climate is dry. Typically the mud is attached to other structural elements (called wattle) of sticks or even grasses. In time the mud dries and hardens, forming a shelter that lasts, so long as it is not permitted to get too wet for too long. Yet, such structures have also been built for centuries in very wet places like London and New York.  However, the problem of the dried clay returning to soft mud in a heavy downpour was solved by dividing the clay into small units that could be fired in a kiln to a dryness and hardness that completely resisted rewetting.  We call these units bricks. Using bricks (small units) for construction of walls provided many benefits to the resulting structure: the units could receive special treatment so the resulting structure could be made stronger (and thus taller) and very resistant to weathering.  Constructing from small units meant materials could be made elsewhere, then transported and assembled on the site.  Structures could be designed to be identical to other structures, for more efficiency in construction and use.

Although multicellular organisms are not exactly like brick houses, think of how the advantages of building structures out of bricks can be advantageous properties for an organism as well.   

We believe that life arose as contained chemical reactions in very small structures that reproduced. It is hard to imagine that anything else would be regarded as &quot;living&quot;. Chemical reactions in an open environment, although more or less identical with the reactions carried out within a cell, simply lack permanence or continuity: the reactions run their course until reactants are used up. Our definition of life requires control over such chemical reactions, and the complexity of reactions involved in living systems requires boundaries that separate the life reactions from the outside environment. However, with a membrane (a separating boundary) the area enclosed cannot efficiently increase in size indefinitely.  The larger the volume inside (the bigger the &quot;cell&quot;), the further from the membrane reactions near the middle become. Since reactions inside require access to substances in the environment outside and perhaps removal of useless or harmful substances from inside to outside, a living cell cannot just grow to a large size.

----
5 pirates of different ages have a treasure of 100 gold coins. On their ship, they decide to split the coins using this scheme: the oldest pirate alive will propose how the coins will be distributed among the pirates, and all pirates remaining will vote for or against it. If more than 50% of the pirates vote for it, then the coins will be distributed as such. Otherwise, the pirate proposing the scheme will be thrown overboard, and the process is repeated with the pirates that remain.

Assuming that all 5 pirates are extremely intelligent, rational, greedy, and do not wish to die, (and are rather good at math for pirates) what will happen?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The eldest pirate will propose a 97, 0, 1, 0, 2 split. 

Working backwards, splits in terms of younger to older:

2 Pirates:  Pirate two splits at 100, 0.  Otherwise, and perhaps even then, pirate 1 (the youngest) votes against him and over he goes!

3 Pirates:  Pirate three splits at 0, 1, 99.  Pirate 1 (the youngest) is going to vote against him no matter what (see above), but this way, pirate 2 will vote for him, to get at least one gold out of it.

4 Pirates:  Pirate four splits of 1, 2, 0, 97.  This way, pirate 1 will vote for him, and so will pirate 2 - they're getting more than they would under 3 pirates.

5 Pirates:  Pirate five splits of 2, 0, 1, 0, 97.  This way, pirate 1 will vote for him, and so will pirate 3 - they're both getting better than they would under 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A test devised by pioneering AI researcher [[w:Alan Turing|Alan Turing]] to determine whether or not an AI is &quot;strong&quot;; that is, whether or not it is capable of behaving like a human. As described by Turing, the test consists of an AI and a human being siting in separate rooms. A researcher sits separate from both of them in a different room. The researcher does not know which room houses which entity, yet he can communicate freely with both the AI and the human. If the researcher is incapable of differentiating between the human and the AI, then the AI has &quot;passed&quot; the Turing Test.

----
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 16. Magnoliophyta (II)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
----

The '''Class Liliopsida''' constitutes the monocotyledonous angiosperms and includes some of the largest plant families such as the orchids with some 20,000 species and the grasses with perhaps 15,000 species. In the previous [[Botany/Magnoliophyta|chapter]] we learned how to separate the two major flowering plant groups: the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons, and covered a number of dicot families.  In this chapter, we shall do the same by considering representative monocot families.

The liliopsids are considered to form a monophyletic group evolved from an early dicot. The oldest fossils presumed to be monocot remains date from the Early Cretaceous (Herendeen &amp; Crane, 1995). Features that are generally common to monocots include vascular bundles that are irregularly distributed (in cross-section of the stem), leaves with parallel venation, and flower parts in multiples of three. Although true secondary growth is absent, most growth habits are found in the group including floating and submerged aquatics, lianas, trees, epiphytes, and forbs of all sizes (Hahn, 2005).

== Grasses ==
[[Image:Pennisetum_setaceum-Guinther.jpg|right|400px]]

The second largest (to Orchidaceae) and one of the most successful of families of monocotyledons is the grass family, classified as the '''Family Poaceae''' (or Gramineae) and comprising nearly 10,000 species distributed more widely than any other angiosperm family. This family is also the most important economically, providing species that are the world's staple food supply. The grasses have reduced floral structures compared with most angiosperms for the reason that grasses are almost exclusively pollinated by wind. Therefore, these plants have had no cause to evolve floral structures that are attractive to insect (or other animal) pollinators.  The grasses also have a fairly specific body plan that is immediately recognizable and very successful for colonizing seasonally dry landscapes, yet modifiable to suit a wide range of ecological conditions.
Bor (1960) stated: 
:The amazing diversity of shapes, sizes, texture and so on in the various parts that make up the vegetative and the reproductive shoot is alike the admiration and exasperation of the taxonomist.  It can be said... that in no other family of monocotyledons, or dicotyledons for that matter, has a relatively simple structure been so altered in the process of evolution as to produce the amazing wealth of forms known to us.  It is as if Evolution, in an excess of exuberance, had added this, subtracted that, enlarged this, suppressed that, in fact tried out every possible combination and permutation of characters to produce a family as complicated and as difficult [taxonomically] as, if not more difficult than, any other.  

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Poaceae|Poaceae]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;)

=== Anatomy ===
Grasses have fibrous roots and three kinds of stems: culms, rhizomes, and stolons. The '''culm''' is the main aerial shoot to which leaves and flower head are attached. The culm is a rounded or slightly flattened stem with one or more solid joints known as ''nodes''. The leaves are attached at the nodes and if the stem is not simple but branched, branches arise only at nodes. Roots may also develop from a node where the node comes into contact with the ground (as in decumbent and prostrate stems).  The portion of the stem between the nodes is called the ''internode'', and is usually hollow in temperate zone grasses and solid in tropical grasses (Rotar, 1968). All or a portion of an internode may be surrounded by the basal part of the leaf known as the ''sheath''.  

A '''rhizome''' is a modified stem that grows underground. Rhizomes are jointed (thus distinguishable from roots) with bladeless leaves (''scales'') arising from the joints. Rhizomes enable the grass plant to spread horizontally as new culms develop vertically from the joints. Thus, grasses with extensive rhizome development will form a turf rather than distinct tufts or bunches.

A '''stolon''' is a stem that creeps across the surface of the ground, and is really a basal branch of the culm that will develop roots and shoots from some or all of its nodes. Like a rhizome, a stolon results in a spreading or turf forming grass plant.

[[Image:Ruwbeemdgras Poa trivialis ligula.jpg|right|thumb|270px|''Poa trivialis'' showing membranous ligules pressed against culm]]
Grasses display two types of leaves: (1) green leaves consisting of a sheath and blade, and (2) reduced leaves consisting of only a sheath. With but a few exceptions, the green leaves arise at nodes alternately up the culm.  Leaves that are concentrated near the base where the internodes are very short are termed ''basal leaves''; leaves arising at nodes along an elongated culm are ''cauline leaves''. These vegetative leaves typically surround the culm as a ''sheath'', then diverge outward (at the &quot;collar&quot;) as a long narrow ''blade'' with longitudinal parallel venation. If the veins are conspicuous, the leaf is striate; if the veins are raised, the leaf is ribbed.
  
The '''sheath''' of the leaf surrounds and protects the shoot. In some species, the sheath extends beyond the next node, so that consecutive leaf sheaths overlap, hiding the nodes. The longitudinal edges of the sheath may overlap, completely surrounding the culm, or the sheath may be tubular (the margins connate).  The upper end of the sheath, known as the sheath mouth is the collar on the lower (outer) surface that may be produced into short appendages called ''auricles''. On the inner, upper surface of the leaf, between the sheath and the blade, is an outgrowth called a ''ligule''. This may be a flap of membranous tissue or simply a fringe of hairs, an inconspicuous rim, or even absent all together, marked only by dark tissue.

Although there is variation in leaf '''blade''' shape, most grasses have linear-shaped leaves that are many times longer than wide, with margins that are parallel then taper to a point at the apex. Grasses that grow in shady places may have lanceolate or even ovate leaf blades. 

Flowers of grasses are borne in an inflorescence or flower head which terminates the culm and other branches of the stem.  Smaller units of the inflorescence are called '''spikelets''' and these are arranged on one or more branches in a wide variety of different ways to which the standard terminology for inflorescences can be applied, but using the spikelet instead of the individual flower. Thus:

* In a '''panicle''', spikelets are carried on branches of the axis.
:The panicle can be either open or dense and crowded, with the branches so short that they are concealed by the spikelets, forming a ''false spike''. 
* In a '''spike''', the spikelets are carried, unstalked, directly on an unbranched axis, called a ''rachis''.
* In a '''raceme''' some or all of the spikelets are attached to the rachis by stalks called ''pedicels''.

===  Neuron Communication===

Communication between neurons relies on molecules called neurotransmitters.  Without
going into the details of this process, it suffices to say that for a neuron to transmit
information to another neuron, it must release a neurotransmitter in the small gap between
the two neurons, called a synapse.

More than 300 different neurotransmitters are known to be used in one role or another
by the human brain.  Three of them in particular, ''serotonin'', ''dopamine'', and, ''norepinephrine'' have
been identified as playing a major part in the physiology of clinical depression although others may also be important.

In a variety of clinical trials it has been shown that the use of drugs that mimic or affect how neurotransmitters are produced, destroyed, and moved in the brain can have verifiable effects on depression.

For example many popular anti-depressants are SSRIs. They decrease the amount of serotonin that neurons remove from synapses.

Although the effective use of these drugs shows that depression can be affected by physical changes in the Brain no one is sure exactly how these medication are effective.

Depression affects the area of the brain responsible among others for memory, learning,
and tasks that require concentration and organisation [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00083A00-318C-1F30-9AD380A84189F2D7].

== Suicide ==
&quot;Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem&quot;.  There is much wisdom to this sentence, and it is probably the best advice you can give a depressed person.  Unfortunately, during that critical stage is difficult for them to visualise the temporary nature of the problem, and suicide is not uncommon.  If you a have a friend or a loved one going through that stage of a depression, do take the possibility seriously and do what you can to prevent it from happening.  In particular, make sure they are being handled by a competent professional. Fortunately, especially if people are young, this stage will not last very long, typically just a few days or weeks.

== The Role of Sports ==

The role played by sports and physical exercise in depression is far more complex than either
the ''sports good'' and ''sports bad'' mantras would lead one to assume.  Moreover,
I would say that this is one area where our current understanding of depression is sorely
incomplete.  Consequently, beware that much of the material in this section is conjectural.
I am well aware that most people's gut  will be to dismiss my conjectures as pure rubbish,
since &quot;everyone knows that sports are good for you&quot;.  A couple of years ago I would have
whole-heartedly agreed with them, but I have learnt otherwise in the meantime.  Furthermore,
read carefully and you will see that I do not deny that sports can be good for you.  I simply
add a poignant ''however'' to the issue of sports and depression.

This issue is complex enough to warrant a number of subsections.  I will first make
a distinction between the temporary improvement of mood brought by sports, versus
the long-term actual improvement of the depression.  Second, I will put forth the
tentative mechanism of why moderate amounts of exercise can help to recover from
depression.  Third, I will describe the caveats of doing exercise to recover from
a depression. At last, I will describe a real-world example of how sports can be
used to make people be more active during a depression, with the drawback that
recovery takes longer.

Sports or exercise is challenging for people experiencing depression primarily because of the engagement of mind, body and spirit. For example, persons depressed as a result of sexual trauma have spent an unknown length of time separated intellectually from their body(ies). One exercise that allows for a kind of autonomy while truly strengthening the body and connecting mind and body is lap swimming. Here an individual can focus on breathing as one would while engaged in meditation. There are also various kinds of disguises involved in swimming starting with swim goggles. The combination of the &quot;mask&quot; and the single swim lane results in a safe environment. 

Swimming requires regular participation. The outcomes (for me) are still being recognized, but the main effort to connect or to reconnect the mind and the body through a concentrated routine of swimming for exercise are being realized.

=== Feeling Good vs. Actual Improvement ===

''Sports alone can lift up a depression'', says one of the most common pieces of advice about
the illness.  Unfortunately, this statement is grossly incomplete, often tragically so.  If you
have properly understood the roles played by adrenaline and cortisol (take a look again at
the section on [[../The Stress System/]]
to refresh your memory), you already have a glimpse
of why this is such misleading advice.  Exercise can indeed momentarily ''lift up'' the
subjective feeling of a depressed person, but that is all caused by adrenaline.  It is
therefore critical to make the distinction between the momentary mood improvement caused
by exercise (which is undisputed), and whether it translates into an actual improvement
of the underlying depression.

Please refer back to [[../The Stress System/]].
There I have speculated on recent findings
which indicate that a process known as ''neurogenesis'' (&quot;neuron birth&quot;) is implicated
in recovery from depression.  This process takes about three weeks to occur*, which also
happens to be the average time required for antidepressants to have an effect.  This
coincidence has led some to hypothesise that antidepressants work by stimulating neurogenesis
[http://www.biopsychiatry.com/newbraincell/].  The point of this digression is to emphasise that anything which has
a positive effect on recovery from depression is likely to require at least three weeks to work and will often take longer to be noticeable. One should therefore be a bit suspicious of any cure which seems to work instantly, as is the
case of exercise.

Now the question is: does exercise also have a long-term positive effect on depression,
or is it all a short-term illusion?

=== Why Moderate Exercise May Sometimes Help ===

A '''moderate''' amounts of
aerobic exercise seem to help many depressed and healthy individuals.


At last, a word of advice.  '''If you think you have a depression, you should seek professional
help'''.  It might be tempting for some people to try to exercise their way out of a depression,
but chances are you might actually be making your condition worse.  See next section for details.

=== Caveats of Treating Depression with Exercise ===

Looking back on [[:Image:Demystifying_Depression-Cortisol.png|Figure 2]] from
[[../The Stress System/]],
some people might suggest that a person with a severe
depression could avoid the ''crashing down'' simply by exercising every single day.
In a sense, as soon as your body begins to crash, you simply do more exercise to rev it
up again.  You could therefore reap the positive temporary effects of exercise, and hopefully
avoid the negative side.  This routine &quot;sort of&quot; works, but is also extremely dangerous,
as I will proceed to explain.

The major problem is that having too many stress hormones flowing through veins has a
negative effect on sleep.  And sleep is crucial for recovery.  So people with more
severe depressions who exercise every day will not sleep as much as they should,
and the recovery will therefore take longer (see [[../A Real World Example|next section]] for a real world example).
More seriously, if the amount of
exercise is too high, they might even regress.  Even more seriously, if the underlying
depression worsens, people might be tempted to increase the amount of exercise
to compensate, which will quickly lead them into a very dangerous downwards spiral.
In a sense, advising a seriously depressed person to exercise is like telling a drunken
individual that the best way to avoid a hangover is to keep drinking; or advising a heroin
addict that the best way to avoid the withdrawal symptoms is to keep injecting the drug.

This is unfortunately not widely known, but even healthy individuals who exercise
too much can develop the symptoms of a depression.  This is sometimes referred
to as the ''athletic overtraining syndrome'' [http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~acheyne/S_P.html], and by now
you should have understood the basic mechanism of why it arises.

=== A Real World Example ===

At last I will provide you a real world example which illustrates the caveats
of doing sports during depression.  Some companies here in the Netherlands
rely on a sports-intensive routine to put people back to work sooner.  In basic terms,
the routine involves running every single morning for a period between one hour and one
hour and a half.  The running is performed under controlled conditions, to prevent
the heart rate from ever going over 130 beats per minute.   If you understood the role
of sports in depression, you will also realise just how this scheme works: it
basically gets their brains running on adrenaline.  This is not entirely harmless,
as during the recovery period the people will have elevated heart rate and stress hormones
flowing through their veins.  Also, with all that adrenaline
in their systems, they will not sleep as much as they could, which makes a full
recovery last much longer, ''up to three years''.
The advantage of this scheme?  Well, they do begin working (part-time of course)
much sooner than otherwise.

At this point you might be wondering how they do not realise what is really happening.
Remember that adrenaline is an insidious hormone, which makes one feel good even
as it revs up the body, and this scheme requires them to exercise ''every single day without exception''.
Obviously, the idea is to keep them from crashing down from all that adrenaline, and therefore to
prevent them from realising their true status.  Also, there is widespread ignorance
about depression among Dutch GPs, which makes it all the more unlikely that
someone will realise that there is something fishy going on.  Personally, I find
this scheme to be utterly mad.  But then, I am not a Calvinist.

Should you be thinking that this scheme is also a perfectly viable alternative way of curing
a depression&amp;mdash;one which takes longer, is potentially harmful to the general health, '''but'''
does allow one to become active sooner rather than later&amp;mdash;I would even be tempted to agree
with you.  '''However''', I still think that the ultimate choice should reside
with each individual person.  It is their health we are talking about, after all.  These
people should be properly informed of all possible alternatives and the implications of
each one.  This is currently not happening.

== Depression and Ageing ==

You do not see 60-year olds having the same lifestyle as 20-year olds.  Even a 40 or a 30-year
old probably would not be able to accommodate for a long time all the intense living and partying
of their youth.  We naturally accept that our physical abilities decrease slowly with age, and
our brains are no different.  Mind you, in this context I will speak only of the brain's endurance,
not of the general cognitive abilities.  Therefore, do not interpret the graph in Figure 9
as &quot;getting dumber with age&quot;.  (Though it is most likely that cognitive abilities also decrease
with age.  Luckily, the added experience can in large part compensate for that).


[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Ageing.png|none|frame|Figure 9: The maximum normal capacity naturally decreases with age.]]


Bear in mind that I am largely speculating here, but I would not be surprised if the reason
why depression tends to strike first towards the mid 20s (and this is a fact) is related to a dip
in the maximum normal capacity which happens after adolescence.  Many people simply fail
to accommodate for the necessary changes in their lifestyle, and thus find themselves
constantly going over their (now slightly diminished) limits.

Still on the speculation front, consider the fact that people tend to sleep less as they get older.
Could it be related with the graph in Figure 9?  If sleep is indeed fundamental for the brain to
repair itself, and if age cuts down the requirements for the maximum normal capacity, it is not
too far-fetched to imagine that people would therefore require less sleep as they get older.

Speculations aside, do not look with gloom at the graph.  Ageing is not a death sentence
as far as feeling well is concerned.  People do generally accommodate by making changes
to their lifestyle, and remember that depression only arises should you constantly go
over your limits.  Furthermore, in percentage terms, the natural decrease might not
even be large.  (Unfortunately, our current understanding of depression does not yet
allow us to make precise quantifications.
See the section [[../Quantifying Depression/]] for details).

== The Genetic Link ==

I have not brought up the genetic link up till now, but it is without doubt one of the
primary risk factors.  Depression seems to run in families, and even after the environmental
effects are taken into account, the genetic link is still clearly there [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00083A00-318C-1F30-9AD380A84189F2D7].
Some studies have shown that approximately one out of every three people have a genetic
predisposition to develop a depression.  However, like in many other
cases, the interplay between genes and environment is also relevant for depression:
only about half of those with the genetic predisposition will actually develop the
illness.
In any case, should you have cases of depression among close blood relatives, do take it as
a warning that you too might be at risk.

'''Note:''' A person is most closely related to their siblings, their parents, and their children.
In either case, you share with them approximately 50% of your genes (for which there is variance among the breeding population).
Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nephews, and nieces are next: the shared portion is approximately 25%.
In these cases, the conditional probability of having a depression knowing that your relative had a depression
is higher than the above mentioned absolute probability of about one third.
For relatives farther beyond the genetic proximity measure (cousins, etc.), the conditional probability approaches
the absolute probability for the general population, and is therefore not quite as relevant as an indicator.

== Is Depression on the Rise? ==

Is the incidence of depression really on the rise?  Statistics seem to point that way [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression],
and considering the risk factors, that should not be altogether surprising.  The truth
is that many modern hobbies are actually very demanding on the brain.  Should a person
pull long hours at work and then come home to face an equally demanding hobby, there
is a very good chance that they are pushing the brain past its limit.

This is likely to strike a chord with the Kuro5hin crowd:  surfing the web and blogging
should be seen as work as far as the brain is concerned.  In a similar note,
''information overload'' is not just a fancy buzzword: it is a factor contributing
to the development of depression.  The list is long: mobile phones, news tickers,
instant messaging, etc.  We seem to be very good at devising ways to overload our brains.

On a more positive note, if one considers the current understanding of the problem, plus
the available means to treat it, making serious clinical depression a thing of the past
is well within our reach.  What is required?  Just getting the message across!  Sadly,
it may prove difficult to overcome centuries of prejudice surrounding mental illness.

== Quantifying Depression ==

You will certainly have noticed the lack of scale in all the graphs herein shown.  The truth
is that research into depression has not yet reached the quantification stage.  This is a pity,
as much of the prejudice (especially in getting official recognition for the problem) could
be avoided if there were tests which could estimate the seriousness of a depression.  Which
is not to say that such tests are not possible.  In fact, in this section I intend to propose
the means by which they could be developed.

At this point you might be thinking that blood pressure already provides a fine estimation.
This is only partially true.  Foremost, several factors other than stress levels have an effect on
blood pressure.  Furthermore, blood pressure is a static measure, unable to differentiate
between the state of ''deep depression / low activity'' and the state of
''mild depression / high activity''.  This is an especially crucial distinction in the
recovery phase of a depression.  (Blood pressure is more reliable during the buildup phase
towards a depression precisely because the activity variable tends to be always high,
as people struggle to maintain a normal lifestyle).

My suggested test also relies on blood pressure, but adds a dynamic measure of that variable.
In short, the idea is to build a graph showing how blood pressure progresses with time as
the test subject performs a high-concentration activity.  Figure 10 shows what one would
be likely to expect from a healthy individual, a mildly depressed one, and one more deeply
depressed.


[[Image:Demystifying_Depression-Quantification_Test.png|none|frame|Figure 10: The blood pressure response curve for three individuals with varying degrees of a depression.]]


Note that a depressed individual will typically not only have a higher blood pressure
at rest, but more importantly, a steeper response curve.  This could be the basis
for developing an objective test of the seriousness of a depression.  It would also
be extremely valuable for tracking the progress of the illness.

The test activity is an open question.  I would suggest a test which would require
both high concentration and short-term memory.  In my personal experience, I noticed
that the simple game ''Concentration'' (the one where you are supposed to pick pairs of cards
out of a large set of unturned cards) provokes an almost immediate response.  It might
be a good candidate for the test.

Obviously, there is a fair amount of noise which makes a precise measurement harder.
How well the test subject slept the night before is one variable hard to control.
Likewise for the degree to which they are enjoying the activity. Furthermore, other
variables such as current medication and time of day would also interfere.

Another advantage of an objective test would be an estimation of how much time would
be required until the test subject could be considered cured.  I realise that there
are several factors interfering with the progress of the illness, but given a large
population of test subjects, one could compensate for factors such as age.  It is
only a matter of statistics, after all.  In any case, a rough estimation is a lot
better than no estimation at all.

At last, one small note of hope: there is research underway which uses imaging techniques
such as fMRI to look directly into the brain and see the changes caused by depression.
Unfortunately, it might take quite a long time before such research is put into practical use.
The test I proposed is low-tech, potentially a lot cheaper, and could be developed immediately.

== The Burnout Syndrome ==

There is much talk (at least in the Netherlands) about the so-called ''burnout syndrome''.
And as is often the case, there is more noise than signal in this discussion.  First of all,
in medical terms, there is no such thing as a burnout.  There are depressions, period.
A ''burnout'' is just a depression whose causes are mostly work-related.  Remember
that the person's attitude towards the task at hand plays an important role in the
biochemistry of the brain.  Should you have a job that you find boring and repetitive,
or should the surrounding circumstances (overbearing boss, bad corridor atmosphere)
make you feel uncomfortable about going to work every day, a depression is likely
to develop.

Second, when a person is said to be ''burned out'', what they have is a lingering
depression from which they have not yet fully recovered.  Also, there are plenty of mildly
''burned out'' individuals who have never received any kind of treatment. They often
drone through life for years before the problem is diagnosed.

I made a section out of this issue precisely because the general attitude in this country
is to dismiss ''burnout'' as just a psychological problem, thus being handled with
a lot of complacency, or just ignored.  This is all the more tragic if one considers the
statistics which show the Netherlands to have some of the highest percentages of people
affected by this problem.  There is indisputably also a psychological component to
''burnout'', but it goes far deeper than that.

== Facing the Prejudice ==

Most of the advice contained in both instalments of this document is based on one very important
assumption: society will give you the means to recover.  Unfortunately, this is still far
from being the case.  A seriously depressed person '''cannot''' constantly go over their
limits if their brains are to be given any chance of recovering.  Take the practical example
of restarting work: one has to build up the activity slowly, in accordance with the increase
of the maximum capacity of the brain (remember [[:Image:Demystifying_Depression-Recovery.png|Figure 6]] from
[[../The Recovery Process/]]).  Obviously, this requires
some sort of official recognition of the particularities of depression.  In theory, this is part
of the law and recognised in most civilised countries.  In practise, things can be very different.

Do not assume that because you live in an otherwise tolerant and socially-minded society,
depression will also be well understood.  Bear in mind that other factors come into play,
most importantly the fact that cure takes '''a long time''', which means it
is also very expensive for an employer.  Also, the overall stance towards mental illness
might be biased by the prevailing religious substrate, influencing attitudes even of
non-religious people: take the example of Calvinism here in the Netherlands.
All in all, when depression is the subject, do not be surprised when society shows its ugly side.
The good old advice of stashing away some six-months worth of salary for a rainy day is
very much applicable in the case of depression: you will need it.

Interestingly enough, I see no reason&amp;mdash;other than prejudice and bad will&amp;mdash;why the state
of affairs should remain like this.  Take again a look at the section on
[[../Quantifying Depression/]]: it is well within
our means to devise reliable objective tests to assess the seriousness of a depression
and/or to determine when a person is again fit enough to work.
Depression itself provides more than enough misery. It is inhumane and cruel
that the problem should be compounded by lack of recognition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Solar power==

* Uncaptured solar energy can convert itself to wind and wave energy, and of course warm the atmosphere.  Large scale solar collection systems are few.  One experimental version generated enough power from stored heat collected in a large &quot;ball&quot; containing salt heated to the melting point that they could have generated enough power for a small city a few hours after dark.  Larger scale under ground storage was not mentioned.

* Solar electric panel are presently over the 10% efficiency point.  They actually are more efficient on cold days.

==Wind power==

* Wind power systems tend to work best, and so most cost effective, where the wind is often at 30 miles per hour, or so.

==Biomass==

* There are reports that it's possible to convert carbohydrates directly to hydrocarbons (Huber ''et al.'', Production of Liquid Alkanes by Aqueous-Phase Processing of Biomass-Derived Carbohydrates, Science 3 June 2005: 1446-1450)

==Wave power==

* A very conservative estimate of the amount of energy that could be captured from a 6 feet wave across its length and 100 feet wide is 100,000 watts.  The north-west Pacific is often considered a storm generator and high wave are not uncommon.  (Kayaks are the favored form of water transport by the natives.)  A sea mount nearing the surface off the coast of California is noted as a shipping hazard due to its high waves.

==Tidal power==

* There are places in the world, particularly as one get farther from the equator, where tidal extremes are very significant.  The west shore of the Korean peninsula and Norway's fiords are noted for the effect.

==Geothermal power==

* The Earth's interior has a radioactive source that some figure is generating the equivalent of 10,000 atomic power plants.  Scientists have noted by monitoring the speed and intensity of earthquake energy propagating through the earth that it tends to rise in plumes coming up through the mantle and sometimes penetrating the surface to generate volcanoes and sometimes form islands like Hawaii.  They can note this because some forms of earthquake energy does not like to propagate through molten material.

[[Image:Cuillere de tapenade.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tapenade]]

'''''Tapenade''''' is a traditional provencale paste of olives, anchovies and capers. Although some versions exclude the capers, the word ''tapenade'' has its origins in the provencale ''tapena'' (caper).

== Ingredients ==
*6 [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]]
*1 Tablespoon [[Cookbook:Caper|capers]], rinsed and drained
*1 cup (240 ml) pitted black [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]]
*Extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

== Procedure ==

# Blend the anchovies, capers and olives.  
# For this a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] is better than the traditional [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]].
# Add a few Tablespoons olive oil until smooth.

Serve on [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]] as an [[Wikipedia:Amuse-bouche|amuse-bouche]], or with boiled [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], or with [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|goats cheese]] and roasted [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|peppers]], or on [[Cookbook:Pasta|potato gnocchi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">I may have made some mistakes when translating the IPL ROM code to an algorithm.  In particular, I'm not sure that the ''cmp'' instruction on the SPC700 is doing what I think it should do.  I believe that a sequence like:

 cmp y,$f4

should compute (''y'' - the contents of $f4) and set the N flag if the result is negative.  This instruction sequence is used to compare the SPC's counter (in ''y'') with the counter value sent by the SNES (in $f4) to check for the end of a block.  Thus, when I send a counter value to terminate the block the SNES is sending, I expect I can send $ff, which is greater than or equal to any value the SPC counter is holding, which therefore should terminate the block, if the SPC follows the algorithm I have outlined in the tutorial.  Instead, when tracing with Geiger's Snes9x debugger, I am seeing the SPC compare y (containing a low number) with address $f4, which seems to contain $ff, and it is ''not'' setting the N flag.  Thus, sending $ff causes the program to lock up.  But, for some reason, adding a small (&lt; $80) value to the counter works, even though this should cause the counter to roll over in some cases, which should make the N flag unpredictable.  If anyone could help clarify what is going on, I'd be grateful.

[[User:Jclee|Joe Lee]] 14:40, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:The cmp does compute y-($f4), but the N flag is simply copied from bit 7 of the result. So if you want the N flag, you should use a value only slightly bigger than Y, e.g. Y+2. $00 - $02 = $fe = N flag set. $7f - $81 = $fe = N flag set. $ff - $01 = $fe = N flag set.

== needs major rewrite ==
I have several problems with this page.  It is unnecessary long, unorganized, not specific enough, and contradicts itself on several occasions.

First of all the SPC loading routine does not match the SNES loading routine.  In the SPC loading routine, it says that the spc700 waits for the 65816 to load $cc into audio0, in the SNES loading routine, the 65816 never loads $cc into audio0, implying that the spc700 would be waiting forever.

Another problem is the artical tells you to do it one way without an explanation of why it works.  The SNES loading routine should just say to load this here, load that there, but instead it tells you to do some calculations with a counter that isn't hardware specific.  Then it says &quot;there are some problems with this ''method''.&quot;  If there are problems with this method, why is this method still on here?  And why is this artical explaning &quot;methods&quot; when the purpose of hardware documents are to show facts?

-- 20:44, 25 May 2010 75.57.185.158

Thanks for the feedback.  The textual description of the SNES loading routine does indeed have an incorrect constant, which is why the routines don't seem to match.  Note that the assembly code is correct, however, and does send $cc to audio0.

The &quot;problems with the routine&quot; are not fatal -- as noted in the article, it is used successfully in open-source demos.  They are merely problems using the routine in the context of this particular program.  Perhaps the phrasing could be improved to make this more clear.

As far as the other feedback, it seems you have misinterpreted the purpose of the page.  As it says at the top, this is tutorial, not a hardware reference.  The goal is to instruct the reader on how create a program that actually plays something on the SPC, without getting into the details of the DSP, SPC assembly, or advanced SNES/SPC communications.  It sounds like you want a page like [http://romhack.wikia.com/wiki/Spc700.rom the one on Wikia] that just explains how the IPL ROM works, but of course this by itself will not leave you with a program that makes sound.  Note that that page also describes &quot;a counter that isn't hardware specific&quot;, because the counter is part of the protocol, and the protocol is effectively part of the hardware, since it is loaded on the SPC automatically on reboot.

I'm not sure what to make of the twin criticisms that the page is too long and that it doesn't explain itself enough, since the length is directly due to the amount of explanation.  If you know how to reduce the length while improving the explanation, I'd love to hear more about it.

[[File:Ambrosia salad.jpg|thumb|An Ambrosia fruit salad]]

==The Rise of Fascism, Socialism and Communism After World War Two==
===Introduction===
The beginning of the Twentieth Century saw the rise of an entirely new political environment in Western nations.  The previous century had seen the Industrial Revolution replace agriculture as the primary economic model in Western nations, a change accompanied by huge social, political and demographic shifts.  Populations which had once been largely rural and engaged in farming or small handicraft work shifted to urban districts filled with factory workers.  The new industrial economies created great wealth, but also much alienation, sharpening divisions between economic classes.  Workers' movements agitating for better living and working conditions emerged in many nations, and came under the influence of intellectual leaders, largely drawn from the middle and upper ranks of Western society.  Some of these leaders pursued radical and Utopian visions of what society should become.

===Socialism===
Socialist societies had existed before the term Socialism was used and there exist many flavours of Socialism, one of which is Communism. The main ideas of Socialism are, &quot;focusing on general welfare rather than individualism, on co-operation rather than competition, and on laborers rather than on industrial or political leaders and structures&quot; this movement was mainly as a result of the poor working conditions the industrial Revolution ushered in due to the fact there were no labor laws enforcing minimum wage, child labor, or working environments.(see [[w:Socialism#History_of_socialism|Wikipedia]] for further information).

===Communism===
Communism was given a common structure through Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' book, ''The Communist Manifesto''. According to Marx, society is meant to go through phases of evolution, beginning with a hunter-gatherer society, followed by Feudalism, Capitalism, Socialism, and finally Communism. Marx believed that the final stage could only be achieved through revolution. Although ''The Communist Manifesto'' was written in 1848, Marx was not far off with his presumption. After decades as a radical movement on the edges of the political scene, Communism burst onto the world stage in 1917, when the October Revolution in Russia brought the Bolshevik wing of the Russian socialist movement, led by Vladimir Il'ych Lenin, to power. Czarist Russia's military failures, first in the Russo-Japanese War, and then the great hardships of World War I, discredited the Russian monarchy and opened the door first to a moderate liberal government replacing the Czar.  Lenin's movement quickly displaced it in turn.  As one of the radical visionaries mentioned previously, Lenin and his cohorts envisioned a complete reordering of Russian and potentially all European society under strict Marxist lines.

Communism is concerned with a complete overhaul of the Capitalist system. One of Communism's goals is to create a classless society in which all members are equal both politically and economically. This is exemplified by the phrase commonly associated with Communism, &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.&quot; In other words, members of society will be expected to provide all that they can by their ability both intellectually and physically, and in return people will receive the benefits according to their need. For example, if 'x' was a doctor, x would be expected to put in all of his skills and effort into being a doctor and in return he would get comparatively little due to his lack of real need. Assuming x is an able fit doctor, x does not need as much as 'y'; a disabled child. Y puts into society as much as he can, being very little, but gets out comparatively a lot. Economically, all factors of production are controlled by the commune so that they will ensure the fair distribution of resources, &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;.

===Fascism===
Fascism was founded in Italy by Benito Mussolini, who began his political career in Socialist circles but came to embrace the idea of an authoritarian, nationalist &quot;corporate state&quot; to achieve his ideals.  Unlike Lenin, Mussolini's ideology definitely did not include international revolution, stressing instead the unity and glory of the Italian nation and the dangers posed to the nation and its culture by Communist-inspired workers' revolt.  Fascism, though a radical movement, emphasized discipline and devotion to a birth nation rather than fighting for class interests.  This made Fascism far more palatable to traditional elements of society such as business interests and the church, who saw in it a means to organize the working and middle classes to defend their interests against Communism.  Mussolini chose the title ''Duce'' (leader) and modelled his image on the emperors of ancient Rome, developing a &quot;cult of personality&quot; around himself.

His beliefs influenced many during the mid-Twentieth Century, namely Adolf Hitler, Britain's Oswald Moseley and Spain's General Franco. Even Britain's Winston Churchill was an early admirer of Mussolini's rule in Italy.  Most people associate Fascism with Hitler; however, Hitler's National Socialism differed in important respects. Similarly to Communism, Fascism took control of the economy with the inauguration of many organizations to control output and prices amongst other things. This was in line with Mussolini's belief and aim of creating economic self-sufficiency. 

For his part, Hitler succeeded in this endeavour because he was able to rearm Germany and once World War II began, was able to keep the country functioning. Hitler's political movement, National Socialism, incorporated elements of all three of these movements, but was unique for its anti-Semitic focus and its devotion to the ideal of the Aryan (northern European) race as a superior race, an idea absent from other forms of Fascism.  Hitler and Mussolini both looked at the example of Russia to formulate their rule, however. [[w:Valeriano Weyler#Cuba and the concentration camps|Concentration camps first appeared during the Boer war]], but their escalated use by the Soviets may have impressed the Nazis who took their use to fiendish heights. Fascism also engaged in imperialism and the expansion of territory; Mussolini invaded Ethiopia while Hitler invaded the rest of Europe and North Africa.

===Conclusion===
The importance of these three political theories can be seen simply by looking at the history of the Twentieth Century. The First World War was the end of the &quot;Old World&quot;. A &quot;New World&quot; had dawned. From 1917, Russia became &quot;Communist&quot;, although a more accurate word would be Stalinist. This caused political polarisation as soon as the First World War was over. Trade was halted with the Soviet Union and it was only until 1924 when the British Labour government recognised it, that the Soviet Union began trading with world powers. Only the rise of Fascism in Italy, Spain, Germany, Romania and other countries did we see the focus weaken on the Soviet Union. Many nations realised the threat Fascism posed to the world and it was only until the outbreak of the Second World War that the world actually took action against it. As soon as the West's fight against Fascism ended in 1945, the fight against Communism commenced with the beginning of the Cold War. 

As we can see, the Twentieth Century can be seen as a period of flirtation with new political ideals that caused the world to be politically split for over half a century, starting with the end of the Second World War, and ending with the end of the Cold War.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like most pocketpc's with WIFI, the Loox 720 can use VOIP services such as Skype.  In fact the Loox is specifically designed to exploit this exciting new development by the inclusion of two speakers, one large for music and alarms, and one small, placed on the top of the unit close to your ear if you held the device to your face.  Unfortunately the Loox 720 did not expose the controls to this small speaker.  This led to a very poor performance with VOIP applications unless a headset was used.  This problem has now been rectified with the use of an application called '''OzLooxSpeaker''' by Oz, which allows the selective deactivation of the main speaker, allowing the exclusive use of the small top earphone for use mainly with VOIP software, but also for any other reason you would rather hold your Loox up to your head.

Its available for download on the [http://www.firstloox.org/ Firstloox.org] website [http://www.firstloox.org/index.php?categoryid=3&amp;p13_fileid=75 here].

== Related Models ==

The Pocket Loox 720 was released alongside the mid-range Pocket Loox 710, which contains most of the advanced features of the 720 but with slightly lower specifications.

In January 2005 the Pocket Loox 718, the 3rd member of the 7xx series, was released. Apart from the lack of a built-in camera, it is identical to the Pocket Loox 720.

== Community ==

An active community grew around this device, mainly in the forums of [http://www.firstloox.org FirstLoox.org] where multiple further discoveries and enhancements of the device's capabilities took place e.g. discovery of Audio out via the cradle, Audio in via the headphone socket, and independent activation of the VoIP speaker.

== Getting the most from your Loox ==

In most cases getting the best from your device will require installed additional software, which is usually downloadable from the Internet.  To install this software you will usually need to double-click on the downloaded file on your desktop computer while your handheld device is in the cradle.  If your downloaded file however ends in '''.cab'''  you will need to copy this file to your handheld device (most simply by placing it in your &quot;Synchronised Files&quot; folder) and click on it on your PocketPC using Explorer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Loox 720 comes equipped with an adequate built-in microphone at the base of the unit.  The range and quality is however limited.  If you wish to use the Loox 720 to record a lecture or interview, you may want to use an external microphone.  This is possible through the inclusion of Audio-In via the headphone jack.  It requires a 4-conductor jack audio jack with mic input currently know to be available at [http://pc-mobile.net/loox.htm PC-Mobile] to use with your choice of 3.5mm microphone.

__NOTOC__
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Confections|Confections]]

'''Peanut Brittle''' is a sugar based hard candy, with peanuts embedded in it. 
 
==Ingredients==
* 1 cup granulated white sugar
* 1/2 cup light corn syrup
* 1/4 teaspoon salt (omit if using salted peanuts)
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 cup shelled peanuts - raw (roasted may be used, see Notes, below).
* 2 tablespoons butter, softened
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
* 1 teaspoon baking soda (optional, see Notes, below).

==Procedure==
#Grease a 9&quot; x 12&quot; cookie sheet. Set aside until needed.
#Over medium heat, in a heavy 2-qt saucepan, bring the sugar, corn syrup, salt, and water to a boil. 
#Attach a candy thermometer to the sauce pan with the tip in the mixture.
#Continue heating,stiring occasionally, until the mixture reaches 250 degrees F.
#Add raw peanuts to the mixture. (Roasted peanuts are not recommended. If used, these must be added at a later stage of cooking to prevent burning).
#Continue heating and stiring gently until temperature reaches 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
#If you are using roasted peanuts (not recommended), stir these into the mixture now.
#Remove from heat.
#Add butter and (optional)vanilla extract. Stir in quickly.
#Add baking soda and stir very quickly.  The volume of the mixture will double as bubbles form throughout. Be sure the soda is evenly mixed in and does not collect in one spot.
#Pour mixture onto cookie sheet.
#Using a fork or wooden spoon, spread the mixture evenly across the entire surface of the 9&quot; x 12&quot; cookie sheet.
#Allow to cool to room temperature.
#Break peanut brittle into bite size pieces.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The use of a candy thermometer will insure consistency between your batches of candy. Alternatively, 250 degrees F. can be determined by dropping a small amount of the hot mixture from a spoon or fork. When a string (filament) forms and curls back up toward the fork, the mixture is 250 degrees F. The mixture has reached 300 degrees F. when a small drop of the mixture forms an amber blob in cold water.
*Baking soda adds an &quot;easier bite&quot; to the peanut brittle, causing it to break when less force is applied. It also causes the sugar base around the peanuts to be opaque. It does this by &quot;foaming up&quot; and introducing small bubbles in the sugar syrup. If you desire a clearer almost transparent sugar base around the peanuts and a &quot;harder bite&quot;, reduce or omit the baking soda.
*If you use roasted peanuts instead of raw, be careful not heat the mixture above 300-degrees F. or the peanuts may taste burned. Roasted peanuts can also be added at the end of cooking to prevent burning.
*If you use salted peanuts, omit the salt in the recipe.
*See also [[Cookbook:Microwave Peanut Brittle|Microwave Peanut Brittle]]

==Warnings==
*Be very careful while working with boiling sugar mixtures, as they can cause severe burns.

==Bong tutorial==
Hi. In case you were wondering, I assimilated the bong tutorial, along with many others, into [[DIY]] because it probably wouldn't have survived upcoming [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote|policy changes.]] Unfortunately, it's future is still uncertain. &amp;mdash;[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 22:32, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Triddle. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Triddle~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

You intend to fly around the world starting from an island with any amount of identical planes and an indefinite supply of fuel. Each of the planes can go exactly half around the world with one supply of fuel. Planes flying next to each other can exchange any amount of fuel which takes no time. Also turning around and refueling takes no time for a plane.

Given that you cannot land any plane anywhere but on the island and no plane is to be crashed, what is the minimum amount of planes that you need to take one of them around the world?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The minimum is three. Two planes obviously do not suffice. A sequence for three planes is:

Start three planes from the island. After going 1/8 around one plane refuels the two others with 1/4 of its tank, leaving it with 1/4 of the tank which is precisely enough to take that plane home. The other planes have a full tank again. Reaching 1/4 around one of the planes transfers 1/4 tank of fuel to the other one, leaving it with 1/2 tank again taking it precisely home.
The remaining plane is the circling one and is full at 1/4 and can go to 3/4 with that fuel. The first returning plane refuels and start off the other way meeting the circling plane at its 3/4 position, where the circling plane is empty and the meeting one is half empty. Sharing their fuel they have both 1/4 tank left which can take them to the 7/8 position. The remaining plane has arrived there in the meanwhile with 3/4 tank giving 1/4 to the other now empty planes. All three planes have now 1/4 and can return home.

What a trip!

----
Two Planes( A &amp; B suppose).Both planes will fly together,one plane(A) will transfer the half of its fuel to other(B) at 1/4 the distance and come back,the second(B) will complete the trip up to 3/4 then first(A) plane should start flying other way round and at 1/4 transfer  any amount of fuel between 1/4 to 1/2 of the full tank to B and both planes will land at island safetly.

The error in the above thinking is that the first tranfer amounts to a 1/4 tank, which allows plane B only to reach the 1/2 + 1/8 position which is not the 3/4 position as claimed. Recall here that a full tank with amount A  (being a fraction between 0 and 1) will last for a fraction of A/2 of the trip distance. -sboehringer
----
Regarding solution 2:

Plane A cannot transfer any fuel to Plane B at 1/4 the distance, because that will leave it with less than half a tank, and it will not be able to return to the island.  This problem is similar to the jeep problem, except that you can refuel from the other direction, and it can be shown that 2 planes will not suffice.  (Plane A delivers 1/3 of a fuel tank to plane B after exhausting 1/3 of its fuel tank and returns to the island empty.  Plane B is then able to fly for 4/3 of a tank, which only takes it to the 2/3 mark, while plane A can only perform the same refueling in the other direction for 1/3 of its tank, which is 1/6 of the flight, leaving a 1/6 gap.

The first solution is correct.
----
Solution 3.
Split the whole circumference in to 12 units. Each plane has a full tank capacity to reach 6 units. Start two planes A and B travel 2 units , transfer the 2 unit fuel to plane A and use the remaining 2 units to come back. now plane A would be able to travel 8 units. using Plane B and C start the other direction at 2 unit distance transfer 2 unit fuel to plane C and plane B returns back home for refueling. plane B travels two more unit transfers the 2 units to plane A and now plan A and C would travel together to come back to two units short of destination. Now plane B can travel two units refuel A and C with one unit each. So plane A and C can now come one unit closer. then do a refueling from Plane B
----
Regarding solution 3:

The solution is incorrect.  When A and C are 1 unit away from home with empty tanks, B is at the same location with them with 1 unit of fuel left.  There is no extra time for B to fly home and come back to refuel A and C.

----

Given a target sum &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, you can choose &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; summands each of which is a number, &lt;math&gt;n_i \in \{0, 1, ...\}, i = 1, ..., k&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{k}{n_i} = n&lt;/math&gt;. How many ways are there of doing this?

Here the notion of a sum is same as that of a permutation, so two sums are same &lt;math&gt;iff&lt;/math&gt; they contain the same summands in the same order. E.g. &lt;math&gt;2+3+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1+3+2&lt;/math&gt; are not the same.

While you are at it, whats the answer, if &lt;math&gt;n_i \in \{1, 2, ...\}&lt;/math&gt;?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The solution is easily found if the problem is restated graphically. Consider n=3, k=2. Possible sums are 3 = 0+3, 3 = 1 + 2. A graphical representation could be:
----
 ||ooo
 |o|oo
----
, respectively, with the bars representing seperations between the summands and 'o's representing the value of the summands. Then obviously the problems is equivalent to finding the number of ways to distribute &lt;math&gt;k - 1&lt;/math&gt; bars among &lt;math&gt;n + k - 1&lt;/math&gt; slots, since we need only &lt;math&gt;k - 1&lt;/math&gt; bars to partition the space into &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; summands. Therefore the solution is
&lt;math&gt;
N = {n+k-1 \choose k-1}
&lt;/math&gt;,
if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of unique sums.

For the next part, set aside &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; 'o's since each partition has to have atleast &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; 'o'. Now the problem reduces to the previous one with a reduced value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;n-k&lt;/math&gt;. So the solution is

&lt;math&gt;
N = {n-k+k-1 \choose k-1} = {n-1 \choose k-1}
&lt;/math&gt;,

if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of unique sums.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The Chinese counting system is fairly easy and straightforward. There are not as many number words as in English (where the numbers zero up to twenty require twenty-one different words, plus more words for the tens, e.g. 'forty').  The Chinese characters for numbers are used much like the Arabic numerals (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9).  There are a few more characters to say ten, hundred, thousand, and so forth.

Note that most of the number characters have another more complicated form representing exactly the same meaning. This form is used when we do not want the numbers to be altered after being written, like on bank checks. This will be explained in later parts of this lesson. However, the simpler form (小寫) and complicated form (大寫) do ''not'' correspond to Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.

==Basic Numbers==
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Number&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;小寫&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;大寫&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;〇&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;零&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;一&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;壹&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;二&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;貳&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;三&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;叁&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;四&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;肆&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;五&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;伍&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;六&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;陸&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;七&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;柒&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;八&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;捌&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;九&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;玖&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
The 小寫 are common daily use, as they are easier to write. In fact, it will be rare to see the 大寫 numbers in normal lives. So, for the time being, you can ignore the 大寫 numbers unless you need it for the uses described later. The only exceptional case is 0 (zero). The character 零 is considered for normal use along with the other numbers, so do remember this - it will be weird to use 〇 in normal circumstances unless speed is needed, though everybody will still understand it.

Looking at the 小寫 numbers, 0 through 3 is fairly straightforward. In fact 0 does not change at all in Chinese characters, except that it seems more circular if you take it very seriously. The characters for numbers 1, 2, and 3 have one, two and three strokes.  The other numbers are not as simple, but each has only a few strokes, so although the only way to learn them is by memorizing, you should not encounter much difficulty. As for the 大寫 numbers, it is not necessary to learn them actually when you only want to achieve basic communication with other Chinese people. However, read the following uses of the 大寫 numbers. If you find yourself in any these case(s), do learn them for your own use.

==Tens, Hundreds, etc==
The following table lists out the corresponding Chinese characters for tens, hundreds, etc. The way to express them will be explained afterwards.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Digit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;小寫&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;大寫&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;十&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;拾&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;100s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;百&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;佰&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1,000s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;千&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;仟&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10,000s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;萬&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;萬&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10,000,000s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;億&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;億&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
As a note, 万 and 亿 are not acceptable variants. That is, the correct variants for both 小寫 and 大寫 are 萬 and 億.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Digit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;小寫&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;大寫&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10,000s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;萬&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;萬&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10,000,000s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;億&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;億&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Expressing Numbers==
===Basics===
When we express a number to represent a value, or for counting (that is, cardinal numbers) we just use the number directly, for example, &quot;'''three''' cups of tea&quot; written in Chinese is &quot;'''三'''(three)杯(cups)茶(tea)&quot;. Note that the word &quot;of&quot; is understood.

===More digits===
Consider this number: 42359

In Chinese: 四萬二千三百五十九

Analysing the Chinese number, we can get 4(四) &quot;10,000s&quot;(萬) + 2(二) &quot;1,000s&quot;(千) + 3(三) &quot;100s&quot;(百) + 5(五) &quot;10s&quot;(十) + 9(九).

So, in this example we can see that the Chinese numbers are expressed from the largest digit to the smallest, in a quite straight-forward translation. We write the number of a digit ('''4'''2359 '''四'''), and then add the corresponding digit indicators ('''4'''2359 四'''萬''') and do the rest in this form. So we can express the numbers gradually as we analyse each digit in the Arabic number: 4-2-3-5-9 四萬-二千-三百-五十-九.

===Larger numbers===
Up to &quot;10,000s&quot; (萬), there are corresponding Chinese characters for each digit. However, as the number gets larger, the digits are not that much available. Look at the following case to solve this problem.

Arabic Number:430,000

In English you have only tens, hundreds, and thousands - what about the &quot;ten thousands&quot; and &quot;hundred thousands&quot;? You express it just as if you're counting the &quot;thousands&quot;, that is, you count that there are &quot;four hundred and thirty&quot; thousands. So that's how you write it.

In Chinese we do the same: we have the most &quot;10,000s&quot; (萬) available in this case. So, we count the 10,000s, which gives us 43 &quot;10,000s&quot;. So we write '''四十三'''萬 to express these larger numbers.

===Place holders===
Consider this number: 4,560,082

To express this in Chinese we first write the &quot;10,000s&quot; we see, that is, 四百五十六萬. Now we see nil digits. To express this we simply replace all the zeros with &quot;零&quot;, and continue expressing the number: 四百五十六萬零八十二.

For multiple place holders required, we use one &quot;零&quot; for each place holder, while for consecutive place holders only one &quot;零&quot; is required.

Consider this number: 50,237,005

Applying the above rules we can express it as 五千''零''二十三萬七千''零''五.

&lt;hr&gt;

In addition to the above rules, there is one left: when expressing 10~19, we write 十,十一...十九 - we don't say 一十,一十一,一十九 alone. However in other numbers like 110~119, we have to add a 一 in front of the 十, that is, 一百''一''十,一百''一''十一...一百''一''十九. This only affects 10s to simplify the form in daily uses.

==The use of 大寫 numbers==
The convenience of using the simplier 小寫 numbers can be clearly seen, but the drawback of these numbers also comes from its simplicity. Imagine you're writing a cheque, and the payable amount is supposed to be 三十萬 (300,000). However, just by adding three strokes, others can easily change it to 五千萬 (50,000,000)! This might be an extreme case, but you can see its drawbacks. The simplicity such as 一(1), 二(2), 三(3),etc, could cause much problems.

For this reason, the 大寫 numbers should be used whenever you don't want the numbers to be modified. In the above example, if you have written 叁拾萬 instead, nobody could have changed your writings simply because of the complexity of the characters.

The author (CrossTimer) will hold responsibility for ''his'' updates of this document; and the update timelines will be posted here. Generally, CrossTimer will be writing the whole Written Chinese tutorial, however not regularly (i.e, don't expect a new lesson per week/month, etc) as some articles need longer time.

== Suspension in June  ==
I have other works to do in June from now on thus will stop updating the article for the time being. Others please feel free to continue writing this book.
===back now===
I am pleased to announce that I am back now, periodic updates will be seen here.

:I have some doubts about this Wikibook... I can imagine a Wikibook on Mandarin or on Cantonese, but on written Chinese in general? What do we aim for in our student exactly &amp;mdash; that he/she can read a text in Chinese '''without''' thinking about Chinese words and Chinese pronunciation?
:When a Chinese speaker reads, the process is exactly the same as when an English speaker reads, it is based on pattern recognition linked to spoken language. When I read Chinese, each of the characters seem to form a &quot;sound&quot; for me in my head, telling me what it is, almost as if one part of my brain (the visual pattern recognition area, probably) is interpreting the shapes into spoken language and then reading it out loud to another part of my brain (probably Broca's area). Any reading done in any written language, English, Chinese, whatever, works like this. I don't see how this can be done (in any language) by bypassing the process altogether. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 23:03, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::I am not trying to bypass it, as I will include the pronunciation of Cantonese and Putonghua after the text - and include reference where the learners can learn the pronunciation of those words (to their corresponding Wikibooks of course). I am trying to bypass the dialect barrier in China and create a Wikibook about the general Chinese such that it fits for most of the dialects. For pronunciation, it is supposed to be universe - just use the own dialect's pronunciation at the users' wishes. [[User:Crosstimer|Crosstimer]] 09:26, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:If that's the case, then what's the difference between this wikibook and the Mandarin wikibook or the Cantonese wikibook? Which learner, for example, would use this book rather than the Mandarin or Cantonese one? -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 17:49, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

==Stroke Order==
May I suggest to the people working on this that one of the very first chapters should deal with the idea of '''stroke order'''.  Without understanding this it is very difficult for a person familiar only with the Latin alphabet to grasp how a Chinese character is drawn.  Perhaps the articles could include progressive diagrams where each adds one stroke to the previous diagram until the character is finished. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 18:15, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:That would be the job of [[East Asian Calligraphy|CJK]], which covers stroke shapes and stroke order. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 23:03, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Division of Dialects ==

I noticed on the page the statement &quot;[Chinese] can be mainly divided into Mandarin and Cantonese...&quot;.  While Mandarin and Cantonese are arguably the two Chinese dialects that are most prominently spoken (because of various diaspora populations, number of native speakers, etc.), I think the statement is misleading.

For example, Shanghainese (Wu) is considered to be a separate dialect from Mandarin or Cantonese, and some sources indicate that the number of speakers of the Wu dialect is considered to be more than that of the Yue (Cantonese) dialect.  Therefore Wu should be counted as one of the major dialect groups in China also.

There are others (such as Min and Gan) Chinese dialect groups.  In short, saying that Chinese can be mainly divided into only two dialect groups is an oversimplification, in my opinion.</text>

''An Introduction to Volapük''
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is an '''introduction''' to the constructed language Volapük, which was quite popular for a period at the end of the 19th century, and is still in active use by a small number of people today.

== Background ==

'''Volapük''' was originally the creation of a German priest, [[w:Johann Martin Schleyer|Johann Martin Schleyer]] (1831–1912), and was published in 1879. It met with immediate success, with Volapük supporters' clubs being formed throughout Europe and the United States, and even as far away as Brazil and China. In its heyday, about 1889, there were dozens of Volapük periodicals, and hundreds of different books had been published in and on the language.

There is much debate about the cause of Volapük's speedy decline. Some put it down to the clamour for reforms to the language, others point to the author Schleyer's proprietorial attitude to his creation, and still others point to the fact of [[Esperanto]] being easier to learn. There was a revival of Volapük in the 1930s, principally in the Netherlands, led by [[w:Arie de Jong|Arie de Jong]] (1865–1957), who also revised the language slightly into the form which is normally used today.

His revised form of Volapük is the one which is described here, but section III below describes where the classical form of the language differs from the modern one.

== Grammar ==

=== Pronunciation and orthography ===

Volapük uses the Roman alphabet, except for the letters Q and W, which are not used, and with the addition of Ä, Ö, and Ü. Rules for capitalisation are much the same as in English. The &quot;names&quot; of the letters are themselves plus '''e''' for the consonants and just themselves for the vowels, giving '''a''', '''ä''', '''be''', '''ce''', '''de''', '''e''', '''fe''' etc.

: a&amp;nbsp;– as '''a''' in 'father' or 'nap'.
: ä&amp;nbsp;– as '''ea''' in 'head' or 'bear'.
: c&amp;nbsp;– as '''ch''' in 'church'.
: e&amp;nbsp;– as '''e''' in 'obey'.
: g&amp;nbsp;– always as '''g''' in 'get'.
: h&amp;nbsp;– as '''h''' in 'house'.
: i&amp;nbsp;– as '''i''' in 'ski' or 'fit'.
: j&amp;nbsp;– as '''sh''' in 'shoe'.
: o&amp;nbsp;– as '''o''' in 'for' or 'no'.
: ö&amp;nbsp;– as '''u''' in 'fur' or more properly as '''eu''' in French 'fleur'.
: u&amp;nbsp;– as '''oo''' in 'fool'.
: ü&amp;nbsp;– as '''ue''' in French 'rue' or '''ü''' in German 'Büro'.
: z&amp;nbsp;– as '''ts''' in 'bats'.

The other letters have their usual values in English. Where a letter only has an unvoiced version, e.g. '''c, j, s, z,''' some voicing is permitted.

'''Stress''' is always on the last syllable, except when that syllable is the hyphened suffix '''-li''' or '''-la''', in which case the stress falls on the syllable preceding.

=== Articles ===

There is no article for Volapük words. Thus '''pod''' can mean ''apple'', ''an apple'' or ''the apple'' according to the context.

There is an article '''el''' which is used with proper nouns which have not been assimilated and other words which for one reason or another are not declinable. This article is declinable in the same way as nouns (see below). For example:

: '''Kanobs logön eli Sputnik me daleskop.''' We can see the sputnik with a telescope.
: '''El Paris binon cifazif Fransäna.''' Paris is the capital of France.

Here the '''-i''' on the end of '''el''' signifies the accusative (direct object) case.

Affixes can also be added on to '''el''', e.g. you can use '''jiel''' if you want to indicate that the proper name refers to a female (male: '''hiel'''), '''elep''' for a plant etc.:

: '''Elaf Felis Catus lödon valöpo.''' The (animal) Felis catus lives everywhere.

=== Nouns ===

'''Nouns''' in Volapük have four main cases. These are the [[w:nominative|nominative]], [[w:accusative|accusative]], [[w:genitive|genitive]] and [[w:dative|dative]] cases. The [[w:nominative|nominative]] case has no ending and is used for the subject of a sentence or with a [[w:preposition|preposition]], e.g.

: '''Vom binof in dom.''' The woman is in the house.

Here, both '''vom''' and '''dom''' have no ending as they are in the nominative.

The accusative ending is '''-i''' added on the end of the noun. The accusative in [[Volapük]] is not shown by word order as in English. Thus:

: '''Man beitom dogi''' AND '''Dogi beitom man''' both mean ''the man bites the dog''.

In some languages, the accusative form of the noun is sometimes used to signify motion after some prepositions. This is not the case in Volapük.

: '''Dog bunon sui tapäd.''' The dog jumps onto the carpet.
: '''Dog bunon sua tapäd.''' The dog jumps off the carpet

Here we see that Volapük can form prepositions of motion ''to'' and motion ''from'' by adding the suffixes '''-i''' and '''-a''' respectively to prepositions.

The prepositions of motion can also be used with adverbs as in Esperanto, but the accusative ending is added on before the adverb ending in Volapük:

: '''Vom golof domio.''' The woman is going homewards.

(From home would be '''domao''', and at home would be '''domo''').

The genitive case ending is '''-a''':

: '''Gramat [[Volapük]]a.''' The grammar of Volapük.
: '''Jul hipula.''' The boy's school.

The dative case ending is '''-e''':

: '''Givob buki tidane.''' I give the book to the teacher (or I give the teacher the book).

The plural ending is '''-s''' which is added on after any case ending:

: '''Flens binons gebovik.'''   Friends are useful.
: '''No labom flenis mödik.'''  He does not have many friends.
: '''Selidöp flenas.'''         The shop of the friends.
: '''Egivom oni flenes okik.''' He has given it to his friends.

The fifth case is the vocative, which just means you have to use the word '''o''' if using a noun as a form of address:

: '''O flens, o Romans, o kelänans!''' Friends, Romans, countrymen!

There is also a '''predicative''' case which is hardly ever used, ending in '''u'''.

: '''Ekölom yani rediku.''' He has painted the door red. - As opposed to:
: '''Ekölom yani redik.'''  He has painted the red door.

=== Pronouns ===

[[w:Pronouns|Pronoun]]s are one of the few groups of words in Volapük which are mostly ''a priori'', i.e. not borrowed from existing languages even in a mutilated form.

The main pronouns are:

: '''ob''' - I
: '''ol''' - you (singular)
: '''om''' - he
: '''of''' - she
: '''on''' - it or he/she 
: '''oy''' - one
: '''os''' - impersonal (null subject), e.g. reinos - it is raining.
: '''obs''' - we
: '''ols''' - you (plural)
: '''oms''', '''ofs''', '''ons''' - they (masc., fem., common/neuter)

These '''pronouns''' are also added on the end of verbs:

: '''Golob.'''     I go.
: '''Golom.'''     He goes.
: '''Man golom.''' The man goes.

Pronouns are ''declined'' just like nouns.

Other pronouns are '''ok''', the reflexive pronoun:

: '''Flapom omi.''' He hits him (i.e. somebody else).
: '''Flapom oki.''' He hits himself.

and '''od''' the reciprocative pronoun:

: '''Löfons odis.''' They love each other.
As opposed to:
: '''Löfons okis.''' They love themselves.

The ''polite'' forms of '''ol''' and '''ols''' are '''or''' and '''ors''', but these are hardly ever used except poetically. Part of Arie de Jong's official modern grammar, but never used are '''og''' (you or me) and '''ogs''' (you and me/you and us).

Some other pronouns are: '''at''' (this), '''et''' (that), '''it''' (itself), '''ot''' (the same thing), '''ut''' (whoever), '''kel''' (who/which: relative, not question), '''kin''' (who?), '''kis''' (what?), '''ek''' (somebody), '''nek''' (nobody), '''bos''' (something), '''nos''' (nothing).

=== Verbs ===

The verb in revised Volapük has 1683 possible conjugations, including many that are extremely rare. It is important to observe that these forms are derived simply and regularly, so there is no great difficulty involved. There are four tenses which are commonly used: the [[w:present|present]], which is the form used in most of the examples so far, the [[w:future|future]], which involves adding the prefix '''o-''', the [[w:imperfect|imperfect]] with prefix '''ä-''', and the perfect, which has '''e-'''. The suffix used is the pronoun involved, or if a noun is the subject, whichever pronoun would be appropriate for that noun.

 '''Fidol.'''          You are eating.
 '''Man fidom.'''      The man is eating.
 '''Vom fidof.'''      The woman is eating.
 '''Cil fidon.'''      The child is eating.
 '''Studans fidons.''' The students are eating.
 '''Ofidol.'''         You are going to eat.
 '''Äfidol.'''         You were eating.
 '''Efidol.'''         You have eaten.

The [[w:prefix|prefix]] for the present tense is '''a-''', but this is only used in certain circumstances. One of these is if used with a word other than a verb, because in Volapük, not only verbs can have tenses:

 '''Delo.'''  By day.
 '''Adelo.''' Today.
 '''Odelo.''' Tomorrow.
 '''Ädelo.''' Yesterday.

The other circumstance is in the [[w:passive|passive]] voice:

 '''Pafidol.''' You are being eaten.
 '''Pofidol.''' You are going to be eaten, etc.

which uses the prefix '''p-''' before the tense prefix.

There are four other tenses which are much less common: the future perfect (prefix '''u-'''), the pluperfect (prefix '''i-'''), the future in the past ('''ö-'''), and the future in the past perfect ('''ü-'''):

 '''Ufidobs.''' We will have eaten.
 '''Ifidobs.''' We had eaten.
 '''Üfidobs.''' We were going to eat.
 '''Öfidobs.''' We were going to have eaten.

Questions are constructed by adding the particle '''-li''' after the verb:

 '''Nolol vegi.'''     You know the way.
 '''Nolol-li vegi?'''  Do you know the way?

There are four other moods in Volapük: the [[w:conditional|conditional]] which uses the ending '''öv''', the [[w:optative|optative]] (polite imperative) ending in '''ös''', the imperative ending in '''öd''', and the [[w:subjunctive|subjunctive]] which uses the particle -la.

The subjunctive is only used where something ridiculous or unimaginably unlikely is referred to.

: '''Ekömoböv, if ilaboböv moni.''' I would have come if I had had the money.
: '''Seilolös!''' Please be quiet.
: '''Seilolöd!''' Be quiet!
: '''Golobsös!''' Let's go!
: '''Ogivob-la dolaris lul? Cogol, no-li?''' Me, give you five dollars? You're joking, aren't you?

Notice how the pronoun is still inserted in the optative and imperative.'''

The [[w:infinitive|infinitive]] form of the verb ends in '''ön'''. Where the infinitive form actually means ''in order to'', we add the word '''ad''':

: '''Fidobs ad lifön.''' We eat to live.

Participles end in '''öl'''. Participles behave as adjectives (see below).

: '''Ovisitob oli ün vig okömöl.''' I shall visit you in the coming week.
: '''Ägolölo ve süt, älogob fleni bäldik oba.''' While (I was) going along the street, I saw an old friend of mine.

Whether a verb is naturally transitive or intransitive varies from one word to the next. Transitive verbs can be made intransitive by inserting the affix '''ik''', and intransitive verbs made transitive by the use of the affix '''ük''':

 '''Seadom su stul.'''         He is sitting on the chair.
 '''Seadükom cili sui stul.''' He seats the child on the chair.

 '''Eperom moni okik.'''       He has lost his money.
 '''Mon omik eperikon.'''      His money has got lost.

(In the above examples, '''oka''' and '''oma''' are acceptable alternatives for the possessive adjectives '''okik''' and '''omik''' respectively).

The affix '''ik''' can be used with intransitive verbs, and '''ük''' with verbs that are normally transitive. In these cases, they provide a kind of medial voice or causative voice respectively.

: '''Äseadikom sui stul.''' He sat down on the chair.
: '''Man päperükom moni oki fa briet.''' The man was caused to lose his money by drunkenness.

=== Adjectives and adverbs ===

[[w:Adjectives|Adjectives]] in Volapük end in '''-ik'''. The normal position for adjectives is after the noun they qualify and if placed there, and there is no ambiguity, they ''' ''do not'' ''' need to agree with their noun in case or number. However, if placed before the noun they qualify, or there is ambiguity, they must agree.

The [[w:comparative|comparative]] and [[w:superlative|superlative]] of adjectives is formed by adding '''um''' or '''ün''' respectively after the '''ik''' and before any case or number agreement.
	
The prepositions used with the comparative and superlative degrees are '''ka''' and '''se''' respectively.

 '''Flens gudik.'''               Good friends.
 '''Flens gudikum ka ons.'''      Better friends than they.
 '''Flens gudikün se valikans.''' Best friends of all.

[[w:Adverbs|Adverbs]] end in '''o''', and can be formed from adjectives or nouns:

 '''Delo.'''   By day.
 '''Deliko.''' On a daily basis.

When they modify other adverbs, they always go in front, but when they modify adjectives and verbs, they can go on either side, though there is a convention to put them in front of adjectives.

There are also a number of common adverbs which are roots in themselves and do not end in '''o''': '''ai''' (always), '''ba''' (perhaps), '''i''' (also), '''is''' (here), '''nu''' (now), '''plu''' (more), '''te''' (only), '''ti''' (almost), '''us''' (there), '''ya''' (indeed), '''ye''' (however), '''kö''' (where: relative), '''kü''' (when: relative), '''lio''' (how: question), '''vio''' (how: relative).

(The questions where and when are '''kiöpo?''' and '''kiüpo?''' respectively. These are formed from '''ki-''' then the affix of place or time respectively ('''öp''' or '''üp'''), then the adverb ending.

=== Numerals ===

The [[w:numeral|numeral]]s are:

{|
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10
|-
| bal || tel || kil || fol || lul || mäl || vel || jöl || zül || deg
|-
| 11 || 12 || 13 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 30
|-
| degbal || degtel || degkil || teldeg || teldegbal || teldegtel || kildeg
|-
| 100 - 101 || 123 || 234 || 1 000
|-
| tum, tumbal || tumteldegkil || teltumkildegfol || mil
|-
| 1 234 || 2 345 || 10 000
|-
| mil teltumkildegfol || telmil kiltumfoldeglul || degmil
|-
| 234 567 || 1 000 000 || 4 876 329
|-
| teltumkildegfolmil lultumäldegvel || balion || folbalion jöltumveldegmälmil kiltumteldegzül
|}

: '''balion''' = million (10^6).

: '''telion''' = billion (European)/trillion (US) (10^12).
: '''kilion''' = trillion (European)/quintillion (US) (10^18) etc.

The key words used in forming [[w:decimal|decimal]] [[w:fractions|fractions]] are:

 0,1      = '''dim'''
 0,01     = '''zim'''
 0,001    = '''mim'''
 0,0001   = '''dimmim'''
 0,00001  = '''zimmim'''
 0,000001 = '''balyim'''

The [[w:fractional|fractional]] part should be read as if an [[w:integer|integer]] number, followed by the decimal fraction word to give the order of magnitude. Thus

: 0,345 = '''kiltumfoldeglul mim'''
: 0,123456 = '''tumteldegkilmil foltumluldegmäl balyim'''

For smaller magnitudes '''telyim''' (10^-12), '''kilyim''' (10^-18) etc. are formed in the same way as their high magnitude counterparts '''telion''', '''kilion'''
etc.

(You probably noticed most of the numerals are ''' ''apriori'' ''').

[[w:Numeral|Numeral]]s are placed after their nouns:

: '''Dolars teltumluldeg.''' $250.

Ordinal numerals are formed by the suffix '''-id'''; &lt;br&gt;
Fractional numerals are formed by the suffix '''-dil''';&lt;br&gt;
Repetition or multiplication is expressed by the suffix '''-na''', e.g.:

 '''Binos düp velid soara.'''            It is 7 o'clock in the evening.
 '''Foldils kil binons veldeglul zim.''' 3/4 is 0,75.
 '''Ibinos visit folnaik ofa us.'''      It had been her fourth visit there.
 '''Folna fol binos degmäl.'''           4 x 4 = 16.

=== Other parts of speech ===

The other parts of speech are [[w:preposition|preposition]]s, [[w:conjunction|conjunction]]s, and [[w:interjection|interjection]]s.

These can exist as roots in themselves, with no particular ending as in the following examples.

; Prepositions : '''bü''' (before: time), '''dis''' (under), '''fo''' (before: place), '''ko''' (together with), '''ma''' (according to), '''nen''' (without), '''po''' (behind), '''su''' (on), '''sus''' (above), '''ta''' (against), '''vü''' (between).

; Conjunctions : '''ab''' (but), '''bi''' (because), '''das''' (that), '''dat''' (so that), '''do''' (though), '''du''' (while), '''e''' (and), '''klu''' (therefore), '''u''' (or).

; Interjections : '''ag!''' (ah!), '''he!''' (hey!), '''o!''' (oh!), '''sö!''' (psst!).

Alternatively, they can be formed from other roots by adding the endings '''-ü''' for prepositions, '''-ä''' for conjunctions, and '''-ö''' for interjections:

 '''Nil.'''   Proximity.
 '''Nilü.'''  Near.
 '''Kod.'''   Cause.
 '''Kodä.'''  Why. (relative; question is '''Kikodo?''')
 '''Seil.'''  Silence.
 '''Seilö!''' Silence!

=== Word formation, prefixes and suffixes ===
Formation of compound words takes place in Volapük in a similar way to [[English]], [[German]], [[Esperanto]], [[Hungarian]], [[Chinese]] and many other languages.

The main word comes last:

 '''Bödakanit.''' Birdsong.
 '''Kanitaböd.''' Songbird.
 '''Pokamon.'''   Pocket-money.
 '''Monapok.'''   Money pocket.

In the above examples, the roots are joined by the genitive ending '''-a'''. It is also possible to join words using the accusative ending '''-i''' and the adverbial ending '''-o'''. This allows subtle differentiation of meaning:

 '''Motalöf.''' Mother love. (Love by a mother).
 '''Motilöf.'''      &quot;       (Love of, or towards, a mother).
 '''Motolöf.'''      &quot;       (Love like a mother's).

Numerous prefixes and suffixes also allow [[Volapük]]'s approximately 3000 root words to be vastly extended. Some of the most important of these are:

; Prefixes : '''be''' (see example below), '''fi''' (to the end), '''hi''' (male), '''ji''' (female), '''ke''' (together), '''läx''' (ex-), '''le''' (greatness), '''lu''' (disparagement or step relationship), '''lü''' (in-law), '''ne''' (opposite), '''ru''' (ancient).

 '''Givön.'''    To give.     '''Begivön.'''     To present with.
	
(Makes what was the indirect object the direct object).

 '''Reidön.'''   To read.     '''Fireidön.'''    To read completely.
 '''Jevod.'''    Horse.       '''Hijevod.'''     Stallion.
 '''Jip.'''      Sheep.       '''Jijip.'''       Ewe.

 '''Laodik.'''   Loud.        '''Nelaodik.'''    Quiet.

Many prepositions are also used as prefixes.

; Suffixes : '''am''' (verbal noun), '''ag''' (abundance), '''an''' (person associated), '''at''' (amount of), '''av''' (science), '''äb''' (victim), '''äd''' (generalisation of effect), '''än''' (country), '''ät''' (abstraction), '''ed''' (particularisation), '''ef''' (group of people), '''el''' (maker of), '''em''' (group of things), '''et''' (consequential or concrete example), '''iäl''' (inclination), '''il''' (diminutive), '''im''' (philosophy), '''od''' (softer or less serious example), '''ot''' (harder or more serious example), '''ov''' (possibility), '''öf''' (quality), '''öm''' (equipment), '''öp''' (place), '''ül''' (young of animals, endearment).

This lists only a proportion of the [[w:affix|affix]]es available.

== Differences with classical Volapük ==

In 1887 there were also a number of reforms to the original Volapük. These are also outlined here, but the majority of changes refer to those agreed in 1930 and proposed by Arie de Jong.

=== Pronunciation and orthography ===

Exactly the same as modern Volapük except that the apostrophe (') was used instead of '''h''' before 1887.

The letter '''r''' was much less commonly used in classical Volapük, and a number of new words have been introduced using it. Some of these replace old words which appeared too mutilated as a result of not using an '''r'''. 
		
Many other words, especially the most common ones, still retain their original '''l'''. Some words crept in classical [[Volapük]] where the root began with a vowel. This was standardised to begin with '''l'''. A very small proportion of words have changed for no other reason than the passage of time or to remove ambiguities. Here are some examples of the changes in vocabulary:

  OLD        NEW
 '''Gletik.  Gretik.'''   (large).
 '''Flentän. Fransän.'''  (France).
 '''Jeval.   Jevod.'''    (horse).
 '''Ägüptän. Lägüptän.''' (Egypt).
 '''Nelij.   Linglän.'''  (England).
 '''Lilöm.   Rein.'''     (rain)
 '''Lilädön. Reidön.'''   (to read)
 '''Lemön.   Remön.'''    (to buy)

Changes to the vocabulary as a result of changes to the affix system and to attitudes to word formation are dealt with later.

=== Articles ===

The use of '''el''' and its derivatives occurs only in modern Volapük.

=== Nouns ===

The predicative case and the modified prepositions to show motion are used only in modern [[Volapük]].

=== Pronouns ===

The pronouns '''oy''', '''or''', '''ors''' and '''od''' do not occur in classical Volapük.
	
Previously '''on''' was used instead of '''oy''', and '''om''' was used instead of '''on''' for all common or neuter items as well as masculine ones.

Before 1887, the reflexive pronoun was added to the end of the verb, e.g. modern '''lavons okis''' (they wash themselves) was '''lavomsok''' or '''lavomoks'''.

=== Verbs ===

The future in the past and future in the past perfect tenses do not appear in classical Volapük.

Classical Volapük also had an [[w:aorist|aorist]] aspect, which was formed by placing an '''-i-''' between the tense marker and the verb root, e.g.

 '''Olödob in zif.''' I shall live in the town.
 '''Oilödob in zif.''' I shall always live in the town.

Classical Volapük also had a third imperative mood, called the [[w:jussive|jussive]], which was stronger than the other two and ended in '''-öz'''.

 '''Seilolös!''' Please be quiet.
 '''Seilolöd!''' Be quiet!
 '''Seilolöz!''' Why don't you shut up?!

The subjunctive mood was formerly used more often than it is now.

=== Adjectives and Adverbs ===
No change.

=== Numerals ===

The numbers '''ten, twenty, thirty&gt;''' etc, which are '''deg''', '''teldeg''', '''kildeg''' etc. in modern [[Volapük]] were previously formed by adding an '''s''' to the numbers for one, two, three, etc.: '''bals''', '''tels''', '''kils'''. The units were added on to the tens by the word '''e''' (and), e.g. '''balsebal''' (11), '''balsetel''' (12) etc.

The decimal fractional numerals are also modern.

=== Other parts of speech ===

No major change except that modern '''ad''' is '''al''' in classical Volapük.

=== Word formation ===

Modern Volapük uses affixes to form words less than was previously the case. This is largely because of the greater number of roots available.

The modern Volapük affix system is much more systematic and regular than the classical one. A number of the modern affixes did not appear in the classical form of the language.

Some classical affixes have been abolished. Previously '''gle-''' existed in addition to '''le-''' as an augmentative prefix, and '''sma-''' in addition to '''-il''' as a diminutive affix.

The old suffixes '''-lik''' and '''-nik''' are the equivalent of the modern '''-öfik''' and '''-agik''' respectively. Previously the affix '''-el''' covered the meanings of both '''-el''' and '''-an'''.

As you can see below, one problem where the word '''lemel''' previously existed as an isomer (it could be analysed in two different ways: '''le-mel''' and '''lem-el''') has been removed.

Also, Arie de Jong introduced some new words to address the problem of sexism in the affix system. And even classical Volapük never said '''ji-fat''' and '''ji-man''' for mother and woman.

 OLD                      NEW
 '''Ludog.'''    (dreadful dog) '''Lup.'''      (wolf)
 '''Snekafit.''' (snake fish)   '''Pil.'''      (eel)
 '''Lemel.'''    (big sea)      '''Sean.'''     (ocean)
 '''Lemel.'''    (buy-er)       '''Reman.'''    (buy-er)
 '''Flenlik.'''  (friendly)     '''Flenöfik.''' (friendly)
 '''Lutnik.'''   (airy)         '''Lutagik.'''  (airy)
 '''Lezif.'''    (big town)     '''Cifazif.'''  (chief town, i.e. capital)
 '''Glezif.'''   (big town)     '''Lezif.'''    (big town, i.e. city)
 '''Jiblod.'''   (she brother)  '''Sör.'''      (sister)
 '''Jison.'''    (she son)      '''Daut.'''     (daughter)

:Hello everyone. I've made several minor changes to this page (e.g. correcting the stress rule and adding that prepositions can take '''-a''' as well as '''-i'''). I'd be happy to discuss the page with anyone who's interested.

::That comment was posted in 2008.  However I think that the author speaks the language.  A lot of information here is based on first-hand knowledge, and corrected when someone challenges it. If you think it's wrong, you can [[WB:BOLD|fix it]], however if you don't speak Volapuk yourself (as I think Custard7 did), it would probably be wise to provide a source.

==Gleason score==
The Gleason grading system, originally developed in 1966, was modified in 2005 at the International Society of Urological Pathology Consensus Conference.  In general, the changes resulted in a more narrow scope of grade 3 and an expanded scope of grade 4, thus shifting a number of previously diagnos

===Clinical correlates===

*'''Colorado/SEER; 2014''' (2004-2006) PMID 25151595 -- &quot;Gleason stratifications prognostic for survival in men receiving definitive external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.&quot; (Rusthoven CG, Urologic Oncology. Aug 20 2014. epub ahead of print)
**Retrospective. 26,885 men with Gleason 6-10 PCa, managed with definitive external beam radiation alone, from 2004-2006. PCa-specific survival (PCSS) evaluated as the primary endpoint.
**Preliminary primary-secondary comparisons demonstrated superior survival for 3+4 vs 4+3=7 (SS), and 4+4 vs 8w/Pattern 5 (3+5 or 5+3)(SS). No differences observed for 4+5 vs 5+4=9.
**The primary analysis included stratifications for Gleason 6, 3+4, 4+3, 4+4, 8 w/P5, 9, and 10, where the 7.5-year PCSS rates were 99%, 97%, 95%, 91%, 86%, 81%, and 78% and 7.5-year OS rates were 83%, 76%, 72%, 67%, 66%, 58%, and 54%, respectively.
***Differences between each sequential score were significant on multivariate analysis for PCSS, with the exception of 8w/P5 vs 9 (p=0.11).
***In a multivariate analysis evaluating the above Gleason Stratifications (scored 1-7), PSA (&lt;10,10-20,≥20 ng/mL, scored 1-3), and T stage (scored 1-4), single-level increases in the identified Gleason stratification were more powerful than classical PSA risk groups or T stage, despite the increased number of tiers (7 vs 3 vs 4).
**Subgroup Analyses demonstrated that the presence of any P5 (as a primary or secondary pattern) was an independent prognostic factor for survival.
*CONCLUSION: &quot;In the largest reported survival analysis of Gleason stratifications, biopsy-assigned GS 6, 3+4, 4+3, 4+4, 8 w/P5, 9, and 10 represented sequential prognostic factors for survival in patients managed with definitive EBRT.&quot;


*'''Johns Hopkins; 2013''' PMID 23464824 -- &quot;Prognostic Gleason grade grouping: data based on the modified Gleason scoring system&quot; (Pierorazio PM, BJU Int. 2013. May;111(5):753-60)
**Retrospective. 7,869 men with PCa, diagnosed 2004 or later, managed with prostatectomy. Biochemical recurrence-free (BFS) survival evaluated as the primary endpoint.
**5-year BFS rates for men with Gleason grade ≤ 6, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 8 and 9-10 tumours at biopsy were 94.6, 82.7, 65.1, 63.1 and 34.5%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 for trend); and 96.6, 88.1, 69.7, 63.7 and 34.5%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001), based on RP pathology
*Conclusion: &quot;There is a need for a change in (Gleason) reporting to more closely reflect tumour behaviour.&quot; Authors propose reporting Gleason score ≤ 6 (prognostic grade group I); Gleason score 3+4=7 (prognostic grade group II); Gleason score 4+3=7 (prognostic grade group III); Gleason score 4+4=8 (prognostic grade group (IV); and Gleason score 9-10 (prognostic grade group (V).

**Retrospective. 812 patients with GS 7 (prostatectomy 693, biopsy 119) on Physicians Health Study and Health Professionals Followup Study. Blinded review by 3 pathologists. Lethal PCA defined as bony mets or PCA death
**Gleason score: Striking upgrading in GS score. Initial GS 2-5 in 25%, on review in &lt;1%
**Outcome: No leathal PCA in GS 2-6; reference 3+4; hazard ratios for lethal cancer GS 4+3 HR 3.1 (SS), GS 8 HR 7.4 (SS), GS 9-10 HR 19 (SS)
*Conclusion: Ignoring pattern 4 in GS 7 may conceal important prognostic information

**Retrospective. 613 patients with GS 7 (all solely with EBRT). Required complete core biopsy information (location of each biopsy core, positive core percentage, individual core involvement, PIN, and PNI). First EBRT study to assess bRFS, DM, and PCSM between GS 3+4 vs 4+3.
**Outcome: The 8-year bRFS rate for pG3 versus pG4 was 77.6% versus 61.3% (P&lt;.0001), DMFS was 96.8% versus 84.3% (P&lt;.0001), and PCSM was 3.7% versus 8.1% (P=.002). On multivariate analysis, pG4 predicted for significantly worse outcome in all parameters. Excellent review of all studies on the subject of GS 3+4 vs 4+3.
**Conclusion: Primary Gleason grade 4 independently predicts for worse bRFS, DMFS, and PCSM among Gleason 7 patients even in the setting of biopsy information.

==Pattern of spread to lymph nodes==
Prostate lymphatic drainage is to hypogastric (primary), obturator (secondary), external iliac (tertiary), and presacral (quarternary). 
For radical prostatectomy, lymph node dissection includes only the obturator and external iliac LNs, and is recommended for PSA &gt; 10 and Gleason &gt; 6. 
Heidenreich et al (PMID 11912387) reported that with extended lymphadenectomy (including all four drainage regions), LN mets were detected in 26% vs 12%, and that 2/3 of patients had LN mets outside of the fields of standard lymphadectomy.  Recommended extended lymphadenectomy of external and internal iliacs and obturator for pts with PSA &gt; 10 and Gleason 7 or above (only 2% LN+). Do not recommend dissection of presacral region or common iliac.

**Retrospective. 5730 men, prostatectomy, no neoadjuvant therapy. Variables used PSA (80% &lt;10), clinical stage (77% T1c), biopsy Gleason (76% GS 5-6)
**Outcome: Nomogram developed
**Conclusion: Updated &quot;Partin tables&quot; reflect trends in presentation
*'''2012''' (2006-2011) PMID 22834909 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11324.x/abstract;jsessionid=45EC7B35C58C48ACFFCAD76AAE500AA3.d02t03 Full text] -- &quot;An updated prostate cancer staging nomogram (Partin tables) based on cases from 2006 to 2011.&quot; (Eifler JB, BJU Int. 2012 Jul 26. -- Epub ahead of print)
**5629 men. Median PSA 4.9; Gleason 6 in 63%; T1c in 78%. 
**OC (organ confined) in 73%, EPE 23%, SV+ 3%, LN+ 1.
**Compared to prior cohort (2000-2005), more likely to have PSA &lt;= 4 (30% vs 25%), Gleason score &gt;= 7 on biopsy (37% vs 23%) and prostatectomy (50% vs 36%), but were similar in clinical and pathologic stage.
**Conclusion: &quot;The distribution of pathologic stages did not change at our institution between 2000-2005 and 2006-2011. The updated Partin nomogram takes into account the updated Gleason scoring system and may be more accurate for contemporary patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.&quot;
*&lt;U&gt;Caution:&lt;/U&gt; The Partin tables assign the &quot;worst-case&quot; pathologic stage for each case; the categories are mutually exclusive. (E.g., those included as &quot;capsular penetration&quot; had to have no seminal vesicle involvement or lymph node involvement, and those included as &quot;positive seminal vesicle&quot; had to have no lymph node involvement. The categories sum to 100%.) This method gives an underestimation of the true rate of extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle involvement.

*'''Seminal vesicle involvement''' - PSA +([Gleason -6] x 10) &amp;mdash; PMID 7523343
**Cutoff is 13%.  If &lt;13%, risk 7%; if &gt;=13%, risk 37%.
*'''Lymph node involvement''' - 2/3 x PSA + ([Gleason-6] x 10) &amp;mdash; PMID 7505775
**Cutoff is 15%. If calculated risk is &lt;15%, actual risk 6%; if &gt;=15%, actual risk 40%.
*'''Extracapsular extension''' - 1.5 x PSA + ([Gleason-3) x 10) &amp;mdash; PMID 10875450
**Approximates actual risk.

**SEER analysis. 9,387 men with cT1c-T4 PCA, surgical LN evaluation, GS and PSA. 98% were cT1c/T2
**Patient characteristics: PSA &lt;4 in 16%, 4-10 in 62%, 10-20 in 14%, &gt;20 in 6%. Gleason &lt;=6 in 39%, 7 in 46%, and 8-10 in 13%. Clinical T1c in 51%, T2 in 46%, T3-T4 in 2.5%. Median 5 LN evaluated.
**Outcome: LN+ in 3.3%. Roach scores overestimated actual rates by 16x if score &lt;10%, by 7x if score 10-20%, and by 2.5x if score &gt;20%. Adjusted expected risk of LN+ is 0.2% for Roach scores &lt;=10%, 2.0% for Roach scores 10-20%, 9.7% (with observed risk 6.5%) for Roach scores 20-30%, and 13.9% for Roach scores 30-40%. Note: adjustment factors should not be applied for T3-T4 disease.

*Traditionally, watchful waiting was defined as no treatment until disease progression to symptomatic locally advanced or metastatic disease. Palliative treatment was with androgen ablation therapy
*In the PSA era, patients managed with watchful waiting are sometimes still monitored with periodic PSA testing. This may allow intervention at a future time
*Active surveillance is being evaluated as a strategy to monitor patients with low risk disease with serial PSA (PSA-DT) and repeat biopsies, and actively intercede with a curative intervention (RP or RT) as necessary


==Latent Prostate Cancer==
*'''Wayne State; 1993''' PMID 8326560 -- &quot;The frequency of carcinoma and intraepithelial neoplasia of the prostate in young male patients.&quot; (Sakr WA, J Urol. 1993 Aug;150(2 Pt 1):379-85.)
**Prospective. 152 patients, age 10-49, majority died of trauma. Prostate sectioned within 24 hours of death. Black 65%, white 35%.
**Outcome: Prostate cancer foci by decade - in 20's 0% vs 30's 27% vs 40's 34%. Majority harbored 2 or more foci of disease
**Conclusion: Natural history of PCA must encompass many more decades than previously realized

==Clinically Insignificant Prostate Cancer==
*'''Hamburg; 2008''' (1992-2003) PMID 18553365 -- &quot;Critical assessment of tools to predict clinically insignificant prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy in contemporary men.&quot; (Chun FK, Cancer. 2008 Aug 15;113(4):701-9.)
**Defined clinically insignificant prostate cancer (IPCa) as organ confined cancer with tumor volume &lt; 0.5 cc and without Gleason 4 or 5 patterns.
**Development of nomogram to predict IPCa based on PSA, clinical stage, and biopsy characteristics.
**Out of 1132 men studied, IPCa identified in 65 (5.7%). Accuracy of nomogram 90%. However, on external validation, 63% of patients who met the nomogram cutoff for having a high probability of IPCa were found to have aggressive prostate cancer on prostatectomy.
**Currently used models for predicting IPCa have poor performance and risk misclassifying patients who have aggressive biology as having IPCa.

'''''Commentary:'''''
*'''Johns Hopkins / NCI; 2012''' No PMID yet [http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2012/10/01/JCO.2012.44.0586 Full text] -- &quot;Gleason Score 6 Adenocarcinoma: Should It Be Labeled As Cancer?&quot; (Carter HB, J Clin Oncol 2012. -- Online ahead of print Oct 1, 2012.)
**Discussion of updated Gleason scoring system and the stage migration of lower grade tumors in the older system to G 6 in the new system. Less than 3% of men diagnosed with Gleason &lt;= 6 prostate cancers will die of prostate cancer within 10-15 years, with or without treatment.

==Watchful waiting==
*Watchful waiting/deferred treatment may be a reasonable option for some patients with early stage PCA, particularly if their life expectancy is &lt;10 years. The 10-year disease-specific survival is ~85% for patients with localized PCA. The studies linked above were performed with patients diagnosed in pre-PSA era. Randomized multi-institutional trials are sadly lacking.
*Radical prostatectomy reduces overall mortality slightly (by 6% at 10 years), and disease-specific mortality, risk of mets and local progression significantly when compared with watchful waiting. This benefit may be limited to patients &lt;65 years of age, and should be explored further. However, in the Swedish trial below, most men had palpable (T2) cancer while most men in North America have T1c disease. It is not clear how generalizable these results are to a current patient population, and whether RP would still be significantly better over these time-frames.

===Cohort Studies===
*'''Connecticut Tumor Registry''' (1971-84)
**Retrospective cohort study. 767 patients identified through Connecticut Tumor Registry. Clinically localized. No screening (TURP 60%, biopsy 26%)  Median age 69. Treated with observation or immediate ADH (42%) or delayed hormonal therapy.
**'''20-years; 2005''' PMID 15870412 &amp;mdash; &quot;20-year outcomes following conservative management of clinically localized prostate cancer.&quot; (Albertsen PC, JAMA. 2005 May 4;293(17):2095-101.) Median F/U 24 years
***Outcome: 20-year CSS 71%, OS 7%. CSS by Gleason Score: 2-6 was 81%, 7 was 55%, and 8-10 was 34%.
***Mortality rate: 3.3% per year during first 15 years, then 1.8% per year thereafter. Low grade (GS 2-4) 0.6% per year, high grade (GS 8-10) 12% per year
***Conclusion: Low risk of dying from prostate cancer for low risk group (Gleason 2-4). High risk of dying within 10 years for Gleason 8-10. Intermediate for Gleason 5-6. Mortality risk does not support aggressive treatment for localized low-grade PCA 
***Comment PMID 15870419: Relatively low grade disease (33% GS &lt;=5 compared with ~5% in contemporary series), many s/p TURP (which is effectively a prophylactic partial prostatectomy, and decreases death rate from PCA), many with serious chronic illness (which is seen less often with earlier PSA-based detection, and who would be expected to die of competing causes)

*'''Orebro Medical Center, Sweden''' (1977-1984)
**Population based study, one county in Sweden. 642 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed, no screening (16% at TURP, 84% clinically palpabe; 47% localized, 28% locally advanced, 25% metastatic). Mean age 72. 223 patients, clinical T0-T2, were offered watchful waiting. Hormone treatment with disease progression 
**'''10-years; 1992''' PMID 1556796 &amp;mdash; &quot;High 10-year survival rate in patients with early, untreated prostatic cancer.&quot; (Johansson JE, JAMA. 1992 Apr 22-29;267(16):2191-6.
**'''15-years; 1997''' PMID 9020270 &amp;mdash; &quot;Fifteen-year survival in prostate cancer. A prospective, population-based study in Sweden.&quot; (Johansson JE, JAMA. 1997 Feb 12;277(6):467-71.) Average F/U 14 years, 84% patients died
***Outcome: 15-year PFS 36%, 15-year CSS 54%, 15-year OS 12%. Localized disease PFS 48%, CSS 81% (regardless if treated or not), OS 20%. Locally advanced disease PFS 47%, CSS 56%, OS 3%. Metastatic disease PFS 6%, CSS 6%, OS 1%
***Conclusion: Patients with localized PCA have a favorable outlook following watchful waiting, while patients with locally advance or metastatic disease need aggressive therapy
**'''20-years; 2004''' PMID 15187052 -- &quot;Natural history of early, localized prostate cancer.&quot; (Johansson JE, JAMA. 2004 Jun 9;291(22):2713-9.)
***Subset of 223 patients with early stage (T0-T2) initially untreated PCA. No patient lost to F/U. Mean F/U 21 years
***Outcome: Progression in 40%, metastatic disease in 17%, PCA-death in 16%. Most cancers indolent course for first 15 years, however, from 15-&gt;20 years substantial decrease in PFS (45% to 36%), DMFS (77% to 51%), and CSS (79% to 54%). PCA-mortality increased from 15/1000 to 44/1000 (SS)
***Conclusion: Although most PCA diagnosed at early stage have an indolent course, agressive metastatic disease may develop in the long term

**Population based study in a single county. No screening. 719 cases. 15 year median f/u. 45% diagnosed incidentally. 31% organ confined.  62% died of prostate cancer. 
**Disease specific survival 80% at 1-yr, 38% at 5-yrs, 17% at 10-yrs. 

*'''Karolinska; 1997'''  PMID 9372882 -- &quot;Deferred treatment of clinically localized low-grade prostate cancer: actual 10-year and projected 15-year follow-up of the Karolinska series.&quot; (Adolfsson J, Urology. 1997 Nov;50(5):722-6.)
**122 patients with palpable, clinically localized, low-grade prostate cancer diagnosed from 1978 to 1982
**10-year DFS 90%; 15-year DFS 75%
**No antitumoral therapy had been given to 58 (48%) patients at follow-up or before death. The chance of being untreated 5 and 10 years after diagnosis, if still alive, was 71% and 43%, respectively
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our data are mature up to 10 years of observation and, based on these data, deferred treatment is a valid option for patients with clinically localized low-grade prostate cancer with a life expectancy of 10 years or less. The data are not definitive beyond 10 years and firm conclusions will be speculative, but our findings indicate that there probably is room for efficacious local treatment in patients with localized prostate cancer and a life expectancy longer than 10 years.&quot;


'''Meta-analyses'''
*'''Meta-analysis, 1998''' - PMID 9554328 -- ''An analysis of watchful waiting for clinically localized prostate cancer.'' (Steinberg GD, J Urol 1998; 159:1431-6.)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Watchful waiting is probably the best treatment option for men with well and perhaps moderately differentiated, low volume prostate cancer who have a life expectancy of less than 10 years. However, the conclusions derived from watchful waiting studies of older men cannot and should not be applied to younger, healthier men or to those with more advanced or aggressive disease. If treated ineffectively, many of these men will die of prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Most men with prostate cancer who have a life expectancy greater than 10 to 15 years should be treated with curative intent.&quot;

*'''Meta-analysis, 1994''' - PMID 8272085 &amp;mdash; ''Results of conservative management of clinically localized prostate cancer.'' (Chodak GW, N Engl J Med. 1994 Jan 27;330(4):242-8.
**Meta-analysis from six nonrandomized studies of 828 pts treated conservatively for localized prostate cancer. 
**10-year disease specific survival was 87% for grade 1 or 2 tumors, 34% for grade 3 (out of 3). **Metastasis free survival (censoring deaths from other causes) was 81%, 58%, 26%, respectively for each grade. 
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The strategy of initial conservative management and delayed hormone therapy is a reasonable choice for some men with grade 1 or 2 clinically localized prostate cancer, particularly for those who have an average life expectancy of 10 years or less. New treatment strategies are needed for men with grade 3 prostate cancer.&quot;

*'''Meta-analysis, 1993''' PMID 8319164 -- ''Recent results of management of palpable clinically localized prostate cancer.'' (Adolfsson J, Cancer. 1993 Jul 15;72(2):310-22.)
**Literature review for localized cancer studies since 1980
**10-year DFS was 93% for radical prostatectomy, 83% for deferred treatment, and 62% for external radiation therapy.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;As judged from our analysis, clinically localized prostate cancer often has a protracted course associated with a significant competing mortality and marginal benefit from radical prostatectomy at 10 years in terms of the endpoints used.&quot;

===Watchful waiting vs. Radical Treatment===
*'''SEER-Medicare study''', 2006 (1991-99) - PMID 17164454 &amp;mdash; &quot;Survival associated with treatment vs observation of localized prostate cancer in elderly men.&quot; Wong YN et al. JAMA. 2006 Dec 13;296(22):2683-93.
**44,000 men (age 65-80) from SEER database, diagnosed in 1991-99 with organ-confined low or intermediate grade prostate cancer. Defined treatment as RT or prostatectomy (but not hormones) and observation as not having had RT, surgery, or hormones. 32,000 had treatment, 12,000 observation. 12 year study period.
**37% in obs group died vs 23% in treatment group. HR=0.69 for treatment. Benefit seen in all subgroups, including older men age 75-80.
**Conclusion: suggestion that active treatment leads to improved survival for low to intermediate risk prostate cancer.  Potential for selection bias exists.

****Radical prostatectomy group: 21 (5.8%) died from prostate cancer vs with 31 men (8.4%) assigned to observation (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.09; P=0.09; absolute risk reduction, 2.6 percentage points). 
****Radical prostatectomy was associated with reduced all-cause mortality among men with a PSA value greater than 10 ng per milliliter (P=0.04 for interaction) and possibly among those with intermediate-risk or high-risk tumors (P=0.07 for interaction). 
***Conclusion: Among men with localized prostate cancer detected during the early era of PSA testing, radical prostatectomy did not significantly reduce all-cause or prostate-cancer mortality, as compared with observation, through at least 12 years of follow-up. Absolute differences were less than 3 percentage points.

****Recruited only 731 men, instead of the 2,000. 
****Protocol stated“a life expectancy of at least 10 years” was an entry criterion, by 10 years almost half of the participants had died, leaving only 176 men in the surgery group and 187 observation men, and by 15 years only 30% were alive. They did not recruit healthy men who would be candidates for surgery and randomize them to observation; rather, they recruited men with a limited life expectancy who were candidates for observation and randomized them to surgery.
****&quot;All that the PIVOT results tell us is that in a man who has a life expectancy of 10 years or less and who has low volume disease surgery is not an ideal option. This is old news, and is far from being a “game-changer.” The information in this article is simply not good enough to be of help to an otherwise healthy man in his forties, fifties or early sixties trying to figure out what he should do.&quot;

*'''Scandinavian SPCG-4''' (1989-99) - prostatectomy vs watchful waiting
**Randomized. 695 men, early prostate cancer (T1-T2), biopsy proven. No adjuvant treatment. If symptomatic local progression, treated with orchidectomy or GnRH analog. Clinical follow-up with PSA, exam. Cause of death scored as due to prostate cancer (if progressive distant mets) or due to other causes. 75% had T2 tumors.

==Active Surveillance==
*Individualized management of early prostate cancer
**Men with significant cancer are offered curative treatment
**Men with low risk disease can be actively monitored with serial PSA and repeat prostate biopsies. Decision to continue AS or undergo curative treatment is individualized
***Initial entry criteria are typically those for low risk disease: cT1-T2, GS &lt;=6 (sometimes &lt;=7), PSA &lt;10 (sometimes PSA &lt;15 or &lt;20), low PSA velocity (PSA DT &gt;4 years)
***Surveillance strategies have not been refined yet
***Action thresholds have also not yet been well defined
**NCCN guidelines offer AS as a treatment strategy for some low and intermediate prostate cancer patients

===Strategies===
Comparison of Active Surveillance strategies (eligibility, definition of progression, and frequency of evaluation)

*'''START Trial, NCIC PR.11''' (2007-ongoing)
**Eligibility: up to T2b, Gleason 6 or less, PSA 10 or less. 
**PSA Progression: PSA-DT &lt; 3 yrs (based on at least 5 values over at least 12 months). Or PSA &gt; 20 (at least 2 consecutive measurements).
**Biopsy Progression: Gleason pattern predominant 4 or higher (i.e. 4+3 or higher).
**Clinical Progression: Local progression results in symptoms of urinary retention, gross hematuria, or hydronephrosis. Distant metastases.
**Evaluation:
***Exam: DRE q3m x 2 yrs, then q6m
***PSA: q3m x 2 yrs, then q6m
***Re-biopsy: at year 1, 4, 7, 10, and then every 5 years

==Historical Perspective==
*EBRT as a curative treatment in localized prostate CA became generally accepted in 1950s with development of Cobalt_60 and linac megavoltage technologies. This was a dramatic change from prior kilovoltage therapies used for advanced cancer palliation, and allowed sufficient energy delivery to the prostate without significant toxicity to the skin.
**PMID 6020942 -- ''Radiotherapy in the conservative treatment of operable and locally inoperable carcinoma of the prostate.'' ('''1967 Del Regato''' JA., Radiology. 1967)
**PMID 14303057 -- ''Linear Accelerator Supervoltage Radiotherapy: VII. Carcinoma of the Prostate.'' ('''1965 Bagshaw''' MA, Radiology. 1965)
*[[Radiation_Oncology/RTOG_Trials/7506|RTOG 75-06]] established 70 Gy as the maximum tolerable dose, beyond which significant GI toxicity (diarrhea) developed. The dose was given as 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx x5 days per week to 45-50 Gy either to whole pelvis or to prostate only, followed by a prostate only boost using same fractionation to 20 Gy.
*Treatment fields were generally 6x6 cm up to 11x11 cm &quot;four-field box&quot; determined by bony landmarks, and if necessary rectal contrast and foley catheter. For large fields, the superior border was set midway through the SI joint, inferior border at the level of ischial tuberosities, the lateral border 1.5-2.0cm lateral to the pelvic rim, the anterior border at the front edge of pubic symphisis, and the posterior border at the S2/S3 interspace. For small fields and boost, the superior border extended to the top of the acetabulum and lateraly to include 2/3 of the obturator foramen.  The fields were shaped by corner blocks only. However, reconstruction of these standard fields using CT imaging shows they may not cover tumors that were bulky, locally advanced or invading seminal vesicles.
**PMID 11146903 -- ''External beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer.'' ('''2000 Horwitz''' EM, CA Cancer J Clin. 2000)
**PMID 7939749 -- ''The biological basis and clinical application of three-dimensional conformal external beam radiation therapy in carcinoma of the prostate.'' ('''1994 Leibel''' SA, Semin Oncol. 1994)
*The 5-year clinical control rates were 70-90%; the biochemical disease-free survival (bNED) was ~60% (see below). Unfortunately, the outcomes for locally advanced (T3) disease were much worse, with 5-year outcomes &lt;50%. 
*There are several reasons for the relatively poor outcomes of conventional 2D RT:
**Presence of conventional radiation-resistant clones
**Inability of conventional planning techniques to deliver prescribed dose throughout tumor volume
**Uncertainities in patient positioning, requiring large safety margins to insure tumor coverage and resulting in significant RT doses to the bladder and rectum
*Two potential strategies were pursued to improve cure rates for higher risk patients: 1) increase the RT dose delivered to prostate to kill presumably radiation-resistant clones and 2) add androgen suppression to destroy androgen-dependent micrometastases outside of the PTV field
*For developments with androgen suppression, please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Prostate/Hormones|Hormones]] page
*Several retrospective studies demonstrated that tumor control is related to dose level, and that doses necessary for local control exceed the 70 Gy maximum tolerated dose

**PMID 10894874 -- ''Survival advantage from higher-dose radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer treated on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trials.'' ('''2000 Valicenti''' R, J Clin Oncol. 2000)
*The development of CT and computer-driven planning programs in the mid 1980's led to the development of 3D-CRT at University of Michigan, which allows to more precisely target radiation delivery. The minimization of rectal and bladder volumes included in high-dose regions thus permits an escalation in the tumor dose without concurrent increase in toxicity, and will hopefully improve the probability of local cure.

**PMID 7939749 -- ''The biological basis and clinical application of three-dimensional conformal external beam radiation therapy in carcinoma of the prostate.'' ('''1994 Leibel''' SA, Semin Oncol 1994; 21:580-97.)
*University of Michigan, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Fox Chase, and MD Anderson pioneered sequential dose escalation from 70 Gy to 80+ Gy. Based on their early results, RTOG sponsored a 3D-CRT dose escalation trial [[Radiation_Oncology/RTOG_Trials/9406|94-06]] in 1994. Its successful conclusion led to the initiation of a Phase III randomized trial [[Radiation_Oncology/RTOG_Trials/0126|01-26]] comparing 70.2 Gy vs 79.2 Gy, which is ongoing.
*Meanwhile, the 3D-CRT technique has been further modified to include intensity modulation ([[Radiation_Oncology/Prostate/IMRT|IMRT]]) of the treatment beams using multi-leaf collimators in a dynamic mode (in motion during radiation delivery). This provides improved conformality and increased dose homogeneity in the planning target volume. While acute toxicity appears better than in 3D-CRT, outcome reports are as yet lacking.
**PMID 8690638 -- ''Conformal radiation treatment of prostate cancer using inversely-planned intensity-modulated photon beams produced with dynamic multileaf collimation.'' ('''1996 Ling''' CC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1996; 35:721-30.)

==Field Size==
'''Conventional (2D) Technique'''
*Treatment fields are generally  &quot;four-field box&quot; determined by bony landmarks, and if necessary rectal contrast and foley catheter. 
*For large fields, the superior border is set midway through the SI joint, inferior border at the level of ischial tuberosities, the lateral border 1.5-2.0cm lateral to the pelvic rim, the anterior border at the front edge of pubic symphisis, and the posterior border at the S2/S3 interspace. 
*For small fields and boost, the superior border extends to the top of the acetabulum and lateraly to include 2/3 of the obturator foramen.  
*However, reconstruction of these standard fields using CT imaging shows they may not cover tumors that are bulky, locally advanced or invading seminal vesicles.

===Para-aortic===
*'''[[Radiation Oncology/RTOG Trials/7506|RTOG 75-06]]''' (1976-1983)
**Randomized. 523 patients with clinical Stage A2-B N+ or Stage C. Arm 1) Pelvic RT 40-45 Gy + prostate boost 20-25 Gy (minimum 65 Gy) vs. Arm 2) Pelvic + PA RT 40-45 Gy + prostate boost (minimum 65 Gy)
**'''1986''' PMID 3514555 -- &quot;Extended field (periaortic) irradiation in carcinoma of the prostate--analysis of RTOG 75-06.&quot; (Pilepich MV, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1986 Mar;12(3):345-51.). Median F/U 4.2 years
***Outcome: No difference between arms for DFS, DM, OS
***Toxicity: Periaortic RT does not increase bowel injury. Prostate doses &gt;70Gy result in increased bowel injury (20% vs 10% rectal bleed) but not bladder injury
***Conclusion: No benefit to elective peri-aortic irradiation

===Pelvic===
'''''Randomized'''''
*'''GETUG-01''' (French)(1998-2004)
**Randomized. 444 patients, T1b-T3 N0 pNx. Randomized to Arm 1) prostate + pelvis vs. Arm 2) prostate only. RT dose pelvis 46 Gy and prostate 66-70 Gy. Stratified into low (T1-2 and GS &lt;=6 and PSA &lt;=12), intermediate, and high risk (T3 or GS &gt;=7 or PSA &gt;=12 ng/ml; 79%) groups. Short term hormonal therapy (6 mos) allowed only for high risk group.

***5-year outcome: PFS 66% vs. 65% (NS); high risk PFS 63% vs. 60% (NS); low risk PFS 75% vs. 84% (NS)
***Toxicity: Pelvic arm small but nonsignificant late GI toxicity
***Conclusion: no benefit to pelvic radiotherapy
**Comment (Nguyen/D'Amico 2008, PMID 18421061): Two randomized trials (94-13 and GETUG-01) have both shown no benefit for pelvic RT. Therefore, evidence is lacking for using pelvic fields in intermediate- and high-risk PCA. Suggest randomized trial for T3/T4 and GS &gt;=4+3
**Comment (Roach 2008, PMID 18669477): Based on the data, the burden of proof to not use WPRT on those who choose not to use it. 
**Comment (Nguyen/D'Amico 2008, same PMID 18669477 [http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/26/22/3817 link]): Given the potential toxicity, and the negative results of the two trials, it is difficult to justify WPRT for the type of men studied in RTOG 94-13 and GETUG 01

*'''[[Radiation Oncology/RTOG Trials/9413|RTOG 94-13]]''' (1995-99)
**Randomized. 1323 patients. High risk patients with estimated risk of LN involvement of 15% or more by the Roach equation and PSA &lt; 100.

***Outcome: 5-yr PFS 48.3% (WP/NHT), 36.8% (PO/NHT), 38.1% (WP/AHT), 40.4% (PO/AHT). Pairwise: WP/NHT &gt; PO/NHT (SS), WP/NHT &gt; WP/AHT (p=0.06). No difference in survival. 5-yr biochemical failure 35.9%, 45.5%, 42.8%, and 40.0%. 
***Conclusion: Improved PFS for whole pelvic treatment and for neoadjuvant hormones for high risk patients.
**'''&quot;Mini pelvis; 2006&quot;''' - PMID 17011443, 2006 &amp;mdash; &quot;Whole-pelvis, &quot;mini-pelvis,&quot; or prostate-only external beam radiotherapy after neoadjuvant and concurrent hormonal therapy in patients treated in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9413 trial.&quot; Roach M et al.

***Subset analysis in patients with N&amp;CHT hormones (WP+NCHT n=325, PO+NCHT n=324). &quot;Mini pelvis&quot; were defined as those randomized to prostate only RT who had a field size &gt; median size of 10 x 11 cm, while &quot;prostate only&quot; had median size field &lt;10x11 cm.
***Outcome: Median PFS 5.2 (WP), 3.7 (MP), and 2.9 yrs (PO). 
***Conclusion: In patients with neoadjuvant+concurrent RT, increasing field size appears to have impact on PFS

Median F/U for alive patients 7.0 years
***Outcome: PFS WPRT+NHT 62% vs. PORT+NHT 66% vs. WPRT+AHT 69% vs. PORT+AHT 62% (NS); also no difference in OS. By pairs, no difference between WPRT and PORT, and no difference between NHT and AHT. No difference in LF or DM
***Toxicity: No difference in RT Grade 3+ toxicity among the 4 arms
***Conclusion: No benefit for NHT + WPRT compared with PORT + AHT
**Comment: the benefit of neoadjuvant hormones combined with irradiation to the pelvic lymph nodes implies that the benefit of hormones is in increasing the effectiveness of RT on the lymph nodes (which receive low dose RT) vs that of increasing local control in the prostate which receives a high dose of RT.

'''''Retrospective'''''
*'''Italy (Rome)''' (1994-2007) - Long term ADT; Pelvis vs Prostate Only
**Retrospective. 358 high risk pts (T2c-T4, or G7-10, or PSA&gt;20). Treated to pelvis + prostate, but pts deemed at risk for increased GI toxicity (those with inflammatory bowel disease, or diverticulosis/itis) were treated to prostate/SV only (PORT). 45 Gy to the pelvis; 70.2-73.8 Gy to the prostate. ADT began 2 months prior to RT, median duration 24 months.
**46.9% treated with WPRT and 53.1% with PORT. Stratified by nodal involvement risk using Roach formula (cutoffs &gt;15, &gt;20, &gt;25, &gt;30).

*Multinational, retrospective, 2005 (1986-2003) - PMID 15964706 &amp;mdash; &quot;Lack of benefit of pelvic radiation in prostate cancer patients with a high risk of positive pelvic lymph nodes treated with high-dose radiation.&quot; Vargas CE et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Dec 1;63(5):1474-82.
**Purpose: to determine the need to treat the pelvic lymph nodes in pts with LN risk of &gt;15%
**Retrospective review of 1491 pts treated at 3 centers in the USA and Germany. Pts were stratified into groups depending on the calculated risk of LN involvement by the Roach equation: Group I, &lt;15%; Group II, 15-30%; Group III, &gt;30%. Pts were treated with EBRT and brachytherapy. 596 pts had &gt;15% risk.  Of these, the pelvis was treated at two centers (312 pts) and was not treated the third center (284 pts). 42% of pts received hormonal therapy for &lt;=6 months. 
**Median f/u 4 yrs for all pts, 4.3 yrs for those high risk pts. For the high risk pts, there was no difference in clinical failure, CSS, or OS. 
**Comment: Biochemical failure was not specified and may be important with longer follow-up.


'''''Seminal vesicles:'''''
*William Beaumont Hospital, 2002 - PMID 12377319 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of prostate cancer with radiotherapy: should the entire seminal vesicles be included in the clinical target volume?&quot; Kestin L et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Nov 1;54(3):686-97.
**Studied prostatectomy specimens and measured the length of SV invasion
**Median length of SV involvement 1.0 cm; 90th percentile, 2.0 cm; median of 25% of length of SV was involved. 
**Conclusion: when treating the SV for prostate cancer, only the proximal 2.0-2.5 cm (approximately 60%) of the SV should be included within the CTV.

==Prostate Localization==
Change in prostate location between dose fractions can be significant. Displacement is greatest in the AP direction, where it can reach 2+ cm, and is correlated with rectal and bladder filling. Given that 3D-CRT/IMRT PTV margins are typically 0.5-1 cm posteriorly to avoid unacceptable rectal dose and that many PCAs are located in the posterior zone, there is a significant risk of geographical miss upon prostate motion. Consistent (preferably empty) rectum and bladder during simulation and treatment, as well as daily verification of prostate location may decrease the risk of geographical miss and improve outcomes.

**Randomized. 32 patients. Arm 1) VacLok immobilization vs. Arm 2) BodyFix adbominal compression. Interfraction motion &gt;3 mm corrected pre-treatment.
**Outcome: No difference in interfraction or intrafraction motion with or without adominal compression
**Conclusion: Addition of abdominal compression didn't influence interfraction or intrafraction prostate motion

*'''MD Anderson; 2007''' PMID 17892900 -- &quot;Is a 3-mm intrafractional margin sufficient for daily image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy of prostate cancer?&quot; (Melancon AD, Radiother Oncol. 2007 Nov;85(2):251-9. Epub 2007 Sep 24.)
**Prospective. 46 patients. CT scan acquired prior and after fraction. Pre-fraction IMRT plan recalculated on post-fraction CT
**Outcome: Median reduction in prescribed dose for prostate 0.1% and SV 1.0%; and minimum dose 0.5 Gy and 1.5 Gy. Three prostates and 8 SVs did not maintain coverage &gt;70 Gy. Rectal filling correlated with decreased coverage
**Conclusion: 3 mm intrafraction margin adequate for prostate coverage but not SV coverage

===Prostate location variability===
Marker implantation:
*'''UCSF''' PMID 14529767 -- ''Evaluation of ultrasound-based prostate localization for image-guided radiotherapy.'' ('''2003 Langen''' Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2003; 57:635-44.)
**Daily BAT U/S measurements compared to implanted markers
**Markers: AP -0.9 +/- 3.9mm (posteriorly), SI 0.1 +/- 3.9mm, LR and 0.2 +/- 3.4mm
**BAT: BAT alignments were systematically different from the marker alignments in the superoinferior, and lateral directions. The remaining random variability of the prostate position after the ultrasound-based alignment was similar to the initial variability. However, the occurrence of displacements &gt;/=5 mm was reduced in the AP direction.

*'''Michigan''' PMID 7995741 -- ''Measurement of prostate movement over the course of routine radiotherapy using implanted markers.'' ('''1995 Balter''' JM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys; 31:113-8.)
**Translation and/or rotation of the prostate was detected in 70% of the treatments. Maximum  displacement was 7.5 mm; typical translations were between 0-4 mm.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Although significant prostate displacement can occur between treatments, the typical range of movement seen along a major axis was less than 5 mm. Proper treatment planning should consider the movement of the target independent of surrounding bony anatomy.&quot;

*'''Ottawa''' PMID 8539455 -- ''Prostate motion during standard radiotherapy as assessed by fiducial markers.'' ('''1995 Crook''' JM, Radiother Oncol; 37:35-42.)
**The base of the prostate was displaced more than 1 cm posteriorly in 30% of patients and in 11% in the inferior direction.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Changes in prostate position of this magnitude preclude the use of standard margins.&quot;


CT scan:
*'''MSKCC''' PMID 10368047 -- ''Quantification and predictors of prostate position variability in 50 patients evaluated with multiple CT scans during conformal radiotherapy.'' ('''1999 Zelefsky''' MJ, Radiother Oncol 1999; 50:225-34.)
**Mean prostate displacement AP -1.2 +/- 2.9 mm (posteriorly), SI -0.5 +/- 3.3 mm (inferiorly), and -0.6 +/- 0.8 mm (right)
**Mean SV displacement: AP - 1.4 +/- 4.9 mm (posteriorly), SI 1.3 +/- 5.5 mm (superiorly), and -0.8 +/- 3.1 (right)
** AP movement of both the prostate and seminal vesicles were correlated with changes in rectal volume (P = 0.0014 and &lt; 0.0001, respectively) more than with changes in bladder volume (P = 0.030 for seminal vesicles and 0.19 for prostate). A logistic regression analysis identified the combination of rectal volume &gt; 60 cm3 and bladder volumes &gt; 40 cm3 as the only predictor of large ( &gt; 3 mm) systematic deviations for the prostate and seminal vesicles (P = 0.05) 
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Prostatic displacement during a course of radiotherapy is more pronounced among patients with initial planning scans with large rectal and bladder volumes. Such patients may require more generous margins around the CTV to assure its enclosure within the prescription dose region.&quot;

*'''MDACC''' PMID 9806528 -- ''Prostate target volume variations during a course of radiotherapy.'' ('''1998 Antolak''' JA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys; 42:661-72.)
**CT scan at plan, then 3 follow-on q 2 weeks
**The mobility of the CTV was characterized by standard deviations of 0.09 cm (left-right), 0.36 cm (cranial-caudal), and 0.41cm (anterior-posterior).
**Mobility of both the prostate and seminal vesicles was very significantly correlated with rectal volume.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Margins between the CTV and PTV based on the simple geometric requirement that a point on the edge of the CTV is enclosed by the PTV 95% of the time are 0.7 cm in the lateral and cranial-caudal directions, and 1.1 cm in the anterior-posterior direction. However, minimum dose to the CTV and avoidance of organs at risk are more important considerations when drawing beam apertures. More consistent methods for reproducing prostate position (e.g., empty rectum) and more sophisticated beam aperture optimization are needed to guarantee consistent coverage of the CTV while avoiding organs at risk.&quot;

*'''JCRT''' PMID 8567348 -- ''Analysis of prostate and seminal vesicle motion: implications for treatment planning.'' ('''1996 Beard''' CJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1996; 34:451-8.)
**The distribution of positional changes were generally small (&lt; 0.5 cm), but maximum displacements of 1.5-2.2 cm did occur
**Bladder volume changes between the scans were small and did not correlate with target motion (P = 0.67)
**Both rectal volume and rectal diameter changes correlated with target motion for both the prostate (p = 0.004 and 0.005, respectively) and seminal vesicles (p &lt; 0.001 and &lt; 0.001, respectively).
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Target motion occurs during the course of treatment planning and delivery and should be considered when designing conformal radiation fields.&quot;

**Center-of-mass (CM) showed motion of less than 1 mm in the left-right direction, while motion ranging from 0 to +/- 1 cm was observed in the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions. 
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Changes in the location of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and normal tissue volumes during the course of radiation therapy occur and have dosimetric consequences that may impact tumor control and normal tissue complication probabilities.&quot;


Ultrasound:
*'''MDACC''' PMID 12738318 -- ''Experience of ultrasound-based daily prostate localization.'' ('''2003 Chandra''' A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2003; 56:436-47.)
**Daily BAT U/S measurements
**Interfraction 1 SD was AP 4.9mm, SI 4.4mm, and LR 2.8mm
**% of BAT where shift was &gt;5mm (potential to violate PTV):AP 29%, SI 23%, LR 9%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Although the accuracy of the BAT was not addressed in this investigation, we found a significant percentage of large shifts being made from the initial alignment position.&quot;

**Prospective. 17 patients, tracked with Calypso, 550 continuous tracking sessions
**Outcome: Average displacement &gt;3 mm in 14%, &gt;5 mm in 3% of total treatment time. For individual patients, 36% and 11%. For individual fractions, 99% and 99%. Displacements increased with elapsed time from set-up
**Conclusion: Prostate displacement intra-fraction determined

IJROBP Volume 63, Supplement 1, 1 October 2005, Page S4.
**Used Calypso System that continuously tracks implanted markers. 3 markers placed in each prostate of 11 pts. Pts monitored for 8 mins.
**If based on skin marks alone, required margins (avg.) of 8.0 mm left-right, 7.3 mm A-P, and 10.0 mm C-C (without intrafraction motion), or 8.2, 10.2, and 12.5 mm (including intrafraction motion). Positioning by prostate markers at the start of treatment reduced margins to 1.8, 5.8, and 7.1 mm.  Interbeam adjustment reduced to 0.4, 2.3, 1.8 mm. Using intrafractional adjustment, reduced to 0.3, 1.5, and 1.5 mm.

===Prostate location and outcome===
*'''MDACC''' PMID 15989996 -- &quot;Increased risk of biochemical and local failure in patients with distended rectum on the planning CT for prostate cancer radiotherapy.&quot; (de Crevoisier R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Jul 15;62(4):965-73.)
**Retrospective review of 127 patients treated with 3D-CRT to 78Gy
**Patients with distended rectum on planning CT had significantly worse PSA control (p=0.0009) than those with normal rectum. Rectal distention had greater impact on outcome (HR=3.89) than high risk disease (HR=2.45)
**Conclusion: &quot;We found strong evidence that rectal distension on the treatment-planning CT scan decreased the probability of biochemical control, local control, and rectal toxicity in patients who were treated without daily image-guided prostate localization, presumably because of geographic misses. Therefore, an empty rectum is warranted at the time of simulation.&quot;

==Outcome Prediction==
After biochemical failure following treatment, predictors for distant metastases and death are PSA-DT, clinical stage, and biopsy Gleason score.

*'''MDACC, 2007''' (1993-1998) - PMID 17161554 -- &quot;The predictive value of 2-year posttreatment biopsy after prostate cancer radiotherapy for eventual biochemical outcome.&quot;  Vance et al.  Int J of Radiat Onc, Biol, Phys. 67(3):828-33, 2007 Mar 1. 
**164 pts who underwent a planned 2yr post-tx biopsy.
**Current nadir + 2 used as biochemical failure.  Bx results divided into several categories:  normal, scant atypical and malignant cells, carcinoma w/ tx effect, carcinoma w/o tx effect.
**Significant association b/w bx results and eventual biochemical failure.

*'''MSKCC''' PMID 15681527 -- ''Outcome predictors for the increasing PSA state after definitive external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.'' ('''2005 Zelefsky MJ''', J Clin Oncol.)
**1,650 patients with T1-T3 treated with high-dose 3D-CRT; 381 patients developed PSA failure; median follow-up 92 months from completion of RT
**5-year incidence of DM after an established PSA relapse was 29%
**PSA-DT (P &lt; 0.001), clinical T stage (P &lt; 0.001), and Gleason score (P = 0.007) independent predictors for DM after established biochemical failure 
**PSA-DT for favorable (20.0 months), intermediate (13.2 mo), and unfavorable (8.2 mo) -risk patients  **3-year incidence of DM for patients with PSA-DT of 0-3, 3-6, 6-12, 12+ months was 49%, 41%, 20%, and 7%, respectively (P &lt; .001). 
**Patients with PSA-DT of 0-3 and 3-6 months demonstrated a 7.0 DM hazard and 6.6 death hazard compared with PSA-DT 12+
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In addition to clinical stage and Gleason score, PSA-DT was a powerful predictor of DM among patients who develop an isolated PSA relapse after external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Patients who develop biochemical relapse with PSA-DT &lt; or = 6 months should be considered for systemic therapy or experimental protocols because of the high propensity for rapid DM development.&quot;

*'''Fox Chase; 2003''' (1989-97) PMID 12569615 -- &quot;Validation of a treatment policy for patients with prostate specific antigen failure after three-dimensional conformal prostate radiation therapy.&quot; (Pinover WH, Cancer.  2003 Feb 15;97(4):1127-33.) Median F/U 44 months.
**248 pts with PSA failure (ASTRO definition). Treated 1989-97 with definitive RT, median 74 Gy. Per policy, pts were treated with hormonal therapy for PSA failure if PSA doubling time &lt; 12 months; for PSA doubling time &gt; 12 months, observation without treatment. Endpoints were measured from time of PSA failure (midpoint between PSA nadir and first rise in PSA).
**Of pts with PSA-DT &lt;12 months (148), 40%(59) were treated with immediate AD, 60% refused. Pts with PSA-DT &gt;12m (100), 89% were observed, 11% started immediate AD.
**47 pts had DM. For those with short PSA-DT, improved 5-yr FDM (78% v 57%) if treated with AD. Median time to DM: 25 months vs 6 months.  For long PSA-DT, no sig diff in FDM (88% v 92%) with AD.  86% of pts who achieved PSA nadir &lt; 1.5 were free of DM, vs 50% who did not.
**Conclusion: pts with PSA-DT &lt; 12 months benefit from immediate AD

==Effect of RT on testosterone==
*British Columbia, 2002 - PMID 11992055 &amp;mdash; &quot;What happens to testosterone after prostate radiation monotherapy and does it matter?&quot; Pickles T et al. J Urol. 2002 Jun;167(6):2448-52.
**666 men received RT without androgen ablation. Testosterone and PSA were measured every 3-6 months. 
**Testosterone decreased by to an avg of 83% of baseline at a median nadir of 6 months; 7.5% fell to &lt; 50%. 97% returned to normal levels but only 60% returned to their baseline.  No correlation with biochemical control.


==Toxicity==
Acute toxicity appears to depend primarily on volume treated, more than DVH. 
Efforts to reduce toxicity currently proceed along 3 lines:
*Exclusion of seminal vesicles or treatment of only proximal 2 cm in appropriately selected patients
*Reduction of margins with improved daily positioning (U/S, CT, fiduciary markers)
*Pre-reduction of prostate volume using neoadjuvant hormone therapy
**PMID 9123735 -- ''Neoadjuvant androgen ablation prior to radiotherapy for prostate cancer: reducing the potential morbidity of therapy.'' ('''1997 Zelefsky''' MJ, Urology 1997; 49:38-45.). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy effectively reduces the volume of normal tissue exposed to high radiation doses in the majority of treated patients and decreases the potential morbidity of therapy.&quot;


*'''William Beaumont, 2005''' (1999-2002) PMID 16111582 -- &quot;Phase II dose escalation study of image-guided adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer: use of dose-volume constraints to achieve rectal isotoxicity.&quot; (Vargas C, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Sep 1;63(1):141-9.)
**Phase II. 331 patients with cT1-T3N0. RT constraints: 1) &lt;30% of rectal wall &gt;75.6 Gy, and 2) &lt;5% of rectal wall &gt;82 Gy. Doses 72, 73.8, 75.6, 77.4 and 79.2 Gy. Median F/U 1.6  years
**Toxicity: 2-year late Grade 3+ rectal toxicity 3%, Grade 2+ 17%. No difference by dose level
**Intermediate group (Prostate + SV) worse chronic rectal bleeding (17%) vs. low-risk group (Prostate only) 8% (SS)
**Conclusion: high dose (79.2 Gy) safely delivered by adaptive RT process. Larger PTV increases rectal wall dose and chronic toxicity

*'''MDACC''' PMID 14630260 -- ''Hazards of dose escalation in prostate cancer radiotherapy.'' ('''2003 Kuban''' D, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2003; 57:1260-8.)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients, although it appears that radiation-dose escalation may improve PSA-DF outcome, the price paid in treatment morbidity can be high without adequate attention to dose-volume constraints of normal tissue. Care must be taken to consider not only the hazard of tumor recurrence but also that of complications.&quot;

*PMID 12459352 -- ''Late rectal toxicity: dose-volume effects of conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer.'' ('''2002 Huang''' EH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002)
**163 T1b-T3c patients treated 1992-1999 with 3D-CRT, to a total isocenter dose of 74-78 Gy at MDACC; median follow-up was 62 months (range 24-102).
**6-year Grade 2+ late rectal toxicity rate was 25%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Dose-volume histogram analyses clearly indicated a volume effect on the probability of developing late rectal complications. Therefore, dose escalation may be safely achieved by adherence to dose-volume histogram constraints during treatment planning and organ localization at the time of treatment to ensure consistent patient setup.&quot;

*PMID 11172950 -- ''Late rectal bleeding after conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer. II. Volume effects and dose-volume histograms.'' ('''2001 Jackson A''', Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001)
**Average DVH for the rectal wall of patients with bleeding was significantly higher than DVH of patients without bleeding in both (70.2 Gy or 75.6 Gy) dose groups (p = 0.02, 70.2 Gy; p &lt; 0.0001, 75.6 Gy).
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Significant volume effects were found in the probability of late rectal bleeding for patients undergoing 3D-CRT for prostate cancer with prescription doses of 70.2 and 75.6 Gy. The percent volumes exposed to 71 and 77 Gy in the 70.2 and 75.6 Gy dose groups respectively were significantly correlated with rectal bleeding. The independent correlation of small V(RW) with rectal bleeding may indicate the existence of a functional reserve for the rectum. The independent association with larger percent volumes exposed to intermediate doses ( approximately 46 Gy) seen in both dose groups may indicate that a large surrounding region of intermediate dose may interfere with the ability to repair the effects of a central high dose region.&quot;</text>

==Erectile function==
*PMID 15890585, 2004 - Merrick GS et al.
**Most were Pd-103, 16% were I-125. 37% had implant only; the remainder had EBRT to prostate + seminal vesicles. Hormones used in 23%.
**3-yr potency preservation of 50.5%.  The preimplant erectile score was 29 for those with adequate postimplant function and 25 for those without.  Median time to ED was 5.4 months. After brachy, erectile score was 20 in potent patients and 3 in those with ED.  On multivariate analysis, the preimplant erectile score and D50 to the proximal crura predicted for ED.

**Retrospective. 1561 pts. Treated with various techniques including brachy alone, brachy + hormones, or brachy + EBRT. Death from prostate cancer was counted if a pt died with the presence of metastatic disease. Pts who had rising PSA at the time of death or who were receiving systemic treatment at the time of death were not necessarily counted as prostate cancer related deaths.

*** Retrospective. 209 patients, low/intermediate/high risk. HDR 16-24Gy/4 + EBRT 45 Gy. Median F/U 5.3 years
***Outcome:Overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival rates at 3.3 years were 97.8% and 98.4%, respectively. On univariate analysis the prognostic factors related bC were GR (p= 0.040), GS ≤ 6 (p= 0.002), total dose of HDR-BT ≥ 20 Gy (p&lt; 0.001), 3DHDR (p&lt; 0.001), BED-HDR ≥ 99 Gy1.5 (p&lt;0.001) and BED-TT ≥ 185 (p&lt;0.001). On multivariate analysis the statistical significant predictive factors related to bC were RG (p&lt; 0.001), HDR-BT ≥ 20 Gy (p=0.008) and 3DHDR (p&lt;0.001).

***On multivariate analysis the only statistical significant predictive factor for biochemical control (bNED) was the risk group.
***Conclusion: &quot;Although the radiation dose administered to the prostate is an important factor related to bNED, this could not be established with statistical significance in this group of patients. &quot;

==PSA kinetics==
'''''Brachytherapy alone:'''''
*'''Princess Margaret, 2007''' (1999-2003) PMID 17869662 &amp;mdash; &quot;PSA kinetics and PSA bounce following permanent seed prostate brachytherapy.&quot; (Crook J, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Oct 1;69(2):426-33.)
**292 pts treated with I-125 brachytherapy without EBRT or hormones. All have &gt;30 months of PSA followup.
**Resolved PSA bounces (&gt;=0.2) seen in 40%, median onset 15 months with median magnitude 0.76. Magnitude &gt;2 (i.e. biochemical failure by Phoenix definition) seen in 15%. Younger age is predictive of bounce.
**Conclusions: The PSA bounce does not predict subsequent failure. Caution is advised in interpreting an early increasing PSA level in the first 30 months after 125I brachytherapy in favorable-risk patients. 

'''''With hormonal thearpy:'''''
*'''Germany, 2007''' PMID 17270634 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prostate-specific antigen kinetics after brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy and neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.&quot; (Pinkawa M, Urology. 2007 Jan;69(1):129-33.)
**75 pts treated with neoadj hormones (median 4 mo). RT was implant alone (29 pts), EBRT + implant boost (21), or EBRT only (25). Minimum 24 mo f/u.
**Trend: initial nadir - PSA 0.1 at 3 months after RT. Rising PSA levels noted in 83%. Subsequent PSA rises/bounces noted (one time-23%, two-21%, or more-17%) to median 0.6 at 16 months. New nadir of 0.1 reached by 35 mo.
**Conclusion: Temporarily rising PSA levels can be expected for most patients after primary RT and NHT following a first nadir.

'''''Mixed (pts with and without hormones)'''''
*'''Cleveland Clinic, 2007''' PMID 16213667 &amp;mdash; &quot;PSA kinetics after prostate brachytherapy: PSA bounce phenomenon and its implications for PSA doubling time.&quot; (Ciezki JP,  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Feb 1;64(2):512-7.)
**162 pts, brachytherapy +/- hormones (in 38%).
**PSA bounce (&gt;=0.2) in 46%. 
**Conclusions: &quot;Patients experiencing a PSA bounce are more likely to be younger and will have a better bRFS. The PSADT cannot differentiate a PSA bounce from bF. The time to the initial PSA rise after nadir is an excellent discriminator of bF from PSA bounce. The time of the PSA rise after nadir occurs far sooner for a PSA bounce than for bF. This factor should be considered when assessing a patient with a rising PSA level after PI before a patient is administered salvage therapy.&quot;


===PSA bounce===
*'''Cleveland Clinic''' (1996-2005)

***Median f/u 58 m. PSA bounce &amp;ge;0.2 above nadir in 30%. Median time to first PSA rise was 17.4 months vs 34.35 months for bF. 
***The use of PSA bounce definitions other than 0.2 did not provide additional prognostic benefit. Patients with PSA bounce had superior bRFS rates to those without PSA bounce. The time to first rise in PSA is an important discriminator between a PSA bounce and bF; a bounce usually occurs much earlier than a rise that corresponds to bF. 
***Conclusion: A bounce definition of a rise &amp;ge;0.2 ng/mL is a reliable definition among several other definitions. The time to first PSA rise is the most valuable factor for distinguishing between a bounce and biochemical failure.

**295 pts. I-125. 
**55% showed a bounce of at least 0.1 ng/ml. Mean bounce 0.8 at mean time to bounce 19 months. 11% of pts had 3 consecutive rises (met ASTRO criteria for biochemical failure), among which 56% had complete normalization of PSA. D90 &gt; 200 Gy predicted PSA bounce of &gt; 0.4.

==Prostatectomy vs. Watchful waiting==
''Please see the [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate:Natural_History#Watchful_Waiting|Watchful waiting]] chapter

==Role of surgical staging==
*Rate of lymphedema is 25-30% in pts undergoing limited dissection, 66% if complete (therapeutic) dissection in pts receiving XRT.
**[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=6483687 Abstract] Pilepich, from RTOG 75-06 and 77-06

*[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9531360 Abstract] &amp;mdash; &quot;Impact of surgical staging in evaluating the radiotherapeutic outcome in RTOG #77-06, a phase III study for T1BN0M0 (A2) and T2N0M0 (B) prostate carcinoma.&quot; Asbell et al. 
*:Not randomized. 12-year OS 48% (staging laparotomy) vs 38% (lymphangiogram), DFS 38% vs 26%, decreased bone mets. Indicates that lymphangiogram group was understaged compared with surgical group.

==Natural history after RP==
*'''Multi-Institutional; 2009''' (1987-2005) PMID 19636023 -- &quot;Prostate cancer-specific mortality after radical prostatectomy for patients treated in the prostate-specific antigen era.&quot; (Stephenson AJ, J Clin Oncol. 2009 Sep 10;27(26):4300-5. Epub 2009 Jul 27.)
**Retrospective; Memorial Sloan Kettering and Baylor patients to develop a nomogram, validation on Cleveland Clinic and University of Michigan data. 12,677 patients treated with RP. Primary outcome PCA-specific mortality. Median F/U 4 years
**Outcome: 15-year PCSM 12%, all-cause mortality 38%. Only 4% of contemporary patients had predicted 15-year PCSM &gt;5%. Using D'Amico risk groups, 15-year PCSM good risk 2% vs. intermediate risk 10% vs. high risk 19% (good risk comprised 46% of patients)
**Conclusion: Few patients will die from prostate cancer within 15 years after radical prostatectomy, despite presence of adverse clinical features


Natural history of biochemical failure:
*Pound, 1999 - PMID 10235151 &amp;mdash; &quot;Natural history of progression after PSA elevation following radical prostatectomy.&quot; Pound CR et al. JAMA. 1999 May 5;281(17):1591-7.
**315 of 1997 men developed biochemical failure. 34% developed mets in median time to mets 8 years after PSA elevation. Median time to death 5 years after mets. Predictive of mets: Gleason 8-10, PSA recurrence &lt; 2 yrs after surgery, PSA doubling time &lt; 10 months. 

'''Factors predicting local recurrence:'''
:''See section:'' [[Radiation_Oncology/Prostate/Adjuvant_RT#Clinical and Pathologic Factors predicting recurrence|Clinical and Pathologic Factors predicting recurrence]] at [[../Adjuvant RT|Adjuvant RT after Prostatectomy]].

'''Factors predicting biochemical failure:'''
*'''Harvard''' 2005 (1989-2002) - PMID 16051949 &amp;mdash; &quot;Identifying patients at risk for significant versus clinically insignificant postoperative prostate-specific antigen failure.&quot; D'Amico AV et al.  J Clin Oncol. 2005 Aug 1;23(22):4975-9.
**1011 pts. Looked for factors identifying post-op PSA doubling time &lt; 3 months (&quot;clinically significant&quot;) or PSA DT &gt; 12 months or no failure (&quot;clinically insignificant&quot;)
**Predictive of clinically significant failure: 1) preoperative PSA velocity &gt; 2 ng/mL/yr, and 2) Gleason 7 or above.  
**Predictive of clinically ''in''significant or no failure: 1) PSA &lt; 10, 2) nonpalpable cancer with Gleason 6 or less, and 3)preoperative PSA velocity &lt; 2

'''Factors predicting metastatic disease:''' 

*PSA doubling time &lt; 10 months (from Pound)
*Extracapsular extension, SV invasion, Gleason 8-10, higher PSA at time of biochemical failure &amp;mdash; (Dotan ZA et al - Abstract 162, 2005 Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Symposium) - nomogram

'''Factors predicting survival:'''
*Post-Prostatectomy PSA Velocity Linked to Increased Mortality
*:Anthony D'Amico.  NEJM, 8 July 2004, 351:125-135

*D'Amico - (Abstract) American Urological Association, 2005, Abstract 1678
**1011 pts. Evaluated factors predictive of mortality - included 1-year PSA velocity prior to diagnosis, baseline PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage.  Correlated with post-operative PSA doubling time, and correlated PSA doubling time with mortality.
**Short postoperative PSA doubling time (&lt;3 months) predicted death due to cancer and overall deaths.  Short PSA DT more likely in pts with preoperative PSA velocity &gt; 2 per year and a Gleason of 7 or higher.  Factors predictive of long PSA doubling time (&gt;12 months) or no PSA failure were baseline PSA &lt; 10, clinical stage T1c or less, Gleason 6 or less, and PSA velocity &lt; 0.5 / yr.
**Conclusion: pts with protracted PSA after surgery may not need salvage treatment.

*'''Johns Hopkins''' (1982-2000)
**379 pts with biochemical recurrences after RP. PSA-DT groups of &lt;3 (6%), 3-9 (31%), 9-15 (21%), &gt;15 (42%) months
**'''2005''' PMID 16046649 &amp;mdash; &quot;Risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality following biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.&quot; Freedland SJ et al. JAMA. 2005 Jul 27;294(4):433-9. Median f/u 10 yrs after surgery.
***Prostate-cancer specific survival is predicted by: PSA doubling time, Gleason score, and interval from surgery to biochemical failure.
**'''2007''' PMID 17470867 -- &quot;Death in patients with recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: prostate-specific antigen doubling time subgroups and their associated contributions to all-cause mortality.&quot; (Freedland SJ, J Clin Oncol. 2007 May 1;25(13):1765-71.) Median F/U 11.4 years
***Outcome: PSA-DT &lt;3 deaths account for only 13% due to low number; they die quickly, but with longer follow-up, slower PSA-DT patients start to die too. Intermediate PSA-DT 3-9 months account for 60% of PCA-related deaths
***In PSA-DT &lt;15 months, 90% will die *of* prostate cancer, not *with* prostate cancer at 15 years. Only if PSA-DT &gt;15 months, competing-cause mortality greater
***Conclusion: Even intermediate PSA-DT leads to prostate-cancer death

==Prostatectomy vs RT==
:''Also see:'' [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/Localized Prostate Cancer]] (for comparisons of treatment modalities)
*'''Cleveland Clinic''', 2002 (1990-98) - PMID 12177097 &amp;mdash; &quot;Comparison of the efficacy of local therapies for localized prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a large single-institution experience with radical prostatectomy and external-beam radiotherapy.&quot; Kupelian PA et al. J Clin Oncol. 2002 Aug 15;20(16):3376-85. 
**Retrospective, single-institution. 1682 pts with clinical stage T1-T2, treated during the PSA era. Treated with prostatectomy or RT to 68-78 Gy (median 70.2 Gy). Excluded pts with adjuvant androgen deprivation. Allowed neoadjuvant androgen deprivation if less than 6 months (19%). End-point was biochemical relapse free survival. Used ASTRO definition for PSA failure after RT. For RP failure was two consecutive PSA &gt; 0.2; defined failure at time of first detectable level. 
**bRFS increased for prostatectomy arm 80% vs 73% at 5-years and 72% vs 70% at 8-years. On multivariate analysis, treatment modality was not an independent predictor of relapse. For favorable tumors, no difference between RP and RT: 8-year bRFS 86% vs 90%. For unfavorable tumors, 8-year bRFS 62% vs 59% (N.S.).  For unfavorable pts treated with RT to &gt;= 72 Gy, there was an improved bRFS 82% vs 70% at 5 years compared to RP. For dose &lt; 72 Gy, it was worse compared to RP: 50% vs 70%.
**Conclusion: &quot;Eight-year biochemical failure rates were identical between RT and RP in any subgroup. Outcome is determined mainly by pretreatment PSA levels, bGS, clinical T stage, and, for RT patients, radiation dose.&quot;

* '''M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Orlando''', 2004 (1990-98) - PMID 14697417 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy &lt;72 Gy, external beam radiotherapy &gt; or =72 Gy, permanent seed implantation, or combined seeds/external beam radiotherapy for stage T1-T2 prostate cancer.&quot; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jan 1;58(1):25-33 Kupelian et al.
**Retrospective. Comparison of biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) for various methods.
**CONCLUSION: The biochemical failure rates were similar among PI, high-dose (&gt; or =72 Gy) EBRT, COMB, and RP for localized prostate cancer. The outcomes were significantly worse for low-dose (&lt;72 Gy) EBRT.

* '''Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center at Mercy Medical Center''', 2004 (1992-98) - PMID 15066293 &amp;mdash; &quot;Monotherapy for stage T1-T2 prostate cancer: radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, or permanent seed implantation&quot; Radiother Oncol. 2004 Apr;71(1):29-33 Potters L et Al.
**Retrospective. 1819 pts, clinical stage T1-T2 (AJCC 1997). Compared freedom from biochemical recurrence (FBR) for various methods. EBRT dose was &gt;= 70 Gy. All received monotherapy without adjuvant therapy. 
**7-year FBR for PPB vs EBRT vs RP were 74, 77, and 79%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified iPSA and bGS as prognostic factors of relapse. Treatment modality, age, clinical T-stage, and race were not independent predictors of failure. 
** CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment PSA levels, and biopsy Gleason score determined outcome in this study cohort. Biochemical failure rates in this study cohort are similar between PPB, RT, and RP as monotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.

== Prostatectomy vs RT and Expected Patient survival ==
Although treatment outcomes after radical prostatectomy seem to be independent of the age of the patient, at least one study has found a higher PSA failure rate in patients younger than 60 years treated with conventional dose levels external-beam radiotherapy. Men with prostate cancer 60 years or younger treated with high dose conformal external beam radiotherapy seem to have an excellent biochemical outcome and to fare as well as older patients.

** Conclusions: This study shows that for any given Gleason score the prostate cancer death rate is similar in older and younger patients with few to no co-morbidities. Men with a score of 7 to 10 were at 29% to 43% risk of death from prostate cancer even when cancer was diagnosed as late as age 74 years and treated surgically.

**964 pts treated with RT alone. Biochemical failure defined per ASTRO consensus statement. 
**Median f/u 48 months. Of the 98 men &lt; 60 y.o. 46 (47%) had biochemical failure, whereas 261 (30%) of the 866 older men had biochemical failure.  5 and 7-year bDFS was 55% and 47% in younger men and 65% and 59% in older men (S.S.) In men &gt; 60 yo, PSA, Gleason score, and lower radiation doses were predictive of biochemical failure. 
** CONCLUSIONS: Men with prostate cancer who are 60 years or younger and treated with radiotherapy may be at significant risk for long-term biochemical failure.

**Retrospective. 740 pts treated with 3D-CRT or IMRT to median dose of 75.6 Gy.  Biochemical failure per ASTRo consensus statement.
**Median f/u 88 months. Biochemical failure in 21%-22%; 5 and 7 year bDFS in 79-82% and 78-79%. No difference between young men (&lt; age 60) and older men. For young men who received &gt;= 81 Gy, 7-year relapse free survival 96%, 87% and 50^ for favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable risk pts. For young pts, most important predictor of biochemical relapse was dose &lt; 75.6 Gy followed by Gleason score &gt; 7. 
**Conclusions: Men &lt; 60 yrs old treated with high dose XRT have excellent outcome and do as well as older pts. Treating younger pts with conventional RT doses led to 8-fold increase in relapse rate.

==Prostatectomy after neoadjuvant hormones==
Hormones decrease the incidence of extracapsular extension and positive surgical margins.  However, this does not lead to improved freedom from biochemical failure or survival (unlike hormones combined with RT).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Inclusion of Public Domain material==
How should we include public domain how to material?  For example, &quot;Popular Mechanics ShopNotes&quot; available on Google Books is in the public domain and well worth inclusion here given the large number of topics covered.  Likewise, Popular Mechanics in the public domain contains many how to articles.

==Adapted from Wikipedia:How-to==

A how-to on Wikibooks should include:
* A brief overview of the project being built or end result of the instructions.
* A list of materials, tools or prerequisites (if needed).
* Time needed.
* Appropriate safety warnings (if needed).  
* Instructions for the project.
* What to do after the project is finished (cleanup).
* How to use the result or object constructed.

If there are multiple ways to do something, consider including more than one.

=== How-tos in Science ===
Often it is appropriate for Wikipedia to include details of a particular scientific experiment that are of interest. For example, if they are the first of their kind, or if they are commonly performed, or if they are just generally well known. It is important that scientific how-tos explain why they are of interest.

Some questions that you should consider in articles on scientific experiments:
* Who first performed this experiment? When? Where? With whom?
* What technical inventions allowed this experiment to be performed?
* Where and when were the results published? Under what title?
* What was the scientific reaction to this experiment?
* What was the public reaction?
* What theories did this experiment confirm or disprove?
* How has this experiment been simplified or made redundant by later innovations?
* What scientific principles were used in the design of this experiment?
* Is this experiment commonly performed in schools or universities? At what age range is it typically performed?
* What conclusions can be drawn from the experiment?

== Merging Savoir-faire ==
[[Transwiki:Savoir-faire]] should be incorporated here somehow. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 11:16, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
*I think that Savoir-faire (&quot;know-how-to-make&quot;) should become a book called [[Savoir-faire]] or [[Basic human needs]]. That book would be an instructional resource listed on the [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf]]. The red links on [[Transwiki:Savoir-faire]] would become links to chapters of that book. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:27, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

==External links==
These are not only references for the reader, but sources for potential ideas for new or expanded Wikibooks how-tos. -- [[User:Beland|Beland]] 22:55, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

== Move from Wikipedia ==

Hi,

I know this is ancient history by now, but I really didn't quite get the move in the first place (except for very long how-tos meriting their own &quot;book&quot;. The association with the name &quot;book&quot; I think may turn people off who just want to get a simple how-to answered. If procedural knowledge is really so offensive to Wikipedia, how about a dedicated wiki (at least Wikicities wiki) for short how-tos? thanks... [[User:Brettz9]]

== Create Separate Wikihowto Site (updated)==

I really like the en.howto.wikia.com page you've built.  What's the next steps for it?  [[User:208.54.15.1|208.54.15.1]] 18:00, 21 April 2006 (UTC)penchina

I have been working on a WikiHowTo demo/proposal for a new Wiki Project.

*Demo site: '''http://en.howto.wikicities.com/'''
*Scope:  ''WikiHowTo would offer tutorials in any numbers of subjects, and unlike most on line tutorials these will stay up to date, as long as they are popular enough to be viewed.''
*Comments:
** ''I believe my demo site has a long way to go before making a formal proposal, I would appreciate any help or suggestions anyone can give.'', thanks [[User:ZyMOS|ZyMOS]] 02:16, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

: to read old discussions on this visit http://en.howto.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikihowto/old
* '''WikiHowTo, Wikisolutions, and wikicities have joined as one site'''
*: http://en.howto.wikicities.com/
**  We are currently working on finalizing policy and creating good examples of Howto's and Guides.
** We could use help if anyone is interested.

* The are now over 100 howtos on WikiHowTo. Most are small, some are stubs.

'''Opinions?'''

:Adding a point to this thread:  You are welcome to fork and grab any Wikibooks content in any form, provided you do so according to the terms of the GFDL.  While I like Wikia for a number of reasons, this is not a Wikimedia project and any forked how-to content on the how-to Wikia (formerly Wikicities) should not be construed as moving content to that other web server.  As far as I'm concerned, How-to books need to remain on Wikibooks, even though perhaps the standards for keeping them here on Wikibooks should be raised in terms of content quality and editorial standards.
:Consider this above announcement as an advertisement for a competing (even if sympathetic) project.  We are working for the same overall goals, but this is a different community.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:10, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

== List of topically arranged how-tos ==

Note: Someone please move the code from [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=How-to&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=12572911 here] to here (the last version before it was migrated to [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf]] and the listing was alphabetized. (I am in a country now where I can't reach Wikipedia for editing. The old wiki code has the advantage of being language independent (not alphabetical) and to allow one to intuitively find items by their general subject, without having to know ahead of time which exact alphabetical listing they are looking for)...Please allow this alternative categorization!!! Thank you... &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Anonymous User|Anonymous User]] ([[User talk:Anonymous User|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anonymous User|contribs]]) comment moved from deleted page.&lt;/small&gt;

== Link word order ==

I feel that the change of all the link titles by [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] to the format '''XXXXX, how to make a''' makes the page very difficult to read through. The English-speaking brain is not accustomed to reading that way, and any benefit to alphabetizing is lost in the extra effort needed to read each line.

For example, these:

*Novel writing
*How to write a novel
*Write a novel

are much easier to read than these:

*Novel, How to go about writing a
*Novel, How to write
*Novel writing, How to

We usually read groups of words at a time, not individual words, so the reordering breaks up the groups we would normally pick out easily, and the line must be read one word at a time and &quot;translated&quot; into something sensible. If there were hundreds of links in each category, then maybe this would be worth it, but with so few I don't think it is. [[User:Jonathan Kovaciny|Jonathan Kovaciny]] 15:37, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:I tried to make each bookshelf link match the title of the book. The book is called [[How to go about writing a novel]], so I do not like bookshelf links such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[How to go about writing a novel|Novel writing]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I introduced the &quot;XXX, How to&quot; format so I could continue the existing convention of alphabetical sorting.

:However, if you think that the bookshelf is now confusing, feel free to edit this bookshelf and fix it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:00, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

== Proposal to convert the bookshelf into a book ==

Most of the how-to books linked here are one-pagers - not exactly what you'd term a book. Where we've had a significant number of short one-pagers in the areas of cooking and cocktails we've turned them into a coherent book ([[Cookbook]] and [[Bartending]]]). To my mind, all the how-tos would look better if organised as a (more or less complete, but readily expandable) book. We can also give it a fun name [[The Great Wikibook of How-Tos]] or something of that ilk. Comments? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:05, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
: That seems like a very sensible suggestion. [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] 21:40, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
:: I think that &amp;rarr; [[DIY]] &amp;larr; might have been an effort like that. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:52, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

== external how to sites ==

I found a new how to site that I tried to list in the external how to site links but, the page is locked. How can I add to this list?

I too would like to add to the external sites links list. Is that possible? --[[User:John Stumbles|John Stumbles]] 00:37, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
:Answered on your talk page - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:48, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

== Wait, really? ==

There's a how-to guide in the listing, under &quot;Other Guides&quot;. It's a red link, and I'm going to assume it NEVER existed. It's &quot;[[How to Understand a Teenage Female]]&quot;. Probably vandalism, but still humorous. Could someone verify this and remove it?

== How to search only in How-tos of Wikibooks ? ==

How can we search in How-tos of Wikibooks, I mean to search only in books of '''How-tos bookshelf''' and in books of '''Category:How-tos''' (and his sub-categories) ? This filter is necessary when we are searching a practical and immediat solution to a problem. Without such a filter we get more books related to various aspects of our search-text than books providing a howto.&lt;br/&gt;
I know that http://howto.wikia.com (and the french version http://fr.howto.wikia.com that I initiated) can provide this quick answer, but today howto.wikia.com does not provide all answers and we have to search also in other wikies as Wikibooks/How-tos.&lt;br/&gt;
One thing could make this search difficult in Wikibooks : many how-tos books are not in the Category:How-tos, then how could they be filtered by a search tool? &lt;br/&gt;
Please help! Thanks.--[[User:Jean-Baptiste Martin|Jean-Baptiste Martin]] 19:13, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

==Too Small==
The list of How-Tos is too small. [[Uncyclopedia]] has a list that is ten or so times as big.
[[User:59.183.183.120|59.183.183.120]] 18:40, 27 May 2007 (UTC)Vader1941

== Titles Should be Standardized ==

=== Variation in Titles ===

I was just going through the how-to section on WikiBooks when I noticed that there is no stardard form for naming the books. Some books titles are [[How To Build A Computer]] (with the &quot;how to&quot; in the link), [[Overcoming Procrastination]] (in active tense), and How to make [[Armour]] (with the &quot;how to&quot; not in the link). I think it should be standardised one way or another. Maybe make a &quot;how to&quot; folder and add all the files in it (all titles in one tense), so that it would be [[How To/Build a Computer]], [[How To/Overcome Procastination]], and [[How To/Make Armour]]. I think this make alot more sense for organization and linking. I would be willing to spend the time to go through them and change all of the names but then I would have to change the links on the how to page would I not? And it is protected and I am not an administrator. Any thoughts or ideas as to what could be done? [[User:Mason L.|Mason L.]] 13:05, 5 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Modeling a picture ==
Ever seen an awesome looking picture you wanted to turn into a 3D model?  Like a logo or a symbol?  Well, it's actually pretty easy... it just takes some time to do.

* First off, you're going to need a picture to trace. I'm currently doing a project for a friend to do with devils and demons, so I chose a demonic looking face for this tutorial: [http://www.masterpiecepumpkins.com/Graphics/Devil2%20(1.5)_______________PM.JPG Demonic Face]

* Now open Blender and start a new project. Delete the default cube.  Before you start tracing the face, you need to set the face as the background image.  To do this, click 'view', then 'Background Image'.  A box should pop up with only one button in it (Use Background Image), click it.  Now some settings appear, we're only interested in one of them for this tutorial.  Click the small button with a picture of a miniature folder on it (it looks kind of like a feather pen). It's the first one under the '''Use Background Image''' button.  From there, select the picture you want to trace.  Like this: [http://k.domaindlx.com/genis/images/bg_select.jpg Background Selection]

* OK, now for the long part.  Zoom in to the new background image just a little bit.  Now, add a Bézier curve, and size it down a little.  Hit '''F9''' and, in '''Curve Tools''', find and click the '''Poly''' button.  Now there should be a few more vertices to work with and the curve should be just a bunch of joined lines.  Select one point at a time and using the '''GKEY''' move it to a point along the background image(or face in this case).  Do the same for all of the rest of the vertices, making sure you only have one vertex selected at a time or you'll move more than just the vertex you want to.  Once this is done, select one of the end vertices of the curve (it doesn't matter which end) and use '''SHIFT+DKEY''' to copy that vertex.  Move the newly copied vertex to a point along the edge of the face a small ways away from the vertex you copied it from.  Continue doing this until you have a complete outline (of the whole face or just one part, like the ear).  Here's what it should look like (I did the left ear): [http://k.domaindlx.com/genis/images/points.jpg Tracing].  You can't see it in the picture, but six of the points on the right side of the ear are connected, while the rest aren't.  In order to get the effect we're looking for here, we need to connect all of the points around the edge to make an outline (make sure not to connect the points across the picture or you'll have a messed up outline).
(user note: hitting CTRL-LMB instead of SHIFT-DKEY will add a vertex that is already connected.)

* To get the outline for the whole face, just do exactly the same thing around all of the edges.  We still have a problem though: most of the points aren't joined by a line, so all we have is a bunch of dots.  This is easily solvable.  Using the '''BKEY''' or the right click of the mouse, we select a bunch of vertices at a time (somewhere between 5 and 10), and hit the '''FKEY''' a few times.  Every time you hit the '''FKEY''' it should connect two of the points.  Do this until all of the selected points are connected, then deselect them and select another group and use '''FKEY''' to join them.  Keep doing this until all of your points are connected.  To connect the last two points, select all the points and press the '''CKEY''', to close the polygon.
[edit: A better option would be to select a vertex on one of the ends of the whole line, hold down the '''CTRL''' and left-click on a certain point on the image. This will create a new vertex, immediately connected to the vertex you selected.]

* Now that we've got the entire face traced (or outlined if you want to call it that), we can make it 3D.  Hit '''F9''' again and find the Ext1 and Ext2 properties, shown here: [http://k.domaindlx.com/genis/images/make3D.jpg Ext1 &amp; Ext2].  Change the values and see what happens.  They correspond to the depth of the outline.  Try changing them around until you find what looks good.  Now, you'll notice that the lines just stick out straight.  I'm still investigating how to actually model a head from the outlined face ... so if anyone has any ideas, feel free to add them to this page.

* In order to make it have depth you should make the outline out of mesh points instead of a curve. Add a primitive mesh and delete all the vertices in edit mode, then ctrl click to all point outline. Add depth to the surface in a side view (split views so you can see what you're moving). It helps to have 2 or more reference images, but you can wing it. Usually the final result has to be subsurfed.

(USER EDIT: I accidentally started it with mesh instead of curve. You can do the same thing with extrude, but I have no idea how to go on after that)
(USER EDIT LATER: If you subsurf it, it creates a relatively 3D looking image. Its really cool)

(Another user, even later: If you want to turn your curve into a mesh, hit Alt-C while in Object Mode. Note that this is NOT reversible.) 

(user edit: You can delete one vertex of a plane, in order to get a line. You may find easier to outline the picture extruding and moving points of the line you created.)

(user edit: you can use this tracing technique to make solid and symmetric models, else, you would really have to use normal modelling)

== Printing a Rendered Image ==
Render your image.  Exit or minimize the &quot;Blender:Render&quot; window.  In blender, go to File -&gt; Save Image...  Then save your image.  Then you can print it as you would print any other picture, using The Gimp, Paint, Microsoft's Photo Editor, or many others.

Great work on the Rad Onc book so far.  It was a good idea to split up the prostate chapter.  It was getting pretty big, and I knew it would have to be split up into different pages soon enough, so thanks for going ahead and doing that.

Why don't you go ahead ad add yourself to the authors' page ([[Radiation Oncology/Authors|Radiation_Oncology:Authors]]) and take credit for all the work you did.

[[User:Brim|Brim]] 06:25, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Page names ==

I was wondering why you were changing the page names to have directory-style levels, such as changing [[Radiation Oncology/Palliation/Brain Metastases|Radiation Oncology:Brain mets]] to [[Radiation Oncology/Palliation/Brain Metastases]]?  To me it seems more cumbersome to have these longer names.  Is there some advantage to doing this that I'm not aware of? &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 21:37, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

*It probably wasn't necessary with the brain mets. But for prostate, all the subchapters would have to then be on the pain Radiation_Oncology page (like Breast is now), which would potentially make the main page really really long. The other problem seemed to be that I didn't see an easy way to link to part of the page (sort of like # does in HTML). So when I wanted to reference back to &quot;palliation&quot; from the RTOG studies, it would just load up the main Rad Onc page. It seemed to me that using directory structures allows to have a page dedicated to a particular topic. I guess with wiki you can keep all topics on the top level, including the &quot;parent&quot; pages and just crosslink. But then you lose the auto-navigation on top that wiki provides. And I guess the last part is just habit, I find it easy to keep track of things like this. Your preference would be to keep it a flat structure? [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 12:11, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
*Now that I have thought about it, there probably isn't much difference in how you set it up. So maybe the shorter path names are easier. I will have to play around with it some more. But for now, I guess I will leave prostate hierarchical and see how it works on the other topics you have already set up. [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 13:26, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The main reason I was asking is because I had set-up the wiki using : but saw that you were switching to / and wanted to keep things consistent.  I now see how the path names create the auto-navigation links.  I wasn't aware of that before when I first created this wiki, which is why I used the : delimiter instead of the /.  I prefer to use templates (like the Radiation Oncology:TOC template) for navigation since it's more flexible and customizable.  I like having the ability to link to the RTOG trials page from any page within the book since it makes it easy to keep the RTOG trials up to date.  

For large topics like prostate, I think the path names make sense since there will be many subpages within the topic.  For brain mets (as an example) I think it makes more sense for the page name to be Radiation_Oncology/Brain_mets rather than Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Brain_mets since brain mets is really the main topic rather than being a subtopic of palliation.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 18:18, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Bile duct ==

Awesome job!! [[User:Brim|Brim]] 17:31, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
*Thanks! Since I was doing a lit review anyway for my paper, and since it's such a rare topic, figured I might as well make it all-inclusive :) [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 14:37, 7 December 2005 (UTC)


== Optin==
I agree to the [[w:User:Interiot/EditCountOptIn|edit counter opt-in terms]]

== That's a lot of edits ==

Thanks for adding the edit count tally to the Author List.  It's pretty interesting to look at it that way.  Thanks for all the outstanding work you've done on the project.  

If you're a believer in &quot;edit velocity&quot; (akin to PSA velocity), consider that it took me two years for my 2585 edits, but you did your 1443 edits in roughly half that time (and were on hiatus for roughly 6 months of that period).  In short, great job! [[User:Brim|Brim]] 00:46, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

==Contact==
Hey T, looks like you are still busy working away at the wiki.  I'm not sure how to get ahold of you, but wanted to email you.  Send me your email address using wiki if you don't mind.  Hope to hear from you,

Shogun (rodney)

== Details about your book ==

Hello Tdvorak! I was wondering if you could give me some details about the [[Radiation Oncology]] book that you are working on? I know that the book is relatively old, and I also know that it is impressively big and well-structured. Are you the only major contributor, or are there more? Is this book affiliated with any kinds of groups or classes? Is there any specific help that the book needs, at least from non-experts? (formatting or editing help, for instance). 

This is an impressive book, and one that I think deserves some additional attention, both inside this project and elsewhere. If you need anything at all, please let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:30, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hello Whiteknight. Thanks for the feedback &amp; encouragement! The [[Radiation Oncology]] book is a project that several of us (2 main authors, and couple semi-frequent contributors; also see [[Radiation_Oncology/Authors|Author List]]) are working on. It is not affiliated with any classes. It is meant as a quick (and eventually comprehensive) reference source for radiation oncologists, who are physicians treating cancer patients with radiotherapy. There are a number of different cancers, and they are each treated differently. This book is meant to provide a handy online reference with links to the published studies. Each PubMed link (PMID) takes one directly to the abstract of that given study, and from there it is possible to get to the actual paper. The beauty of course is that it can be as detailed as we want (and have energy!) and current (unlike print textbooks, which are immediately out of date in our specialty).

:Thank you for your offer to help. I think we are mostly fine on formatting; we have slowly settled down on a formatting style that seems to work. There is not yet a lot of prose to edit per se, since thus far most of the content is summaries of the individual studies and clinical trials. But any help is of course appreciated, both in terms of grammar and in terms of spelling.

:As for getting it attention elsewhere, I leave that in your hands :) We have thus far not made any active effort to disseminate its existence to our specialty, but there certainly are a number of radiation oncologists who found it via Google. We are in the process of writing a manuscript about its creation, structure, and ultimate goals.

== Images in [[Radiation Oncology]] ==

G'day, I see that you've been active in this book recently. There is a large quantity of images in this book that have been uploaded early in the project when image licensing wasn't given a priority, but are now in jeopardy of being deleted because they don't specify copyright information. A discussion has been started about these images on the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance|Administrators' noticeboard]] (near the bottom), and your input could be useful. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:15, 13 July 2007 (UTC)
:Nice work so far on the graphics! [[User:Brim|Brim]] 22:55, 22 August 2007 (UTC)
::Thanks! They really liven up the page, don't they :) Of course, I am putting up just about any ole' crappy image I come across for now (like [[Radiation_Oncology/Primary_CNS_Lymphoma|PCNSL]]), but hopefully they will get better over time. Also, I really ought to size them more-or-less the same  [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 01:21, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

== Vantage Oncology ==

http://www.vantageoncology.com at [[Radiation Oncology/Corporate]] - This looks like advertising/spamming to me.  I looked at the site and don't see any valuable resources.  I meant to delete it from [[Talk:Radiation Oncology]] but Wikibooks was undergoing maintenance so I couldn't.  Do you see any value to this site that I may have missed? [[User:Brim|Brim]] 14:22, 18 July 2007 (UTC)

:I think it was meant as advertising. But I figured that we could set up a &quot;corporate&quot; page and have links to the major equipment manufacturers, planning system vendors,  etc. This could also include links to the various academic departments, free-standing facilities, and places like Vantage. This was more in the spirit of providing a comprehensive radonc resource; I don't have a strong feeling about them in particular. So for now I have moved them [[Radiation_Oncology/Corporate|here]] from the Talk page and will expand the page as I have time [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 19:42, 18 July 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Google Analytics ==

Installing the script is the only step you need to take, really. When the script is in your profile, every page hit you make is recorded by google and aggregated into a daily report that I can access using my google account. I am developing a bot to upload the results to a [[user:Whiteknight/Count Ticker|page in my user space]]. The records will appear there. Since the results are aggregated daily, your page hits will likely not be reflected in the list until tomorrow. I'll let you know asap. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:19, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

This explains how to get a copy of [http://mambo-code.org/gf/project/mambo/ Mambo]. It maybe sounds a bit strange that you need to download your website before you can use it, but it is similar to downloading any other program - [http://source.mambo-foundation.org Mambo] is in a way a program, one that it creates, manages, and serves websites. Therefore, you will need to download it.

==Mambo CMS - Download==

You can use the official site, [http://mambo-code.org/gf/project/mambo/ Mambo Code forge], to get a copy of mambo. This is the way most new users do it, and it is simple and easy. Here, you can also get additional information about Mambo - take a look yourself!

The '''Incas''' were the ruling class of Peruvian Indians controlling a large empire in South America between the years 1438 and 1533 before the Spanish conquest. In [[Quechua]], the main language of the Incas, the empire was called Tawantinsuyu which means ''Land of the Four Corners''. The native government of the Incas was the most stable on the continent. The Peruvians were agricultural people, who irrigated their lands and built great granaries and fine roads to all parts of the empire. The Incas kept track of numerical data through a system of knotted quipu-strings. Gold was owned by them in abundance and was used in the decoration of the palaces and temple of the Incas. The capital of the empire was at Cuzco, until just before the arrival of Pizarro, when Atahualpa, heir to the throne, had moved his rule to Quito, now [[../Ecuador/]], to protect himself from a rebellion started by his brother. When the Spanish conquered the country in 1533, Atahualpa, the last emperor of the Incas, was executed, but it was forty years before the Indians were fully subdued. Their descendants as unmixed Amerindians make up a large segment of the population of [[../Peru/]] today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Aerobic exercise is generally exercise that is done over a long period of time, typically 20 minutes or more.  It is used to tone the body, make it leaner, and improve endurance by keeping the cardiovascular system healthy.   Although getting any exercise is healthy, getting at least 20 minutes of sustained aerobic exercise about 3 times a week, along with a good diet, will generally keep a person healthy.

Technically, aerobic exercise is exercise that mainly uses energy from the cells in the muscles of the body doing aerobic respiration.  Aerobic respiration of a cell is when the cell uses oxygen to burn energy (aerobic means &quot;requiring air (or oxygen)&quot;), unlike anaerobic respiration where the cell does not use oxygen when it burns energy.  Cellular aerobic respiration can potentially be 18 times more efficient than anaerobic respiration, and aerobic respiration produces less toxins in the cell.  Because of this, the cell will try to do aerobic respiration whenever it can, but it will do anaerobic respiration to get energy when it lacks oxygen.

Exercises that are less intense but last longer allow the body to give the muscles oxygen as they are using it up, and keep them doing aerobic respiration.  More intense exercises use up the oxygen in the cells faster than it can be replaced, so the cells divert to anaerobic respiration to get the energy they need.

==What Happens to the Body During Aerobic Exercise?==

A lot of energy is not used during aerobic exercise, so the body will burn fat by converting it into sugar for the cells to use as energy.  If aerobic exercise is sustained for more than 20 minutes, it is especially healthy because the body will continue to burn fat for several hours afterward.

Aerobic exercise requires a lot of oxygen, so many things in the body do change.  The heart rate increases, and the volume of blood per heart beat increases, to circulate the oxygen in the blood to the muscles faster, and remove toxins from the cell faster.  This increases the blood pressure.  To  get more oxygen into the bloodstream, and get toxins out, the breathing rate increases, and the lungs expand and contract more.

Lactic acid is produced and will cause a burning sensation in the muscles.  The body will try to get oxygen to the muscles as fast as it can, but it is not always able to give the muscles all the oxygen they need.  When this happens, the muscles will shift to anaerobic respiration until they can get the oxygen they need.  This usually happens during any aerobic workout, if the person is trying to push him or herself.  When it does happen, the muscles will produce many toxins that are created during anaerobic respiration, and then the liver will try to cleanse those toxins as fast as it can.  When the liver cannot remove the toxins as fast as they are created, they build up.  When a person experiences pain in their muscles because of working out, it is usually because of lactic acid building up (unless the person has pulled a muscle or damaged something).

One good benefit of getting aerobic exercise is the release of endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that reduce the feeling of pain and make a person feel better. They are sort of like the body's natural pain medicine, and they make a person feel good. Sustained aerobic exercise for a long period of time, like during a marathon, can be euphoric because of endorphins.  They are released to reduce the pain a person feels during aerobic exercise.

A person who regularly does aerobic exercise will develop a healthier and stronger body.  Their heart will be stronger, and pump more blood per heartbeat, making it more efficient, to handle the increased blood circulation required for aerobic exercise.  This will allow the person to have a lower heart rate when resting, and make them feel better.  The lung capacity and efficiency at transferring material between the air and the bloodstream will increase to handle the extra oxygen required during aerobic exercise.  This will allow the person to breathe less when resting, making them feel better.  The arteries, veins, and capillaries will become more efficient to handle the increased blood circulation.  The muscles will increase their efficiency and more blood vessels will be created in the muscles.  Coordination will increase.  The person will feel better because of having more endorphins in their brain.  The muscles, bones, organs, and other tissue will become stronger to handle the impact that exercise will give to them.  Burning more energy will require eating more, but even if a person eats more, the person can more easily lose fat by working out.

== Method: Using heart rate as guide ==
{{yellow Warning|Use at your own discretion. This is '''NOT''' medical advice. Any change in lifestyle involving massive change in physical activity should be under doctors supervision.}}

When we start conditioning, at first, our heart beat goes up to high levels even with very moderate forms of exercise. The reason for this is that our cardiovascular system and our respiratory system are not conditioned. In other words, they are not very effective for a person who has not exercised for years. But once we start exercising, these systems keep on becoming more and more effective and conditioned. Our heart becomes stronger and our lungs become stronger. Our body is able to supply more oxygen to the muscles in an easier fashion. 

Similary, the muscular system becomes more efficient. Our muscles are able to produce more work by using more energy. A fit and conditioned individual can work more through his muscles than a deconditioned person. His muscles are stronger and better adapt at working. 

So, as we train, our body can supply more oxygen, more easily, and the muscles can use that extra oxygen to do more work more easily. 

Therefore, no matter if you are a fit individual or some one who has been living a sedentary lifestyle for the past many years, you can use heart rate as an effective guide line for your exercise intensity. Your heart rate will tell you how comfortable your body is while exercising. It is one measure that is tailored to your body's ability to perform. Other methods like your speed or inclination or resistance etc. are not tailored to your ability. An unconditioned individual might be struggling at a speed, at which a trained individual is barely breaking a sweat. However, the heartbeat will tell a different story. 

Here is the theory behind using heart beat as a guide:

The maximum heart rate is your heart's response to increased oxygen demand and your body's attempt to oxygenate (meaning supply your body with oxygen). It declines with age variably and there is an interindividual variability as well. Here is a rough approximation for the maximum heart rate for an individual:

Maximum Heart Beats Per Minute = 220 - (age in years)

This is a very raw approximation but it doesn't matter that much. Better approximation can be achieved for an individual by putting on a good heart rate monitor and running as fast as possible for at least 2 minutes in an untrained individual to see how high his/her heart beat goes. 

Now, by exercising at heart beat about 70% - 80% of maximum heart beat, a person successfully improves his body, while remaining in a comfortable zone. 

Even 65% - 70% bpm of max, is a good conditioning zone that is very comfortable and produces constant bodily improvement.

There is no need to push too much. Remain at 70% - 80% : it is very comfortable and gives huge improvements. 

For example, I am 25. My maximal heart beat is ~195 (220 - 25).

For me: 
: 70% of maximal heart beat is 136 bpm. 
: 75% of maximal heart beat is 146 bpm.
: 80% of maximal heart beat is 156 bpm.
: 85% of maximal heart beat is 166 bpm. 
: (These are all approximations). 

During exercise, if I keep my heart beat at about 70% - 80%, I will have significant benefits. If I want, I can push it to 75% - 85% (85% is the upper limit). It is usually sufficient to remain around 70-75%. As an alternative to measure the heart rate run and try to talk at the same time. If you can do this without significant shortness to breath will have reached approximately 70% of your maximal heart beat.  

Note that, for an untrained individual, even very moderate exercise will bring his/her heart beat pumping really fast. That means that they can easily remain very comfortable and get significant health improvements. Very soon they will find that their heart beat does not rise that sharply. 

Invest in a good heart rate monitor. I think, polar makes excellent heart rate monitors. Buy the ones that have a chest strap. Many professional treadmills can read the heart rate readings from the chest strap - so you don't need to carry the wrist watch with you (that comes with the chest strap). I found the chest strap heart rate monitors to be much more accurate.

=== Energy output analysis === 
: Deconditioned individual - maximum energy output = 6-7 times resting energy expense
: Conditioned individal - max. energy output = 10 - 12 times resting energy expense

A person can only sustain about 20% of maximum energy output throughout the day, without getting fatigued over time.

Therefore,
: Deconditioned Individual can spend about 20% of 7 = 1.4 times what he would spend sitting/lying whole day.
: Conditioned Individual can spend about 20% of 10 = 2 times what he would spend sitting/lying whole day.
Considering that sitting/lying whole day (basal metabolic rate) is about 2000-3000 calories for most people, a difference of .6 (2 - 1.4) times basal metabolic rate is 
: 1200 - 1800 extra calories per day that a fit individual can spend compared to a deconditioned individual. Do you have any idea how much difference these 1200-1800 calories can make!
Base line - become fit.

Aerobic exercise, Running for example, is a pleasure and it gives the best feeling in the world to run. Don't overdo it and give your body time to slowly increase in efficiency and capacity. 

As heart and respiratory systems become stronger, the body's peak capacity as well as endurance increase. As muscles become stronger and more effective, body's peak capacity and endurance increase further. The whole body becomes more powerful and stronger.

== Warming up and cooling down ==
It is very important to warm up before suddenly increasing the intensity of your exercise. It is equally (if not more) important to slowly cool off. These two things prevent injury. When warming up, you slowly bring your body into the correct state for more intense exercise, without this warm-up phase the body's muscles and tendons are tight and prone to injury thus it's important to warm up to prevent injury. The cool down is important for recuperation of your body. If you don't allow for a proper cool down, lactic acid more readily and easily builds and stays in your muscles. This acid slows down the healing process and makes you sore. Generally, 5-10 minutes to warm up and about 5 minutes to cool down is sufficient. During the cool down, it is a good idea to write down your daily exercises.

After both the cool down and warm up phase, 5-10 minutes of stretching should follow. This also prevents injury, helps in recuperation, and helps to alleviate lactic acid buildup.

== Specific exercise tips ==

=== Treadmill ===
I found treadmill to be an excellent machine for aerobic exercise. I have always loved running and treadmill makes it so easy. 

Running on a treadmill, lessens chances of injury. This is because you don't need to be careful of the terrain (road, bumps on the road, foot path etc.), or vehicles or other things. No problems with weather. Also, most good treadmills absorb the shock, making the running more comfortable for your legs. 

Also, most treadmills have excellent programs built into them. These programs have been designed by experts and use contemporary exercise theories. Programs like heart rate based programs, can use your heart rate monitors to adjust the inclination etc. 

One thing to note is to accurately simulate running outside, you should set the treadmill at at least a 1% grade or higher.  With the higher grade, you will be pushing more against the treadmill than the treadmill will be pushing your feet along.

Important Tip: Don't ever forget to clip the stop button to your self. You never know when you might lose a step or something and end up falling. The last thing you want is the belt burning your back or increasing your injury by throwing you around. Always, clip that stop button to your clothes. This is extremely important if you are going to run at a fast pace.

Heart Rate Monitor Guide: I think most treadmill heart rate monitors lack precision. A good heart rate monitor would be a good investment if you plan on exercising seriously.

=== Bicycling (Biking) ===
Biking is another excellent aerobic exercise, besides being immensely entertaining. 

==== Tips about buying a bike and accessories ====
; Shoes : Get special biking shoes. If your pedals have the lock-in mechanism, get matching shoes. The shoes can be &quot;clipped&quot; into the pedals. The term 'clipless' refers to the older mechanism that locked your foot, which was a cage like system, the clip. Pedals without this system but that offer the possibility to lock your foot are called clipless. That allows you to pull the pedals up in addition to the usual push down. That allows you to complete a full rotation instead of each leg just completing a partial rotation. In addition to using more muscle groups you can, with practice, develop a smoother pedal cycle with greater stability and thus allowing higher cadence. Higher cadence is essential for cardiovascular stress and training. Note that, some basic practice is needed to be able to easily unlock and lock your feet and to immediately unlock your feet in case of emergency. 

; Cost : Don't buy a very expensive bike. I made this mistake and I don't think that my bike justifies the expenditure. It does not matter that you bike is 1 lb. lighter. It will pinch you for long if you belong to the category that most of us belong to. 

; Pump : Tire pressure is essential for optimum performance. Correct tire pressure will yield a sufficiently low rolling resistance of the tire and a minimal risk of flats. Under-inflating will result in a softer ride but also increases the risk of 'pinch flats' caused by squeezing the tire between the ground and the rims when hard cornering. Also, rolling resistance is significantly increased resulting in less then optimal speeds. Over-inflation only reduces the rolling resistance marginally but creates some other issues such as easy puncture flats and bouncing behavior, compromising bike stability. The pressure required is a variable depending on driver weight, the kind of tire and ride circumstances. 

; Tires : The choice depends on the kind of bike. There are specific tires for each kind of bike. The difference is in tire width and profile. The wider the tire, the higher the rolling resistance because of larger contact area, but also the higher the grip on the surface. Profile refers to the tire surface, this can be smooth (slicks) or heavy profile like on mountain bikes. The heavier the profile the more drag and grip it has on loose surfaces such as mud and sand. There is absolutely no point in any profile when the only surface you ride on is asphalt (road). With this in mind, a road bike has a thin smooth tire with the lowest rolling resistance and a mountain bike will have a wide tire with heavy profile for optimum grip on rough surfaces. City bikes, cyclo-cross bikes or other models may choose for something intermediate.

; Other Accessories : Accessories are optional but can be useful. The use of a helmet is heavily debated and a little out of the scope of this article. Cycling gloves may offer protection against RSI (repetitive stress injuries) from leaning on the handlebars by means of the padding in them. They can also offer extra comfort when riding rough surfaces. Most professional cyclists wear them but the choice remains yours. Glasses provide you with cover for dust and bugs but may also provide a hinder during heavy weather. Cycle clothing has several uses but may dramatically improve riding comfort, especially when riding for greater distances. Cycling shorts are essential in preventing shearing injuries from leg action under sweaty circumstances. The jerseys are in a fabric that allows sweating while still keeping warm. Basically the lycra allows for a more optimal thermoregulation, in addition they provide back pockets. Another good accessory - heart rate monitor. Its fun to see your heart rate once in a while. Another good accessory - an electronic speedometer, mileage computer. They are cheap and it's a pleasure to see how many miles you did today and the total number of miles so far.

==== Benefits of bicycling ====
* Very Entertaining - Biking is probably one of the most entertaining exercises out there.  Although, every exercise gives pleasure and has a unique fun attached to it, riding a bike is like gliding. You feel the fresh air brushing your face and body. You get to see many places. Biking is really fun. 
* Fresh Air - Cycling is something that gives you an opportunity to catch a breath of fresh air, literally. 
* Low Impact - Cycling is easier on your bones than running.
* Hiking while Biking! You can literally go places on your bike. It is not too hard to bike 30 miles in a day (even if you are not very trained, although, your muscles might be a bit sore the next day). You can see parks, cities, neighborhoods on your bike. 
* Practical - You can commute to work / school on a bike to save money on gas.

How about a chapter on implementing propositional (non-predicate) logic in Prolog?

----

Nothing on this page is really relevant to Prolog programming, perhaps it should be not here?
: I think a short introduction to logic can take the edge of learning prolog for people who aren't familiar the subject. Reading a whole (wiki)book on logic isn't necessary when all you want to learn is what prolog is about, but if you don't have any experience with predicate logic, a short introduction can help you along. As the introduction says, you don't have to read it, but it may help. [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]) 21:41, 17 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

The sun is the primary energy source for all of the Earth's lifeforms. '''Photosynthesis''' is a process where the energy of the sun converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose. This happens mostly in the leafs green plants. Chloroplasts in the leaf cells contain '''chlorophyll''', which captures the energy of the sun and makes photosynthesis possible.

[[Image:Chloroplast-new.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a chloroplast]]
Chlorophyll captures light energy from the sun and converts it to electrical energy. The electrical energy splits apart carbon dioxide (coming through pores, called stomata, in the plant) and water (coming through the roots and stem) molecules in the plant. This can be expressed by the chemical equation:

:&lt;center&gt;''&lt;b&gt;6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + light &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''&lt;/center&gt;

:&lt;center&gt;Carbon Dioxide + Water + Light energy → Glucose + Oxygen&lt;/center&gt;

The oxygen is released into the air, where it can be inhaled by animals. Glucose is used by the plant for energy. It is called a '''carbohydrate'''.

This book is designed for people interested in learning how to program the X Window System and assumes some basic knowledge on how to use a computer, how to setup and use [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101/The X Window System|The X Window System]], how to use a compiler, and how to write a program in the [[C Programming|C programming language]]. This book is open work, so if you find any problems with terms or concepts, you can contribute an explanation to it. Feel free to participate; you are welcome to do so.

The '''X Window System''' (or '''X''' and '''X11''' for short) is a server application that provides basic functions for displaying graphics and gathering user input transparently, either locally or over a network. X distributes user input to and accepts output requests from applications through the X Window System protocol.

X does not mandate the visual appearance and interface of applications, choosing instead to allow applications to use whatever visual style and interface is desired.  As a result, different applications may present radically different interfaces.

A man is hanging from the ceiling, which is 5 metres above floor level.  He has hanged himself however there is no chair and there is no other furniture that he could have used to push himself up.  The walls are all smooth and there is no way he could have used them to climb up.  However, the floor is flooded.  How did he hang himself?

He stood on a block of ice, which has melted and so flooded the floor.

The room was located near a river, when the river flooded, the water level rose and lifted the man to the ceiling, leaving the floor flooded.

:The first priority should be clarity. The &quot;slangy&quot; wording gets the point across very very well. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

== Canavanine ==

Maybe this article ought to include a warning about alfalfa's [[canavanine]] content? This amino acid can get incorporated into body proteins in place of arginine, and alfalfa-induced autoimmune symptoms presumably due to its presence have been recorded on a few occasions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What would be a good long-term format for this page? After I looked at the prostate RTOG studies, there tends to be a fair amount of papers associated with them. I think I would lean to keeping just the study, and linking the main outcome paper with maybe a pasted conclusion. I have done this as a trial for the prostate studies. Even that may be too long in the long run. And then have all the details on individual pages (to be constructed as we have time.) [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 15:38, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:My goal for this page was that it should be no more than a numeric listing of trials so it could serve as an index.  So, if you're trying to remember just what the heck 85-31 is about, you can look it up here.  Its purpose is not to provide details about the study but just to describe, in a brief one line sentence, the overall schema of the study.  For example:
::'''85-01''' - ''Esophagus'' - XRT alone vs XRT/Chemo
:In some cases, I would also provide a PMID link to the results of the study, but would not list details .  Those details should be provided in the appropriate chapter, i.e. Esophagus.  Some studies have a larger number of ancillary papers associated with them, but I don't think those papers should be listed in here unless there are just a few.  A good solution would be to do what you did for some of the prostate studies, where each study has its own page listing the schema and all of the publications associated with it.  In those cases, I would just provide a brief description of the study on this page and then link to the study's own page for a listing of all the publications.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 21:16, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The pythagorean (pi-THA-gor-in) theorem is a formula which explains the relationship between sides of a right triangle (a triangle w/ one 90 degree angle)

Formula:

'''&lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt;''' where a and b are the legs and c is the hypoteneuse.

There is also a thing called a '''Pythagorean Triple''', 
where in &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt; a and b are equal to c.

Such an example is with &lt;math&gt;3^2+4^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt; Where &lt;math&gt;3^2 = 9&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4^2 = 16, 16+9 = 5^2&lt;/math&gt; which is 25
