Filters can filtrate your incoming mails, and put them into labels, archive them automatically or delete them.

== Create a filter ==
[[Image:gmail-filter-button.png|right|]]When you make a filter you click the little &quot;Create Filter button&quot; beside the search bar. Now you see a big yellow box, where you can choose what the massages have to contain or be like, should it filtered or not. If you click the test search button you can see what messages it will filter. After choosing the options you click the &quot;Next Step&quot; button.[[Image:Gmail-filters-options.png|center]]

You will see a new box, here you choose the action of the filter. Here is a description of the actions:
*&quot;Skip the inbox&quot; The message will be archived (Gmail version of &quot;archived&quot; - see below)
*&quot;Star it&quot; Give the message a star.
*&quot;Apply the label&quot; Puts the message into a label.
*&quot;Forward it to&quot; Forward the mail to another Mail account.
*&quot;Move to deleted items&quot; Delete the message.

'''Note:''' when you &quot;archive&quot; a message, all this means is the messages has its &quot;Inbox&quot; label removed. It does not changes its read/unread status etc. So, in the second screen, using &quot;Skip the Inbox&quot; with &quot;Apply the Label:[  ]&quot; would move incoming mail matched by the filter automatically into a separate &quot;folder&quot; in Outlook speak. If the message is left unread, then the label will the appear in bold with the number next of unread messages next to it, just like the Gmail &quot;Folders&quot; behave (e.g. Spam, Trash).

Of course you can choose more than one action, so you can star and archive a message at the same time.

== Advanced filters ==
The titles that Gmail gives each filter are in fact the &quot;script&quot; that it uses to parse each email.  In other words, if you cut and pasted the entire title into the &quot;Has the words&quot; box, you would get the exact same filter.  This obviously is silly--the interface generated that filter in a much easier fashion.  But, it opens up new possibilities.  For example, you now can do AND's and OR's to generate complex filters.  So something like (subject:(biking)) AND (from:(foo) OR from:(bar)) would match all messages about biking that came from either foo or bar.

The symbol | (found on the same key as \), means OR. So you could write biking | helmet, which would be similar to (biking) OR (helmet), in the preceding paragraph.

Here are a few &quot;super&quot; filters. 

# Create label bookmarks, in the to: box type in, youremail@gmail.com, and in the from: box, type in youremail@gmail.com, apply label bookmarks, archive now. Now, when you email yourself you won't clutter your inbox. 
# Create label attachments. Check the Has attachments, label it attachments, archive it (if preferred). Now any email you have that has attachments, get labeled attachments. Making it easier to stay organized.
# Use Gmail as a multimedia holder. do the following: create filter, in the has words box, type filename:mp3, apply label music, check the latest updates 

If you have another format and don't want to make a separate filter, do the following: filename:mp3 | filename:wav. Refer to 2nd paragraph (above) for what | means.

Google offers a range of [http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=7190 documented] and [http://www.letterbar.com/3-undocumented-gmail-filters/ undocumented] search and filter operators that can be used to fine-tune a filter.

== Weakness in filter pattern matching ==

One weakness is that Gmail filters on match on ASCII letters.  In fact, only case-insensitive ASCII.  So for example, I get a bunch of messages that nicely have a subject that starts with [Bike].  One would hope that matching on [Bike] in the subject line would grab these emails and nothing else.  But, matching on [Bike] is exactly the same as matching on bike.  So it matches, BIKE, Bike, bike, and obviously the intended [Bike].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Arabic word for &quot;what&quot; in question sentences is usually&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ماذا &lt;/font&gt;(maa''dh''a) or the shorter form&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ما &lt;/font&gt;(maa).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ماذا &lt;/font&gt;(maa''dh''a) or&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ما &lt;/font&gt;(maa) is used to translate the following sentences from English to Arabic.


What is your name?&lt;br&gt;
What did you do?&lt;br&gt;
What are you doing?&lt;br&gt;
What is this?&lt;br&gt;
What will you do?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Just like in English the word for &quot;What&quot; usually goes at the beginning of the sentence in Arabic.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ما أسـمك؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;maa ismuk&lt;br&gt;
mas-muk&lt;br&gt;(irregular)
What's your name?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ما أسـمـي؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;maa asmii&lt;br&gt;
maa-as-mii&lt;br&gt;
What's my name?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ماذا فعلت؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;maa''dh''a fa`alt(a)?&lt;br&gt;
maa-''dh''a-fa-`alt&lt;br&gt;
what did you do?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ماذا تفعل؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;maa''dh''a taf`al?&lt;br&gt;
maa-''dh''a-taf-`al&lt;br&gt;
What are you doing?/What do you do?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ما هذا؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;maa haa''dh''a?&lt;br&gt;
maa-haa-''dh''a&lt;br&gt;
What is this?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ماذا ستفعل؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;maa''dh''a sa-taf`al?&lt;br&gt;
maa-''dh''a-sa-taf-`al&lt;br&gt;
What will you (guy) do?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ماذا ستفعلين؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;maa''dh''a sa-taf`aliin(a)?&lt;br&gt;
maa-''dh''a-sa-taf-`a-liin&lt;br&gt;
What will you (girl) do?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ماذا تريد؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;maa''dh''a turiid?&lt;br&gt;

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: interchangable → interchangeable using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Arabic word for &quot;why&quot; is&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; لـماذا &lt;/font&gt;(li-maa-''dh''a). The shorter form is&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; لـما &lt;/font&gt;(li-maa). Do not assume that&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; لـما &lt;/font&gt;(li-maa) and &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;لـماذا &lt;/font&gt;(li-maa-''dh''a) are interchangeable. These words go at the beginning of a question just like &quot;why&quot; does in English. There are big differences between Arabic and English question making. In Arabic adding a question word at the beginning of a statement makes it a question. In English words have to be moved around. In Arabic no words are moved around to make a question.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here are some examples of questions with&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; لـماذا &lt;/font&gt;(limaa''dh''a):
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
لـماذا فعلتَ ذالك؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;limaa''dh''a fa`alta ''dh''aalik(a)?&lt;br&gt;
li-maa-''dh''a fa-`al-ta-''dh''aa-lik&lt;br&gt;
Why did you (guy) do that?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;font siz=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
لماذا يحب هذه البنت؟ 
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;limaa''dh''a yuhib ha''dh''ihi 'l-bint?&lt;br&gt;
li-maa-''dh''a yoo-hihb ha-''dh''-i-hil-bint&lt;br&gt;
Why does he like that girl?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

I've done some additional cleanup; removing the redundant procedure steps, adding some cats, trying to clarify the process. I may have inadvertently removed your preferred wording, so please rv changes that don't fit with your actual recipe, but I tried my best to get the meaning. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:41, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

: Hi, [[User:198.236.13.33]] has been making some sketchy edits, which you noticed to some degree on the cheesecake recipe. We've rv'd all of their changes except the ones on the cheesecake. I suggest you have no mercy for their edits (some of their other edits were blatant vandalism, and others were plain wrong) and make sure the recipe is up to snuff. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:09, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

== title v. sentence case ==

Hi. You should look at [[Cookbook:Policy]] for discussion with respect to the accepted case-format for recipes. Right now, everything is in title case and changing that should be done through some sort of discussion on [[Talk:Cookbook]]. Making your one or two recipes in sentence case will just make our layout more confusing. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:15, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Polyparadigm. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Polyparadigm~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

Work in progress.  Document needs substantial reformatting to fit the Wikibooks style.  Also the page is much too long for convenient editing in a browser text box so it must be broken into sections.  Use the original as a guide: http://www.gui.com.au/resources/coding_standards_print.htm

==Overview==

This document is a working document - it is not designed to meet the requirement that we have &quot;a&quot; coding standard but instead is an acknowledgement that we can make our lives much easier in the long term if we all agree to a common set of conventions when writing code.

Inevitably, there are many places in this document where we have simply had to make a choice between two or more equally valid alternatives. We have tried to actually think about the relative merits of each alternative but inevitably some personal preferences have come into play. 

Hopefully this document is actually readable. Some standards documents are so dry as to be about as interesting as reading the white pages. However, do not assume that this document is any less important or should be treated any less lightly than its drier cousins.

==When Does This Document Apply?==

It is the intention that all code adhere to this standard. However, there are some cases where it is impractical or impossible to apply these conventions, and others where it would be A Bad Thing.

This document applies to ALL CODE except the following :
Code changes made to existing systems not written to this standard.

In general, it is a good idea to make your changes conform to the surrounding code style wherever possible. You might choose to adopt this standard for major additions to existing systems or when you are adding code that you think will become part of a code library that already uses this standard.

Code written for customers that require that their standards be adopted.

It is not uncommon for programmers to work with customers that have their own coding standards. Most coding standards derive at least some of their content from the Hungarian notation concept and in particular from a Microsoft white paper that documented a set of suggested naming standards. For this reason many coding standards are broadly compatible with each other. This document goes a little further than most in some areas; however it is likely that these extensions will not conflict with most other coding standards. But let's be absolutely clear on this one folks: if there is a conflict, the customer's coding standards are to apply. Always.

==Naming Standards==

Of all the components that make up a coding standard, naming standards are the most visible and arguably the most important.

Having a consistent standard for naming the various 'thingies' in your program will save you an enormous amount of time both during the development process itself and also during any later maintenance work. I say 'thingies' because there are so many different things you need to name in a VB program, and the word 'object' has a particular meaning.

===CamelCasing and uppercasing===

In a nutshell variable name body, function names, and label names are using
&lt;b&gt;CamelCasing&lt;/b&gt;, while constants use &lt;b&gt;UPPER_CASING&lt;/b&gt;.

Roughly speaking, camel casing is that all words have the 1st letter in
uppercase without any word separation, and the subsequent letters in lowercase, while uppercasing is that all words are in upper case with an underscore
separator.

===Name body casing does not apply to prefixes and suffixes===

Prefixes and suffixes are used for

* module name for name with module scope
* variable type
* whether a variable is a function parameter

Those prefixes and suffixes are not subject to the same casing as the name
body. Here are a few example with the prefixes or suffixes in bold face.

&lt;code&gt;
  &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; shows that sSomeString is of type String
  &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;SomeString
  &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;i&gt;_IN&lt;/i&gt; shows that iSomeString_IN is an input argument
  &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;SomeInteger&lt;b&gt;_IN&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;i&gt;MYPRJ_&lt;/i&gt; shows that MYPRJ_bSomeBoolean has module scope MYPRJ
  &lt;b&gt;MYPRJ_b&lt;/b&gt;SomeBoolean
&lt;/code&gt;

===Physical units should not be cased===

Sometimes it is convenient to show within a variable name in which physical
unit the variable value is expressed, like mV for milliVolt, or kg for
kilogram. The same applies to a function name returning some real number
value. The physical unit should be placed at the end with a leading underscore
and without any casing. Case has a special meaning for physical units, and it
would be quite disturbing to change it. Here are a few examples where the unit
and underscore are in bold face.

  fltSomeVoltage&lt;b&gt;_mV&lt;/b&gt;
  sngSomePower&lt;b&gt;_W&lt;/b&gt;_IN
  dblSomePowerOffset&lt;b&gt;_dB&lt;/b&gt;
  dblSomeSpeed&lt;b&gt;_mps&lt;/b&gt;

===Acronyms===

Acronym words have special handling.

==Variables==

Variable names are used very frequently in code; most statements contain the name of at least one variable. By using a consistent naming system for variables, we are able to minimise the amount of time spent hunting down the exact spelling of a variable's name.

Furthermore, by encoding into the variable's name some information about the variable itself, we can make it much easier to decipher the meaning of any statement in which that variable is used and to catch a lot of errors that are otherwise very difficult to find.

The attributes of a variable that are useful to encode into its name are its scope and its data type.

==Scope==

In Visual Basic there are three scopes at which a variable may be defined. If defined within a procedure, the variable is local to that procedure. If defined in the general declarations area of a form or module then that variable can be referenced from all procedures in that form or module and is said to have module scope. Finally, if it is defined with the Global keyword, then it is (obviously) global to the application.

A somewhat special case exists for arguments to procedures. The names themselves are local in scope (to the procedure itself). However, any change applied to that argument may, in some cases, affect a variable at a totally different scope. Now that may be exactly what you want to happen - it is by no means always an error - but it can also be the cause of subtle and very frustrating errors.

==Data Type==

VB supports a rich assortment of data types. It is also a very weakly typed language; you can throw almost anything at anything in VB and it will usually stick. In VB4, it gets even worse. Subtle bugs can creep into your code because of an unintended conversion done behind the scenes for you by VB.

By encoding the type of the variable in its name, you can visually check that any assignment to that variable is sensible. This will help you pick up the error very quickly.

Encoding the data type into the variable name has another benefit that is less often cited as an advantage of this technique: reuse of data names. If you need to store the start date in both a string and a double, then you can use the same root name for both variables. The start date is always the StartDate; it just takes a different tag to distinguish the different formats it is stored in.

==Option Explicit==

First things first. Always use Option Explicit. The reasons are so obvious that I won't discuss it any further. If you don't agree, see me and we'll fight about it --- errr --- we'll discuss it amicably.

==Variable Names==

Variables are named like this :

  scope + type + VariableName

The scope is encoded as a single character. The possible values for this character are :


{|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; rules=&quot;all&quot; frame=&quot;box&quot;
|-
|g||This denotes that the variable is Global in scope	
|-
|m||This denotes that the variable is defined at the Module (or Form) level	
|}

The absence of a scope modifier indicates that the variable is local in scope.

:I will use text sidelined like this to try and explain why I have made certain choices. I hope it is helpful to you.

:Some coding standards require the use of another character (often 'l') to indicate a local variable. I really don't like this. I don't think that it adds to the maintainability of the code at all and I do think it makes the code a lot harder to read. Besides, it's ugly.

The type of the variable is encoded as one or more characters. The more common types are encoded as single characters while the less common types are encoded using three or four characters.

:I thought long and hard about this one, folks. It is certainly possible to come up with one-character codes for all of the built-in data types. However, it is really hard to remember them all, even if you made them up yourself. On balance, I think that this a better approach.

The possible values for the type tag are :

{|
|-
|i   ||integer ||16-bit signed integer	
|-
|l   ||long    ||32-bit signed integer	
|-
|s   ||string  ||a VB string	
|-
|n   ||numeric ||integer of no specified size (16 or 32 bits)
|-
|c   ||currency||64-bit integer scaled by 10-4	
|-
|v   ||variant ||a VB variant	
|-
|b   ||boolean ||in VB3: an integer used as a boolean, in VB4: a native boolean data type	
|-
|dbl ||double  ||a double-precision floating point number	
|-
|sng ||single  ||a single-precision floating point number	
|-
|flt ||float   ||a floating point number of no particular precision	
|-
|byte||byte    ||an eight-bit binary value (VB4 only)	
|-
|obj||object   ||a generic object variable (late binding)	
|-
|ctl||control  ||a generic control variable	
|}

:We do NOT use VB's type suffix characters. These are redundant given our prefixes and no-one remembers more than a few of them anyway. And I don't like them.

It is important to note that defining a prefix for the underlying implementation type of the variable, while of some use, is often not the best alternative. Far more useful is defining a prefix based on the underlying aspects of the data itself. As an example, consider a date. You can store a date in either a double or a variant. You don't (usually) care which one it is because only dates can be logically assigned to it.

Consider this code :

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;dblDueDate = Date() + 14&lt;/source&gt;

We know that dblDueDate is stored in a double precision variable, but we are relying on the name of the variable itself to identify that it is a date. Now suddenly we need to cope with null dates (because we are going to process external data, for example). We need to use a variant to store these dates so we can check whether they are null or not. We need to change our variable name to use the new prefix and find everywhere that it is used and make sure it is changed :

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;vDueDate = Date() + 14&lt;/source&gt;

But really, DueDate is first and foremost a date. It should therefore be identified as a date using a date prefix :

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;dteDue = Date() + 14&lt;/source&gt;

This code is immune from changes in the underlying implementation of a date. In some cases, you might need to know whether it is a double or a variant, in which case the appropriate tag can also be used after the date tag :

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  dtevDue = Date() + 14
  dtedblDue = Date() + 14
&lt;/source&gt;

The same arguments apply for a lot of other situations. A loop index can be any numeric type. (In VB4, it can even be a string!) You will often see code like this :

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim iCounter As Integer
  For iCounter = 1 to 10000
    DoSomething
  Next iCounter
&lt;/source&gt;
Now, what if we need to process the loop 100,000 items? We need to change the type of the variable to a long integer, then change all occurrences of its name too.

If we had instead written the routine like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim nCounter As Integer
  For nCounter = 1 to 10000
    DoSomething
  Next nCounter
&lt;/source&gt;

We could have updated the routine by changing the Dim statement only.

Windows handles are an even better example. A handle is a 16-bit item in Win16 and a 32-bit item in Win32. It makes more sense to tag a handle as a handle than as an integer or a long. Porting such code will be much easier - you change the definition of the variable only while the rest of your code remains untouched.

Here is a list of common data types and their tags. It is not exhaustive and you will quite likely make up several of your own during any large project.

{|-
|h  ||handle||16 or 32 bit handle                 ||hWnd	
|-
|dte||date  ||stored in either a double or variant||dteDue	
|}

The body of the variable's name is comprised of one or more complete words, with each word starting with a capital letter, as in ThingToProcess. There are a few rules to keep in mind when forming the body of the name.

Use multiple words - but use them carefully. It can be hard to remember whether the amount due is called AmountDue or DueAmount. Start with the fundamental and generic thing and then add modifiers as necessary. An amount is a more fundamental thing (what's a due?), so you should choose AmountDue. Similarly:
 
{|
|&lt;b&gt;Correct&lt;/b&gt;      ||&lt;b&gt;Incorrect&lt;/b&gt;
|-
|DateDue      ||DueDate	
|-
|NameFirst    ||FirstName	
|-
|ColorRed     ||RedColour	
|-
|VolumeHigh   ||HighVolume	
|-
|StatusEnabled||EnabledStatus	
|}

You will generally find that nouns are more generic than adjectives. Naming variables this way means that related variables tend to sort together, making cross reference listings more useful.

There are a number of qualifiers that are commonly used when dealing with a set of things (as in an array or table). Consistent use of standard modifiers can significantly aid in code maintenance. Here is a list of common modifiers and their meaning when applied to sets of things:

{|
|Count||count   ||the number of items in a set||SelectedCount	
|-
|Min  ||minimum ||the minimum value in a set   ||BalanceMin
|-
|Max  ||maximum ||the maximum value in a set   ||RateHigh	
|-
|First||first   ||the first element of a set   ||CustomerFirst	
|-
|Last ||last    ||the last element of a set    ||InvoiceLast	
|-
|Cur  ||current ||the current element of a set ||ReportCur	
|-
|Next ||next    ||the next element of a set    ||AuthorNext	
|-
|Prev ||previous||the previous element of a set||DatePrev	
|}

At first, placing these modifiers after the body of the name might take a little getting used to; However, the benefits of adopting a consistent approach are very real.

==User Defined Types (UDTs)==

UDTs are an extremely useful (and often overlooked) facility supported by VB. Look into them - this is not the right document to describe how they work or when to use them. We will focus on the naming rules.

First, remember that to create an instance of a UDT, you must first define the UDT and then Dim an instance of it. This means you need two names. To distinguish the type from instances of that type, we use a single letter prefix to the name, as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Type TEmployee
    nID      As Long
    sSurname As String
    cSalary  As Currency
  End Type
  
  Dim mEmployee As TEmployee
&lt;/source&gt;

We cannot use the C conventions here as they rely on the fact that C is case-sensitive. We need to come up with our own convention. The use of an upper case 'T' may seem at odds with the other conventions so far presented but it is important to visually distinguish the names of UDT definitions from the names of variables. Remember that a UDT definition is not a variable and occupies no space.

Besides which, that's how we do it in Delphi.

==Arrays==

There is no need to differentiate the names of arrays from scalar variables because you will always be able to recognise an array when you see it, either because it has the subscripts after it in parentheses or because it is wrapped up inside a function like UBound that only makes sense for arrays.

Array names should be plurals. This will be especially helpful in the transition to collections in VB4.

You should always dimension arrays with both an upper and a lower bound. Instead of:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim mCustomers(10) as TCustomer&lt;/source&gt;

try:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim mCustomers(0 To 10) as TCustomer&lt;/source&gt;

Many times, it makes far more sense to create 1-based arrays. As a general principle, try to create subscript ranges that allow for clean and simple processing in code.

==Procedure==
Procedures are named according to the following convention:

  verb.noun
  verb.noun.adjective

Here are some examples:

Good:

  FindCustomer
  FindCustomerNext
  UpdateCustomer
  UpdateCustomerCur

Bad: 

  CustomerLookup should be LookupCustomer
  GetNextCustomer should be GetCustomerNext

Scoping rules for procedures are rather inconsistent in VB. Procedures are global in modules unless they are declared Private; they are always local in forms in VB3, or default to Private in VB4 but can be Public if explicitly declared that way. Does the term &quot;dog's breakfast&quot; mean anything?

Because the event procedures cannot be renamed and do not have scope prefixes, user procedures in VB also should NOT include a scope prefix. Common modules should keep all procedures that are not callable from other modules Private.

==Function Procedure Data Types==

Function procedures can be said to have a data type which is the type of their return value. This is an important attribute of a function because it affects how and where it may be correctly used.

Therefore, function names should be prefixed with a data type tag like variables.

==Parameters==

Within the body of a procedure, parameter names have a very special status. The names themselves are local to the procedure but the memory that the name relates too may not be. This means that changing the value of a parameter may have an effect at a totally different scope to the procedure itself and this can be the cause of bugs that are particularly difficult to track down later. The best solution is to stop it from happening in the first place.

Ada has a really neat language facility whereby all parameters to a procedure are tagged as being one of the types In, Out or InOut. The compiler then enforces these restrictions on the procedure body; it is not allowed to assign from an Out parameter or assign to an In parameter. Unfortunately, no mainstream language supports this facility so we need to kludge it.

Always make sure you are absolutely clear about how each parameter is to be used. Is it used to communicate a value to the procedure or to the caller or both? Where possible, declare input parameters ByVal so that the compiler enforces this attribute. Unfortunately, there are some data types that cannot be passed ByVal, notably arrays and UDTs.

Each parameter name is formed according to the rules for forming variable names. Of course, parameters are always at procedure level (local) scope so there will not be a scope character. At the end of each parameter name, add an underscore followed by one of the words IN, OUT or INOUT as appropriate. Use upper case to really make these stand out in your code. Here is an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub GetCustomerSurname(ByVal nCustomerCode_IN as Long, _
                         sCustomerSurname_OUT As String)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you see an assignment to a variable that ends in _IN (ie if it is to the left of the '=' in an assignment statement) then you probably have a bug. Ditto if you see a reference to the value of a variable that ends in _OUT. Both these statements are extremely suspect:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  nCustomerCode_IN = nSomeVariable
  nSomeVariable = nCustomerCode_OUT
&lt;/source&gt;

==Function Return Values==

In VB, you specify the return value of a function by assigning a value to a pseudo-variable with the same name as the function. This is a fairly common construct for many languages and generally works OK.

There are, however, one limitation imposed by this scheme. Which is that it makes it really hard to copy and paste code from one function into another because you have to change references to the original function name.

Always declare a local variable called Result inside every function procedure. Make sure that you assign a default value to that variable at the very beginning of the function. At the exit point, assign the Result variable to the function name immediately before the exit of the function. Here is a skeleton for a function procedure (minus comment block for brevity):

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Function DoSomething() As Integer
  
    Dim Result As Integer
    Result = 42 ' Default value of function
  
    On Error Goto DoSomething_Error
    ' body of function
  DoSomething_Exit:   
    DoSomething = Result
    Exit Function
  DoSomething_Error:   
    ' handle the error here  
    Resume DoSomething_Exit
  
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

In the body of the function, you should always assign the required return value to Result. You are also free to check the current value of Result.  You can also read the value of the function return variable.

This might not sound like a big deal if you have never had the ability to use it but once you try it you will not be able to go back to working without it.

Don't forget that functions have a data type too, so their name should be prefixed in the same way as a variable.

==Constants==

The formatting rules for constants are going to be very difficult for us all. This is because Microsoft has done an about-face on constant naming conventions. There are two formats used by Microsoft for constants and unfortunately we will need to work with both formats. While it would be possible for someone to work through the file of MS-defined constants and convert them to the new format, that would mean that every article, book and published code fragment would not match our conventions.

A vote failed to resolve the issue - it was pretty much evenly split between the two alternatives - so I have had to make an executive decision which I will try to explain. The decision is to go with the old-style constant formats.

Constants are coded in ALL_UPPER_CASE with words separated by underscores. Where possible, use the constant names defined in the Constant.Txt file - not because they are particularly well-formed or consistent but because they are what you will see in the documentation and in books and magazine articles.

The formatting of constants may well change as the world moves to VB4 and later, where constants are exposed by OLE objects through a type library and where the standard format is to use InitialCapitalLetters prefixed with some unique, lower-case tag (as in vbYesNoCancel).

When writing modules that are to be called from various places (especially if it will be used in several programs), define global constants that can be used by the client code instead of magic numbers or characters. Use them internally too, of course. When defining such constants, make up a unique prefix to be added to each of them. For example, if I am developing a Widget control module, I might define constants like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Global Const WDGT_STATUS_OK = 0
  Global Const WDGT_STATUS_BUSY = 1
  Global Const WDGT_STATUS_FAIL = 2
  Global Const WDGT_STATUS_OFF = 3
  Global Const WDGT_ACTION_START = 1
  Global Const WDGT_ACTION_STOP = 2
  Global Const WDGT_ACTION_RAISE = 3
  Global Const WDGT_ACTION_LOWER = 4
&lt;/source&gt;

@TODO: Global versus Public
@TODO: Mention enums.

You get the idea. The logic behind this is to avoid naming clashes with constants defined for other modules.

Constants must indicate scope and data type in one of two ways - they may take the lower-case scope and type prefixes that are used for variables, or they may take upper-case group-specific tags. The widget constants above demonstrate the latter type: the scope is WDGT and the data type is STATUS or ACTION. Constants that are used to hide implementation details from clients of a common module would generally use the latter type, whereas constants used for convenience and maintainability in the main part of a program would generally use the normal variable-like prefixes.

:I feel I need to explain these decisions a little more, which I guess signifies that I am not totally satisfied with this outcome. While it would be nice to think that we could just go ahead and define our own standard, the fact is that we are part of the wider VB programming community and will need to interface to code written by others (and in particular by Microsoft). I therefore needed to keep in mind what others have done and what they are likely to do in the future.

:The decision to adopt the old-style comments (ie ALL_UPPER_CASE) was based on the fact that there is a huge body of code (and in particular modules containing constant definitions) that we need to incorporate into our programs. Microsoft's new format (the vbThisIsNew format) is only being implemented in type libraries. The VB4 documentation suggests that we adopt the lower-case prefix &quot;con&quot; for application-specific constants (as in conThisIsMyConstant) but in several on-line discussions with developers working in corporations all around the world it appears that this is not being adopted, or at least not for the foreseeable future.

:That's basically why I decided on the old-style comments. We are familiar with them, everyone else is using them and they clearly delineate code that is in the program (whether we wrote it or it was included from a vendor's supplied BAS file) from constants published by a type library and referenced in VB4+.

:The other dilemma was the issue of scope and type tags on constants. Most people wanted these although they are not generally defined in vendor-supplied constant definitions. I'm not too sure about the type tag myself as I think it is sometimes useful to hide the type to make the client code less dependent on the implementation of some common code.

:In the end, a compromise was chosen. For constants where the type is important because they are used to assign values to a program's own data items, the normal variable-style tags are used to denote both scope and type. For 'interface' constants, such as those supplied by vendors to interface to a control, the scope can be considered the control, and the data type is one of the special types supported by a particular property or method of that control. In other words, MB_ICONSTOP has a scope of MB (message box) and a data type of ICON. Of course, I think it should have been MB_ICON_STOP and that MB_YESNOCANCEL should have been MB_BUTTONS_YESNOCANCEL, but you can't ever accuse Microsoft of consistency. I hope this sheds some light on why I decided to go this way.

:I suspect this issue will generate further discussion as we all get some experience in applying this standard.

==Controls==

All controls on a form should be renamed from their default Text''n'' names, even for the simplest of forms.

The only exceptions to this are any labels used only as static prompts on the surface of a form. If a label is referenced anywhere in code, even once, then it must be given a meaningful name along with the other controls. If not, then their names are not significant and can be left to their default &quot;Labeln&quot; names. Of course, if you are really keen, you may give them meaningful names but I really think we are all busy enough that we can safely skip this step. If you don't like to leave those names set to their defaults (and I'll confess to being in that group), you may find the following technique useful. Create a control array out of all the inert labels on a form and call the array lblPrompt( ). The easy way to do this is to create the first label the way you want it (with the appropriate font, alignment and so on) and then copy and paste it as many times as is necessary to create all the labels. Using a control array has an additional benefit because a control array uses up just one name in the form's name table.

Take the time to rename all controls before writing any code for a form. This is because the code is attached to a control by its name. If you write some code in an event procedure and then change the name of the control, you create an orphan event procedure.

Controls have their own set of prefixes. They are used to identify the type of control so that code can be visually checked for correctness. They also assist in making it easy to know the name of a control without continually needing to look it up. (See &quot;Cradle to Grave Naming of Data Items&quot; below.)

==Specifying Particular Control Variants - NOT==

In general, it is NOT a good idea to use specific identifiers for variations on a theme. For example, whether you are using a ThreeD button or a standard button generally is invisible to your code - you may have more properties to play with at design time to visually enhance the control, but your code usually traps the Click() event and maybe manipulates the Enabled and Caption properties, which will be common to all button-like controls.

Using generic prefixes means that your code is less dependent on the particular control variant that is used in an application and therefore makes code re-use simpler. Only differentiate between variants of a fundamental control if your code is totally dependent on some unique attribute of that particular control. Otherwise, use the generic prefixes where possible.
Table of Standard Control Prefixes

The following table is a list of the common types of controls you will encounter together with their prefixes:

{|
!'''Prefix'''!!align=&quot;left&quot;|'''Control'''
|-
|cbo||Combo box	
|-
|chk||Checkbox	
|-
|cmd||Command button	
|-
|dat||Data control	
|-
|dir||Directory list box	
|-
|dlg||Common dialog control	
|-
|drv||Drive list box	
|-
|ela||Elastic	
|-
|fil||File list box	
|-
|fra||Frame	
|-
|frm||Form	
|-
|gau||Gauge	
|-
|gra||Graph	
|-
|img||Image	
|-
|lbl||Label	
|-
|lin||Line	
|-
|lst||List box	
|-
|mci||MCI control	
|-
|mnu||Menu control †	
|-
|mpm||MAPI Message	
|-
|mps||MAPI Session	
|-
|ole||OLE control	
|-
|opt||Option button	
|-
|out||Outline control	
|-
|pic||Picture	
|-
|pnl||Panel	
|-
|rpt||Report	
|-
|sbr||Scroll bar (there is no need to distinguish orientation)
|-
|shp||Shape	
|-
|spn||Spin	
|-
|ssh||Spreadsheet control	
|-
|tgd||Truegrid	
|-
|tmr||Timer ‡	
|-
|txt||Textbox	
|}

† Menu controls are subject to additional rules as defined below.

‡ There is often a single Timer control in a project, and it is used for a number of things. That makes it difficult to come up with a meaningful name. In this situation, it is acceptable to call the control simply &quot;Timer&quot;.

==Menu Controls==

Menu controls should be named using the tag &quot;mnu&quot; followed by the complete path down the menu tree. This has the additional benefit of encouraging shallow menu hierarchies which are generally considered to be A Good Thing in user interface design.

Here are some examples of menu control names:

  mnuFileNew
  mnuEditCopy
  mnuInsertIndexAndTables
  mnuTableCellHeightAndWidth

==Cradle to Grave Naming of Data Items==

As important as all the preceding rules are, the rewards you get for all the extra time thinking about the naming of objects will be small without this final step, something I call cradle to grave naming. The concept is simple but it is amazingly difficult to discipline yourself to do it without fail.

Essentially, the concept is simply an acknowledgment that any given data item has exactly one name. If something is called a CustomerCode, then that is what it is called EVERYWHERE. Not CustCode. Not CustomerID. Not CustID. Not CustomerCde. No name except CustomerCode is acceptable.

Now, let's assume a customer code is a numeric item. If I need a customer code, I would use the name nCustomerCode. If I want to display it in a text box, that text box must be called txtCustomerCode. If I want a combo box to display customer codes, that control would be called cboCustomerCode. If you need to store a customer code in a global variable (I don't know why you'd want to either - I'm just making a point) then it would be called gnCustomerCode. If you want to convert it into a string (say to print it out later) you might use a statement like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;sCustomerCode = Format$(gnCustomerCode)&lt;/source&gt;

I think you get the idea. It's really very simple. It's also incredibly difficult to do EVERY time, and it's only by doing it EVERY time that you get the real payoffs. It is just SO tempting to code the above line like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;sCustCode = Format$(gnCustomerCode)&lt;/source&gt;

==Fields in databases==

As a general rule, the data type tag prefixes should be used in naming fields in a database.

This may not always be practical or even possible. If the database already exists (either because the new program is referencing an existing database or because the database structure has been created as part of the database design phase) then it is not practical to apply these tags to every column or field. Even for new tables in existing databases, do not deviate from the conventions (hopefully) already in use in that database.

Some database engines do not support mixed case in data item names. In that case, a name like SCUSTOMERCODE is visually difficult to scan and it might be a better idea to omit the tag. Further, some database formats allow for only very short names (like xBase's limit of 10 characters) so you may not be able to fit the tags in.

In general, however, you should prefix database field/column names with data type tags.

==Objects==

There are a number object types that are used often in VB. The most common objects (and their type tags) are:

{|
!'''Prefix'''!!align=&quot;left&quot;|'''Object'''	
|-
|db||Database	
|-
|ws||Workspace	
|-
|rs||Recordset	
|-
|ds||Dynaset	
|-
|ss||Snapshot	
|-
|tbl||Table	
|-
|qry||Query	
|-
|tdf||TableDef	
|-
|qdf||QueryDef	
|-
|rpt||Report	
|-
|idx||Index	
|-
|fld||Field	
|-
|xl ||Excel object	
|-
|wrd||Word object	
|}

==Control Object Variables==

Control objects are pointers to actual controls. When you assign a control to a control object variable, you are actually assigning a pointer to the actual control. Any references to the object variable then reference the control to which it points.

Generic control variables are defined as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim ctlText As Control&lt;/source&gt;

This allows a pointer to any control to be assigned to it via the Set statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Set ctlText = txtCustomerCode&lt;/source&gt;

The benefit of generic control variables is that they can point to any type of control. You can test what type of control a generic control variable is currently pointing to by using the 
TypeOf statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;If TypeOf ctlText Is Textbox Then&lt;/source&gt;

Be careful here; this only looks like a normal If statement. You cannot combine TypeOf with another test, nor can you use it in a Select statement.

The fact that the variable can point to any control type is also its weakness. Because the compiler does not know what the control variable will be pointing to at any point in time, it cannot check what you are doing for reasonableness. It must use run-time code to check every action on that control variable so those actions are less efficient, which just compounds VB's reputation for sluggish performance. More importantly, however, you can end up with the variable pointing to an unexpected control type, causing your program to explode (if you are lucky) or to perform incorrectly.

Specific control variables are also pointers. In this case however, the variable is constrained to point only to controls of a particular type. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim txtCustomerCode as Textbox&lt;/source&gt;

The problem here is that I have used the same three-letter tag to denote a control object variable as I would have used to name an actual text control on a form. If I am following these guidelines, then I will have a control called by the same name on a form. How am I supposed to assign it to the variable?

I can use the form's name to qualify the reference to the actual control, but that is confusing at best. For that reason, object control variable names should be distinct from actual controls, so we extend the type code by using a single letter &quot;o&quot; at the front. The previous definition would more correctly be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim otxtCustomerCode as Textbox&lt;/source&gt;

This is another one I had to agonise over. I actually like the name better if the &quot;o&quot; follows the tag, as in txtoCustomerName. However, it is just too hard to see that little &quot;o&quot; buried in all those characters. I also considered using txtobjCustomerName, but I think that is getting a little bit too long. I'm happy to look at any other alternatives or arguments for or against these ones.

Actually, this is not as big a problem as you might imagine, because in most cases these variables are used as parameters to a generic function call. In that case, we will often use the tag alone as the name of the parameter so the issue does not arise.

A very common use of control object variables is as parameters to a procedure. Here is an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub SelectAll(txt As TextBox)
    txt.SelStart = 0
    txt.SelLength = Len(txt.Text)
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

If we place a call to this procedure in the GotFocus event of a textbox, that textbox has all its text highlighted (selected) whenever the user tabs to it.

Notice how we denote the fact that this is a generic reference to any textbox control by omitting the body of the name. This is a common technique used by C/C++ programmers too, so you will see these sorts of examples in the Microsoft documentation.

To show how generic object variables can be very useful, consider the case where we want to use some masked edit controls as well as standard text controls in our application. The previous version of the routine will not work for anything but standard textbox controls. We could change it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub SelectAll(ctl As Control)
    ctl.SelStart = 0  
    ctl.SelLength = Len(ctl.Text)
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

By defining the parameter to be a generic control parameter, we are now allowed to pass any control to this procedure. As long as that control has SelStart, SelLength and Text properties, this code will work fine. If it does not, then it will fail with a run-time error; the fact that it is using late binding means that the compiler cannot protect us. To take this code to production status, either add specific tests for all the known control types you intend to support (and only process those ones) or else add a simple error handler to exit gracefully if the control does not support the required properties:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub SelectAll(ctl As Control)
    On Error Goto SelectAll_Error
    ctl.SelStart = 0  ctl.SelLength = Len(ctl.Text)
  SelectAll_Exit:  
    Exit Sub
  SelectAll_Error:
    Resume SelectAll_Exit
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==API Declarations==

If you don't know how to make an API declaration, see any one of several good books available on the subject. There is not much to say about API declarations; you either do it right, or it doesn't work.

However, one issue comes up whenever you try to use a common module that itself uses API calls. Inevitably, your application has made one of those calls too so you need to delete (or comment out) one of the declarations. Try to add several of these and you end up with a real mess; API declarations are all over the place and every addition or removal of a module sparks the great API declaration hunt.

There is a simple technique to get around this, however. All non-sharable code uses the standard API declarations as defined in the Help files. All common modules (those that will or may be shared across projects) is banned from using the standard declarations. Instead, if one of these common modules needs to use an API, it must create an aliased declaration for that API where the name is prefixed with a unique code (the same one used to prefix its global constants).

If the mythical Widgets module needed to use SendMessage, it ''must'' declare:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Declare Function WDGT_SendMessage Lib &quot;User&quot; Alias &quot;SendMessage&quot; _
                  (ByVal hWnd As Integer, ByVal wMsg As Integer, _
                   ByVal wParam As Integer, lParam As Any) As Long
&lt;/source&gt;

This effectively creates a private declaration of SendMessage that can be included with any other project without naming conflicts.

==Source Files==

Do not start the names of the files with &quot;frm&quot; or &quot;bas&quot;; that's what the file extension is for! As long as we are limited to the 8-character names of Dos/Win16, we need every character we can get our hands on.

Create the file names as follows:

  SSSCCCCV.EXT

where SSS is a three-character system or sub-system name, CCCC is the four-character form name code and V is an (optional) single digit that can be used to denote different versions of the same file. EXT is the standard file extension assigned by VB, either FRM/FRX, BAS or CLS.

@TODO: rewrite the short name specific parts, update to win32.

The importance of starting with a system or sub-system name is that it is just too easy in VB to save a file in the wrong directory. Using the unique code allows us to find the file using directory search (sweeper) programs and also minimises the chance of clobbering another file that belongs to another program, especially for common form names like MAIN or SEARCH.

Reserving the last character for a version number allows us to take a snapshot of a particular file before making radical changes that we know we might want to back out. While tools like SourceSafe should be used where possible, there will inevitably be times when you will need to work without such tools. To snapshot a file, you just remove it from the project, swap to a Dos box or Explorer (or File Manager or whatever) to make a new copy of the file with the next version number and then add the new one back in. Don't forget to copy the FRX file as well when taking a snapshot of a form file.
Coding Standards

The rest of this document addresses issues relating to coding practices. We all know that there is no set of rules that can always be applied blindly and that will result in good code. Programming is not an art form but neither is it engineering. It is more like a craft: there are accepted norms and standards and a body of knowledge that is slowly being codified and formalised. Programmers become better by learning from their previous experience and by looking at good and bad code written by others. Especially by maintaining bad code.

Rather than creating a set of rules that must be slavishly followed, I have tried to create a set of principles and guidelines that will identify the issues you need to think about and where possible indicate the good, the bad and the ugly alternatives.

Each programmer should take responsibility for creating good code, not simply code that adheres to some rigid standard. That is a far nobler goal - one that is both more fulfilling to the programmer and more useful to the organisation.

The underlying principle is to keep it simple.

Eschew obfuscation.

==Procedure Length==

There has been an urban myth in programming academia that short procedures of no more than &quot;a page&quot; (whatever that is) are better. Actual research has shown that this is simply not true. There have been several studies that suggest the exact opposite. For a review of these studies (and pointers to the studies themselves) see the book Code Complete by Steve McConnell (Microsoft Press, ISBN 1-55615-484-4) which is a book well worth reading. Three times.

To summarise, hard empirical data suggests that error rates and development costs for routines decreases as you move from small (&lt;32 lines) routines to larger routines (up to about 200 lines). Comprehensibility of code (as measured on computer-science students) was no better for code super-modularised to routines about 10 lines long than one with no routines at all. In contrast, on the same code modularised to routines of around 25 lines, students scored 65% better.

What this means is that there is no sin in writing long routines. Let the requirements of the process determine the length of the routine. If you feel that this routine should be 200 lines long, just do it. Be careful how far you go, of course. There is an upper limit beyond which it is almost impossible to comprehend a routine. Studies on really BIG software, like IBM's OS/360 operating system, showed that the most error prone routines were those over 500 lines, with the rate being roughly proportional to length above this figure.

Of course, a procedure should do ONE thing. If you see an &quot;And&quot; or an &quot;Or&quot; in a procedure name, you are probably doing something wrong. Make sure that each procedure has high cohesion an low coupling, the standard aims of good structured design.

==IF==

Write the nominal path through the code first, then write the exceptions. Write your code so that the normal path through the code is clear. Make sure that the exceptions don't obscure the normal path of execution. This is important for both maintainability and efficiency.

Make sure that you branch correctly on equality. A very common mistake is to use &gt; instead of &gt;= or vice versa.

Put the normal case after the If rather than after the Else. Contrary to popular thought, programmers really do not have a problem with negated conditions. Create the condition so that the Then clause corresponds to normal processing.

Follow the If with a meaningful statement. This is somewhat related to the previous point. Don't code null Then clauses just for the sake of avoiding a Not. Which one is easier to read:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If EOF(nFile) Then
    ' do nothing
  Else
    ProcessRecord
  End IF

  If Not EOF(nFile) Then
    ProcessRecord
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

Always at least consider using the Else clause. A study of code by GM showed that only 17% of If statements had an Else clause. Later research showed that 50 to 80% should have had one. Admittedly, this was PL/1 code and 1976, but the message is ominous. Are you absolutely sure you don't need that Else clause?

Simplify complicated conditions with boolean function calls. Rather than test twelve things in an If statement, create a function that returns True or False. If you give it a meaningful name, it can make the If statement very readable and significantly improve the program.

Don't use chains of If statements if a Select Case statement will do. The Select Case statement is often a better choice than a whole series of If statements. The one exception is when using the TypeOf condition which does not work with Select Case statements.

==SELECT CASE==

Put the normal case first. This is both more readable and more efficient.

Order cases by frequency. Cases are evaluated in the order that they appear in the code, so if one case is going to be selected 99% of the time, put it first.

Keep the actions of each case simple. Code no more than a few lines for each case. If necessary, create procedures called from each case.

Use the Case Else only for legitimate defaults. Don't ever use Case Else simply to avoid coding a specific test.

Use Case Else to detect errors. Unless you really do have a default, trap the Case Else condition and display or log an error message.

When writing any construct, the rules may be broken if the code becomes more readable and maintainable. The rule about putting the normal case first is a good example. While it is good advice in general, there are some cases (if you'll pardon the pun) where it would detract from the quality of the code. For example, if you were grading scores, so that less than 50 was a fail, 50 to 60 was an E and so on, then the 'normal' and more frequent case would be in the 60-80 bracket, then alternating like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Select Case iScore
  
    Case 70 To 79:   sGrade = &quot;C&quot;
  
    Case 80 To 89:   sGrade = &quot;B&quot;
  
    Case 60 To 69:   sGrade = &quot;D&quot;
  
    Case Is &lt; 50:    sGrade = &quot;F&quot;
  
    Case 90 To 100:  sGrade = &quot;A&quot;
  
    Case 50 To 59:   sGrade = &quot;E&quot;
  
    Case Else:     ' they cheated
  
  End Select
&lt;/source&gt;

However, the natural way to code this would be do follow the natural order of the scores:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Select Case iScore
  
    Case Is &lt; 50:   sGrade = &quot;F&quot;
  
    Case Is &lt; 60:   sGrade = &quot;E&quot;
  
    Case Is &lt; 70:   sGrade = &quot;D&quot;
  
    Case Is &lt; 80:   sGrade = &quot;C&quot;
  
    Case Is &lt; 90:   sGrade = &quot;B&quot;
  
    Case Is &lt;= 100: sGrade = &quot;A&quot;
  
    Case Else:     ' they cheated
  
  End Select
&lt;/source&gt;

Not only is this easier to understand, it has the added advantage of being more robust - if the scores are later changed from integers to allow for fractional points, then the first version would allow 89.1 as an A which is probably not what was expected.

On the other hand, if this statement was identified as being the bottleneck in a program that was not performing quickly enough, then it would be quite appropriate to order the cases by their statistical probability of occurring, in which case you would document why you did it that way in comments.

This discussion was included to reinforce the fact that we are not seeking to blindly obey rules - we are trying to write good code. The rules must be followed unless they result in bad code, in which case they must not be followed.

==DO==

Keep the body of a loop visible on the screen at once. If it is too long to see, chances are it is too long to understand buried inside that loop and should be taken out as a procedure.

Limit nesting to three levels. Studies have shown that the ability of programmers to understand a loop deteriorates significantly beyond three levels of nesting.

==FOR==

See DO above.

Never omit the loop variable from the Next statement. It is very hard to unravel loops if their end points do not identify themselves properly.

Try not to use i, j and k as the loop variables. Surely you can come up with a more meaningful name. Even if it's something generic like iLoopCounter it is better than i.

:This is a suggestion only. I know how convenient single-character loop variable names are when they are used for a number of things inside the loop, but do think about what you are doing and the poor programmer who has to figure out what i and j actually equate to.

==Assignment Statements (Let)==

Do not code the optional Let key-word for assignment statements. (This means you, Peter.)

==GOTO==

Do not use Goto statements unless they make the code simpler. The general consensus of opinion is that Goto statements tend to make code difficult to follow but that in some cases the exact opposite is true.

In VB, you have to use Goto statements as an integral part of error handling, so there is really no choice about that.

You may also want to use Goto to exit from a very complex nested control structure. Be careful here; if you really feel that a Goto is warranted, perhaps the control structure is just too complex and you should decompose the code into smaller routines.

That is not to say that there are no cases where the best approach is to use a Goto. If you really feel that it is necessary then go ahead and use one. Just make sure that you have thought it through and are convinced that it really is a good thing and not a hack.

==EXIT SUB and EXIT FUNCTION==

Related to the use of a Goto is an Exit Sub (or Exit Function) statement. There are basically three ways to make some trailing part of the code not execute:
Make it part of a conditional (If) statement: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub DoSomething()
  
    If CanProceed() Then
  
      . . .
  
      . . .
  
    End If
  
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Jump over it with a Goto 

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub DoSomething()
  
    If Not CanProceed() Then
  
      Goto DoSomething_Exit
  
    End If
  
    . . .
  
    . . .
  
  DoSomething_Exit:
  
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Exit prematurely with an Exit Sub/Function 

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub DoSomething()
  
    If Not CanProceed() Then
    
      Exit Sub
  
    End If
  
    . . .
  
    . . .
  
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

The one that seems to be the clearest in these simple, skeletal examples is the first one and it is in general a good approach to coding simple procedures. This structure becomes unwieldy when the main body of the procedure (denoted by the '…' above) is nested deep inside a series of control structures required to determine whether that body should be executed. It is not at all difficult to end up with the main body indented half way across the screen. If that main body is itself complex, the code looks quite messy, not to mention the fact that you then need to unwind all those nested control structures after the main body of the code.

When you find this happening in your code, adopt a different approach: determine whether you should proceed and, if not, exit prematurely. Both of the other techniques shown work. Although I think that the Exit statement is more 'elegant', I am forced to mandate the use of the Goto ExitLabel as the standard. The reason that this was chosen is that sometimes you need to clean up before exiting a procedure. Using the Goto ExitLabel construct means that you can code that cleanup code just once (after the label) instead of many times (before each Exit statement).

If you need to prematurely exit a procedure, prefer the Goto ExitLabel construct to the Exit Sub or Exit Function statements unless there is no chance that any cleanup will be needed before those statements.

One case where the Exit statement is very much OK is in conjunction with gatekeeper variables to avoid unwanted recursion. You know:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub txtSomething_Change()
    Dim bBusy As Integer
    If bBusy Then Exit Sub
    bBusy = True
      . . . ' some code that may re-trigger the Change() event
    bBusy = False
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==EXIT DO/FOR==

These statements prematurely bail out of the enclosing Do or For loop. Do use these when appropriate but be careful because they can make it difficult to understand the flow of execution in the program.

On the other hand, use these statements to avoid unnecessary processing. We always code for correctness and maintainability rather than efficiency, but there is no point doing totally unnecessary processing. In particular, do NOT do this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  For nIndex = LBound(sItems) to UBound(sItems)
    If sItems(nIndex) = sSearchValue Then
       bFound = True
       nFoundIndex = nIndex
    End If
  Next nIndex

  If bFound Then . . .
&lt;/source&gt;

This will always loop through all elements of the array, even if the item is found in the first element. Placing an Exit For statement inside the If block would improve performance with no loss of clarity in the code.

Do avoid the need to use these statements in deeply nested loops. (Indeed, avoid deeply nested loops in the first place.) Sometimes there really is no option, so this is not a hard and fast rule, but in general it is difficult to determine where an Exit For or Exit Do will branch to in a deeply nested loop.

==GOSUB==

The Gosub statement is not often used in VB and with good reason. In most cases it does not offer any advantages over the use of standard Sub procedures. Indeed, the fact that the routine that is executed by a Gosub is actually in the same scope as the calling code is generally a dangerous situation and should be avoided.

However, this very same attribute is sometimes very useful. If you are writing a complex Sub or Function procedure you would generally try to identify discrete units of processing that can be implemented as separate procedures that this one can call as appropriate. In some particular cases, however, you will find that the amount of data that needs to be passed around between these related procedures becomes quite absurd. In those cases, implementing those subordinate routines as subroutines inside the main procedure can significantly simplify the logic and improve the clarity and maintainability of the code.

The particular situation where I have found this technique useful is in creating multi-level reports. You end up with procedures like ProcessDetail, ProcessGroup, PrintTotals, PrintSubTotals, PrintHeadings and so forth, all of which need to access and modify a common pool of data items like the current page and line number, the current subtotals and grand totals, the current and previous key values (and a whole lot more I can't think of right now).

For situations like this, this standard does permit the use of Gosub statements when appropriate. However, be careful when you decide to use this approach. Treat the enclosing Sub or Function as if it was a single COBOL program; that is essentially what it is from a control and scope point of view. In particular, ensure that there is only one Return statement at the end of every subroutine. Also be sure that there is an Exit Sub or Exit Function statement before all the subroutine code to avoid the processing falling through into that code (which is highly embarrassing).

==Procedure Calls==

Since the days of QuickBASIC for Dos, there has been a raging debate about whether you should use the 'Call' keyword for non-function procedure calls. In the final analysis, it is one of those issues for which there is no definitive 'right' way to do this.

This standard deprecates the use of the Call keyword.

My reasoning for this is that the code reads more naturally. If we have well-named procedures (using the verb.noun.adjective format) then the resulting VB code is almost pseudocode. Further, I think there is no need to code a keyword if it is obvious what is going on, just like omitting the Let keyword in assignment statements.

==Procedure Parameters==

One of the problems with using procedures is remembering the order of parameters. You want to try to avoid the need to constantly look at the procedure definition to determine what order the arguments need to be supplied to match the parameters.

Here are some guidelines to try to address this issue.

First, code all input parameters before all output parameters. Use your judgement about InOut parameters. Usually, you will not have all three types in a single procedure; if you do I would probably code all the input parameters, followed by the InOut and ending with the output. Again, use your judgement on this.

Don't write procedures that need scores of parameters. If you do need to pass a lot of information to and from a procedure, then create a user defined type that contains the required parameters and pass that instead. This allows the calling program to specify the values in any convenient order by &quot;setting&quot; them in the UDT. Here is a rather trivial example that demonstrates the technique:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Type TUserMessage
    sText          As String
    sTitle         As String
    nButtons       As Integer
    nIcon          As Integer
    nDefaultButton As Integer
    nResponse      As Integer
  End Type
  
  Sub Message (UserMessage As TUserMessage)
    '  &lt;&lt; comment block omitted for brevity &gt;&gt;
    UserMessage.Response = MsgBox(UserMessage.sText,_
                                  UserMessage.nButtons Or _
                                  UserMessage.nIcon Or _
                                  UserMessage.nDefaultButton, _
                                  UserMessage.sTitle)
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Now here is the calling code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim MessageParms As TUserMessage
  
  MessageParms.sText = &quot;Severe error in some module.&quot;
  MessageParms.sTitle = &quot;Error&quot;
  
  MessageParms.nButtons = MB_YESNOCANCEL
  MessageParms.nIcon = MB_ICONSTOP   
  MessageParms.sDefaultButton = MB_DEFBUTTON1
  
  Message MessageParms
  
  Select Case MassageParms.nResponse   
     Case ID_YES:   
     Case IS_NO:
     Case ID_CANCEL:
  End Select
&lt;/source&gt;

==Error Handling==

The ideal situation is to have an error handler around every bit of code and that should be the starting point. This is not always achievable in practice for all sorts of reasons and it is not always necessary. The rule is, however, that unless you are absolutely sure that a routine does not need an error handler, you should at the very least create a handler around the entire routine, something like this:

:Note that the next section discusses a Default Error Handler which requires an expanded form of this skeleton. Please refer to that section for a more complete skeleton for a procedure with an error handler. It has not been included here because we are looking at other components of the standard in this section.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub DoSomething()
    On Error Goto HandleError   
    . . .
  Done:
    Exit Sub
  HandleError:
    Resume Done
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Within the body of the procedure, you may create regions where different error handling is required. To put it bluntly, VB stinks in this area. The technique I prefer is to temporarily disable error trapping and to test for errors using in-line code, something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  DoThingOne
  DoThingTwo
  
  On Error Resume Next
  
  DoSomethingSpecial
    
  If Err Then
    HandleTheLocalError      
  End If
     
  On Error Goto HandleError
&lt;/source&gt;

Another technique is to set flag variables to indicate where you are up to in the body of the procedure and then to write logic in the error handler to take different action based on where the error occurred. I do not generally like this approach but confess that I have used it on occasion because I just could not figure out a way I liked better.

If you get the feeling that I am not too impressed with VB's error handling mechanisms, you are absolutely correct. For that reason, I am not going to mandate any particular style of error handling other than to say that you should implement sufficient error handling in your application to ensure that it works correctly and reliably. If you implement an error handler in a procedure, use the naming convention as shown previously for the line labels.

===Standard Error Handler===

The idea is to have this as a sort of generic error handler that individual error-handling routines can call to handle many of the common errors. 

Using the standard error handler involves the following steps:
*add the module containing the default error handler to a project
*call DefErrorHandler from your error handling routines

This is the standard way to do this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub DoSomething()
  
    On Error Goto DoSomething_Error
    . . .
  DoSomething_Exit:  
    Exit Sub
  
  DoSomething_Error:
    Select Case Err
      Case xxx:
      Case yyy:
      Case xxx:
      Case Else: DefErrorHandler Err, &quot;DoSomething&quot;,_
                                 &quot;&quot;, ERR_ASK_ABORT_
                                 Or ERR_DISPLAY_MESSAGE  
    End Select
  
    Resume DoSomething_Exit

  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the Select Case statement used to trap errors that will be handled locally. All expected errors that need to be handled locally will have a corresponding Case statement. The individual cases may choose to use a different form of the Resume statement to control the flow of the program. Any handled errors that do not do a Resume will fall through to the final statement that will cause the procedure to exit gracefully.

Any errors that have not been handled will be passed on to DefErrorHandler. Individual cases may also call upon DefErrorHandler to log the message and display a user alert.

The first parameter to DefErrorHandler is the error number that has been trapped. The second parameter is a string to denote where the error occurred. This string is used in message boxes and in the log file. The third parameter is a message that is to be written to the log file and displayed to the user. The fourth parameter is a set of flags indicating what the procedure should do. See the constants defined in ERRORGEN for more information.

The default error handler can also provide exits in which you can further customise the way the generic error handler works without modifying the code. These would take the form of global procedures  that are called at convenient places in the processing cycle. By customising how these procedures operate you can change the appearance and function of the error handling process.

Here are some examples of constants and procedures you may want to implement:

;gsERROR_LogFileName:a constant that defines the root file name for the log file
;gsERROR_LogFilePath:a constant that defines the path for the log file can be left empty to use App.Path or can be changed to a variable and set during program initialisation to a valid path
;gsERROR_MSG_???:a series of constants that define some strings, buttons and icons for default message boxes.
;gsERROR_LOGFORMAT_???:a series of constants that define the delimiters in and the format of the lines in the log file
;sERROR_GetLogLine:a function that can totally redefine the format of the log line
;sERROR_GetLogFileName:a function that returns the complete path to the log file; this function can be customised to allow non-fixed locations for the log file to be handled (see the comments in the function)
;ERROR_BeforeAbort:a sub that is called just before the program is terminated with an End statement; this can be used to do any last-minute clean-up in an error situation
;bERROR_FormatMessageBox:a function that can do custom formatting of the error message box or can replace the message box altogether with custom processing (eg. using a form to gather additional information from the user before continuing or ending)

==Formatting Standards==

The physical layout of code is very important in determining how readable and maintainable it is. We need to come up with a common set of conventions for code layout to ensure that programs incorporating code from various sources is both maintainable and aesthetically pleasing.

These guidelines are not hard and fast rules, less so than the variable naming conventions already covered. As always, use your own judgement and remember that you are trying to create the best possible code, not slavishly follow rules.

That said, you'd better have a good reason before deviating from the standard.

==White Space and Indentation==
===Indentation===

Indent three spaces at a time. I know that the default editor tab width is four characters, but I prefer three for a couple of reasons. I don't want to indent too much, and I think two spaces is actually more conservative of screen real estate in the editor. The main reason that I chose three is that the most common reasons to indent (the If and Do statements) look good when their bodies line up with the first character of the word following the keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If nValueCur = nValueMax Then
     MsgBox . . .
  End If
  Do While nValueCur &lt;= nValueMax
     Print nValueCur
     nValueCur = nValueCur + 1
  Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

Unfortunately, the other two prime reasons to indent (the For and Select statements) do not fit neatly into this scheme.

When writing a For statement, the natural inclination is to indent four characters:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  For nValueCur = nValueMin To nValueMax
      MsgBox . . .
  Next nValueCur
&lt;/source&gt;

I'm not too fussed about this as long as the For is not too long and does not encase further indentation. If it is long and if it does contain more indentation, it is hard to keep the closing statements aligned. In that case, I would strongly suggest that you stick to indenting by the standard three spaces.

Don't forget that you can set up the VB editor so that the Tab key indents by three spaces if you prefer to use the Tab key. Personally, I use the space bar.

For the Select Case statement, there are two commonly used techniques, both of which are valid.

In the first technique, the Case statements are not indented at all but the code that is controlled by each statement is indented by the standard amount of three spaces, as in:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Select Case nCurrentMonth
  
  Case 1,3,5,7,8,10,12
     nDaysInMonth = 31
  
  Case 4,6,9,11
     nDaysInMonth = 30
  
  Case 2
     If IsLeapYear(nCurrentYear) Then
        nDaysInMonth = 29
     Else
        nDaysInMonth = 28
     End If
  
  Case Else
     DisplayError &quot;Invalid Month&quot;
  End Select
&lt;/source&gt;

In the second technique, the Case statements themselves are indented by a small amount (two or three spaces) and the statements they control are super-indented, essentially suspending the rules if indentation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Select Case nCurrentMonth
    Case 1,3,5,7,8,10,12:  nDaysInMonth = 31
    Case 4,6,9,11:         nDaysInMonth = 30
    Case 2                 If IsLeapYear(nCurrentYear) Then
                              nDaysInMonth = 29                 
                           Else                            
                              nDaysInMonth = 28     
                           End If
    Case Else:             DisplayError &quot;Invalid Month&quot;
  
  End Select
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how the colon is used to allow the statements to appear right beside the conditions. Notice also how you cannot do this for If statements.

Both techniques are valid and acceptable. In some sections of a program, one or the other will be clearer and more maintainable, so use common sense when deciding.

Let's not get too hung up on indentation, folks. Most of us understand what is acceptable and what is not when it comes to indenting code.

===White space in expressions===
Put one space around operators, and after a comma in expressions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Let miSomeInteger = 1 + 2 * (miSomeOtherInteger - 6)&lt;/source&gt;

==Commenting Code==

This one will be really controversial. Don't comment more than you need to. Now, here's a list of where you definitely need to; there may be others too.

===Comment Header Block===

Each major routine should have a header that identifies:
*who wrote it
*what it is supposed to do
*what the parameters mean (both input and output)
*what it returns (if it's a function)
*what assumptions it makes about the state of the program or environment
*any known limitations
*an amendment history

Here is an example of a function's header:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Function ParseToken(sStream_INOUT As String, _
                      sDelimiter_IN As String) As String
  '===============================================================
  'ParseToken
  '---------------------------------------------------------------
  'Purpose : Removes the first token from sStream and returns it
  '          as the function result. A token is delimited by the
  '          first occurrence of sDelimiter in sStream.
  '
  ' Author : Jim Karabatsos, March 1996
  '
  ' Notes   : sStream is modified so that repeated calls to this
  '           function will break apart the stream into tokens
  '---------------------------------------------------------------
  ' Parameters
  '-----------
  ' sStream_INOUT : The stream of characters to be scanned for a
  '                 token.  The token is removed from the string.
  '
  ' sDelimiter_IN : The character string that delimits tokens
  '---------------------------------------------------------------
  ' Returns : either a token (if one is found) or an empty string
  '           if the stream is empty
  '---------------------------------------------------------------
  'Revision History
  '---------------------------------------------------------------
  ' 11Mar96 JK  : Enhanced to allow multi-character delimiters
  ' 08Mar96 JK  : Initial Version
  '===============================================================
&lt;/source&gt;

Looks like a lot, doesn't it? The truth of the matter is you will not write one of these for every procedure. For many procedures, a few lines of comments at the top is all you need to convey all the information required. For event procedures you generally do not need such a comment block at all unless it contains significant amounts of code.

For significant procedures, however, until you can write one of these you haven't thought the processing through enough to start coding. If you don't know what's in that header, you can't start maintaining that module. Nor can you hope to reuse it. So you may as well type it into the editor before you write the code and pass on your knowledge rather than require someone else to read through the code to decipher what is going on.

Notice that the header does not describe how the function does its job. That's what the source code is for. You don't want to have to maintain the comments when you later change the implementation of a routine. Notice also that there are no closing characters at the end of each comment line. DO NOT DO THIS:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  '****************************************************
  '* MY COMMENT BLOCK                                 *
  '*                                                  *
  '* This is an example of a comment block that is    *
  '* almost impossible to maintain. Don't do it !!!   *
  '****************************************************
&lt;/source&gt;

This might look 'nice' (although that really is debatable) but it is very hard to maintain such formatting. If you've got time to do this sort of thing, you obviously aren't busy enough. 

In general terms, naming variables, controls, forms and procedures sensibly, combined with a well-thought-out comment block, will be sufficient commenting for most procedures. Remember, you are not trying to explain your code to a non-programmer; assume that the person looking at the code knows VB pretty well.

In the body of the procedure, there are two types of comments that you will use as required: In-line comments and End of Line Comments.

===In-line Comments===

In-line comments are comments that appear by themselves on a line, whether they are indented or not.

In-line comments are the Post-It notes of programming. This is where you make annotations to help yourself or another programmer who needs to work with the code later. Use In-line comments to make notes in your code about
*what you are doing
*where you are up to 
*why you have chosen a particular option 
*any external factors that need to be known 

Here are some examples of appropriate uses of In-line comments:

What we are doing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;' Now update the control totals file to keep everything in sync&lt;/source&gt;

Where we are up to:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ' At this point, everything has been validated.
  ' If anything was invalid, we would have exited the procedure.
&lt;/source&gt;

Why we chose a particular option:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ' Use a sequential search for now because it's simple to code
  ' We can replace with a binary search later if it's not fast
  ' enough
  ' We are using a file-based approach rather than doing it all
  ' in memory because testing showed that the latter approach
  ' used too many resources under Win16.  That's why the code
  ' is here rather than in ABCFILE.BAS where it belongs.
&lt;/source&gt;

External factors that need to be kept in mind:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ' This assumes that the INI file settings have been checked by
  ' the calling routine
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that we are not documenting what is self-evident from the code. Here are some examples of inappropriate In-line comments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ' Declare local variables
  Dim nEmployeeCur As Integer
  ' Increment the array index
  nEmployeeCur = nEmployeeCur + 1
  ' Call the update routine
  UpdateRecord
&lt;/source&gt;

Comment what is not readily discernible from the code. Do not re-write the code in English, otherwise you will almost certainly not keep the code and the comments synchronised and that is very dangerous. The reverse side of the same coin is that when you are looking at someone else's code you should totally ignore any comments that relate directly to the code statements. In fact, do everyone a favour and remove them.

===End of Line Comments===

End of Line (EOL) comments are small annotations tacked on the end of a line of code. The perceptual difference between EOL comments and In-Line comments is that EOL comments are very much focused on one or a very few lines of code whereas In-Line comments refer to larger sections of code (sometimes the whole procedure).

Think of EOL comments like margin notes in a document. Their purpose is to explain why something needs to be done or why it needs to be done now. They may also be used to document a change to the code. Here are some appropriate EOL comments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
mnEmployeeCur = mnEmployeeCur + 1    ' Keep the module level
                                     ' pointer synchronised
                                     ' for OLE clients
                                     
mnEmployeeCur = nEmployeeCur         ' Do this first so that the
UpdateProgress                       ' meter ends at 100%

If nEmployeeCur &lt; mnEmployeeCur Then ' BUG FIX 3/3/96 JK
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that EOL comments may be continued onto additional lines if necessary as shown in the first example.

Here are some examples of inappropriate EOL comments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  nEmployeeCur = nEmployeeCur + 1 ' Add 1 to loop counter
  UpdateRecord  ' Call the update routine
&lt;/source&gt;

Do you really want to write every program twice?

[[IB Chemistry Option Definitions]]

== Core ==

IB Chemistry Definitions mostly by Jobin

=== Topic 1 - Stoichiometry ===

*Avogadro’s constant:	The number of particles in 12g of 12C.	6.022 x 10^23
*Atomic mass: The mass of a single atom
*Chemical reaction:	A reaction in which bonds in the reactants are broken and bonds in the products are formed resulting in an energy change between the reacting system and its surroundings.
*Compound:	Two or more types of atoms chemically bonded together.
*Concentration: a measure of the amount of dissolved substance contained per unit of volume
*Element:	A substance that contains only one type of atom.
*Excess:	The reactant which there is more of than needed to react with all of the limiting reagent.
*Formula, empirical:	The formula obtained by experiment, showing the simplest whole number ratio of atoms of each element in a particle of the substance.
*Formula mass: The mass of one formula unit of that substance
*Formula, structural:	Shows the arrangement of atoms and bonds within a molecule.
*Ion: An atom or molecules where the total number of protons is not equal to the total number of electrons.
*Limiting reagent:	The reactant which will determine the theoretical maximum amount of product formed.
*Molar mass:	The mass of a mole of a substance.
*Mole:	The amount of substance that contains a number of specified species equal to Avogadro’s constant.
*Molecular mass: the mass of one molecule of that substance
*Solute: A substance that is dissolved into another ( the solvent)
*Solvent: a substance that dissolves another ( the solute)
*Yield, percentage:	The experimental yield as a percentage of the maximum theoretical yield.
*Yield:	The amount of product.

=== Topic 2 and 12 - Atomic structure ===

*Atomic emission spectra:	The characteristic line spectrum that occurs as a result of energy being supplied to individual elements. When energy is supplied to an atom, e- are excited from their ground state to a higher energy level. The e- dropping from higher energy levels to lower emit energy, which can be observed in a spectrum. As e- can only exist in fixed energy levels, the energy in the emissions are characteristic for each type of atom. Lines converge toward high energy end of spectrum as the energy levels themselves are convergent.
*Atomic number:	Number of protons in the nucleus.
*Aufbau principle:	The principle that states that lowest energy levels are filled first. The starting order is 1s2s2p3s3p4s3d…
*Hund’s rule:	Orbitals within the same sub-shell are filled singly first.
*Ionization energy, first:	The energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms in the ground state to produce one mole of gaseous ions. Increases across a period (due to increasing nuclear attraction), except for slight drops (due to the commencement of pairing of e- into orbitals  greater electron repulsion). Decreases down a group (due to increased number of energy levels  increased electron shielding).
*Isotope:	An atom that contains the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.
*Mass number:	Total number of nucleons.
*Mass spectrometer:	A device for determining relative atomic masses and their relative abundances. Composed of: 
			**vaporizer (where the sample is vaporized), 
			**ionizer (where atoms are bombarded with high energy e-  e- knocked off the atoms. Only ions with a +1 charge are formed, in practice), 
			**accelerator (where an electric field accelerates them), 
			**deflector (where a magnetic field deflects them; the smaller the mass and the higher the charge, the greater the deflection) and 
			**detector (which measures both the mass and relative amounts of ions present.
*Orbital:	A region of space around the nucleus of an atom that is occupied by a maximum of two e- at any given time. The types of orbitals are s (spherical), p (dumbbell-shaped), d and f.
*Pauli’s exclusion principle:	e- in single orbital must have opposite spin.
*Relative abundances:	The percentage of natural occurrence of an isotope of an element.
*Relative atomic mass:	The weighted mean of all the naturally occurring isotopes of the element relative to 12C. No units.
*Valence electrons:	The e- in the highest main energy level.

===Topic 3 and 13 – Periodicity===
*Alkali metals:	Group 1 elements. Strength of metallic bond gets weaker as atoms get larger.
*Anion:	A – charged ion. Decrease in size across a period as they are isoelectronic but have an increased nuclear charge. Contain more e- than their parent atom, so they are larger in size.
*Atomic radius:	Half the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms of the same element. Decreases across period as nuclear charge increases. Increases down a group because of greater number of energy levels.
*Catalyst:	A substance that increases the rate of reaction while being recoverable in the end stage of the reaction, unchanged. Examples of catalytic transition metals: Fe is used in Haber process; V2O5 in Contact process; Ni in hydrogenation reactions; MnO2 with hydrogen peroxide.
*Cation:	A + charged ion. Decrease in size across a period. Contain less e- than their parent atom, so they are smaller in size.
*Chloride:	Chlorides of Na and Mg have an ionic structure, while all the remaining chlorides of period 3 elements have simple covalent structures. Still, Al2Cl6 can act as a poor conductor. NaCl dissolves in water to give a neutral solution, MgCl2 gives slightly acidic solution, while all other chlorides react vigorously with water to produce acidic solutions of HCl together with fumes of hydrogen chloride.
*Colored complex:	A complex is a compound in which molecules or ions form dative bonds to a metal atom or ion. Colors are due to e- transitions between different d orbitals. 
*Co-ordination number:	Number of lone pairs bonded to the metal ion. Cl- often gives 4 coordinate bonds, CN- gives 6, H2O gives 6 and NH3 gives 4 or 6.
*D-d transition:	The excitation of an e- from the lower of two energy level groups to the upper. As the ligand approaches the metal, the five d orbitals split. The difference in energy between the two levels corresponds to the wavelength of visible light, as incoming light causes energy of a particular wavelength to be absorbed by e- that are excited from the lower level to the higher. The amount that the d orbitals are split will determine the exact color.
*Degenerate:	Of equal energy. In a free ion, the five d orbitals are degenerate.

*Reaction, substitution:	A reaction in which one group is substituted for another. Substitution reactions with halogenoalkanes are nucleophilic substitutions. Benzene does not undergo substitution reactions readily as its  bonds are delocalized.
*Reflux:	A condenser which causes any vapor produced to condense and returns to the flask and continues to react. If the carboxylic acid is desired from the oxidation of a primary alcohol, this must be done under reflux. On the other hand, if the aldehyde is desired, this can be distilled from the reaction mixture as soon as it is formed.
*Saturated:	Containing only single bonds. Alkanes are saturated.
*Spectrometry, mass:	Separating ions according to mass. 
*Spectroscopy, IR:	Analyzing the bonds present within a molecule by sending infrared light through it, causing the bonds to absorb radiation of characteristic frequencies.
*Spectroscopy, NMR:	Analysis of hydrogen environments to deduce the structure of a molecule. Measured in ppm relative to TMS.
*Trans-isomer:	The geometric isomer in which the similar groups are on different sides of the double bond. Commonly non-polar.
*Unsaturated:	Containing double bonds. Alkenes are unsaturated. Can be tested for by bromination.

{{Basic Computing Using Windows/Table of Contents}}

==What is a computer?==
A '''computer''' is an automatic, electronic, data-processing machine that takes in facts and figures known as '''data''', and then '''processes''' or organizes it in some useful way.  Afterwards it '''outputs''', or displays, the results for you to see as information. Keep in mind that data is not information. Rather, information is the knowledge that you, the end-user, derive from accurate data that are entered into a computer. Only after processing, is data transformed into information which is then used for decision making. 
(Almost) each part of a computer can be classified as either '''hardware''' or '''software'''.

==Hardware==
Hardware refers to all of the physical components of a computer. These parts may include:
* A display component (commonly a '''monitor''')
* A '''keyboard'''
* A '''pointing device''', usually a mouse or trackpad
* Any cables or wiring
* Any buttons found on the computer, such as a power button
* Internal components such as a '''processor''', '''memory''', '''mass storage''' and a '''motherboard'''
* A '''printer'''

===The display===
Many people mistakenly think that the part of the computer that normally displays pictures and text is the computer.  This is usually not true.  That part is called the '''monitor''' or '''display'''.  With a standard desktop computer, the part that does the actual computing is often in a separate box.  With a laptop or a netbook, the computing is done in the hardware under the keyboard.  Also, you may call the whole assembly of all the hardware (the computer and the monitor, for example) the computer.  Occasionally though, the computer and monitor are built together, in which case they are commonly referred to as '''All-in-One Desktop Computers'''.

There are different types of monitors.  One of these is the one already shown.  It is called a '''CRT''' monitor, which is similar to a old television. It uses more electrical power than the other popular kind, called '''LCD'''s .  However, CRT monitors work faster, which makes them better for fast games because the movement will blur less , but LCD's have already caught up.  LCDs are thinner than CRTs, but they are generally more expensive. As of now , CRT screens are no longer sold. Some monitors use touchscreens, where you can interact with the monitor by touch.

Monitors are only one way the computer can output information for you to see.

===Printers and scanners===
Another popular output device is called a '''printer''' .  Printers are used to put data on paper.  This is called '''hard copy'''; what monitors show is called '''soft copy'''. There are different types of printers , like Xerox , laser and deskjet , with the last one being the cheapest of the three. There are also printers which can also scan/fax , they are called All-in-one.&lt;br /&gt;
Scanners are devices which scan the input for viewing on the computer.
===Input devices===
There are also different kinds of input hardware.  The two most important of which are the '''mouse''' and the '''keyboard'''.  A mouse is used to move the '''cursor''' (or arrow) around the '''screen''' (monitor display).  A keyboard is used to enter ('''type''') letters, numbers, and other symbols into a computer. 

==Software==
Software is all of the instructions and programming that a computer uses to do what you ask it to do.  Packages of software are often called '''programs''', and an '''operating system''' is a collection of programs that help all the other '''programs''' run. Think of software as the power behind the hardware. Without software, your computer doesn't do anything. Without hardware, the software can't exist. Computers do not think for themselves, so they need software, which is made to manipulate the computer's hardware in such a way that you, the user, can understand.

As an example, a calculator is a very simple computer. It is not as complex or versatile as your net book, laptop, or desktop computer though. You input information as series of key presses, and the calculator computes the result which is displayed as output on a small screen. Since calculators are faster than humans this creates utility in the form of time saved. Calculators can also repeat calculations much more easily than humans can. 

Computers store all data in '''binary code''', which is a number system that only uses ones and zeros.  One digit in binary code is called a '''bit''', eight bits is called a '''byte'''.  A byte is the amount of space one letter takes up.  One thing to bear in mind is that all the extra detail about how the letter looks must also be stored in binary code and so '''word processor''' documents use more space than one byte per letter.
== Types of computers ==
There are many different kinds of computers. The ones that most people use are called '''Personal Computers''' (PCs). '''Desktop PCs''' are computers that you don't move around; they generally are a box with a monitor attached.  Smaller, portable, computers that are about the size of a briefcase are called '''laptops''' or '''notebooks'''.  There are also computers that are around the same size, but they have a special screen: '''Text''' (letters and numbers) is written directly on the screen, these are called '''Tablet PCs'''. They also do not require a mouse; the mouse gestures and clicks are done by tapping directly on the screen with your finger or with a '''Stylus'''.  '''Personal Digital Assistants''' (PDAs) are computers so small that you can hold them in one hand. They generally also have a '''Touch Screen''', like the Tablets.  Notebooks, PDAs, and most Tablets have batteries so that you can use them without plugging into a wall outlet. These batteries generally last for about three to 8 hours , with some reaching 12 hours and beyond before needing to be recharged, although smaller devices may last longer.  They use LCD screens because LCDs are thinner and take less power, so the batteries will last longer, and so that they are not, say, a foot thick.  There are also much more powerful computers called '''servers''' that can be as big as a room or a house! This is what, say, Google and Wikimedia run their websites off of. 
== Turning the computer on ==
In a desktop , to start the computer  first make sure that the power supply is connected , and then press the switch which is usually on the front of the computer. On laptops and tablets , simply locate the power button and press it. 
If it comes up, and it is like this one, you must type the correct '''login name''' and '''password''' in the respective boxes.  If you get a picture(Windows 8+) , then simply click it from the top. Then press the '''enter''' key, or '''click''' on (put the cursor on top of and push the left button on the mouse) the OK '''button''' if there is one.  If the box does not come up, do not worry, nothing is wrong.  That just means the computer is set not to have a password.  We will learn more about this later.  If this box did not come up, but instead a screen with pictures and names of the user accounts , click the picture with the correct user name beside it, type in the password (if there is one), and press(or tap) on your keyboard(or virtual) that says ‘Enter’.

'''Hormone, adrenalin:''' Responsible for ‘fight or flight’ response (goose bumps, increased pulse/BP). Produced in adrenal medulla.

'''Hormone, insulin:''' Made up of 51 aa residues. Decreases glucose levels in blood by making liver absorb glucose in the form of glycogen. Insulin produced in -cells of Islets of Langerhans.

'''Hormone, thyroxine:''' Regulates metabolism. Produced in thyroid gland. Hypothalamus releases local hormone which tells anterior pituitary to release thyroid SH (+ feedback). TSH tells thyroid glands to release thyroxine (+ feedback). When the concentration of thyroxin reaches a certain level, a – feedback is sent to hypothalamus, ceasing production of the local hormone. 

'''Hormones, sex:''' Responsible for development of secondary sexual characteristics. Both estrogen and testosterone produced in testes (males) and ovaries (females). They are all steroids  contain characteristic four-ring structure.

'''Hormones:''' Chemicals produced in glands and transported to specific target cell by blood stream, and binds to a receptor site on or within the target cell  produces a specific physiological response. Glands are controlled by pituitary gland, which in turn is controlled by the hypothalamus. Hormones act as chemical messengers.
 
Hydrophilic:''' Describing part of molecule that is attracted to water.

'''Hydrophobic:''' Describing part of molecule that repels water.

'''Lactose:''' Disaccharide in which -D-galactose and -D-glucose are joined by glycosidic link.

'''Lipids:''' Biological substances that are soluble in non-polar solvents (generally). Lipases in digestive system degrade lipids.

'''Menstrual cycle:''' Pituitary gland releases follicle SH, which travels to ovaries causing release of estradiol. Two weeks later, – feedback stops release of FSH and triggers release of luteinizing hormone, which travels to ovaries and releases progesterone. Progesterone causes egg to be transported to uterus. If egg is fertilized, it embeds itself on uterine wall and hormone levels rise dramatically, otherwise hormone levels fall and menstruation occurs.

'''Metabolism:''' The network of biochemical reactions that supports life.

'''Micelle:''' The particle formed when the hydrophilic tail dissolves in oil or grease.

'''Ninhydrin:''' An organic dye. Causes coloration of aa’s. Used to see how far aa’s have moved in both paper chromatography and electrophoresis.

'''Nutrient:''' Substances that are required by an organism as food.

'''Oils:''' Liquid triglycerides at room temperature. Contain at least one double bond, i.e. they are unsaturated. The more unsaturated, the lower the m.p. due to its inability to pack so closely together  the surface area decreases  decrease in the van der Waals’ forces between the molecules. Number of C=C bonds can be determined by addition reactions with I2. See IODINE NUMBER.

'''Oral contraceptives:''' Most common ‘pill’ contains a mixture of estradiol and progesterone  mimics the high hormonal levels of pregnancy, in turn preventing the release of more eggs.

'''Polyunsaturated oils:''' An oil containing several double bonds.

'''Protein structure, electrophoresis:''' Electrophoresis is carried out on a medium called PAGE. Sample is placed in center of gel, and a potential difference is applied across it. The movement of the aa depends on the pH of the buffer: at low pH, the amine group will be protonated, while at high pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated. At the isoelectric point – characteristic for each aa – the aa exists as a zwitterion, and will not move (charges balanced). When satisfactory separation is complete, the aa can be sprayed with ninhydrin, and their isoelectric points can be compared.

'''Protein structure, paper chromatography:''' When a piece of chromatographic paper containing a small sport of the unknown aa is placed in an eluent, the eluent rises up the paper (capillary action). The different aa’s spread out to different extents, and move up the paper at different rate. 

'''Proteins:''' Large macromolecules of chains of 2-amino acids. Formed by aa’s bonding to each other by peptide bonds. 
			1) The primary structure of the proteins is their strict sequence of aa residues. 
			2) The secondary structure describes how the chain folds itself due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding (can be -helix -– hydrogen bonds within single chain, causing spiraling – or -pleated – hydrogen bonds between chains). 
			3) The tertiary structure describes overall folding of the chain, giving the protein its three-dimensional shape (may be due to hydrogen bonds, van der Waals’, and ionic attraction. Two Cys residues can form disulphide bridges). 
			4) The quaternary structure results from the interactions between separate polypeptide chains. 
		Uses of proteins: 
			1) Many are enzymes; 
			2) can give structure; 
			3) source of energy; 
			4) regulation hormones.

'''Saccharide, oligo-:''' Containing 2-9 monosaccharides.

'''Saccharide, poly-:''' Polymers of monosaccharides. Formed by condensation reactions, forming glycosidic links.

'''Saponification:''' The process in which a triglyceride is hydrolyzed, forming soap. Reverse of esterification.

'''Soap:''' The sodium or potassium salt of the fatty acids produced from the saponification process. Functions because of hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. The tail dissolves in oil or grease to form a micelle. Surrounded by hydrophilic heads, which makes it soluble in water.

'''Starch:''' Polymer of -D-glucose. Exists in two forms: 
			1) amylose (water soluble); 
			2) amylopectin (water insoluble). Most plants use starch as a store of carbohydrates.

'''Structure-function relationship:''' The structure of a chemical compound is adapted to its function by evolution.

'''Synthetic detergents:''' Soap molecules of which the calcium or magnesium salts are soluble  that they can work well in hard water as well. Cause more pollution than soaps.

'''Triglyceride:''' Formed from condensation reaction between glycerol and fatty acids.

'''Vitamin A:''' Retinol. Found in cod liver oil, green vegetables and fruit. Fat soluble despite OH group, due to long hydrocarbon chain. Not broken down readily by cooking. Aids night vision. Retinol is oxidized to retinal in body. Retinal combines with  protein opsin to form rhodopsin, the active agent for converting light signals into electrical signals that travel along optical nerve to brain. Deficiency  xerophtalmia or night-blindness.

'''Vitamin C:''' Ascorbic acid. Found in fresh fruit and vegetables. Water soluble. Involved in biosynthesis of the protein collagen (found in connective tissue). Deficiency  scurvy.

'''Vitamin D:''' Calciferol. Found in fish liver oils and egg yolk. Can be formed on surface of skin by UV light reacting with 7-dehydrocholesterol. Involved in uptake of Ca2+ and PO43+ ions from food, and in formation of bone structure. Deficiency  rickets.

'''ATP:''' Adenosine triphosphate. Made up of base A, ribose, and three phosphate groups bonded together by high-energy phosphate bonds. Breaking the last of these bonds releases energy for use in cells, leaving ADP.

'''Chromosome:''' A structure composed of DNA and associated proteins.

'''Codon:''' Each of 64 permutations of the triplet code.

'''Coenzyme:''' Organic cofactors. Example: B-vitamins. Two types: 
			1) permanent coenzymes (always bonded to enzymes); 
			2) non-permanent coenzymes (only bonded to enzymes during catalysis).

'''Cofactor:''' A substance that is a part of the active site, and that is involved in the catalysis. Can be: 
			1) inorganic (metal ions); 
			2) organic (coenzymes).

'''Concentration, effect of:''' 1) Increasing concentration of the substrate: proportional increase in rate, but eventually evens out as all active sites of enzyme become saturated. 2) Increasing concentration of enzyme: proportional increase in rate.

'''Cyanide:''' A poison which works by blocking cytochrome oxidase, which is vital for aerobic respiration.

'''Cytochrome:''' Oxidizing enzymes in mitochondria. Contain Cu2+/Cu+.

'''Deoxyribose:''' The pentose sugar found in DNA.

'''DNA profiling:''' Using a small amount of cellular material, DNA is extracted and broken down into minisatellites using restriction enzymes. Splits where there are no coded messages in the base sequence are unique to the person giving the sample, and so this can be used to identify them.

'''DNA replication:''' DNA in cell begin to partly unzip as hydrogen bonds between the bases break. New sugar base units are taken up from the aqueous solution. Due to set pairs (AT and CG), the new strands will be identical to the original one.

'''DNA:''' Deoxyribonucleic acid. Double-stranded. Made up of nucleotides. Have – charge due to phosphate group. Cannot penetrate nucleus.

'''Electron transport:''' Occurs in inner membrane of mitochondria, which contains different proteins and enzymes, incl. cytochromes. The H+ ions from the NADH2 (product from the citric acid cycle) move along cytochromes by repeated redox reactions, due to presence of stronger oxidizing agents. Enzyme cytochrome oxidase causes H+ ions, e- and O2 to react to form water, releasing energy in the process.

'''Enzyme saturation:''' When all the active sites of the enzymes are occupied by a substrate. At this saturation, increasing substrate concentration has no effect.

'''Enzyme, factors affecting:''' 1) Enzyme concentration;

'''Enzyme:''' Proteins that act as biological catalysts, for specific substrates.

'''Gene:''' A specific sequence of DNA which codes for the synthesis of a protein.

'''Glycolysis:''' First phase of breakdown of glucose in respiration. Occurs in cytoplasm.

'''Heavy metal ions, effect of:''' Can poison enzymes by reacting with –SH groups replacing the hydrogen atom with a heavy metal atom or ion. Enzyme is denatured.

'''Induced fit theory:''' The active site can alter its shape to allow for a better fit with the substrate. An enzyme-substrate complex is created, and the catalyzed reaction takes place, leaving an enzyme-product complex. The products are released, and the enzyme reverts to its original shape.

'''Inhibition, competitive:''' Reversible inhibition. Resemble the substrate in shape, but cannot react. Slow down reaction by occupying active site. Does not affect Vmax but does affect Km.

'''Inhibition, irreversible:''' The inhibitor reacts with a part of the enzyme, and a covalent bond is formed between the inhibitor and enzyme. Enzyme activity is permanently destroyed. Example: nerve gases work by alkylation of an OH-group in the active site of an enzyme.

'''Inhibition, non-competitive:''' Reversible inhibition. Prevents enzyme reactions by binding to another part of the enzyme than the active site. This causes the enzyme to alter its shape and be unable to receive its substrate. Does not affect Km but does affect Vmax.

'''Inhibition, reversible:''' The inhibitor makes weak (intermolecular) bonds with the enzyme. The enzyme can become biologically active again. Two types: 
			1)competitive; 
			2) non-competitive.

'''Metal ions:''' Examples of important ions: Na+ and K+ (nerve impulses and water balance); Ca2+ (bones and teeth); Cu2+ (enzymes); Co2+ (vitamin B12); Fe2+ (Hb). All depend on one of the following: 
			1) difference in charge density between two ions; 
			2) variable oxidation states; 
			3) forming complexes with ligands.

'''Michaelis-Menten constant:''' The substrate concentration when the rate of the reaction is at ½ Vmax. The constant will always be the same for a particular enzyme and particular substrate.	Km

'''mRNA:''' Messenger of genetic information (transcription).

'''Nucleotide:''' Repeating base-sugar-phosphate units that make up the nucleic acids. The base can be one of four nitrogen-containing bases, adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) or thymine (T). In RNA, uracil (U) replaces T. The phosphate bonds to the C4, while the base bonds to the C1.

'''pH, effect of:''' The pH value affects the tertiary structure. Enzymes have an optimum pH; outside of this, they can be denatured. More subtly, pH affects the electrostatic charge of the enzyme, which may affect the binding of substrate to enzyme, or the chemistry of the active site.

'''Phosphodiester bond:''' Bonding between nucleotides in a polynucleotide. Each nucleotide is joined between the C3 of the sugar and the neighboring phosphate group.

'''Phosphorylation:''' Addition of phosphate group. Phosphorylation in the sodium-potassium pump causes shape of pump to change.

'''Protein synthesis:''' Happens in ribosomes. 
			1) Transcription in nucleus; followed by 
			2) processing by mRNA; 
			3) translation by ribosome.

'''Ribose:''' The pentose sugar found in RNA. Same as deoxyribose, except with an extra O bonded to the C2.

'''Ribosome:''' Particle that causes protein synthesis. Sequence of aa’s determined by nucleotide sequence in mRNA.

'''RNA:''' Ribonucleic acid. Single stranded. Contains base U instead of DNA’s base T. Two functions: 
			1) transcription (messenger of genetic information); 
			2) translation (translating gene information into protein synthesis).

'''Sodium-potassium pump:''' Protein structure in cell membrane act as valves pumping Na+ ions out of cell and K+ ions into the cell. Works due to difference in charge density between Na+ and K+. The Na+ binds to three sites on the protein molecule. Energy is extracted from ATP by hydrolyzing to ADP, and the phosphorylation causes the pump to change its shape. Na + ions are expelled, and K+ ions bind to two sites on the protein molecule. The loss of the phosphate causes the pump to change its shape again, expelling the K+ ions into the cell.

'''Substrate:''' The substance on which an enzyme acts.

'''Temperature, effect of:''' Increasing temperature will initially increase rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions (greater proportion of reactants will have the minimum activation energy). Optimum temperature for most enzymes is ca. 40C. Above this temperature enzymes rapidly denature.

'''Transcription:''' Copying of DNA onto a strand of RNA by unwinding temporarily due to the action of RNA polymerase. Takes place in nucleus.

'''Translation:''' The reading of the base sequence of the mRNA by ribosomes to make a sequence of aa’s to form a polypeptide.

'''Triplet code:''' A sequence of three bases that represents one aa.

'''tRNA:''' RNA that brings the right aa’s to the ribosomes.

'''Vmax:''' The maximum rate at which enzyme activity can occur, given a constant enzyme concentration. This is when the active sites of the enzyme are saturated.


==Option D – Medicine and Drugs - SL==

'''Addiction:''' Problem with opiates, in which a dependency on a drug is created.

'''Adrenaline:''' A naturally occurring hormone and stimulant. Released during stress. Responses: 
* Increased pulse; 
* dilation of pupils; 
* sweating; 
* diversion of blood to muscles; 
* decreased blood clotting time. Fat insoluble. Both amphetamine and adrenaline are based on the framework of a benzene ring with a two carbon chain and an amine (NH2 or NH) group at the end.

'''AIDS:''' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Develops from HIV.

'''Alginates:''' Often combined with antacids. Prevent acid in stomach from rising into esophagus and causing ‘heartburn.’

'''Amine:''' Primary amines have one R group attached to N atom. Secondary have two on at least one N atom. Tertiary have three on at least one N atom.

'''Amphetamine:''' Fat soluble molecule which mimics noradrenaline. Similarity is so strong that it can replace noradrenaline in its storage sites, resulting in a flood of displaced noradrenaline molecules that bind to other neural proteins and set of a number of signals  euphoria.

'''Analgesic, mild:''' Have triad of properties: 
			1) analgesic (pain relief); 
			2)antipyretic (fever reduction); 
			3) anti-inflammatory (reduces swelling). Believed that they work by blocking synthesis of prostaglandins.

'''Analgesic, strong:''' Analgesics that bind with specific chemical receptors in brain that receive pain messages  stopping the transmission of pain. They are almost all related to morphine. Family is called the opium alkaloids.

'''Analgesic:''' A drug which relieves pain without the aid of sleep. Two types: 
			1) mild; 
			2)strong.

'''Antacids:''' Bases that neutralize excess acid. They are just barely soluble  neutralize gradually. 

'''Antibiotics, broad spectrum:''' Antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of bacteria. This is initially prescribed until the specific diagnosis is found.

'''Antibiotics, narrow spectrum:''' Antibiotics only effective against certain types of bacteria. Prescribed once the specific diagnosis is found.

'''Anti-coagulant:''' Has blood-thinning properties.

'''Antivirals:''' Three possible approaches:

			2) Retrovirus inhibitor (inhibits RNA from acting as a template for DNA replication); 
			3) blunting (preventing escape of new viruses by inhibiting neuraminidase enzyme which cuts open cell membrane).

'''Aspirin:''' Derived from salicylic acid, which was unpleasant to use due to its acidity. The phenol group is substituted with an acetyl group in aspirin, but it is still acidic due to its alkanoic acid group. Has anti-coagulant properties, but there can be allergic reactions to it and it can induce Reye’s Syndrome in children, a potentially fatal liver and brain disorder.

'''Benzodiazepenes:''' Class of depressants, including valium, prozac and mogadon. Benzodiazepenes work on chemical receptors in brain by binding to a special protein at the synapse of nerve junctions, causing gap between nerves to widen  prevents nerve cell from producing signal. The ethanol works on a different part of the same protein. The synergistic effect of these two working together can result in neural shutdown.

'''Blood-brain barrier:''' Can only by passed by fat soluble molecules.

'''Caffeine:''' A tertiary amine. Can 
			1) promote mild dependence; 
			2) act as a mild diuretic; 
			3) increase anxiety (when taken in excess); 
			4) cause insomnia. Known as respiratory stimulant, as it increases rate of respiration, by blocking inhibition of ATP. It does so by mimicking the shape of the ATP and causes the inhibiting enzyme to bind to it instead.

'''Cephalosporins:''' Variants of penicillin created to overcome the action of penicillinases. Broad spectrum antibiotics.

'''CNS:''' Central Nervous System.

'''Codeine:''' Derived from morphine by replacing H in one of alcohol groups with methyl group.

			2)Rectal (efficient, cultural biases); 
			3) inhalation (drug can only be absorbed through lungs); 
			4) Parenteral (see PARENTERAL); 
			5) Patches (absorbed directly through skin barrier, allow absorption to take place gradually).

'''Drug development:''' A disease is selected, and targets along the disease process are identified, which may be vulnerable to interference by a drug. Lead molecules are considered, and selected according to the drugs which seem most effective, easiest to manufacture, have an advantage over existing drugs and are profitable. Phase I trials assess toxicology of drug. Phase II trials are clinical; the efficacy and dosage are determined. Phase III trials give the drug to thousands of closely monitored patients. If approved at this stage, drug is launched, after which comes the Phase IV trials, which is the post-launch monitoring of drug, which may lead to product extension.

			1) body mass; 
			2) tolerance.

'''Gas chromatography:''' Test for ethanol. Under pressure, sample can be passed through thin tube containing inert material. Components of sample separate and can be identified.

'''Heroin:''' Derived from morphine by replacing H’s from both alcohol groups with acetyl (-COCH3) groups. More soluble in fatty tissue due to removal of both -OH groups.

'''HIV:''' Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Specific proteins on HIV bind to receptor protein on certain WBC’s called T cells. Quick mutation.

'''In vitro:''' Testing potency of molecule and selectivity; done in a laboratory environment.

'''In vivo:''' Meaning “in life.” Tests conducted in living species, to test for side effects and the effect of the body on the drug.

			1) constipation; 
			2) loss of sex drive; 
			3)  social problems (e.g. theft, prostitution, etc).

'''Paracetamol:''' Has none of the side effects of aspirin given that the correct does is used. If doses are exceeded, it can induce massive liver damage. Acetaminophen.

'''Parenteral:''' Administering drugs by injection. Can be administered locally  reducing dose necessary and also possibility that body will alter molecular structure. Often required medically trained staff to administer. Three types: 
			1)intravenous (bypasses digestive system, quick arrival; still spreads out dose); 
			2) subcutaneous (directly into body fat – only for fat soluble molecules); 
			3)intramuscular (into muscle tissue).

'''Pathogen:''' Organism or virus that causes disease.

'''Penicillin:''' Discovered by Alexander Fleming, who noticed that some of the bacteria in his petri dish had died off after some foreign appearance. Prevent cell walls from being made in bacteria; does not affect mammalian cells or viruses as they do not have a cell wall  selectively toxic. [Relatively] narrow spectrum antibiotic.

'''Penicillinases:''' New enzymes produced by bacteria to counter the action of penicillin. Degrade penicillin molecule.

'''Physiological state:''' Includes consciousness, activity level and co-ordination.

'''Placebo effect:''' A drug with no chemical effects. Used to test brain’s ability to influence physiology and to test the efficacy of new drugs. 

'''Prostaglandins:''' Local action hormones which have a range of functions in body. One of these may be pyrogenic (raise body temperature). Also responsible for altering of signals across synapse junctions of nerves. Mild analgesics are believed to work by blocking the synthesis of these prostaglandins.

'''Retrovirus:''' Virus that contains RNA instead of DNA.
Selective toxicity:''' The process of inhibiting processes vital to the pathogen, but absent in the host (see PENICILLIN).

'''Side effects:''' Unwanted effects of a drug. Risk-to-benefit ratio has to be considered. Thalidomide had an unacceptable ratio, while chemotherapy – causing hair loss and nausea – still has life-saving potential.

'''Stimulant:''' Drugs that increase a person’s state of mental alertness.

'''Sympathomimetic amine:''' Amines which mimic chemical behavior of hormones of the CNS.

'''Synergistic effect:''' Creating a cumulative effect greater than the sum of each individual effect. Benzodiazepenes have synergistic effect with ethanol. Ethanol also has synergistic effect with aspirin (may cause stomach bleeding).

'''Thalidomide:''' Morning sickness drug sold in many countries (1958-1962) until severe side-effects were discovered. Early clinical trials had shown no problems. Later withdrawn, but many children had been born with absent or malformed limbs (phocomelia). Currently used for treatment of some cancers, leprosy and other conditions where its inhibition of blood vessel formation is beneficial.

'''Tolerance:''' The body’s adaptation to the action of a drug, resulting in a requirement for larger doses to achieve original effect.

'''Toxicology:''' Poisonous effect of drug.

'''Trial, blind:''' A trial of drugs where half of the patients are given the real drug and the other half a placebo. The administering doctors know which patient receives which drug.

'''Trial, double blind:''' Similar to blind trial except that neither the administering doctor nor the patient knows which patient receives which drug.

'''Virus:''' Contains DNA but cannot replicate by itself. Works by sticking to the outside of a cell, and inject its own DNA, effectively causing cell to replicate the virus for it. New viruses break through cell and infect other cells. All viruses have a central core of DNA or RNA surrounded by a capsid of regularly packed protein units (capsomeres). Have no nucleus or cytoplasm.

==Option D – Medicine and Drugs - HL==

'''Anesthetic, general:''' An anesthetic that renders the patient unconscious so that they can feel no pain. First anesthetic to be used was ether. This was highly inflammable, so later chloroform and nitrous oxide (laughing gas) was used. Chloroform was found to possibly lead to liver damage, while nitrous oxide was not very efficient. Objectives for anesthetic: 
			1) able to put patient to sleep; 
			2) non-toxic; 
			3) non-inflammable; 
			4) volatile; 
			5) stable. 
		Halothane was found to satisfy these requirements, but it is a CFC, which can cause damage to ozone layer.

'''Anesthetic, local:''' An anesthetic that blocks pain in a specific area without affecting overall level of consciousness.

'''Cannabis, arguments for/against:''' 		1) Cannabis addictive: contested. 
			2) May lead to harder drugs. 
			3) Toxic. 
			4) If cannabis legalized  demands to legalize other drugs. 
			5) Should be legalized to remove profits from criminals. 
			6) Ensure correct dosage.

'''Chiral auxiliary:''' The main component of a technique used to obtain only a desired enantiomer. Attaching an auxiliary which is itself optically active creates the stereochemical conditions for the reaction to form only one enantiomer.

'''Cisplatin:''' Cis form of a chemical which is highly effective in the treatment of testicular and ovarian cancers. Transplatin is not as effective an anti-cancer drug. Causes alteration in the cancer cell’s DNA  cannot replicate properly.

'''Cocaine:''' First anesthetic to be used. Work by suppressing nerve transmissions. Side effects: 
			1) anxiety; 
			2) nausea; 
			3) headaches; 
			4) possible coma/death.

'''Combinatorial library:''' A technique to form a library of combinations of aa or other types of active molecules, by use of mix and split process.

'''Form, cis-:''' Geometric isomer where the similar groups are on the same side.

'''Form, trans-:''' Geometric isomer where the similar groups are on different sides.

'''Hallucination:''' Distortions in sound and visual perceptions.

'''Hallucinogen:''' Causing hallucinations.

'''Indole ring structure:''' A common structure in many hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and psylocybin.

'''Isomers, geometric:''' Stereoisomerism where the isomers differ in positions of a group relative to the double bond.

'''LSD:''' Does not occur naturally. Believed to work by blocking serotonin, one of the compounds responsible for transmitting impulses across synapses in brain. 
		Short term effects: 
			1) restlessness; 
			2) dizziness; 
			3) hallucinations. 
		Long term effects: 
			1) severe depression; 
			2) recurrences of LSD effects (flashbacks).

'''Marijuana:''' Cannabis when dried. Not based on indole ring. Causes feeling of relaxation and enhanced auditory and visual perception. Synergistic effect with depressants. 
		Long term effects: 
			1) apathy; 
			2) lethargy (state of sluggishness); 
			3) reduced fertility.

'''Mescaline:''' One of oldest known hallucinogens. Causes hallucinations, and decrease in appetite. Synergistic effect with alcohol.

'''Mix and split:''' Coupling resulting in a combination of active molecules. Gives all permutations possible.

'''Partial pressure:''' The pressure a gas would exert if it occupied the total volume on its own. Found by mole fraction of gas multiplied by total pressure.

'''Procaine and lidocaine:''' Derivatives of cocaine.

'''Psilocybin:''' Mildly hallucinogenic. Tolerance may develop but it is not addictive. Biggest danger lies in inability to recognize “magic mushrooms” correctly; similar looking fungi are poisonous.

'''Racemic mixture:''' A mixture containing equal amounts of both enantiomers.

'''Thalidomide:''' One enantiomer helped against morning sickness, while the other was responsible for causing fetal deformities.

'''Virtual library:''' Modeling permutations virtually.

----
'''Software'''

Software is the set of instructions that tell a computer what it needs to do.
----

There are two kinds of software: the '''System Software''' which includes the Operating System and '''Applications Software'''.

----
'''Operating System'''

Abbreviated OS, the Operating System is the resource manager which transforms sectors, bytes, interrupts and ports into files, folders, processes, and the user-interfaces with which you can interact.  Examples include: Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista, or 7), any flavor of Linux, and Mac OS X (An apple version of Unix).
----
'''Applications Software'''

Also called user programs, pieces of applications software do the specific things you want.
----

The Operating System runs the computer and the Applications Software.  It makes sure that the Hardware and the Applications Software understand each other.  This makes it the most important piece of software on the computer.  The Operating System also comes with '''utilities'''.  These are pieces of Applications Software that mostly deal with managing data.  You can also buy '''Third Party''' utilities, which means a different company made them than made the Operating System.

----
'''Utilities'''
Programs that manage, repair, and optimize data on a computer.  A basic set comes with every OS.
----

Applications Software does the specific things you want the computer to do, Whereas the Operating System is general instructions to the computer for controlling the Hardware, Applications Software is specific instructions that work together with the Operating System to do work for you.

There are as many different kinds of Applications Software as there are things you could want to do with a computer, however the most common are '''word processing''', '''spreadsheet''', '''presentation''', and '''database''' software and all computer games.  Word processing software is used to create '''documents''', which are formatted pages of text, such as letters, memos, reports or essays.  Spreadsheet software organizes data, usually numbers, into columns and rows.  It is used mostly for accounting and has many features for doing mathematical operations.  Presentation software is used to make '''virtual''' (or, simulated) slide shows and usually have all sorts of exciting features for animations and sounds that you just can’t do in a normal slide show.  Database software is an advanced way of organizing complicated information in simple formats. A database is your electronic filing cabinet.

Most computers come pre-installed with an OS called '''Microsoft® Windows®'''.  Most OS's and programs have the same features whether they use Windows or not, but all computers running Windows will have these features with these names.  The thing we did in the last chapter with the box that comes up when you turn on your computer is called '''logging in'''.  The screen you see after logging in is called the '''Desktop'''.  Most things on a computer are named after things in real life, and they are usually used similarly too.  Just like a real desktop the desktop on a computer is where you go to access all your data. However, a real desktop has a flat horizontal surface.

You can replace the Operating System with another whether or not your system gets a virus.  The most common replacement Operating System is called Linux.  It is free to download and install and software for it is freely available via the Internet.

----
'''Desktop'''
The desktop is the area that appears right after logging in.  It contains a background picture (wallpaper),icons and the taskbar.
----

On the desktop are pictures with text labels under them, these pictures are called '''icons''' because they represent something else.  If you move or get rid of an icon, all that means is that you have to access what they represent a different way, you haven’t gotten rid of the application software the icon is representing.  Icons usually represent programs, but sometimes they represent collections of data.  '''Double-clicking''' (clicking twice in rapid succession) on one of these icons will open whatever it represents, the text tells you what it represents.

----
'''Icons'''
A tiny picture that represents a program, folder, or program function.
----

There is a bar that is usually at the bottom of the desktop, however it may also be on any other side.  If you cannot see it, then move the cursor to the edge where it is and it will come up.  It is called the '''task-bar'''.

----
'''Taskbar'''
The taskbar is the bar along one side of the desktop.  It is used for launching programs or opening the window of an open program.
----

Along the main part of the task-bar is a list of all open programs, clicking on one element of this list will put that program’s '''window''' (the box that a program is viewed in) on top of all other open windows.  Over on one side of the task-bar is a clock; beside the clock are a bunch of icons that represent open ‘invisible’ programs.  These are programs that are always running and do things ‘behind the scenes’.  This area is called the '''system tray'''.  On the main part of the task-bar there is sometimes a small group of icons, this is called the '''quick-launch bar'''.  Clicking on one of these icons opens whatever it represents.

----
'''System Tray'''
The system tray holds icons for programs currently running ‘behind-the-scenes’.
----

On the opposite side of the task-bar from the clock and the system tray is a button.  A '''button''' (or '''command button''') is just like a real button, when it is pushed (clicked) it does something.  Some buttons have text on them that say what they do, and some have icons representing what they do.  Some have both.

----
'''(Command) Buttons'''
Buttons do something when you click on them.  They may be labeled by text, an icon, or both.
----

The quick-launch icons are also buttons.  Some buttons are raised to look like real buttons and some only raise up when you '''hover''' (put the cursor on top of) them.  The button on the other side of the start-bar from the clock and system tray is called the '''start-button'''.  When you click the start-button it opens the '''start-menu'''.  The start-menu has icons for more programs and data collections, although it is usually programs.

----
'''Start button'''
The Start button is a button that opens the start-menu.
----
'''Start menu'''
The Start menu contains icons for all installed programs and data collections, usually for programs.
----

The icons that are on the desktop, the quick-launch bar, and the start-menu are usually '''shortcuts'''.  On the desktop shortcuts are often indicated by a small symbol on top of the icon ([[Image:WindowsShortcutArrow.png||30px]]).  Shortcuts are what I meant earlier when I said ‘if you move or get rid of an icon, all that means is that you have to access what they represent a different way, you haven’t gotten rid of the actual thing’.  Icons represent all data collections and programs even if they are not shortcuts, however normally the ones on the desktop and in the start-menu are shortcuts.

----
'''Shortcuts'''
Icons that are only links to the things those icons represent.
----

The difference between icons and shortcuts is important so be sure you understand it.  An icon is any picture that is meant to convey what something is.  The icon on the start-button represents the fact that it is a major part of Windows, which is why it is a Windows logo.  Shortcuts are a link to a program or data collection; the icon on a shortcut represents whatever the shortcut opens, however the same icon would be on the real thing as well.  A Venn Diagram can maybe better show this, see Figure 2.2.

You open whatever is linked to by each shortcut on the start-menu by clicking on it.  If any icon has a right-arrow beside it, then hovering over it or clicking on it will make a '''sub-menu''' (a menu inside a menu) come out with more shortcuts on it.

Everything we just talked about is part of the Windows '''interface'''.  An interface is just anything that goes between two or more things.  This interface goes between you and the computer, you could also say that the Operating System is the interface between the hardware and software.

----
'''Interface'''
An interface, just as the name suggests, is anything that acts as or creates a medium of interaction or communication between multiple things. A '''user-interface''' is the means of interaction between (you)the user and the computer.
----

There are some standard things that are on most user-interfaces.  We have already talked about one, buttons.  These things are called '''controls'''.  Below is a table of some of the more common controls, starting with buttons:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
| Name of control and picture || Description
|-
| (Command) Button [[Image:UI-Button.png|30px]] || Buttons (also called command buttons) do something when clicked.
|-
| Check box [[Image:UI-Checkbox.png|30px]] || A check box turns something on or off.  There is a check in the box if it is on, to change it click on it.
|-
| Text box [[Image:UI-Textbox.png|30px]] || Also called edit boxes, these boxes let you type text in them.
|-
| Radio button || Also called option buttons, these boxes come in groups, you can only pick one per group.
|-
| List box || These boxes contain lists of things: you can select one.
|-
| Combo box || Also called drop-down boxes, these boxes are like text boxes, but they have a button on the side that, when clicked, brings up a list of things that you can pick from.
|-
| Spin button || These buttons increase or decrease numerical values by one when the up or down arrow half is clicked.
|-
| Scroll bar || Click on the arrows at the top and bottom of these bars to move the screen, you can also drag the box that is on the bar.
|-
| Label || Often overlooked, labels don’t do anything, but they sit near other controls with text in them to tell you what those things are.
|}

You can get a basic description of what any control does by hovering your mouse over it.  A little thing with text will pop up.  This is called a '''tool-tip''' (or a '''ToolTip''').

Besides these there are also '''menu'''s.  Menus all operate the same way as the start-menu.  Some of them are found at the tops of programs.  These are called '''main-menus''' or simply menus.  Other menus are opened by '''right-clicking''' (pushing the right mouse button over something).  These are called '''popup-menus'''.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This book is intended to be a basic introcuction to Computers for newbies, focusing on Windows simply because that is the most common Operating System.  The initial content is adapted from a textbook I wrote to teach a course at a local school where I live, it is my own content and has never been published and thus would be under my copyright, so I have the right to release it as I choose and am relicensing it here as per Wikibook's licensing restrictions. Vocabulary/Glossary words on the subpages are currently in bold and should eventually be links to their section of the (as yet nonexistant) glossary or to Wiktionary. --[[User:Singpolyma|Singpolyma]] 13:33, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
:While this is meant to be a general introduction to computing, the focus on a particular OS is necessary.  The attempt has been made to keep the instructions compatable with Windows 9x ''and'' XP both, however in an attempt to keep things simple this often led to confusing wordings in the text.  This needs to be remedied, especially in light of the forthcoming Windows Vista which will add yet another dimension to the text. -- [[User:Singpolyma|Singpolyma]] 13:55, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
::As this book is focused on computer beginners, wouldnt it be better to not worry so much about compatability with the Win9x kernel series? WinNT kernel has been the standard for a few years now, and no new versions of Win9x are even in development. Tricky wording can be reduced by removing all information from past Windows versions into an appendix. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 14:03, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
:::I suppose that's true.  Originally compatability was maintained (in my 'initial' copy) because at the school I taught at all the computers run Win 9x.  However most computer beginners would be using WinXP (or Vista, soon), so I suppose that the text should probably be reworked to focus on those and then maybe and introductory note somewhere stating that the important things different in operating older versions of Windows are in an appendix. -- [[User:Singpolyma|Singpolyma]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Singpolyma|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Singpolyma|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:15, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

==TOC on main page==
I moved the TOC to the main page for user conveniance, a seperate TOC page is not really needed at this point. --[[User:Singpolyma|Singpolyma]] 10:14, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

== TOC as template ==

the TOC actually makes more sense as a template, so that's what it is now -- [[User:Singpolyma|Singpolyma]] 12:19, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

== Computers for Beginners ==

How does this differ from the book that already exists, [[Computers for Beginners]]? --[[User:68.148.190.38|68.148.190.38]] 04:20, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

==System Maintance ==
How about a system maintance section; basics such as:
Defrag, cleaning temp files, etc.

== Security ==
Either in this book or in [[Computers for Beginners]], would it be a good idea to include a chapter on security? Anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-rootkit, the need to keep secuity software signature files up to date, software firewalls, Microsoft security updates, the common email scams, phishing attacks, etc?

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are no 'real' layers though; you can’t peel off the wallpaper and see the Desktop! However there are ‘virtual’ layers, arranged with the Desktop on the bottom.  What you see behind the icons on the Desktop is called the '''wallpaper''', whereas the whole thing is the Desktop, not just the picture/colour that you see behind the icons.  Application windows are layered on top.

You can add shortcuts to your Desktop in a number of ways.  The most common way is to right-click on the desktop, which brings up the popup-menu.  On the popup-menu there should be a sub-menu labelled ‘New’, hover over this.  When the sub-menu pops out find the item labelled ‘Shortcut’ and click it.  A dialogue-box will come up asking you where the program or data collection is found.  Later we will get into how to form something to type in the box, however it is easier to just click the button beside labelled ‘Browse...’.

The '''Browse button''' is a standard button that you will see often, clicking it always brings up a dialogue-box in which you can select programs and data collections.  Select the program or data collection you want to make a shortcut to and click the button labelled ‘OK’.  The '''OK button''' is also a standard button on dialogue-boxes that you click to tell it that you are done filling in information and it can use that data now.  ‘OK’ is usually paired with ‘Cancel’, ‘Cancel’ closes the dialogue-box without doing anything.

When you have selected the correct program or data collection click the button marked ‘Next &gt;’.  The '''Next button''' is, again, a standard button that tells the dialogue box you are done this step and to go on to the next step in the process.  It usually comes with the '''Back button''' to go to the previous step.  This dialogue-box also has a '''Cancel button'''.  After you have clicked ‘Next’ the dialogue-box comes up with a text-box asking what you want the text under the icon to be for this shortcut.  When you have typed what you want into the box click ‘Finish’, another standard button.

----
'''NOTE:'''  The true name of these buttons is above in bold.  However it is common computer shorthand to say Click ‘OK’ instead of Click the OK button.  We will be using this shorthand in this book.
----

If you do not like the text under a shortcut, you can change it.  There are three primary ways to do this.  The first one is to click on the shortcut, '''selecting''' it, and then push the ‘F2’ key on your keyboard.  The text will become a text-box that you can type in to change what it says.  The second way is to right-click on the shortcut, bringing up its popup-menu, and select ‘Rename’ from the popup-menu.  The same thing will happen.  Another way to cause it to happen is to select the icon and then click on it.  Do not double-click!  That will open whatever it links to, select it and then click.

If you want to change the icon (picture) one your shortcut, bring up its popup-menu and select ‘Properties’.  Across the top of the window, just below the bar with the ‘X’ button on it (the '''title bar'''), there are a bunch of '''tabs''', click the one labelled ‘Shortcut’.  Then, click the button labelled ‘Change Icon…’, in the dialogue-box that comes up select the new icon that you want, or click ‘Browse’ to find more files with icons.  In this same window where the ‘Change Icon’ button is, there is a text-box labelled ‘Target:’.  It is the same as the box with a Browse button on the first step of adding a shortcut to the Desktop, only there is no browse button.  That it what you change if you want the shortcut to link to something else.

You can also move or sort icons on the Desktop.  To sort them right-click on the Desktop and hover over the sub-menu called ‘Arrange Icons By’.  Then click on the way you want them sorted.  If you want them automatically sorted make sure the ‘Auto Arrange’ option is checked (you can check or uncheck it by clicking on it).  If you have Auto Arrange off, you can put the icons wherever you want them.  Click on one and don’t let the button go back up.  Move the cursor over to where you want the icon to be and it will move right along with it.  When you have it where you want it, let go of the mouse button.  This is called '''dragging-and-dropping'''.

If you want to take an icon off the desktop there are three major ways to do it.  You can select the icon you want to remove and push the ‘Delete’ key on your keyboard.  A dialogue-box will come up, click ‘Yes’.  You can also drag-and-drop the icon onto the '''recycle bin''', which is an icon on the Desktop labelled exactly that.  Or you can right-click on the icon and click ‘Delete’.  The same dialogue-box will come up for you to click ‘Yes’ on.  If you did it by accident you can click ‘No’ and it won’t remove the icon.

There are other settings you can change on the Desktop.  To access them right-click on the Desktop and select ‘Properties’ from the popup-menu.  To change the wallpaper select the tab labelled ‘Wallpaper’ or ‘Desktop’.  To change what picture is displayed for wallpaper select it from the list or if it is not in the list click ‘Browse…’.  There is a combo box from which you can select whether to stretch, '''tile''' (repeat by picture with itself together likes tiles), or centre the picture.  If you just want a colour for your wallpaper, then select ‘(None)’ from the list.  Sometimes there is a combo-type box to select the colour right there and sometimes you have to change it under the ‘Appearance’ tab.

You can also change the '''Screen-Saver'''.  The Screen-Saver is a program that shows up after your computer has not been used for so long so that the monitor will not get wrecked (which can happen if the same picture is displayed on it for hours at a time).  To change the Screen-Saver click the tab labelled ‘Screen-Saver’.  There will be a combo box that lists all the Screen-Savers on your computer.  After you have selected the one you want you can change how long the computer waits before bringing it up in the text box with a spin button that is below the combo box.

You can also change the colour scheme of all the controls in almost all programs.  Click the ‘Appearance’ tab.  There is one or more combo boxes on this page that allow you to select different combinations of default colour schemes.  On this same page, or sometimes you have to click ‘Advanced’ to get there, are other settings.  You can select an element from one combo box, and then change it’s colour and how its text looks.  You can try experimenting with this if you want, just be sure to save your current settings so you can change back (which some versions of windows don’t allow, so don’t worry then).  You do this by clicking the ‘Save As…’ button and typing the name you want to call the colour scheme.

There is one final tab common to most versions of Windows.   It is the ‘Settings’ tab.  It is not recommended to change settings in this tab unless you know what you are doing.  Some games will give errors when you try to start them like ‘256 colours required’ or ‘This program needs 640 × 480 to run’.  This is where you set those.  There is a combo box here, selecting a different option from this box changes the number of colours your computer can display.  More colours mean more quality.  There is also a '''slider''' labelled ‘Screen resolution’.  It increases or decreases the size of everything displayed on your monitor.  The larger the numbers, the smaller things are, and the smaller things are the more you can fit.  When this is set to make things smaller, some programs (or you can manually) change their stuff so that it looks the same size, allowing them to have more quality in display.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Basic Computing Using Windows/Table of Contents}}

Before we get into anything else we need a basic understanding of how a computer stores data.  Inside the computer box there are many different pieces of hardware used for storing data.
== Memory ==
One of these is the '''memory'''.  A Computer’s memory is where it stores the data that is currently in use.  So, for example, when you have a letter open and are looking at or working on it the computer stores it in memory.  All the software currently running is stored in memory too. 
=== RAM(Random Access Memory) ===
This kind of memory is called '''RAM''' ('''Random-Access Memory''').  Random-access means that any part of the information may be read or changed randomly, the computer does not have to look through all the data in order so that it can find the right piece. The disadvantage of RAM is that if power goes off , the data is gone. 
=== ROM(Read only memory) ===
There is another kind of memory called '''ROM''' ('''Read-Only Memory''').  '''Read-only''' means that the data on it cannot be changed.  ROM is used to store basic information that every computer needs.

== Disks ==
When a computer is turned off, everything in RAM is erased.  Because this would cause you to lose your work all the time, '''disks''' were created.  Disks are round flat objects, but in computer slang they are pieces of data storage hardware that do not need electricity to keep the data stored.  There are other things that do this that are not disks, however the things inside of all things called disks are round and flat, so that is how the term came to be.  All disks need to be in another piece of hardware that acts as an interface between them and the rest of the computer called a '''drive'''.There are two main kinds of disks: '''Magnetic''' and '''Optical'''.
=== Magnetic===
Magnetic disks are the old kind and are slowly being replaced by flash systems(like SSD).  They store data by aligning little pieces of metal inside differently using a magnet.  Because of the way they store data magnetic disks can be erased or completely destroyed by magnets, heat, and dust. The two most popular forms of magnetic disks are '''Hard Disks''' and '''Floppy Disks'''. 
==== Hard Disk Drive(HDD)====
Hard disks are stored permanently inside their drive, which is normally installed into the computer box where you cannot see any part of it.  Hard Disks can store a lot of data, and are used to store most of the information on computers. The advantage of HDD is cost and capacity. The disadvantage of HDD is that they create noise , are slow and prone to failure. They are slowly being replaced by solid state drives(SSD).
==== Floppy Disk Drive(FDD)
Floppy disks are small disks that you can pop in and out of their drive.  All you can see of their drive is a slit in the computer box with a button and a light.  You can put in different disks and then take them out and give them to someone so that you can transfer data between your computers. FDD's are now obsolete. They can store only about 1.44 MB , which is way too little. They are prone to damage and are now unsupported now for many years.
=== Optical ===
==== Compact disk(CD) ====
The most popular kind of optical disk is the '''Compact Disc''' ('''CD''').  CDs can still be put into and taken out of their drive, making them good for buying programs on, and nowadays for transferring data.  Normal CDs that you buy with programs on them are '''CD-ROM'''s.  They are called that because, like ROM, they are read-only.  You can also get '''CD-R'''s and '''CD-RW'''s, which are not read-only and are not erasable and erasable, respectively. However , CD-R cannot be deleted once it is written(a process known as finalizing). CDs can store around 700MB.  And, because CDs store their information with variations in the shape of the disk that reflects a laser differently they cannot be damaged as easily. However, you should still never touch the shiny surface of the CD. CD's are now being replaced by online media , and do not feature in many new computers anymore.
==== DVD ====
'''Digital Versatile Discs''' ('''DVD'''s) are another kind of Optical disc that work identically to CDs, however they can store much more information than CD's can. DVD's can store usually about 4.3 GB , but dual-layered DVD's can store up to about 9 GB and DVD-RAM can store about the same amount. They are sometimes called Digital Video Discs because of their extensive use in video and films.
=== Flash memory ===
Today you can also get memory cards that are called '''flash memory''' or, more properly, '''EEPROM'''s.  These are cards that operate just like ROM that isn’t read-only, so they don’t lose their information when the power is cut.
==== SSD(Solid State disks) ====
SSD's are based on flash memory. They are much quicker than HDD's , do not make much noise and heat , but they are costlier than HDD's , but the cost of SSD's are rapidly declining. Another concern with SSD's is that the cells on the SSD can last only up to a specific number of write cycles. However , they are not of much concern to home users , as SSD's utilize features such as TRIM to extend lifespan. The lifespan of the SSD will usually be mentioned , which could be anywhere between 30 - 150 TB , which is more than the average lifespan of the computer.

Note that defragmentation is not required on a SSD and actually not recommended , as they will not give much benefit and with reduce the lifespan instead.

== Files and folders ==
All data on a computer is stored in collections called '''file'''s and '''folder'''s.  
=== Files ===
Files are the most basic data collections, they store the data for a single thing. A file is the most basic collection of data on a computer.  A file can store the instructions for a single program, or the data for a single letter.  Folders are collections of files.  So a file is like a piece of paper and you put it in a folder.
=== Folders ===
Also called directories, folders are collections of files.
=== Sorting files===
It is very necessary to sort files properly into folders so that you can find them again.  Many people have had to redo entire projects because they lost their file by putting it into the wrong folder. We'll be looking at this as we go on.
=== File extension ===
Most files are named with two parts.  The first part of the filename is a description of the file.  After this comes a ‘.’ followed by the second part.  The second part of a filename is called the '''extension'''.  Extensions are often three letters long and they tell you what kind of file it is.  For example ‘exe’ files (files with an extension of ‘exe’) are programs.  ‘Doc’ files are Microsoft Word documents.

Note that since Windows hides the main extension by default, hackers and spammers can use this to their advantage. For instance , a spammer could send you an e-mail inviting you to open a PDF file whose filename is 'Test.pdf' and that's what you see. But in fact , it could be 'Test.jpg.exe' and clicking the file could open up viruses. You can force Windows to show all file extensions by going to Folder Options.
=== Windows Explorer ===
Besides '''saving''' (taking a file you have open in a program and writing it from memory onto a disk) there are many other file operations.  These can all be done using the same program.  This program is a utility called a '''file manager'''.  There is a file manager that comes with Windows called '''Windows Explorer''', or sometimes just Explorer.  To open Explorer go to ‘Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;Windows Explorer’ or Right Click Start, Click Explore, and the Directory should show. Yet in Windows XP, You go ‘Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Windows Explorer’.

Sometimes Explorer will start you off looking at your ‘My Documents’ folder, and sometimes it will start you off looking at drive C (C:). There are some basic parts of Windows Explorer.

#The title bar
#The main menu. Below the menu is the '''toolbar'''.
#The icon representing a folder.
#The icon representing a hard disk, also called hard drive, because the disks and the drive are in one, sealed, box, (this one is called ‘C:’, all drives have a letter).  
#The icon representing a file(6) is what you click to view sub-folders.

So, if there isn’t a '''tree''' (the part in the circle) below your hard drive (which should be the icon in the left-hand '''pane''', the part in the square, and should have a name followed by ‘(C:)’ as seen above with (4)) then click the ‘+’ (6) beside it.  This is a lot of new stuff so it may be a little bit confusing.

Now we have a tree open below our hard drive showing us all the folders that are directly in the '''root''' of the hard drive.  Now should be a good time to look at the standard conventions for drives and '''path'''s.  As you can see above, the '''drive letter''' is always is brackets after the name of a drive.  The first (or only) floppy drive is almost always ‘A:’.  If you have a second floppy drive it will be ‘B:’.  Your first hard drive is ‘C:’ and your CD drive is ‘D:’.  If you have more hard drives the other drives change accordingly (i.e. if you have a second hard drive that is ‘D:’ and your CD drive will become ‘E:’).  You can have folders inside folders as well as files, and the drive itself acts like a folder.  So if you wanted to designate a file called ‘Letter.rtf’ that is in the folder ‘My Documents’ and that folder is found in the root of the hard drive ‘C:’, you separate the elements with a back-slash ‘\’ and come up with ‘C:\My Documents\Letter.rtf’.
==== Navigate ====
Navigate means to make it so you are looking at that in your file manager.  For example to navigate to ‘C:\My Documents’ you would open the tree on ‘C:’ like we did before (or by double-clicking on it in the right-hand pane).   Then you would click the icon that is labeled ‘My Documents’, or double-click on this icon in the right-hand pane (that is, the part in the octagon).

Now '''navigate''' to your ‘My Documents’ directory.  It should be found at ‘C:\My Documents’ or ‘C:\Documents and Settings\[Your Name]\My Documents’. Now, to open a file in its program, double-click on its icon in the right-hand pane. 
==== Recycle Bin ====
If you accidentally delete a file you wanted, you can open the Recycle Bin (double-click on its desktop icon) right-click on the file and select ‘restore’ from the popup-menu.  If you want to permanently get rid of all files in the Recycle Bin, right-click on the Recycle Bin and select ‘Empty Recycle Bin’ from the popup-menu.  Deleting or restoring folders works the same way.
==== Sorting your files ====
If you are going to sort your files properly into folders, you need to know how to create them.  To create a folder, navigate to the folder you want the new folder in.  Then, right-click on a blank area of the right-hand pane to bring up the popup-menu.Then select ‘New-&gt;Folder’ from the menu.  Type the name of the folder and press ‘Enter’.  To arrange file in folders, you also need to be able to '''copy''' and '''move''' both files and folders.  Moving means that the file or folder goes to the new location and is no longer in the old location.  To move a file or folder, simply drag-and-drop the file or folder from where it is in the right-hand pane on top of the folder where you want it to be in either the right or left-hand pane.  Copying means that the file or folder stays where it is, and a duplicate is created in the new location.  To copy a file or folder you '''right-drag-and-drop''' (that is, drag-and-drop by holding down the right mouse button instead of the left one) from its old location on top of the new one.  A popup-menu will come up asking if you want to copy, move, or create a shortcut to the file or folder.  If you want to copy, select ‘Copy Here’.
==== Searching ====
If you want to search the whole computer for a specific file or folder there are two possible ways to do it.  Some versions of Windows Explorer have a button on the toolbar that says ‘Find’, click on this.  In all versions of Windows you can go to ‘Start-&gt;Find-&gt;Files or Folders’ or ‘Start-&gt;Search’.  Some versions of the search have extra features to make it easier that it displays first.  To bypass these click ‘All files and folders’.  If your version came up with text boxes right away you don’t have to do this.  Once the text boxes are up you can select what drive or folder to search from the combo box.  The topmost text box is where you type all or part of the filename.  
===== Wildcard searches =====
You can also create '''wildcard searches'''.  To do this you type letters that are in the filename along with symbols called '''wildcards'''.  The wildcards are ‘*’ and ‘?’.  ‘*’ represents an infinite number of characters or nothing.  ‘?’ represents exactly one character.  So ‘?ello.doc’ would find ‘Hello.doc’ and ‘jello.doc’.  ‘Si*.*’ would find all files that start with ‘Si’.
==== File properties ====
Finally there are file properties.  Different kinds of files have different properties and different versions of Windows can have different kinds of properties allowed.  You can experiment with these if you want.  To open the properties for any file, right-click on it and select ‘Properties’.  In the window that comes up you can change all the properties of the file that can be changed.  In this window it also shows the name and location of the file and its size in bytes, kilobytes (KB, 1 024 bytes, usually estimated at 1 000 bytes), or megabytes.  It also shows the attributes, the most commonly used and useful of which is the read-only attribute.  When you check the read-only check box and click OK, Windows won’t let any program change the file.  If you uncheck the box Windows will let programs change it again. This operation can also be done using the 'attrib' command in Command Prompt.

'''Thai Green Curry''' (''Khaeng Keaw Wan'')
[[File:GreenCurry-Ikebukuro-2011.jpg|thumb|A bowl of green curry.]]

==Ingredients==
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Curry Paste|green curry paste]] (according to taste)
* 1 tbsp soft dark brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1-2 thick stalks [[Cookbook:Lemongrass|lemongrass]], fat ends bashed with a rolling pin (optional)
* 750g (1½ lb.) skinless, boneless [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], cut into chunks (use breast and/or leg meat)
* 6-8 [[Cookbook:Kaffir Lime Leaf|kaffir lime leaves]], torn into pieces (if unavailable, use the grated zest of 1 lime)
* 400ml (14 fl. oz.) [[Cookbook:Coconut Milk|coconut milk]]
* good shake of Thai [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|fish sauce]] or light [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* small handful of [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander]] (Cilantro), roughly chopped
* ½-1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]], juice only

== Procedure ==
# Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan. 
# Add the green curry paste and sugar and cook over a fairly high heat for about a minute, stirring with the lemongrass, if using. 
# Reduce the heat slightly and stir in the chicken pieces and lime leaves or zest until coated in the paste. 
# Add the coconut milk, fish sauce or soy sauce and bring to a simmer, cooking for 25-30 minutes until thickened slightly. 
# Stir in the coriander and lime juice. 
# Check for seasoning, adding more fish sauce or soy sauce if needed.

The curry is now best left to sit for a few minutes so the sauce becomes creamier. You will also taste the true flavours of the curry paste ingredients when it's slightly cooler. Serve with lots of fragrant Thai jasmine rice.

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Will.law. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Will.law~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the citation information should all be in one area instead of in 2+ places in this section. - Mindy

==Talk 1==
In reading this page, it seems to that the tone is off. For example, here's an exmaple of the diction being used: &quot;Evaluating your sources is a major component of researching. Making sure that the sources you choose are valid is a key point to making your essay more reputable. To determine the relibility of both print and internet sources there are key points to look for.&quot;

The information is accurate -- evaluating sources matters. But the diction is that of a student writer trying to sound like a textbook. So the use of the &lt;i&gt;to be&lt;/i&gt; verb dominates the sentence structure because that verb defines, and you get a sentence like, &quot;Making sure that the sources you choose &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; valid &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a key point to making your essay more reputable.&quot;

Why am I drawing attention to this? 

It seems to me the potential strength and value of a textbook written by students is the chance for students to talk to students like students. Why talk to other students trying to sound like a 45 year old writing teacher who has read too many textbooks over the years? Student writers come new to many of the ideas a textbook tries to convey. Write with that energy. Write in your own voices. Use the first person. Maybe something like this is an approach that can unstuck writers from imitating textbooks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The first time I did research for a project that I can remember was in the fourth grade. I had to write a report on spiders. I remember somewhere along the line the teacher saying that if we used something from a source, we had to quote it, but if we put that something in our own words or changed some of the souces words we didn't have to quote it. So for my report on spiders I went to the Encylopedia Britannica (Wikipedia didn't exist then.), and pretty much copied the entry on spiders, careful to change enough words --at least two or three-- in every sentence so that I didn't have to quote. 

Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway because this is a textbook, that's not how you should do research. What worked in fourth grade, what may have worked in high school in some cases, won't work in college. 

&lt;b&gt;So what is research in college writing and why does it matter?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As writers, can you find your natural voices? Can you talk to students as students? If you can, I think the book will be both easier to write, but also more useful to read. You can also imagine more inviting for other students to begin contributing too.

==Hyperlinking within the same page==

Whowever made the points about audience, etc...I think it is a great idea.  I've been playing around with the format and if anyone knows how to hyperlink from those 5 points to an area further down the page that will explain the 5 points in more detail, let me know, or please do it.

==Redundance of ADAM==
To me, the section ADAM seems to be redundant to the section above it. For instance, ''date'' in ADAM matches ''current'' in the section above. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 09:53, 6 June 2008 (UTC)

== Matt's Thoughts ==

Wow, this is a big, intimidating chapter. It seems a lot longer and involved than it needs to be. It looks like past editors have just added on text without really considering how it fits with the rest; we end up with a lot of redundancy and incoherence as a result. 

Research is such a big topic that I'd recommend being focused here strictly on college writing and the type of sources most professors expect to see: peer-reviewed journal articles, which are now usually available online through university library websites, and scholarly books. I wouldn't even bother here talking about newspapers, magazines, and general websites, since most professors wouldn't consider them acceptable sources anyway. 

It seems that this could be simply broken down into 3 processes: finding sources (focusing on library database search engines and Google Scholar), evaluating sources (maybe ADAM could come in here), and integrating them into your own writing (this could be briefly introduced and then send them to the links on citing sources and plagiarism). The division of print and web seems unnecessary, and the bit about ADAM just seems grafted on here (maybe it could be fit into the categories above). Finally, it might be worth mentioning some general note-taking strategies and tools like Evernote or Zotero.  

Again, the They Say, I Say book by Graff et al. seems relevant here. I realize we can't just imitate them everywhere, but I really like how they frame it as a conversation. Research becomes more about familiarizing yourself with a conversation than just cherry picking facts and quotations to support your personal opinion. That's also why this section comes early in the process, since students who aren't aware of the conversation aren't likely to come up with a good thesis or draft a good essay, much less have an awareness of their audience. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] ([[User talk:Mattbarton.exe|talk]]) 22:36, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

== Matt H's thoughts ==

I like the section on considering audience, although I think audience consideration is perhaps a broad enough topic to warrant its own page.

The “Evaluating Web Sources” could benefit from a brief commentary on the perceived credibility of Wikipedia as a source.

“Using and correctly citing outside sources is hugely important to the ethical portrayal of you as a writer.” – This could be rewritten, although I’m not sure how as I am not confident I sufficiently understand the sentence’s meaning to rewrite the sentence itself.

== Faith's thoughts ==

One of the things i missed in this section was field research.  Interviews, polls, and surveys are not of huge importance to English majors, but are to students studying in other fields.  An overview of this type of research might be useful.--[[User:SFaithL|SFaithL]] ([[User talk:SFaithL|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SFaithL|contribs]]) 15:37, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

== Emily's Thoughts ==

I like the idea of breaking down this section into three areas.  Visually organizing them that way can make an intimidating process look less so.  

Perhaps something could be mentioned about online searches and using synonyms?  In the age of Google, I find most of my students type in a word and if they don't find what they were looking for, they give up and go to Google.  
--[[User:Emily.isackson|Emily.isackson]] ([[User talk:Emily.isackson|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Emily.isackson|contribs]]) 20:37, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

I like the three stage approach too: choosing sources, evaluating sources (with an eye to Widipedia's potential skewed articles) and how to incorporate sources into one's writing. As Faith noted, field interviewing is legitimate for academic as well as general media writing and could be included. And as Dr. B noted, this is an hulking intimidating section.

== Karl's Thoughts ==

The section does seem to be all ove the place, and would probably benefit from a focus strictly on academic writing. I like the notion of 3 sections: Choosing sources, evaluating sources and using using sources in academic. That number is far less intimidating and would make the section easier to assimilate.</text>

=Open Sicilian with 2...Nc6=
Here Black has decided to play Nc6 instead of d6 or other moves.  If Black plays pawn to d5 later on then he has saved a tempo by not playing d6 first.

= Open Sicilian with 2...Nc6 =
Moves: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.d4

The Open Sicilian is a very popular opening.  There is a great deal of theory on the opening and it is also typically very tactical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chess/Sicilian Defence|Sicilian Defence]], .Sicilian Defence&lt;/ref&gt;  For these two reasons some people who do not play the Sicilian will avoid playing the Open Sicilian to encourage slower maneuvering instead of sharp tactics.

== What country did they live in? ==

At the start, the Romans lived in a region that now forms part of [[Wikijunior:Europe/Italy|Italy]]. Through conquest of nearby peoples, the Roman Empire expanded.  At its peak, the empire controlled most of Western Europe, North Africa, [[Wikijunior:Europe/Greece|Greece]], the Balkans, and the Middle East. The capital Rome grew from a simple village to a thriving metropolis. Even today, some 2500 years later, Rome is still a major world city.

&lt;!--At the beginning, the Romans lived in what is now Italy. They later expanded by conquering nearby peoples. At its largest, the Roman Empire controlled most of modern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. Their capital city was Rome, which grew from humble beginnings (it probably was made up of little more than a few huts on an easily-defended hill overlooking a river). Today, 2,500 years later, Rome is one of the major cities of the world.
--&gt;

== What did their buildings look like? ==
[[Image:Campitelli_-_Insula_romana_1907.JPG|thumb|200px|Remains of the top floors of an insula near the Capitolium and the Aracoeli in Rome.]]

Many public buildings built by the Romans were huge works of white marble complete with arches
and grand architecture.  The average house, by comparison, was smaller and plainer, being built of 
bricks and timber. Much of our extensive knowledge of Roman Buildings comes from ruins and remains left in the ground. &lt;!-- Trying to say archaeology in simple terms here --&gt;

&lt;!--
We know a lot about Romans, and usually think that all of their buildings were huge and made of white marble and arches. This was true for the public buildings, but the average house was much smaller and plain-looking, being made of bricks and timber. 
--&gt;

Inside a middle class home (a domus), there were many rooms, with distinct functions.
These ranged in size, from small cubicles in which they slept, through medium sized rooms in which they eat, to large halls in which they would receive and entertain guests. The rooms in the house
normally opened out onto a courtyard. Despite its often small size, the purpose of this courtyard was to provide light and air to the rooms. As well as a courtyard, most wealthy people would also have
kept a garden behind the house, in which flowers, fruit, vegetables, and even grape vines would have 
been grown.

&lt;!--
Inside a middle class home, called a domus, there were various rooms, ranging in size from very small cubicles (this word actually comes from their language: cubiculum) to sleep in, to medium-sized dining rooms, and to large halls in which to receive guests. Most rooms opened onto the courtyard, which could be quite small. Behind the house, with a few rooms opening there too, most wealthy people would have a nice garden with flowers, fruit and vegetables.
--&gt;

In the city of Rome most people lived in two or three-story apartment buildings called ''Insulae''.  Here a whole family lived in only one or two rooms, spending much of their time outside in the courtyards and streets. Water came from nearby public fountains and aqueducts.
&lt;!-- what about underfloor heating? --&gt;

The Romans also constructed many public buildings, including temples, marketplaces, forum, and amphitheaters.  These public works also included things required for city living like aqueducts and sewers.

Military building was also undertaken, the largest construction being Hadrian's Wall at the northern Fringes of the Roman Empire. Even today, the remains of these roads are still visible in Northern England.

== What did they eat? ==
Both the rich and poor ate bread and porridges made from wheat, barley and other grains. This was their main staple food. Some of the other common foods that they would have eaten were chicken and other birds, beans, lentils, walnuts, eggs, apples, cheese, milk, wine, figs, dates and grapes. 

While most of their food would be familiar to us, Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse. Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while they ate their meals.

Ancient Roman meals couldn't have included foods that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries. For instance, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.

== What did they wear? ==
[[Image:Toga Illustration-2.svg|thumb|150px|left|A Roman man wearing a toga]]People in Rome had three types of clothing. Firstly, they wore a loin cloth. This was worn like underwear. Then, over their loin cloth they would wear a tunic and women would sometimes wear two tunics. A tunic was usually made out of wool but occasionally linen. It was a loose garment that fitted over a person's head and was joined at the shoulders and sides. It would resemble a nightgown in our society. Finally, on top of a man's tunic he would wear a toga whenever he went into public, if he could afford one. Togas were large pieces of wool fabric that were wrapped all around the body. Interestingly, only Roman citizens were permitted to wear togas. It was symbol of peace because Roman soldiers also didn't wear togas. Togas were decorated in different ways to indicate rank, like a uniform. For example, a purple fringed toga indicated that the person wearing it was a leader.

Women in Rome also had an outside garment that corresponded to the male toga. It was called a stola and was also made of a large piece of fabric but it was wrapped and attached differently. Woman also wore a warm shawl called a palla when they went out.

Fashion changed as the empire progressed. Initially in Rome both men and woman wore togas but that changed fairly early in the Roman empire. Also, cloaks that were like large ponchos were first primarily used by poor people and soldiers but eventually became the standard dress for even the wealthy. Togas in that era had become purely ceremonial.

Roman men and woman also wore shoes or sandals unless they were extremely poor. They were completely made of leather, even the soles. When visiting one another they would wear them into their friend's home but remove them before eating.

== What did their writing look like? ==
[[Image:MarcianaDen(114).jpg|thumb|150px|A roman coin; note the common letters]] Romans developed what is now called the Latin alphabet for their writing. The Latin alphabet is nearly the same as the current English alphabet but originally it only consisted of capital letters. Also, the Romans didn't use a few of the letters that are a part of the modern English alphabet such as j, x and w. The Latin alphabet is the basis for most European languages.

The Romans also invented a way to write the capital letters in cursive. They didn't use punctuation the way that we do today.

Roman numbers were written with letters as well.  These are called Roman numerals.

*M = 1,000
*D = 500
*C = 100
*L = 50
*X = 10
*V = 5
*I = 1

2008 is written as MMVIII in Roman numerals.

When a smaller value followed a larger this indicated ''addition''. E.g. VI means V+I = 5+1=6. But the other way around it meant subtraction: IV means V-I = 5-1= 4.

This made it very hard to do maths with these numbers, and Arabic numbers (the ones we use today) began to be used in the Middle Ages. People found that banking and doing maths was much easier with these new number symbols.

== What did they believe? ==
The Romans, like many other ancient civilizations, were polytheistic; this means they worshiped many gods.  Each god or goddess, a female god, would be connected to a certain part of people’s life. If you were a fisherman you might pray to Neptune, the god of the sea. However if you were a warrior you would pray to Mars the god of war. All these gods and goddesses had different stories. These long stories of the gods have lived on in writings on pots and in scripts, or books, by ancient people. Most of the Roman gods were taken from the Greek culture. For example, the Roman god Neptune was considered the same as the Greek god Poseidon. Today, the names of the Roman gods are still used as names for planets! 

Romans were generally tolerant of other polytheistic religions and often adopted foreign gods into their religion including Egyptian gods. Emperors sometimes declared themselves to be descended from heroes or gods. Monotheists such as Christians, who believe in only one god, were distrusted because they refused to worship the emperors and were often persecuted.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
[[Image:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|500px|This 19th Century fresco imagines Cicero denouncing Catiline in the Senate. Cicero mentions in his first speech against Catiline that the other senators have stood up and moved away from him, leaving him alone.]]

Roman history and literature have had a strong and continuous influence on Western culture for thousands of years, so many Roman statesmen, poets, and philosophers remain famous today.

Julius Caesar is probably the most famous Roman of all time. He was a Roman military and political leader and one of the most influential men in world history. As a general, he led invasions of France and Britain. Most people in Rome thought Caesar was a hero, but his enemies said that he only cared about winning fame and power for himself. When the Senate ordered Caesar to disband his army, he was afraid of what they would do to him, so he began a civil war. Four years later, Caesar won the war and became dictator for life. A group led by Cassius and Brutus, who called themselves the Liberators, killed Caesar at a meeting of the Senate because they thought it was the only way to save the republic. However, Caesar's friends defeated the Liberators in the ensuing civil war, and the Roman Republic became the Roman Empire. Caesar is also famous for reforming the calendar and for several books he wrote about his military campaigns.

Marcus Tullius Cicero was another famous Roman statesman. Many of Cicero's books, speeches, and letters have survived, and we know more about him than any other Roman. Cicero didn't come from a noble family, but he rose rapidly in politics because of his talent for public speaking. Cicero began his career in public office as a quaestor, a low-level official who managed the finances of the state. Because the people of Sicily found him to be honest and fair, they asked him to prosecute the corrupt governor of their island. Cicero prepared for a full trial, but after his opening speech, the governor saw that there was little chance of winning against Cicero and chose to leave the country. Cicero became known as Rome's greatest public speaker, and his successful prosecution entitled him to take the governor's seat in the Senate, giving him a freedom to speak that would not normally have been available to such a young member. Cicero gave some of his most famous speeches denouncing a plan by Catiline, an impoverished nobleman, to murder Rome's ruling class and seize power by force. Cicero was called &quot;father of his country&quot; for stopping the conspiracy. After the fall of the Roman Republic, the new rulers had him killed for speaking out against them. One of Cicero's most famous books is ''On Duties'', which was considered the greatest work of moral philosophy through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. When printing was invented, it was the second book to be printed after the Bible.

Vergil has been considered Rome's greatest poet ever since his own lifetime. He was born into a wealthy family, and spent his childhood on the family farm in northern Italy before being sent to large cities for school when he was 12. Vergil moved to Rome after the government seized his family's farm and he had to go to the capital to ask for it back. There, Vergil became a favourite of the emperor and other rich and important people. Vergil's most famous work is the ''Aeneid'', a long poem about the founding of Rome that he worked on for the last 11 years of his life. When he was dying, he asked his friends to burn the draft, because he didn't want anyone to read his unfinished work. The emperor asked Vergil's friends to ignore his wishes and to prepare the poem for publication.

Another famous Roman was Pontius Pilate. He was the governor of the Roman ludaea (Judea) province from 26 AD until 36 AD. In modern times he is best known as the man who, according to the Christian Bible, presided over the trial of Jesus Christ and ordered his crucifixion.
&lt;!--
 What about the poets dramatists and philosphers?
--&gt;

== What is left of them today? ==
At its pinnacle, the Roman Empire covered much of Europe, northern Africa, and some of the Middle East. There are many different ethnicities in these regions. Some of them are the direct descendants of Roman citizens while other people and ethnicities emerged through immigration into these areas from other regions. In Rome, the capital city of the Roman Empire, there are currently Italian people who have a blend of Roman heritage and other people that emigrated to the area after the Roman Empire dissolved. 

Many modern European languages have evolved from Latin, the language of the Roman Empire. These are called Romance languages, and they include Italian, Spanish, and French. Today Romance languages are also spoken in many countries in South America and Africa.

Some other languages in Europe that didn't directly descend from Latin were influenced by it. For example, languages like English, Hungarian, and Turkish are all written with versions of the Latin alphabet, even if they had other writing systems of their own. The English language has been heavily influenced by Latin ever since 1066, when England was conquered by people who spoke French. In fact, over half of English words were borrowed from French or Latin, including ''joy'', ''charity'', ''continue'', ''army'', ''animal'', ''actor'', ''reptile'', and ''library''.

== Beauty in Ancient Rome ==
The use of cosmetics in ancient Rome was not exclusively for women. Men also used them to improve their appearance. Perfume and body waxing was acceptable for both men and women. During the Republic, men took less of an interest in their appearance so they would not be ridiculed.  However, many wore makeup, combed their hair and looked after their bodies with baths and massages.

To remove excess hair was considered too effeminate for men, but to show all body hair was considered rude for the Roman taste. Because of that, they had found a middle ground. To remove it, they used resin paste or pumice. The elderly didn't do much to improve their appearance because it would have been considered ridiculous, as was seen firstly as a preparation for romantic attraction.

For men to wear trousers was a disgrace because it was something typical of neighboring peoples. Romans typically considered them  barbarians. 

Men used to have short hair but women instead choose between a great variety of hairstyles. Because of Julius Caesar who returned after a war and was blond and tanned, then to be blond became fashionable.  Sometimes they used wigs which were made of hair which they cut from their Gallic slaves.

For the Roman women was very important to had the skin white and soft with the cheeks a little bit rosy.

For the teeth they used pumice power to whiten them. They had also fake teeth.

Baths made up of milk by donkeys were a very exclusive and expensive treatment to exfoliate the skin. Some of the important persons who had it were Cleopatra or Popea Sabina.

Plastic surgery was also known and used for example in scars.

== Marriage in Ancient Rome ==
Romans didn't give a lot of importance to marriage, as we do today. Most couples simply lived together without any type of ceremony. 

Only one of three couples married.

The oldest way of marriage was the ''usus'' which could come immediately into a divorce if the wife stayed out during three consecutive nights.

In Roman times, marriage was private. It didn't have any type of document or record as proof. However, the institution had certain legal effects, since the children had to inherit the father's name and fortune.

=== Women as property ===
Roman marriage could become legal in two ways:

* the ''conventio in manum'' form, in which the bride's father gave the property of his daughter to his future son-in-law.

* or the ''sine manu'', in which the girl continued to be owned by the father and the husband only received the benefit. If she committed adultery, for example, the father could kill her even if the husband had forgiven her.

== Slaves in Rome ==
The Romans took slaves from among the ones they took in battle or in conquered cities, among the children of slaves or children which were abandoned. Sometimes they bought slaves from other countries. Finally there was the case of men who were forced to be slaves as a result of debts.

The slaves ( which were called ''mangones'' or ''mercatores venalicii'') always followed the armies or bought their human merchandise in major markets of Rome and Delos. Ordinary slaves were sold on a rotating platform (''catasta''). A table (''titulus'') was around their necks as a sign indicating its origin, age, abilities and physical or mental defects, and the certification that were free of any crime. The best were kept in separate rooms in taverns, and showed only to wealthy clients.

The children of slave parents was given the name of ''vernae'', as a distinction from the free-born. All the ones belonging to one owner were called a family. The employees at residences of the city were urban families, while the ones who lived in a villa were called rustic families. However, it was common for slaves to serve in both.

In ancient times their number was small, because the houses were very simple, often made by the owner. But as they grew larger and more splendid, the number of slaves increased. There was one for almost every task, which was characteristic of a large house. When the population of Italy was estimated to be about six million people, there was a slave for every three inhabitants, and population in the city of Rome was much higher.

The list of slaves tied to some Roman houses is long: tailors, barbers, cooks, bakers, teachers, also musicians, dancers of both sexes and mimes and jugglers groups to divert the host and his guests, especially when they were at the table. There were buffoons who by their faults, weaknesses or thoughts made people laugh.
The favorite of the ladies were the dwarfs trained to fight and dance.

Doctors and surgeons also were mostly slaves or free men, at least in Republican times, and the same happened with the private secretary of the lord of the house.

=== Slaves of rich people ===
The rich Roman was always accompanied by one or more slaves (''pedisequus'') which had to carry any object his owner may need like to the baths or to a party. They also carried a torch at night. Another type of slaves were the ''lectiarii'' or the carriers of chairs. In the city,only ladies and senators were permitted to sit. 

There were also the readers, which were the slaves who read to their owners while he was a the bath or at the table. There were also the ones who wrote documents and took care of the library of the house. The ''cellarius'' had the keys to the warehouse and the wine cellar. 

The ''procurator'' was the principal in the family of slaves and was the one who managed the money and the expenses of the family.

The slave was absolute property of the house owner and had no legal protection against him.

== Children in Ancient Rome ==
When a child was born in ancient Rome, the birth took place at home while the protection of the goddess Juno Lucina (&quot;she is the goddess who brings children into light&quot;) was invoked.

The men did not attend births, not even the father of the child or the doctor who presented later. Everything was done by the midwife, except in the poorest families who couldn't afford any midwifes, since they used to be expensive. In that case, the woman had no choice but to be assisted by her own relatives.

It was the midwife who watched the baby to check its vitality and to find possible deformities. She announced the sex, but not with words but by signs, and cut the umbilical cord with a distance of four fingers from the womb. Because of this they didn't used any metal instruments. There were some alternatives like glass, ceramic or even a crust of hard bread. After that, she tied the cord with a wire of wool and cleaned and bathed the newborn.

Then, ceremonies began. Immediately a sacred meal was offered to Picumno and Pilumno, sons of Jupiter presiding over marriage and guardianship of children. To try to prevent the dangers since that time, at night three men met on the threshold, one armed with an ax, the second with a club and the third with a broom. The first two struck the door and the third was sweeping the floor, which was considered that the place was clean of evil spirits.

The child was placed at the foot of the ''paterfamilias'' (father or in his absence, the paternal grandfather, great grandfather or person in place). ''Tollere FILIUM'', which meant to raise the newborn in his arms, meant he was recognizing as his, even if it was not his natural son, and because of that he was entitled to enjoy and spend all the rights and privileges as a member of a Roman family. This ceremony took place in ''dies lustricus'', eight days after birth if it was a girl and nine when it was a boy.

The newborn (''pupus'') was then purified at the family altar in a ceremony called ''lustratio''. The guests had to gave him his or her first toys (''crepundia''), small glass beads that were placed over the baby's shoulder so the metallic sound amused the child as a modern rattle. Toys were shaped like flowers, swords, axes and crescents, and also offered some special identification if the child got lost.


== Shows and entertainment in Ancient Rome ==
Shows were one of the most important and characteristic features of Roman life, which occupied, on a schedule on the IV century, 176 days a year. Many came from the Republic, and others were initiated and added by the emperors. The extraordinary spectacles and shows were held on occasions such as anniversaries or triumphs. Along with free food distributions, were the most common ways of gain the sympathy of the people and to distract them from government issues and economic problems: ''panem et circenses'', bread and circuses.


The organization of such events had many difficulties. One of them was to get animals for the shows and to train them. The emperors established a monopoly for hunting and for the possession of elephants and installed in Laurentum an elephant park, near Rome. In this regard there is an anecdote from Plutarch, who noted that in a show in Rome, (which had also dogs acting), an elephant missed a trick in the performance and was seen the next night rehearsing the trick on his own.


Emperors also like gladiators fights and maintained gladiators training schools in Rome, and later in other places like some people of the Republic did on the past. 


The imperial ceremonies were usually accompanied by meals for everyone, that could be served in the theater or in the circus, or maybe in outside in different points of the city. In these cases the emperor attended personally. In other occasions the emperor threw a type of coins called ''missilia'', which gave some advantages to the ones who could get one of those. 


Nero gave birds, groceries, tickets for the distribution of wheat, clothes, jewelry, paintings, slaves, cattle, trained animals, and finally, boats, blocks of flats and parcels of land. Elagabalus gave gold and silver, food, costumes, camels, donkeys, cattle and deer.


In Emerita Augusta (now Mérida, Spain) the shows were announced on posters painted in red and black that were distributed throughout the city, and in the intervals between races, they also threw ''missilia'' or ''sparsiones''.

|-
|}

* The French commonly use '.' instead of ',' to separate thousands.
* For 70-79, it builds upon &quot;soixante&quot; but past that it builds upon a combination of terms for 80-99.
* Only the first (21,31,41,51,etc.) have &quot;et un&quot;; but past this it is simply both words consecutively (vingt-six, trente-trois, etc).
* For 100-199, it looks much like this list already save that &quot;cent&quot; is added before the rest of the number; this continues up to 1000 and onward.

|-
|}

* Use ''heure'' in between the hour and the minutes when telling the time, e.g., ''Il est cinq heures dix''
* Note that there is no &quot;a.m.&quot; or &quot;p.m.&quot; in French. Use ''du matin'', ''de l'après midi'', and ''du soir'' to disambiguate a given time. &quot;''Il est sept heures du soir''&quot; makes it clear that it is 7 o'clock at night, and not in the morning. Alternatively, you could use the 24-hour system: &quot;''Il est dix-neuf heures''&quot; has no ambiguity; time is often expressed in this fashion, particularly in professional/commercial settings.
* ''Midi'' and ''minuit'' can be used without an article when telling the time: &quot;''Il est midi.''&quot; (It is noon.)

The 35mm film is only 1 bit per &quot;pixel&quot;. (a &quot;pixel&quot; being a film grain spot that suddenly changes when hit by a number of photons in rapid succession) It is this property that makes resolution highly misleading. The film is naturally dithered. A digital setup with similar resolution would presumably have far more bits per pixel. So the film sounds better than it really is.

The eye is similar, but it also averages over time. The retina uses pulse modulation, from a high of about 1 kHz down to wherever the noise floor is... probably below 1 Hz. The longer you stare at something, the better you can sense the detail and the color.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is your quest? ==

A friend asked me what was the purpose of this wikibook, and how it was different from other wikibooks and references out there.  I thought the answer was worth general discussion.

I see a whole lot of sites out there that try to answer the &quot;what&quot; about some software part.  (Wikipedia is a really good example.)  I would like the handbook to answer the &quot;how&quot; questions.  A lot of times this will be a &quot;How do I start?&quot; or &quot;How do I get started in XXXXX?&quot;  type question.  Many times the answer will be ''Check out these references.'' or ''Here's the vocabulary you need to look on the web.''  

I have a different push with the language dictionary section.  I would like to be able to find the concepts that I find hard to find in beginners' books.  They're spending so much time teaching the basics of programming, that the basics of the language get hidden.  I thought It would be really sweet to compare a language you know with one you're trying to learn in the same format.  The second time you use the dictionary it would be even easier.

That's not what I intended, but I'd love to hear from others.  I was hoping to have roughly single page descriptions of each language, so that it is easy to compare between languages without being bogged down with too many details.  I don't know that there would be much help in pointing to the sub-sections.  Is the language dictionary section too redundant with the computer programming wikibook?

--[[User:Christine Frayda|Christine Frayda]] 00:23, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

== Red links in the language section ==

I am in favor of removing the red links from the language sections. It is a bad habit of many language advocates to add ''there'' language anywhere they see fit without providing an article to go with it. We should not tolerate such laziness and remove those vanity entries.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:37, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

Thanks Krischik!  I'll remove some red links that don't seem to add clarification to the category.  I think some of them help, but definitely not all.

[[User:Christine Frayda|Christine Frayda]] 00:17, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

== Book is Redundant ==

Alot of topics in this book are heavily redundant. The only part of this book that couldn't (and probably shouldn't) be merged into other books would be the &quot;software life-cycle&quot; part. All the rest of this book, from paradigms to the &quot;language dictionary&quot; is already represented in the form of other books currently on the CS bookshelf. Also, this book certainly doesn't follow any naming convention that I am familiar with.

I think it is a waste of time and resources to try and make a single monolithic book that covers the same material as is already to be found on the CS bookshelf. I won't list this book for VfD or anything, but i think it would be better for everybody to contribute to the books that already exist on these topics, then to try and find new ways to say the things that have already been said. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:34, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for looking into this Whiteknight.  My idea wasn't to cover the material in detail, but to start people in the right direction.  It may be that the computer science bookshelf does this already.  When I last looked at it, the bookshelf was not beginner friendly, but this handbook may not be much more.  Do you know of a place that compares languages well in a quick (1-page-ish) side-by-side reference format?  

All that being said, I don't rule out that much of this work could be redundant.  How can we best merge any missing bits back to the parent documents? [[User:Christine Frayda|Christine Frayda]] 01:41, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

:If your goal here is to have a quick comparison guide and a series of reference tables, then I supposed I don't have much quarrel with that. That kind of information is not well tabulated here at wikibooks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:12, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Seven card stud eight-or-better high-low split''' is a variation on [[../7-stud|7 card stud]] where there are two separate pots. One pot is for the high hand and the other pot is for the low hand. The high hand pot is paid off just like the pot for 7 card stud. The low hand pot is only paid off if a player has a 5 card hand that has a high card of 8 or lower. Just like in the variant [[../Razz/]], straights and flushes do not count for the low card hand. For all other rules, see [[../7-stud|7 card stud]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Razz''' is a variation on [[../7-stud|7 card stud]] which has similar rules to the low hand rules for [[../7-stud8|7 card stud high/low]]. Instead of the best hand winning, the lowest hand wins in razz. Just like in high/low stud, straights and flushes do not count against the player's low hand.  Unlike 7 card stud high/low, low hands do not have to contain 5 cards with a value under 8. Valid lows can include cards over 8, along with pairs and higher hands. Razz has a small, but loyal following online and in casinos. The frustrating aspect of Razz is that unlike all other forms of poker, pairs and 3 of a kind hurt instead of help. So it is common to have a beautiful looking hand after 4 cards, but then the cards start to pair up and it all ends in nothing. For basic stud rules, see [[../7-stud|7 card stud]].

==Aristotle and Whitehead==

I transferred the bulk of your piece on Whitehead's view of Aristotle to Whitehead's entry. The quotation you gave from de Anima (424b) could not be found in that part of de Anima - please could you provide the correct reference. Whitehead's views on the relational nature of science also need a reference. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:37, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

There are some words which are spelled the same in English and in German, but have completely different meanings. Even though the words are spelled the same, they are usually pronounced completely differently. It can sometimes be dangerous to use these words (for both native English speakers and native German speakers.) Think of that, next time someone wants to give you a &quot;[[#Gift | Gift]]&quot; or opens a door and says &quot;[[#After | After]] you!&quot;

'''Note''': This list contains some items of [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/etymology etymological] interest. For example, the transformation of the consonant 't' in German to 'd' in English in word pairs like Bart-&gt;Beard, Bett-&gt;Bed, Gut-&gt;Good, Hart-&gt;Hard, Rot-&gt;Red, and Not-&gt;Need.

this actually makes more sense as a template because then we can include it on other pages if necessary, so I have again made the change

The HRs in pages are going on top of the TOC, despite z-index specification... any ideas? -- [[User:Singpolyma|Singpolyma]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Singpolyma|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Singpolyma|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:28, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

Kevin, 

In answer to both emails. 

1. Copyright. All we would require is a general statement on the contents page,
we certainly wouldn't wish the effort on you of somehow trying to keep track of
AVDF content page by page... that would render it pretty much unusable I should
have thought! A link to avdf.com would be nice if that doesn't cause any stress.

2. Licensing. Having reviewed your licensing arrangements, I can confirm that
GUI Computing Pty Ltd, owner of all copyrights in the material contained both
on avdf.com and in the GUI Coding standards, agrees for you to use our above
referenced work under terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.

3. Contribution. Keep me in the loop as the project moves forward. I shall mention
it to my developers at our next meeting... these days, of course, most of them are
.NET hotshots who consider VB &quot;legacy&quot;, but there are a couple who might be interested.

Finally, if you need anything in addition to the above, please yell. 

All the best, 

Mark

I'm editing the Visual Basic book on WikiBooks
(http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Visual_Basic_Classic) and I
wonder
if I might include some of your articles in it.

Of course if you felt like contributing to the book yourself that would
be
even better.

When I started adding to it I thought I would be one among many but it
seems
that VB6 programmers are a shy and retiring lot.

The screen shot referenced in the text is no longer shown, although I don't know why. The previously requested device pictures are now shown, and the photo of the CD drive has the same figure designation as the referenced screen shot. Since this would confuse the novice computer user, I removed the screen shot reference.

Also, the text never mentions the Windows version referenced, although it seems to be Windows XP. While I'm sure it was done to make the guide more generic, there ARE some version-specific references, which should be identified as such. The reference to &quot;Start-&gt;All Programs...&quot; is clearly for XP (although could now be for Vista, too), and should be labeled that way. So, I did.</text>

One great benefit of Gmail is that when you receive an e-mail from someone who isn't already in your contacts list, Gmail automatically saves the e-mail address and the display name.  You can add more information such as this person's real name, phone number, etc. by clicking the contacts hyperlink on the left panel of the Gmail webpage once logged in.  If you don't want to keep any automatic contact entries, you select the addresses you don't want and delete them.

The huge benefit of the autosave is that when you are sending a new e-mail and start to type an address, Gmail gives you a dropdown menu to select names from.  For example: If I was sending an e-mail to testuser@gmail.com and my contacts had test@gmail.com, test123@gmail.com and testing@gmail.com I could just click the appropriate one after typing just &quot;Te.&quot;

'''Import and Export of Contacts'''
As Gmail has continued to grow and expand features one of the more profound areas has been in managing the export and import of contacts.

This feature is extremely useful in assisting users in a move from or to an Outlook or Outlook Express mail client.

'''To Export Contacts'''
1)  Go into your contact list and notice on the top right hand portion of the contacts area the text link &quot;Export&quot;.
2)  After clicking this option a small window will open asking what type of format you would like to export your contacts to.
3)  Once this decision has been made with the provided radio buttons click the &quot;Export Contacts&quot; button.
4)  At this point you can save the file and close the small window.


'''To Import Contacts'''
1)  Go into your contacts list and notice on the top right hand portion of the contacts area the text link &quot;Import&quot;.
2)  You will need to have a .csv (Comma Separated Value) file.  This is typically the format that Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express export address books to.  Keep in mind that additional formatting may be required for Gmail to accept the file.
3)  Once this has been done you will see a failed message or see that all of your contacts are listed in this area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The presentation in the linked page is unsatisfying in the extreme.  While it is true that the ''calculation'' of the arithemetic mean is more complicated for fractions, this does not mean that the arithmetic mean is a poor representation of the central tendency, as the text claims.  In fact, the arithmetic mean is the arithemetic mean, and is a perfectly valid expression of the central tendency of fractions.  The geometric mean is another measure of central tendency.  Compare with the harmonic mean, for which an example is provided of why the arithemetic mean is not great, or at least an example where the harmonic mean has an appealing interpretation.

Can an example be provided showing when one would prefer the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean, including an interpretation?</text>

==What country did they live in?==
The Persian Empire started in the north west corner of what is now Iran. It grew through military conquest to cover a huge region that roughly encompasses today's Iran, Iraq, Armenia, Afghanistan, Turkey, Bulgaria, many parts of Greece, Egypt, Syria, much of what is now Pakistan, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Caucasia, Central Asia, Libya, and northern parts of Arabia. The empire eventually became the largest empire of the ancient world.

Persepolis was the ceremonial capitol of Persia.  Susa and Pasargadas also were capital cities at different times in Persian history. They were all in what is now Iran.

==What did they eat?==
[[Image:Granadas - Pomegranates.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Pomegranates]]The food prepared for Persian kings is legendary. Persians ate stews made from meat and fruit with herbs. They ate rice and bread made with wheat. Yoghurt was also a staple in Persian food. Tablets from the time of these ancient peoples indicate that the inhabitants of Mesopotamia were using basil, cilantro, cumin and caraway in their food in 4,000 BC. Apricots, artichokes, eggplants, lemons, lime, oranges, pistachios, spinach, saffron or tarragon all came to Europe through Persia. Other condiments and spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, coriander, dill, nutmeg, paprika, pomegranates, saffron, sumac, turmeric, as well as orange-flower water and rose water were used in Persian food. Lamb and goat were the primary meats eaten by Persians. Persians did not eat beef!

== What did their buildings look like? ==
[[Image:Takht-jamshid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|the ruins of Persepolis]]Persians made very interesting buildings. The Ruins at Persepolis are an example of ancient Persian buildings.  Persians were among the first to use mathematics, geometry, and astronomy in their building. Their buildings were grand and were created by skillful workers. Some Persian buildings had huge barrel-vaulted chambers. The Persians created huge domes of rock and clay and supported their roofs with tall columns. They also decorated the walls of their palaces with lions, bulls and flowers. 

The Kharaghan twin towers and the Shah Mosque are two other old buildings built in a Persian style.

== What did they wear? ==
[[Image:Persepolis_Apadana_noerdliche_Treppe_Detail.jpg|thumb|200px|Carvings in Persepolis]]
The Persian king wore a robe of honor that was a large piece of fabric that was draped around him. For the king and other aristocracy, their clothes were often decorated with golden clothing ornaments. Some of these are in the form of roundels, while others are gold plaques with loops or rings on the back so they can be sewn onto the cloth. Rich people also liked to wear gold jewellery such as bracelets with animal head carvings.

Common people wore coats and pants made out of leather. Men's coats reached from their shoulders down to their knees and were fastened with a girdle. Their sleeves were somewhat tight and went down to their wrists.

Originally woman's clothing was quite similar to men's clothing but as time went their style changed. Initially their clothes were short and tight but when the style changed their clothes were made longer, more voluminous and were made out of softer materials. 

Persian shoes were usually just pieces of leather that were wrapped around their feet and were tied up on the top. These would have look similar to moccasins. Persians also wore red clothes to show respect to their husbands

== What did their writing look like? ==
[[Image:Behistun_detail.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Detail of old Persian writing.]]
Old Persian was written from left to right in Old Persian cuneiform script. Old Persian cuneiform script was supposedly invented by King Darius I, one of ancient Persia's famous kings. There were 36 letters in their alphabet, although some of them essentially represented different syllables. For example they had one symbol for &quot;ka&quot; and another symbol for &quot;ku&quot;. They used these symbols even though they also had symbols that represented &quot;a&quot; and &quot;u&quot;.

== What did they believe? ==
The Persian civilization spawned three major religions: Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, and Manichaeanism. 

The Persian thinker Zoroaster, an Aryan nomad,(who propagated Zoroastrianism) was the main religious movement leader. Living around 18th century BC (although some believe as recent as 6th century BC), he helped to unite the Persian empire. He rejected the old Persian gods and introduced that a single wise god, Ahura Mazda, ruled the world. However, Ahura Mazda was often in battle with the prince of evil and lies, Ahriman who is also known as Angra Mainyu. On Earth, each person had to choose which side to support. Ahura Mazda had a helper that secretly helped Ahura and Angra, his name was Eshmugeler. 

Zoroaster's teaching were written in a book, the Zend-Avesta. It said that Ahura Mazda would conquer over the forces of evil, Ahriman, at the end. On that day, all the people would be judges for their actions. Those who did good would enter paradise. Those who did evil would be condemned to eternal suffering. Now most Persians are Muslims.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
Of course, but perhaps the most famous Persian of all time is [[w:Cyrus the Great|Cyrus the Great]] who founded the Persian Empire. In fact, in 1992 he was ranked #87 on [[w:Michael H. Hart|Michael H. Hart]]'s list of the most influential figures in history.
Other famous Persian kings were Cambises and Darius the Great.

'''Darius III''' is famous only because he suffered under the hands of Alexander the Great of Macedonia. During Darius' reign, the whole Persian Empire was destroyed by Alexander, who first attacked the Persians in what is now modern Turkey. He then moved on into the heart of the Empire where he captured the capital Susa. Darius ran away from battle against Alexander twice, but was murdered by his governor Bessus who wanted the throne for himself. Alexander was angry this happened and respected his dead opponent. He held a great funeral for the dead king. Later, Bessus was captured and executed.

== What is left of them today? ==
Persians are one of the few ancient civilizations who have made significant contributions to humanity from prehistoric times by their Persian empire all the way through to the modern day in their country Iran. Many Persians are now Muslims, although there are Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians still living  and practising their religion in Iran. There are also some Zorastrians, called Parsis, living in India with majority of the community in Mumbai.The Parsis practise the Zorastrian religion and fled from Iran when the Muslims invaded. Rather than convert to Islam a small group set sail from Iran and landed on the shores of India.

[[File:Michelsonmorley-boxplot.svg|thumb|Figure 1. Box plot of data from the Michelson-Morley Experiment]]

A '''box plot''' (also called a box and whisker diagram) is a simple visual representation of key features of a univariate sample.

The box lies on a vertical axis in the range of the sample.  Typically, a top to the box is placed at the 1st quartile, the bottom at the third quartile.  The width of the  box is arbitrary, as there is no x-axis (though see Violin Plots, below).  

In between the top and bottom of the box is some representation of central tendency.  A common version is to place a horizontal line at the median, dividing the box into two.  Additionally, a star or asterisk is placed at the mean value, centered in the box  in the horizontal direction.

Another common extension is to the 'box-and-whisker' plot.  This adds vertical lines extending from the top and bottom of the plot to for example, the maximum and minimum values, The farthest value within 2 standard deviations above and below the mean.  Alternatively, the whiskers could extend to the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles.  Finally, it is common in the box-and-whisker plot to show [[outliers]] (however defined) with asterisks at the individual values beyond the ends of the whiskers.

Violin Plots are an extension to box plots using the horizontal information to present more data.  They show some estimate of the [[CDF]] instead of a box, though the quantiles of the distribution are still shown.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Basic Computing Using Windows/Table of Contents}}

We’ve been moving extremely fast and covering a lot of potentially new and confusing material, so let’s take a second to review (some of you may remember this better if you try thinking about the pictures in brackets instead of the words):

* Computers are machines that process data (picture a giant contraption with sheets of paper containing information being fed in, and ice cream coming out)
* Go back to the table of controls in Chapter 2 and review all of those (picture something really obvious for each one, like the control panel of a sci/fi spaceship for buttons)
* The desktop is behind everything and is your access panel to everything (picture an office desk covered in switches, buttons, and knobs)
* Shortcuts are only links to other files (picture a whirlpool that looks like Mars sucking you to Mars)
* Everything, programs, shortcuts, letters, and data of all kinds is stored on the computer as files (come up with your own picture, make it interesting)
* You copy and move files by drag-and-drop (picture a ball, you pick it up and move it, then you pick it up and put it down somewhere else while it stays in the second place)

There was much more covered (especially terms and the hardware from [[Basic Computing Using Windows/Computers and Peripherals|Chapter 1]]) but this should help you get oriented and give you a good handle on where we’ve been.

Now we’re moving forward again.  The next big centre to tackle in Windows is the '''Control Panel''' ('''CP''').  The Control Panel is where you change almost all the main things in Windows.  “But didn’t we change a lot of things, like the wallpaper and colours and screensaver, without going through there?”  Yes, but we took a shortcut.  Go to ‘Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control Panel’ or ‘Start-&gt;Control Panel’ (it may come up with a window or be a sub-menu), then double-click (click if it’s a sub-menu) on ‘Display’.  There it is; the box that we used to change the wallpaper, screensaver, and colours

----
'''NOTE:'''  Your Control Panel may come up looking totally different and you may be lost.  If there is no icon in your control panel called ‘Display’ then your computer is running in a ‘User Friendly’ mode.  To switch out of it into the ‘normal’ view, look at the left-hand side of the Control Panel window and find the option called ‘Switch to classic view’ and click this.  If you can’t find it, look at [[Basic Computing Using Windows/Appendicies/Switching the Control Panel to Classic View|Appendix A]].
----

So now we’ve reached the main control centre of Windows, what’s the first thing?  How about a severe warning?  The options in the Control Panel are necessary and useful, however do not change anything unless you understand it and know what you are doing.  Blindly changing any setting can wreck havoc with your computer.

Now, on to the next item.  '''Desktop themes'''!  We have already changed the way Windows looks, however Desktop Themes (or just '''Themes''') are designed to make it easier.  Navigate to ‘Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Desktop Themes’ or ‘Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Display’.  These two versions of Desktop Themes are implemented very differently.  If you have a ‘Desktop Themes’ item on your Control Panel, the double click on this icon.  In the window that opens, you can select a theme from the drop down box near the top.  In the centre area, the different items will change to show you what that Theme looks like.  There are two buttons in the top right-hand corner of the window that allow you to preview the Screen Saver, sounds, and cursors.  The check boxes below these buttons are for selecting which parts of the Theme to apply.  So if you only want, say, the wallpaper from one Theme and everything else from another, then you would uncheck everything except for ‘Desktop wallpaper’.

If you don’t have a ‘Desktop Themes’ item on your Control Panel, then Desktop Themes for you are integrated into the Display box.  Go to the tab labelled ‘Themes’ and select the one you want from the ‘Theme:’ combo box.  Just as with the other version there is an area below that will show a preview of what the wallpaper, colours, and some of the icons will be changed to.  Click ‘Apply’ or ‘OK’ to change your settings to those determined by the Theme.

Now to get to something really useful, '''install'''ing and '''uninstall'''ing programs!  Most programs nowadays come on one or more CDs.  You put the CD (or the first CD) in the drive and it '''auto-starts''' (automatically runs the installation program).  You follow the instructions, answer the questions, and voila!  Your program is ready to use.  Sometimes, however, this does not work, and what if you want to remove a program?  So, navigate to the Control Panel and open ‘Add/Remove Programs’ or ‘Add or Remove Programs’.  No matter what your version of Windows, a list will be displayed of most of the programs on your computer.  To remove a program (uninstall it), click on it in the list and then click ‘Add/Remove’ or ‘Change/Remove’ and answer the questions, if there are any.  To add (install) a new program make sure that its CD or Floppy disk is in the drive and then click ‘Install…’ or ‘Add New Programs’ and answer the questions.

Okay, that was easy, wasn’t it?  All automated and simple.  Now remember back to Chapter 1 when we logged on to the computer.  Some computers don’t have a password to log on: some never show the box.  Some computers can be set up to have multiple usernames and passwords (accounts) so that you can log into different desktops.  How can we set all this up?  From the Control Panel, of course!  Open ‘Passwords’ or ‘User Accounts’ on your Control Panel.  These two work very differently, and they are both presented below.

If your computer has the ‘Users’ item, then you have to check something before you can change the accounts.  Open the Control Panel item called ‘Passwords’.  In the window that pops up, click the ‘User Profiles’ tab ('''profile''' is another word for account).  There are two radio buttons here.  Click the first one if you want to have only one account on the computer, click the second one if you want to have multiple accounts.  Then use the check boxes at the bottom to specify what things can be customised on each account.  It is recommended to check all of these.

Once you have enabled using multiple accounts, it becomes easy to create a new account.  To create a new account, just type in a different name and password when you start the computer.  Windows will automatically create the new account with that username and password to be used every time you log on with them.

If your computer has the ‘User Accounts’ item then you have a much easier way to change all of these options.  To create a new desktop click ‘Create a new account’.  The computer will ask you what you want to call the new account, this is the username.  Click ‘Next’.  The computer will then ask you if you want this to be a ‘Computer administrator’ or ‘Limited’ account.  It is recommended to run most desktops as limited accounts, however there are some programs that do not function well this way.  There are also many things you cannot do from a limited account (like create a new account, so if the instructions in this paragraph don’t work for you, then it is because you have a limited account).  Click ‘Create Account’ and you have a new desktop of that type under that name!

To change an account in ‘User Accounts’, click on it in the list at the bottom of the window.  The window will then give you the list of options of what you can change.  You can change the account name by clicking on the first option.  You can also change the password by clicking the second option or you can make your account password-less with the third option.   To change the picture representing the account you use the fourth option.  You change the account type from administrator to limited and vice-versa with the fifth option, and you assign a ‘.NET Passport’ to the account with the fifth option.  All of these options save the last one should be self-explanatory.  The final option will be discussed when we discuss the Internet.  If you have multiple desktops on your computer and the account selected is not the account that is currently logged on, then there appears a sixth option ‘Delete the account’.  This options starts a wizard to remove the user from the computer.

You can change the ‘Welcome screen’ (which is the log-on screen variation that fills the whole screen talked about in Chapter 1) to the normal log-on box.  To do this select ‘Change the way users log on or off’ from the main ‘User Accounts’ screen.  Then uncheck ‘Use the Welcome screen’ and click ‘Apply Options’.

All right, was that a lot of stuff or what?  Now for some concepts, first of all, '''viruses''', '''hackers''','''crackers''', '''scanners''', and '''firewalls'''.  You may have heard some of these terms before.  Viruses are what people often like to blame (wrongly) for computer problems.  Computer viruses work much the same way as normal ones.  They ‘infect’ a computer by getting their files on its hard disk.  They then begin to copy themselves all over the computer and onto anything that might carry them to another computer, such as floppy disks and emails (more on emails when we talk about the Internet).  They also do damage while they are on the computer.  Many viruses do annoying things, like playing a song or slowing the computer down, however some of them delete files and erase crucial data.  Therefore many people get Virus Scanners.  There are some major benefits to scanners.  The biggest one being that they will destroy many (and maybe all) of the viruses on your computer.  Their disadvantages are that they must be updated regularly, and they slow your computer down.  They also give a false sense of security, making you think you are well protected when they may have missed something.

Crackers are people who break into computers.  Sometimes they do it for fun, sometimes for profit, sometimes to show off.  They often touch nothing.  Sometimes they will take data or erase it.  They tend to prefer government or corporate targets and seldom do serious hackers target normal people.  However, to protect against the theft of data, many people run firewalls.  Firewalls are pieces of software that identify hacker-like things and cut them off, providing a huge measure of protection for the home user.  A similar term, hacker, is often used to refer to crackers, however the term hacker more properly refers to someone who knows how to exploit a computer system for beneficial purposes.

We’re almost done, now for error messages.  Error messages do not always indicate an error (or at least, not what ''you'' call error messages).  Many so-called error messages are simply the program asking for more information.  The first thing to do when you see an error message is to ''read it''.  Many computer experts may seem to violate this rule: that is often because they recognise common messages and know what they say without reading it.  Below is a list of common error message buttons and what they usually do:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspaceing=&quot;0&quot;
| '''Button label''' || '''What it does'''
|-
| OK || Confirms the operation and shuts the box
|-
| Yes ||It performs the operation the message box says it is going to
|-
| No || It does not perform the operation the message box says it is going to
|-
| Cancel || Stops the operation and shuts the box (any data is lost)
|-
| Abort || It stops the operation you were trying to do
|-
| Retry || Tries again giving to time to make changes
|-
| Ignore || Cancels an error message.
|}

Most error boxes have icons beside them to indicate their nature as well:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspaceing=&quot;0&quot;
| '''Icon''' || '''What it means'''
|-
| [[Image:UI-QuestionBaloon.png|50px]] || The computer have some information for you.
|-
| [[Image:UI-AlertBaloon.png|50px]] || The computer is warning you that there may be something you forgot to do or did wrong.
|-
| [[Image:UI-ErrorBaloon.png|50px]] || There has been a major computer error.
|}

Computers can break.  Things can go wrong, viruses can destroy information, and the person using the computer can do something wrong.  To protect your data just in case this happens it is necessary to back it up.  '''Backing up''' is making a second copy of data.  If you are changing something and do not want to lose the original you can create a second copy on the hard drive to work with, this is a back up.  However to protect your data in the case of major computer error it is necessary to back it up ''off'' of the hard drive.  The most common way to do this is to put all of your data on CDs or DVDs.

'''Minerals''' are inorganic chemicals, generally metallic, that are used by the body.  Usually the body has a sufficient supply of minerals through eating a variety of foods in the correct amounts.  Mineral distribution in the body falls into two categories - bulk minerals, and trace minerals (defined by the USRDA as greater than and less than 200 mg).

==Bulk Minerals==
===Calcium===
Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body, and is needed to form strong bones and teeth, and is also used for blood, muscle, nervous system transmission, and inter-cellular fluid.  Calcium plays a part in the contraction of muscle cells and blood vessels, and the secretion of hormones and enzymes.  Some typical sources of calcium include: dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt), Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli.

===Sodium===
Sodium is found together with chloride as sodium chloride or common salt. In the body, sodium helps to balance the fluids inside the body cells and outside them. A lack of sodium can cause cramps. However too much salt in the body is harmful as it can cause hypertension, a condition that affects the blood system

===Magnesium===
The fourth most abundant mineral in the body - half of which is found in bones, while the other half is distributed amongst tissues and organs.  It it a vital component in muscle and nerve function, immune system function, bone strength, blood sugar and blood pressure, and metabolism and protein synthesis.  Most sources of magnesium are green vegetables and whole or unrefined grains and nuts, as magnesium is the central component of chlorophyll molecules, which give the green color of vegetables.

===Chloride===

===Phosphorus===

===Potassium===

===Sulfur===

==Trace Minerals==
===Selenium===
A trace mineral that makes [[Cookbook:Antioxidants|antioxidant]] selenoprotein enzymes, which prevent cellular damage from free radicals, regulate thyroid function, and play a role in the immune system.  The amount of selenium in a particular food is related to the amount in the soil of the area the food was produced in.  Typically it is found in grains and nuts, but also in the meats of animals that eat grain or plants from selenium-rich soil.

===Iron===
Iron is needed for the formation of hemoglobin in red blood cells which are responsible for carrying oxygen to all parts of the body.  Most sources of iron are animal related (also called heme iron sources) and include beef, turkey, chicken, pork, oysters, crab, and tuna.  Other sources, called nonheme iron sources, include beans, tofu, spinach, raisins, molasses, and some cereals and grains.

===Chromium===

===Cobalt===

===Copper===
Copper aids in the formation of Red Blood Cells. Copper excess also mimics zinc deficiency and can promote impotence.

===Fluorine===

===Iodine===

===Zinc===
Zinc can be found in almost every cell in the body, and stimulates about 100 different enzyme reactions.  It is used by the immune system, for DNA synthesis, for healing wounds, and for normal growth and development during hormonally active periods.  Zinc is provided by oysters, beef, pork, chicken, fish, beans, tree nuts, and some dairy products.

===Manganese===

===Molybdenum===

=Photographing Rain=

* Backlight it
* Use LOTS of rain!  It's surprising just how much you need to show up.
* Sometimes milk is added to water to increase its visibility.
* Use Large droplets. Misting the source will only look like haze.

== Overview ==

'''''Dobby''''', a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House Elf]], is essentially property, belonging to his &quot;family&quot; and unable to work against their instructions or interests. Apparently, according to the author, his birthday is 28 June.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Dobby came to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursley's house]] to warn [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] that he should not return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] for his second year studies, saying he thought it would be too dangerous for Harry. Dobby admitted that he had been blocking Harry's mail; he had believed that if Harry got no letters from his friends, he would think his friends were false and would not want to go back to them.

Dobby then locked the barrier at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]] in hopes that if Harry was unable to make it onto the Hogwarts Express, he would be unable to go to school. Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] thwart this by using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Ron's father's]] flying car.

Dobby bewitched one of the bludgers to repeatedly attack Harry in the Quidditch match against Slytherin; visiting Harry in the Hospital Wing that night, he admitted that he had hoped that it would injure Harry enough to cause him to be sent home. It is during this visit that he also explains how a house-elf can be freed, and admits that the Chamber had been opened before.

At the end of this book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] brings Dobby with him to the school, thus confirming that he is the house-elf of the Malfoy family, as Harry had believed. Dobby hints to Harry where Riddle's diary had come from; Harry confronts Lucius with this in front of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. Harry then tricks Lucius Malfoy into accidentally releasing Dobby from service to the Malfoys by presenting an article of clothing to Dobby, who promptly saves Harry from Malfoy's wrath at having his servant freed.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Dobby spent at least a year searching for a family who would pay him wages to be their House-Elf, something which is unheard of in the wizarding world. Eventually, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] agreed to pay Dobby one Galleon per week to work at Hogwarts – he had offered more, but Dobby bargained him down. When we see Dobby in the Hogwarts kitchens, he has just entered Dumbledore's service at the school, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]].

At Christmas, Dobby wakes Harry up leaning over him in his bed; Dobby gives Harry a pair of socks; they are hand-knit by Dobby himself. In return, Harry presents Dobby with a pair of socks &amp;ndash; the ones which had been cushioning his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sneakoscope|pocket Sneakoscope]] for years. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] also gives Dobby a pair of socks and a jumper (US: sweater).

Dobby happens to overhear [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] discussing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] of the Triwizard Tournament, and discovers that Harry will need some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gillyweed|Gillyweed]] to save &quot;his Wheezy&quot; (Ron Weasley); so he steals some from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s office and gives it to Harry, waking him up where he had fallen asleep in the library mere minutes before the task is due to start.

Harry later visits the Hogwarts kitchens with Ron and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], to thank Dobby with a gift of socks (Dobby's favorite garment) for his help in the second Task. Ron takes the opportunity to secure some additional food for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who at the time is living in a cave outside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]].

We later learn that Professor Moody had deliberately let the information about Gillyweed slip when Dobby was in earshot, in hopes that Dobby would act on it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] has healed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]], Dobby brings her back to Harry. Harry is of course pleased to get Hedwig back, and speaks with Dobby for a while about how he and Winky are doing. Harry at this point is trying to find a place where the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Defence Association, as it was then known]], can practice, and he asks Dobby if he knows of any such place. Dobby, surprisingly, does, and tells Harry about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement, or the Come And Go Room]]. He has used it several times when he needed a place for Winky to dry out. He volunteers to show it to Harry, but Harry decides he is too tired, and it is too late at night; instead, he asks Dobby to tell him how to get in.

Dobby manages, somehow, to get into the room before the last meeting of Dumbledore's Army before Christmas, and decorates it with embarrassing Christmas decorations – baubles reading &quot;Have a Very Harry Christmas&quot;, for instance. Harry does manage to get it largely cleaned up before the rest of the D. A. arrive.

Against direct orders from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], Dobby makes his way into the Room of Requirement to warn the D.A. that Umbridge is coming. Because he has violated orders, he as usual feels a need to punish himself; he does this by charging headfirst into the wall. Harry does prevent him from injuring himself further. Harry is able to spread the word quickly enough that the only person actually caught is himself.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

At one point, Harry feels the need to have [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] trailed, to find out where he is going. He summons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], who appears entangled with Dobby – evidently they had been involved in a fight when Harry summoned Kreacher. Dobby volunteers to track Malfoy as well.

Shortly thereafter, Kreacher and Dobby return to report to Harry. Kreacher's report seems to be largely praise for Malfoy and his pure blood, and abuse for Harry, but Dobby is able to report that Malfoy had been spending time in the Room of Requirement.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When captured and in the cellars of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], Harry sees a blue eye in the Magic Mirror he carries around with him, and asks it to send help. Shortly, Dobby [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|apparates]] into the cell where Harry, Ron, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] are being held. Dobby is apparently extremely nervous at being in the Malfoy home, where he was so cruelly treated before Harry won him his freedom. Harry asks him to take Luna, Dean, and Ollivander to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]]. The noise of Dobby Disapparating attracts attention from upstairs; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] is sent down to the cell to investigate, and Ron and Harry attempt to overpower him. Harry calls on the life debt that Wormtail owes him, and he hesitates; the silver hand that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] had given Wormtail senses this hesitation, and reading it as disloyalty, chokes Wormtail to death.

Harry and Ron proceed upstairs to try and save Hermione and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]]. Though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmed]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] produces a silver knife and threatens Hermione with it; she has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] collect all the wands Harry and Ron are holding. Dobby re-appears and causes the chandelier to fall on Bellatrix; gathering all the wands Draco is holding, Harry takes Griphook and Dobby, and Ron takes Hermione, and together they Apparate to Shell Cottage. As Harry is Disapparating, however, he sees Bellatrix throwing her knife; arriving at Shell Cottage, he finds that the thrown knife has hit Dobby, killing him.

Harry then digs a grave for Dobby, and buries him, near a tree on the grounds of Shell Cottage.

Later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth Dumbledore]] asks where Dobby was, saying that he had expected Dobby to be traveling with Harry; Harry tells him that he was killed by Bellatrix. Aberforth is dismayed; he says he &quot;liked that elf.&quot;

== Strengths ==

Dobby is very loyal to the people he cares about. He did what the Malfoys told him to do because he had no choice. Despite the loyalty he owes to the Malfoy family, however, Dobby still tries unsuccessfully in the second book to protect Harry. He later helps Harry in the Second Task in Goblet of Fire, tells him about the Room of Requirement, warns the DA, and tails Draco Malfoy for him. He is also loyal to Dumbledore who employs him, and helps his friend Winky when she is drunk. He is also a hard worker. Dobby is also a very grateful person. In general, he is a good friend to have around.

== Weaknesses ==

Like all house-elves, certain subtleties of human behavior are beyond his understanding; his speech pattern, for instance is somewhat immature: he will speak in the third person, apparently unable to master the subtleties of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot;. He is completely subservient, seeming to exist only to take orders from one wizard or another. He does have a will of his own, reflected in his being able to try and warn Harry away from Hogwarts against his owner's wishes, but he has to make a supreme effort to allow that will to express itself, and because he is going against the wishes of his owner, he must punish himself. He has internalized his subservience so much that he will punish himself without being told to, if he finds himself doing something which he believes his owners might not like.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Dobby, being emotionally very simple, in some ways childlike, forms relationships very quickly, albeit at a possibly child-like level. Initially, of course, he is required to be loyal to the Malfoy family, but even within the constraints of that loyalty, he attempts to protect Harry, who he sees as something of a saviour, from efforts to harm him. Dobby says that this is because of Harry's defeating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]; house-elves were really very badly treated when he was around. &quot;Of course, Dobby is still treated very badly...&quot;, he goes on to say; but Harry is respected because of what he did for the general House-Elf population. Once Harry engineers his freedom from the Malfoys, Dobby must hunt for some other Master to serve, eventually setting on Hogwarts and Dumbledore; while his loyalty then is to the school, he clearly is also loyal to, and protective of, Harry, even attempting to defend Harry from slurs by Kreacher. Additionally, he takes care of Winky, who he apparently feels responsible for, having found her the job at Hogwarts. To a lesser extent, Dobby also comes to admire Ron when he receives one of Ron's Christmas sweaters.

== Analysis ==

It is possible that Rowling has used the relationship between Harry and Dobby to send a message to the reader, teaching equality of all and using the difference in species to comment on racism. We are repeatedly told, by one wizard after another, that House-Elves are happy with their lot, that they exist to serve, and that granting them freedom would be an injustice; but Dobby, perfectly happy to be a Free Elf, shows that this generalization is, like all such, an over-simplification. However, by showing how the relationship between Harry and Dobby continues, and Dobby's essentially child-like nature, we can see how wizards in general could perpetuate this discrimination.

By the same token, we should note that Dobby's pleasure at being freed largely stems from the way he was maltreated by his owners, the Malfoy family. Dobby's treatment at the Malfoy's hands contrasts with the treatment of the Hogwarts house elves; while still subservient, the Hogwarts house elves are treated as individuals with worth, and are not abused or belittled. The Malfoys' treatment of Dobby displays how this sort of inequality can be abused.

It is also worth mentioning that Dobby's apparent pleasure at his freedom is one of the main things that supports Hermione's attempts to win freedom for house elves. None of the other Hogwarts house-elves seems to want freedom, to the point of refusing to clean Gryffindor tower because of the elf hats Hermione knits and leaves lying around. Dobby, as a Free Elf and already clothed, thus ends up cleaning the Gryffindor dormitory single-handed. Quite possibly, it is the difference in how they are treated that determines whether freedom is seen as a good thing or not, and it is only the very worst treatment that results in an elf being willing to risk the uncertainty of freedom.

We have now covered all the basic concepts using a computer.  In this chapter we are going to cover the concepts related to networking and using the Internet.

A '''network''' is a way of connecting two or more computers together so that they can share peripherals (hardware like printers) and data.  The most common form of network uses '''Ethernet'''.  Ethernet is a system of data transfer that uses two different kinds of wire, the older one being like a cable television wire and the newer one being like telephone wire.  The newer one is faster and uses an end called '''RJ-45''', which looks like a fat telephone cable end.  Normally, computers are plugged into a '''hub''', or '''switch''' using an internal piece of hardware called an '''Ethernet card''' or simply a '''network card''' and one of these cables.  Then they can all communicate with each other.

Once the computers can communicate, each item (i.e. printer or folder) that needs to be accessed on the network must be '''shared''', allowing it to be visible to the other computers.  Any shared item may be blocked off from general use by a password.  One of the other benefits of networks is '''email''' (electronic mail).  Email allows users to send messages and files to each other.  When a new message is received it goes into the users '''inbox''' for storage until it is read, so that a user may receive mail while away from the computer.

Ethernet networks create what is called '''Local Area Network'''s ('''LAN'''s).  This means that they are used within one area (i.e. a house or business building) and that is it.  All the computers in that area may be connected, but no one else.  This can be a problem depending on what you want to do, and a larger network could open up immense possibilities.  Enter the '''Internet'''.  In 1957, just after the USSR launched Sputnik, the American government created ARPA, a scientific research branch for the military.  In 1969 ARPA decided to attempt the creation of a national computer network for communications by the military.  They did not want to use any standard system, however, not just because of the distance, but because of the fear of nuclear attack.  They wanted a network where there was not central hub that could be taken out, but where all remaining parts would function if any other part were destroyed.

After their success, the idea spread.  Different government and educational institutions started connecting into the network.  Because they all used the same '''protocol''' (a set of rules that computers use to communicate, in this case '''TCP/IP''') and the same wires that carried telephone across the country as soon as they plugged in it was the same network.  Soon different institutions were creating their own '''server'''s (computers that store information meant to be accessed on a network).  By 1989 there were more than 100 000 servers on what was becoming known as ‘the Internet’.  After the Cold War the American government no longer needed a specifically protected portion of this network they had started for their own and the Internet became completely public domain.

In 1990 Tim Berners-Lee invented a protocol based on TCP/IP that could work with it on the Internet and was more flexible.  Soon after this, the NCSA (National Centre for Supercomputing Applications) developed Mosaic, a graphical interface for this protocol called the '''World Wide Web''' ('''WWW''').

The rest of this chapter is going to be spent looking at the WWW (or ‘'''the Web'''’).  To view '''Web pages''' (the electronic documents with pictures and formatted text that you view on the Web) you need to have a '''Web browser'''.  The two most popular browsers are Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer.  You can use either one or any other Web browser.  If you are not sure what you have, then you will still have Internet Explorer, it comes with Windows.

To do anything '''online''' (on the Internet), you must first connect to the Internet.  If you don’t know how, see Appendix B.  After you have connected to the Internet, open your Web browser.  Every computer connected to the Internet has an address, called an '''IP address''' to identify it.  This is a number like ‘207.194.50.216’.  To have to remember something like that to access a web page would be a pain, so '''Domain Name'''s were created.  Domain names are names that you can type in the '''location bar''' (more on this below) in your browser.  The name is then sent to a server on the Internet called a '''DNS''' ('''Domain Name Service''') '''server''' that then returns the correct IP address.

You should be connected to the Internet and have your browser open.  (You may not have access to the Internet where you live.  Your teacher will provide a substitute.)  First we should identify the parts of a browser so that we know what we’re talking about.  Figure 6.1 is a picture of Internet Explorer.  If your browser looks a little different, that is okay.


The location bar can also be called the address bar, and it is where you type the '''URL''' ('''Universal Resource Locator '''or '''Uniform Resource Locator'''), which is laid out as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;
| http:// || home.golden.net || /~psweber/
|-
| The protocol name || The domain name || The folder and/or file name on the server
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

After you type the URL press the Enter key and you web browser will take you to the page.  The first button on the toolbar is the ‘Back’ button.  It does the same thing as the ‘&lt; Back’ button that we saw before, it goes to the previous screen you were looking at.  In this case, the previous web page you were at.  The back arrow on the button is a '''universal icon'''.  Universal icons are ones that are always used to represent the same function.  This is different from a program icon like on your desktop or from an icon that only occurs in one program.  Even the ‘&lt; Back’ button has a back arrow, that’s what the ‘&lt;’ is for.  Note that universal icons do not always look exactly the same (i.e. the arrow can look different, as long as it points left).

A universal icon also identifies the next button on the toolbar, the ‘Next’ button.  If you push the back button, then you can go forwards again by pushing this button.  The next button on the toolbar has two universal icons used together.  A sheet of paper represents a file.  An ‘X’ represents stop.  So the sheet of paper with an ‘X’ on it represents stop loading the file, which is what this button does.  Some web browsers have just and ‘X’ or have a red stoplight on this button.  They mean the same thing, stop.

Two icons are also used on the next toolbar button.  The paper means the same thing, and the arrows going around mean refresh or reload.  This is actually typically a Microsoft icon, although some other companies also use it.  The reload button in Netscape as a bent up-arrow, signifying looking at the server again.  This button forces the web browser to look at the server and download all the data for a web page again.  This is primarily used for when the '''cache''' (the place where a web browser stores web pages on your hard drive for quicker access) has an old version of the page that the web browser is displaying and you want to see the newest version of the page.

The next two buttons on the toolbar are the last ones with universal icons.  They have a house, and a magnifying glass.  A house represents ‘home’ and this button takes you to your home page.  A home page is a web page that you have set up for your browser to take you to when it first starts or when you click this button.  The magnifying class represents ‘search’ and this button will take you to a web page from which to search the Internet.

There is one more thing you need to know about if you are going to be using web pages, '''hyperlinks'''.  Hyperlinks (one is labelled in the picture above) can be either text or pictures.  When they are text they are often a different colour and underlined.  When you click on them they take you to a different web page.  The text ones are a different colour once you have been to the web page they point to.  Some text hyperlinks are formatted differently, though, and many hyperlinks are pictures.  How can you know if something is a hyperlink?  Hover your cursor over it and if it is a hyperlink your cursor will turn into a hand, and usually the URL that the hyperlink (or just '''link''') points to will be displayed in the status bar.

The web is very useful for getting information this way, but what if you don’t know the URL you need?  That is why '''search engines''' were created.  There are more than 10 billion web pages on the Internet, not all of them are catalogued in all search engines and when you search for something you will tend to get pages that have nothing to do with what you want.  However there are some ways to improve your search results.

Go to a search engine.  They all work much the same but if you don’t know of one go to [http://www.google.com http://www.google.com].  In the text box you can type '''keywords''' (words that have something to do with what you want to find).  Some search engines have more advanced features that you can explore on your own, but all of them support '''Boolean operators'''.  The two most useful for web searches are AND and OR.  It is best to type them in all caps.  AND tells the search engine that the things on both sides must be in the web page (they may be in its text or in its '''META''' '''tag'''s).  OR tells the search engine that one or the other must be in the web page.  So typing ‘boats AND models’ will look for all pages containing both words, whereas ‘boats OR models’ will find any page with either word.  You can also use NOT, ‘boats NOT Titanic’ returns everything containing ‘boats’ that does not contain ‘Titanic’

You can do more complicated strings too, like ‘boats AND models OR ships AND kits’ which finds all pages containing both ‘boats’ and ‘models’ or both ‘ships’ and ‘kits’.  You can also do something like this, ‘boats OR ships AND models OR kits’ which finds anything containing the word ‘boats’ or ‘ships’ along with either ‘models’ or ‘kits’.</text>

== E-mail==
Email was already partially explained when we talked about networks.  The Internet is often called a ‘network of networks’ but it still has many of the things a network has.  One of those things is the ability to do email.  The problem with email over the Internet is that it would be impossible to list every person on the Internet in one place, have it current with their names, have those names be unique, and still have it be useful.  Since this is the way email on LANs works there needed to be a better addressing system.  Email addresses on the Internet work with domain names, but not with URLs.  All email addresses go by the format ‘username@domain.name’ , where domain is usually the website you sign up.  Thus ‘julia@yahoo.ca’ is the email address for the person who signed up with Yahoo! Canada for an email address under the username of ‘julia’.  ‘julia62@yahoo.ca’ is what happens when a name was already taken and someone else wants it.

Email typically operates on two sub-protocols of TCP/IP, '''SMTP''' and '''POP3'''.  SMTP is used for sending email, and IMAP(or the older POP3)is used for downloading (taking off the Internet and putting on your computer) email.  Many different email programs exist , for desktops and mobile(iOS , Android , Windows Phone etc).  Three of the most popular are '''GMail(Android)''', '''Microsoft Outlook''', and '''Windows Mail'''.  Another popular way to access email is through a web page interface.  There are many differences between all the major programs, however there are some things that are standard.

You can create and email, usually by clicking on a button or link labeled ‘new message’.  The universal icon for an email message (or just for email) is an envelope and the universal icon for ‘new’ is a star.  So there may be an icon of an envelope with a star or something like that.  Remember to use tool-tips to find out what buttons with no labels are called.  You type one (or more than one separated by a comma) email address in the box labeled ‘To:’.  The ‘From:’ box is usually filled in automatically(you may be given options if you use a mail client and have 2 or more e-mail addresses , in which case you should choose the e-mail address you want to send from), and then there are ‘Cc:’(Carbon Copy) and ‘Bcc:’(Blind Carbon Copy)..  You can put email addresses in them and the email will be copied to them so that all can see it was copied to all the persons(Cc) or so that they cannot(Bcc), respectively.  You then type the text for your message into the big text box at the bottom.

If you are connected to the Internet when you click the ‘Send’ button (or other similar button) on the email it will go immediately.  If you are not (or if the button is called ‘Queue’) then the messages go into you '''Outbox''' until you check your mail.  To check your email(which is usually done automatically) (that is, to download new messages and send the ones in the outbox) click the ‘Check Mail’, ‘Send and Receive’ or other similar button.  A progress bar will appear in the status bar or a window will come up with one so that you can know when it is finished.  All new messages go into your Inbox, unless you have '''filter'''s set up (we will not be discussing filters in this book).  You can then move them into other mailboxes that you have created by drag-and-drop.  (To create a new mailbox there should be a ‘Create new mailbox’ on the menu or on a popup-menu for the Inbox.)

Some emails have '''attachment'''s, these are files that are in the email that you can open and/or save.  The universal icon for attachments is a paper clip.  You can attach file to you emails by clicking the ‘Attach’ or similar button.  You can open files in email that you receive by either clicking on their icon at the end of an email, or double clicking on it in the ‘Attachments:’ spot at the top, depending on your program. It is important to take caution when opening attachments , as viruses are easily hidden inside attachments. Also there can be file limits depending on your provider.
== Chat rooms ==
Email is very useful, but what if you want to talk to someone directly?  So '''chat-rooms''' were invented.  Chat-rooms are found on web pages all over the place, some are public, and some you need a membership for.  Once you are in, to use it is simple.  There is (usually) a list of the nicknames (or handles, fake names people use on the Internet) somewhere on the page, and when you sign in you give it the one you use.  You type something in a text box at the bottom and press either the ‘Enter’ key or the ‘Send’ or ‘Say’ button and your messages is visible to everyone in the chat-room in the text box above, including yourself.  
=== IRC(Internet Relay Chat)
'''IRC chat''' was designed to go a step further.  You need a program for it and it has a few more features (like the ability to ‘whisper’ to only one person in the room).
== IM(Instant Messaging) ==
'''IM''' (Instant Messaging) was designed for one-on-one or conferencing, much like telephones.  Everyone has a unique nickname or number that you must know in order to contact them with a message, send them a file, or do a real-time chat, depending on what your program supports.  You add people to your '''contact list''' or '''buddy list''' and then if you are online, the program notifies you when they are too.  Then you can send them messages, chat with messages, or do other things.

Some IM programs also let you send them messages when they are offline that they will get when they come online.  Something like email, but it works faster.  You can also usually invite other people on your list into an existing chat (or messaging) session so that you can have a little chat room with only people you want.  There are new features coming out for computers all the time.  Many IM programs now let you talk with the people while chatting or even see them!  The biggest advantage over telephones?  You can talk to anyone in the world for any length of time without paying more than your monthly Internet bill.  No long-distance charges!</text>

The Internet is an integral part of Windows. There are many ways of connecting to the Internet.

# '''Using a dial-up connection''':-To create a new dial-up connection to the Internet (that is, not a high-speed broadband connection) navigate to one of the three places above (if it is the last one click on ‘Show all connections’).  Then there will be either an icon that says ‘Make New Connection’ or an item on the left-hand side labeled ‘Create a new connection’.  Open the one that your computer has and follow the instructions.  If it is called ‘Create a new connection’ you can also create a high-speed connection in there. This system is outdated , with most computers not having an RJ-45(telephone jack) connector anymore. Dial-ups are also very slow.
# '''Using Ethernet''':- Mostly , you can simply connect the cable and then connect to the Internet. If that does not work , make sure that the latest drivers are installed and that the connection is not disabled. Ethernet is often faster than Wi-Fi , where CAT5E can get up to 1Gbps(125 MB/s) while the latest Wi-Fi 802.11 ac can get up to about 600Mbps(75 Mb/s) and the more common 802.11 n can get up to about 130 Mbps(16.25 Mb/s) to 300 Mbps(47.5 MB/s). The common types of Ethernet are:-
## CAT3 , offers up to about 10Mbps(1.25 Mb/s)
## CAT5 , offers up to about 100Mbps(12.5 Mb/s)
## CAT5E , offers up to about 1Gbps(125 Mb/s)
Note that they are both backwards and forward comparable(both socket and cable) but you'll not get the benefit of the newer standard.
# '''Wi-Fi''':- Wi-Fi(Wireless Fidelity) is a very popular method of connecting to the internet both at home through a router , and outside at popular malls and cafes. First you need to make sure that the network you want to connect is within range. Then click the wireless icon(or open the Charms and click Network) on the taskbar and click Connect to Network. If you see no networks , make sure that Wi-Fi is not disabled. You can go to Network Connections in Windows XP + or open the Charms bar in Windows 8+ , click Network and ensure that Wi-Fi is enabled and Airplane mode is disabled. Click then network , and enter the password if you're prompted. Sometimes , you cannot find your preferred network. In this case , if you know the name , you can click Hidden Network in the list of networks and enter its name. Sometimes , you do not have to enter the password. Instead , you can click on a button and then it'll connect. This feature is called Wireless Protected Setup(WPS) and while it can be easy, it is not recommended as it is not that secure. The common types of Wi-Fi are
## 802.11 b , offers up to about 11 Mbps(1.375 Mb/s)
## 802.11 g , offers up to about 54 Mbps(6.75 Mb/s)
## 802.11 n , offers up to about 130 Mbps(16.25 Mb/s) in 20Mhz frequency and about 300Mbps(47.5 Mbps) in 40Mhz frequency.
## 802.11 a , offers up to about 54 Mbps(6.75 Mb/s). Uses a different frequency type(5Ghz) and has shorter range.
## 802.11 ac , offers up to about 600 Mbps(75 Mb/s)
Note that they can reduce their speeds dynamically(eg - from 11 Mbps to 5 Mbps) if there is not enough range.</text>

'''How Do You Know You Have Mail?'''

The easiest way to check is to log into Gmail. Once you've logged in, your Inbox tab will be bold in the left-side navigation, and it will have the number of new e-mails in parentheses. Additionally, you can see which ones are new, because they are bold and highlighed in white, whereas read e-mails are highlighted in light blue. If you use your customized Google homepage, a preview of your Inbox and the first 5 e-mails appears by default in the top right-hand corner. If any of the top 5 e-mails in your inbox are new, they will be bold in your homepage module. If you use the Gmail Notifier, the grey Gmail icon in your task manager will turn blue when there is unread mail. When mail is received, it will give you a quick preview of your new mail.


'''Reading Your E-Mail'''

Once you've logged into your Gmail account, reading your e-mail is as easy as clicking on the e-mail you'd like to read. You can click anywhere on the e-mail you'd like: the subject, the sender's address, or the date - they'll all take you to the same place. If the e-mail is new (has not been read), the line highlighting this particular e-mail will be white. If it has been read, it will be light blue. If you are using your personalized Gmail homepage, you can click on the Inbox link to read all of your mail or on any of the first 5 e-mails in your inbox to view it directly.

Gmail was created to be extremely easy to use, with as many useful features as possible, while omitting unnecessary options. All the standard e-mail features you'd expect are here, including automatic filters, easy forwarding and replying, and group mail composition. So, what sets Gmail apart from the rest?


'''Quick Previews'''

Whether you're looking at your inbox through your customized Google homepage, the Gmail Notifier, or in your inbox, you'll notice that Gmail gives you more than the sender name and the subject. After the subject (in bold), Gmail uses any extra space available to give you a quick preview of the e-mail's content.


'''Easy Searching'''

In your inbox, you can use the convenient search box to find any keyword in your inbox and archives. If you don't find what you're looking for, you can expand your search to include spam and trash.


'''Archives'''

Do you have an e-mail that you just can't throw away? If you don't want it to clutter your inbox, simply select the checkbox next to the e-mail, and click Archive. The e-mail no longer appears in your inbox, but you can easily access it through the search feature or by choosing All Mail in the left navigation.


'''[[../Stars/]]'''

This feature is the equivalent of &quot;flagging&quot;. To set an e-mail apart from the rest and include it in a special category, click on the hollow star next to any e-mail. (You can also choose Add Star in the drop-down menu of any e-mail.) To star multiple e-mails at once, check them all, and choose Add Star from the drop-down menu.


'''Labels'''

If you'd like to keep all your online shopping receipts together or create a category for e-mails from friends, family members or  email lists, you can create a label by clicking on New Label... in the drop-down menu. To apply a label, click on the label you want to apply in the drop-down menu. 


'''Auto Contact Additions'''

When someone e-mails you who is not already in your address book, Gmail automatically adds the e-mail address and contact name to your address book. As you type a name or e-mail address into the To: box, Gmail will suggest matching names and e-mail addresses from your current contacts.


'''Trash'''

Emails in the trash are automatically deleted forever in 30 days.</text>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The idea that pushed von Neumann to propose the cellular automata model, was constructing a self replicating machine, which components would obey physical laws defined by differential equations. His machine was constructed from approximately 200000 cells, each holding 29 different states. It diverged from physical laws and was so complex that was fully simulated on a computer only in 1989 (by Signorini) but the idea was born.

Cellular automata are now used to model several phenomena present in the physical world. Some models can only be used to express a basic idea of a phenomenon, others are accurate enough to be used for prediction.

== Real world phenomena that can be observed in cellular automata ==

Stephen Wolfram (1983) describes CA as:
:&quot;Cellular automata are sufficiently simple to allow detailed mathematical analysis, yet sufficiently complex to exhibit a wide variety of complicated phenomena.&quot;
He intensively investigated the phenomenology of simple discrete dynamic systems in his book ''A New Kind of Science'' (a very Wolfram-centric book, not really useful for serious scientific learning).

Let us just list some examples of physical phenomena and CA that exhibit similar behavior:
* Patterns on sea shells ''Cymbiola innexa'' are similar to patterns generated by rule 30 1D CA
* Growth of crystals especially patterns in snowflakes can be modeled by simple 2D CA
* Excitable media in biology (predator-prey dynamics) and chemistry (Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction) produce spiral patterns that can be seen in Greenberg-Hastings Models
* Self-replication is seen in the ''Langton loop'' (which is a small component of a simplified version of the original von Neumann self-replicating machine)
* Evolution (self-replication + mutation + selection) can be seen on the Evoloop model, a modified Langton loop
* Fractal growth of biological organisms
* Models of ''universal computation'' include rule 110 and the Game of Life
* The ''Game of Life'' exhibits interesting patterns that can't really be seen in the real world but they excite our imagination about what CA are capable of

== Models with prediction power for physical phenomena ==

Traditionally physical systems are described with differential equations. We use the top down approach, differential equations are discretized to difference systems that are simulated on a computer. There is a centuries long tradition of algebraic methods for the top down approach.

On the other hand CA models must be constructed using a bottom up approach, simple discrete systems must be modified to exhibit the same behavior as described by differential equations. Only recently with the popularization of computers we started researching algebraic methods for the bottom up approach.

Because of this not many models based on cellular automata really grew over the phenomenon hype to a useful tool.
* ''Lattice-gas cellular automata'' and ''Lattice Boltzmann models'' for modeling fluid dynamics, there are analytical methods that describe how such system can be constructed to exhibit behavior described by differential equations
* ''Stochastic cellular automata'' can model many physical phenomena, their probabilistic parameters can be adopted to a problem using evolutionary algorithms or machine learning THEE

Here you can set up many of the basic values pertaining to your website and your business. It is by far the largest menu section in CRE Loaded and also one of the largest in this book. If you find the Configuration section confusing don't worry, most options will only ever need to be set once and rarely altered.

== My Store ==

Things that you can set-up in [[CRE_Loaded_Features/Configuration/My_Store|My Store]] include:

*'''Contact details''' including the name of the store, owner of the store, address and phone number, e-mail addresses, country and zone. The name of the store's logo can also be set here.

*'''Day to day running of the store''' you can specify where you want extra order emails to be sent and whether you want to use DHTML drop-down menus or the side panel when in admin.

*'''Tax''' – how many decimal places to display and whether to include tax in prices or only at the checkout stage.

*'''Presentation and shop behaviour''' including how products are sorted in lists and how the customer searches are dealt with. You can decide whether to switch to default language currencies. Displaying the cart after products are added, displaying featured products in the main page and displaying category descriptions can all be switched on or off.

*'''Customer accounts settings''' – new account welcome gift voucher and coupon amounts and whether or not you want to allow guests to tell a friend.

Find out more about [[CRE_Loaded_Features/Configuration/My_Store|My Store]].

== Minimum Values ==

Things that you can set-up in [[CRE_Loaded_Features/Configuration/Minimum_Values|Minimum Values]] include:

*'''Customer registration minimums''' - character limits for personal details (names and addressess) and minimum dates of birth (i.e. the youngest that a customer can be). 

*'''Customer review minimums''' - lowest length in characters of customer reviews is set here. 

*'''Product lists minimums''' - for Best Seller, Also Purchased and X-Sell product lists which appear in various CRE Loaded boxes. 

Find out about [[CRE_Loaded_Features/Configuration/Minimum_Values|Minimum Values]].

== Maximum Values ==

Things that you can set-up in [[CRE_Loaded_Features/Configuration/Maximum Values|Maximum Values]] include:

*'''Customer registration minimums''' - address book entries is the only maximum you can set here which relate to customer registration.

Custards are a broad family of soft [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]-and-[[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] dishes.  They may be [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]], [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] or [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]], either in cups or one large dish. A British person talking about &quot;custard&quot; is referring to what other people might call [[Cookbook:Crème anglaise|crème anglaise]].

The usual rule for custards is about eight eggs to 1 liter (approximately 1 quart) of milk; but a very good custard can be made of six, or even fewer, especially with the addition of a level tablespoonful of sifted flour, thoroughly blended in the sugar first, before adding the other ingredients. It improves custard to first boil the milk and then cool it before being used; also a little salt adds to the flavor. A very small lump of butter may also be added, if one wants something especially rich.

To make custards look and taste better, duck's eggs should be used when obtainable; they add very much to the flavor and richness, and so many are not required as of ordinary eggs, four duck's eggs to the pint of milk making a delicious custard. When desired extremely rich and good, cream should be substituted for the milk, and double the quantity of eggs used to those mentioned, omitting the whites.

Eggs should always be thoroughly well beaten separately, the yolks first, then the sugar added, beat again, then add the beaten whites with the flavoring, then the (sometimes cooled) scalded milk. The lighter the eggs are beaten, the thicker and richer the custard.

The main point of writing a text is to convey ideas, information, or knowledge to the reader. The reader will
understand the text better if these ideas are well-structured, and will see and feel this structure much better if the typographical form reflects the logical and semantic structure of the content.

LaTeX is different from other typesetting systems in that you just have to tell it the logical and semantical structure of a text. It then derives
the typographical form of the text according to the “rules” given in the document class file and in various style files. LaTeX allows users to structure their documents with a variety of hierarchical constructs, including chapters, sections, subsections and paragraphs. 

==Global structure==

When LaTeX processes an input file, it expects it to follow a certain structure. Thus every input file must contain the commands

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{...}

\begin{document}
...
\end{document}
}}

The area between {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\documentclass{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{document}&lt;!----&gt;}} is called the ''preamble''. It normally contains commands that affect the entire document.

After the preamble, the text of your document is enclosed between two commands which identify the beginning and end of the actual document:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}
}}

You would put your text where the dots are. The reason for marking off the beginning of your text is that LaTeX allows you to insert extra setup specifications before it (where the blank line is in the example above: we'll be using this soon). The reason for marking off the end of your text is to provide a place for LaTeX to be programmed to do extra stuff automatically at the end of the document, like making an index.

A useful side-effect of marking the end of the document text is that you can store comments or temporary text underneath the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end{document}&lt;!----&gt;}} in the knowledge that LaTeX will never try to typeset them:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\end{document}
...

}}

==Preamble==

===Document classes===

When processing an input file, LaTeX needs to know the type of document the author wants to create. This is specified with the &lt;code&gt;\documentclass&lt;/code&gt; command. It is recommended to put this declaration at the very beginning.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[options]{class}
&lt;!----&gt;}}

Here, &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; specifies the type of document to be created. The LaTeX distribution provides additional classes for other documents, including letters and slides. It is also possible to create your own, as is often done by journal publishers, who simply provide you with their own class file, which tells LaTeX how to format your content. But we'll be happy with the standard article class for now. The &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; parameter customizes the behavior of the document class. The options have to be separated by commas. 

Example: an input file for a LaTeX document could start with the line

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[11pt,twoside,a4paper]{article}
&lt;!----&gt;}}

which instructs LaTeX to typeset the document as an article with a base font size of 11 points, and to produce a layout suitable for double sided printing on A4 paper.

Here are some document classes that can be used with LaTeX:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+Document Classes
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|article }}
| For articles in scientific journals, presentations, short reports, program documentation, invitations, ...
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|IEEEtran}}
| For articles with the IEEE Transactions format.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|proc}}
| A class for proceedings based on the article class.
|-
&lt;!----| {{LaTeX/Environment|minimal}}
| Is as small as it can get. It only sets a page size and a base font. It is mainly used for debugging purposes.
|- -----&gt;
| {{LaTeX/Environment|report}}
| For longer reports containing several chapters, small books, thesis, ...
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|book}}
| For real books.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|slides}}
| For slides. The class uses big sans serif letters.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|memoir}}
| For changing sensibly the output of the document. It is based on the {{LaTeX/Environment|book}} class, but you can create any kind of document with it [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/memman.pdf]
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|letter}}
| For writing letters. 
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|beamer}}
| For writing presentations (see [[LaTeX/Presentations]]). 
|}

The standard document classes that are a part of LaTeX are built to be fairly generic, which is why they have a lot of options in common. Other classes may have different options (or none at all). Normally, third party classes come with some documentation to let you know. The most common options for the standard document classes are listed in the following table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+&lt;span id=&quot;Document Class Options&quot;&gt;Document Class Options&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|10pt, 11pt, 12pt}}
|Sets the size of the main font in the document. If no option is specified, 10pt is assumed.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|a4paper, letterpaper,}}...
|Defines the paper size. The default size is {{LaTeX/Parameter|letterpaper}}; However, many European distributions of TeX now come pre-set for A4, not Letter, and this is also true of all distributions of pdfLaTeX. Besides that, {{LaTeX/Parameter|a5paper, b5paper, executivepaper}}, and {{LaTeX/Parameter|legalpaper}} can be specified.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|fleqn}}
|Typesets displayed formulas left-aligned instead of centered.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|leqno}}
|Places the numbering of formulas on the left hand side instead of the right.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|titlepage, notitlepage}}
|Specifies whether a new page should be started after the document title or not. The article class does not start a new page by default, while report and book do.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|twocolumn}}
|Instructs LaTeX to typeset the document in two columns instead of one.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|twoside, oneside}}
|Specifies whether double or single sided output should be generated. The classes {{LaTeX/Environment|article}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|report}} are single sided and the {{LaTeX/Environment|book}} class is double sided by default. Note that this option concerns the style of the document only. The option {{LaTeX/Parameter|twoside}} does not tell the printer you use that it should actually make a two-sided printout.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|landscape}}
|Changes the layout of the document to print in landscape mode.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|openright, openany}}
|Makes chapters begin either only on right hand pages or on the next page available. This does not work with the {{LaTeX/Environment|article}} class, as it does not know about chapters. The {{LaTeX/Environment|report}} class by default starts chapters on the next page available and the {{LaTeX/Environment|book}} class starts them on right hand pages.
|-
|{{LaTeX/Parameter|draft}}
|makes LaTeX indicate hyphenation and justification problems with a small square in the right-hand margin of the problem line so they can be located quickly by a human. It also suppresses the inclusion of images and shows only a frame where they would normally occur.
|-
|}

For example, if you want a report to be in 12pt type on A4, but printed one-sided in draft mode, you would use:
	
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,oneside,draft]{report}
&lt;!----&gt;}}

===Packages===

While writing your document, you will probably find that there are some areas where basic LaTeX cannot solve your problem. If you want to include graphics, colored text or source code from a file into your document, you need to enhance the capabilities of LaTeX. Such enhancements are called packages. Some packages come with the LaTeX base distribution. Others are provided separately. Modern TeX distributions come with a large number of packages pre-installed. The command to use a package is pretty simple: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage}}:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[options]{package}
&lt;!----&gt;}}

command, where package is the name of the package and options is a list of keywords that trigger special features in the package. For example, to use the {{LaTeX/Package|color}} package, which lets you typeset in colors, you would type:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{color}

\begin{document}
...
\end{document}
}}
&lt;!---------- not recommended, deleted
makes the rest useless, deleted as well.
-----&gt;
You can pass several options to a package, each separated by a comma.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[option1,option2,option3]{''package_name''}
}}

==The ''document'' environment==

=== Top matter ===

At the beginning of most documents there will be information about the document itself, such as the title and date, and also information about the authors, such as name, address, email etc. All of this type of information within LaTeX is collectively referred to as ''top matter''. Although never explicitly specified (there is no {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\topmatter}} command) you are likely to encounter the term within LaTeX documentation.

A simple example:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{report}

\begin{document}
\title{How to Structure a LaTeX Document}
\author{Andrew Roberts}
\date{December 2004}
\maketitle
\end{document}
}}

The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\title}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\author}}, and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\date}} commands are self-explanatory. You put the title, author name, and date in curly braces after the relevant command. The title and author are usually compulsory (at least if you want LaTeX to write the title automatically); if you omit the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\date}} command, LaTeX uses today's date by default. You always finish the top matter with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\maketitle}} command, which tells LaTeX that it's complete and it can typeset the title according to the information you have provided and the class (style) you are using. If you omit {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\maketitle&lt;!----&gt;}}, the titling will never be typeset (unless you write your own).

Here is a more complicated example:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\title{How to Structure a \LaTeX{} Document}
\author{Joe Bloggs\\
  School of Computing,\\
  University of Study,\\
  Books,\\
  United Readdom,\\
  RN 1234\\
  \texttt{jbloggs@latex.wizard}&lt;!----&gt;}
\date{\today}
\maketitle
}}&lt;!----- ok so far :BJ ----&gt;

As you can see, you can use commands as arguments of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\title}} and the others. The double backslash ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}}) is the LaTeX command for forced linebreaks in tabular material.&lt;!------JB: the following is true, but has nothing to do with the author command
 LaTeX normally decides by itself where to break lines, and it's usually right, but sometimes you need to cut a line short, like here, and start a new one.--------&gt;

If there are two authors separate them with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\and}} command:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\title{Our Fun Document}
\author{Jane Doe \and John Doe} 
\date{\today}
\maketitle
}}

&lt;!----- JB: omitted; publisher classes and the ams-classes are special and should not just be treated in a few sentences, if so, where is memoir and KOMA?

If you are provided with a class file from a publisher, or if you use the AMS article class ({{LaTeX/Package|amsart}}), then you can use several different commands to enter author information. The email address is at the end, and the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\texttt}} commands formats the email address using a mono-spaced font. The built-in command called {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\today}} will be replaced with the current date when processed by LaTeX. But you are free to put whatever you want as a date, in no set order. If braces are left empty, then the date is omitted. ------&gt;

Using this approach, you can create only basic output whose layout is very hard to change. If you want to create your title freely, see the [[LaTeX/Title_Creation|Title Creation]] section.

=== Abstract ===

As most research papers have an abstract, there are predefined commands for telling LaTeX which part of the content makes up the abstract. This should appear in its logical order, therefore, after the top matter, but before the main sections of the body. This command is available for the document classes ''article'' and ''report'', but not ''book''. 

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
Your abstract goes here...
...
\end{abstract}
...
\end{document}
}}

By default, LaTeX will use the word &quot;Abstract&quot; as a title for your abstract. If you want to change it into anything else, e.g. &quot;Executive Summary&quot;, add the following line before you begin the abstract environment:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Executive Summary}
}}

=== Sectioning commands ===

The commands for inserting sections are fairly intuitive. Of course, certain commands are appropriate to different document classes. For example, a book has chapters but an article doesn't. Here are some of the structure commands found in ''simple.tex''.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter's content...

\section{Structure}
This section's content...

\subsection{Top Matter}
This subsection's content...

\subsubsection{Article Information}
This subsubsection's content...
}}

Notice that you do not need to specify section numbers; LaTeX will sort that out for you. Also, for sections, you do not need to use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end&lt;!----&gt;}} commands to indicate which content belongs to a given block. 

LaTeX provides 7 levels of depth for defining sections (see table below). Each section in this table is a subsection of the one above it.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Command
!width=&quot;10%&quot;| Level
! Comment
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\part{''part''}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; | -1
| not in letters
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\chapter{''chapter''}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; | 0
| only books and reports
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\section{''section''}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; | 1
| not in letters
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\subsection{''subsection''}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; | 2
| not in letters
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\subsubsection{''subsubsection''}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; | 3
| not in letters
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\paragraph{''paragraph''}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; | 4
| not in letters
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\subparagraph{''subparagraph''}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; | 5
| not in letters
|-
|}

All the titles of the sections are added automatically to the table of contents (if you decide to insert one). But if you make manual styling changes to your heading, for example a very long title, or some special line-breaks or unusual font-play, this would appear in the Table of Contents as well, which you almost certainly don't want. LaTeX allows you to give an optional extra version of the heading text which only gets used in the Table of Contents and any running heads, if they are in effect. This optional alternative heading goes in [square brackets] before the curly braces:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\section[Effect on staff turnover]{An analysis of the
effect of the revised recruitment policies on staff
turnover at divisional headquarters}
}}

==== Section numbering ====

Numbering of the sections is performed automatically by LaTeX, so don't bother adding them explicitly, just insert the heading you want between the curly braces. Parts get roman numerals (Part I, Part II, etc.); chapters and sections get decimal numbering like this document, and appendices (which are just a special case of chapters, and share the same structure) are lettered (A, B, C, etc.).

You can change the depth to which section numbering occurs, so you can turn it off selectively. By default it is set to 3. If you only want parts, chapters, and sections numbered, not subsections or subsubsections etc., you can change the value of the {{LaTeX/Parameter|secnumdepth}} [[LaTeX/Counters|counter]] using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setcounter&lt;!----&gt;}} command, giving the depth level you wish. For example, if you want to change it to &quot;1&quot;:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{1}
}}

A related counter is {{LaTeX/Parameter|tocdepth}}, which specifies what depth to take the Table of Contents to. It can be reset in exactly the
same way as {{LaTeX/Parameter|secnumdepth}}. For example:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}
}}

To get an unnumbered section heading which does not go into the Table of Contents, follow the command name with an asterisk before the opening curly brace:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\subsection*{Introduction}
}}

All the divisional commands from {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\part*&lt;!----&gt;}} to {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\subparagraph*&lt;!----&gt;}} have this &quot;starred&quot; version which can be used on special occasions for an unnumbered heading when the setting of {{LaTeX/Parameter|secnumdepth}} would normally mean it would be numbered.

If you want the unnumbered section to be in the table of contents anyway, use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\addcontentsline}} command like this:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
}}

Note that if you use PDF bookmarks you will need to add a phantom section so that bookmark will lead to the correct place in the document. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\phantomsection}} command is defined in the {{LaTeX/Package|hyperref}} package, and is implemented normally as follows:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
\section*{Introduction} 
}}

For chapters you will also need to clear the page (this will also correct page numbering in the ToC):

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\cleardoublepage
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\bibliography{my_bib_file}
}}

The value where the section numbering starts from can be set with the following command:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setcounter{section}{4}
}}

The next section after this command will now be numbered 5.

For more details on counters, see the [[LaTeX/Counters|dedicated chapter]].

==== Section number style ====

See [[LaTeX/Counters|Counters]].

=== Ordinary paragraphs ===

Paragraphs of text come after section headings. Simply type the text and leave a blank line between paragraphs. The blank line means &quot;start a new paragraph here&quot;: it does '''not''' mean you get a blank line in the typeset output. For formatting paragraph indents and spacing between paragraphs, refer to the [[LaTeX/Paragraph Formatting#Paragraph_Indents|Paragraph Formatting]] section.

=== Table of contents ===

All auto-numbered headings get entered in the Table of Contents (ToC) automatically. You don't have to print a ToC, but if you want to, just add the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tableofcontents&lt;!----&gt;}} at the point where you want it printed (usually after the Abstract or Summary).

Entries for the ToC are recorded each time you process your document, and reproduced the next time you process it, so you need to re-run LaTeX one extra time to ensure that all ToC pagenumber references are correctly calculated. We've already seen how to use the optional argument to the sectioning commands to add text to the ToC which is slightly different from the one printed in the body of the document. It is also possible to add extra lines to the ToC, to force extra or unnumbered section headings to be included.

The commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\listoffigures&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\listoftables&lt;!----&gt;}} work in exactly the same way as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tableofcontents&lt;!----&gt;}} to automatically list all your tables and figures. If you use them, they normally go after the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tableofcontents&lt;!----&gt;}} command. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tableofcontents&lt;!----&gt;}} command normally shows only numbered section headings, and only down to the level defined by the {{LaTeX/Parameter|tocdepth}} counter, but you can add extra entries with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\addcontentsline&lt;!----&gt;}} command. For example if you use an unnumbered section heading command to start a preliminary piece of text like a Foreword or Preface, you can write:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\subsection*{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Preface}
}}

This will format an unnumbered ToC entry for &quot;Preface&quot; in the &quot;subsection&quot; style. You can use the same mechanism to add lines to the List of Figures or List of Tables by substituting {{LaTeX/Parameter|lof}} or {{LaTeX/Parameter|lot}} for {{LaTeX/Parameter|toc}}. If the hyperref package is used and the link does not point to the correct chapter, the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\phantomsection&lt;!----&gt;}} in combination with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\clearpage&lt;!----&gt;}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cleardoublepage&lt;!----&gt;}} can be used (see also [[LaTeX/Labels and Cross-referencing#phantomsection|Labels and Cross-referencing]]):

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\cleardoublepage
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{List of Figures}
\listoffigures
}}

To change the title of the TOC, you have to paste this command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\renewcommand{\contentsname}{&lt;New table of contents title&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}} in your document preamble. The List of Figures (LoF) and List of Tables (LoT) names can be changed by replacing the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\contentsname&lt;!----&gt;}} with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\listfigurename&lt;!----&gt;}} for LoF and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\listtablename&lt;!----&gt;}} for LoT.

==== Depth ====
The default ToC will list headings of level 3 and above. To change how deep the table of contents displays automatically the following command can be used in the preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setcounter{tocdepth}{4}
}}

This will make the table of contents include everything down to paragraphs.   The levels are defined above on this page.
Note that this solution does not permit changing the depth dynamically.

You can change the depth of specific section type, which could be useful for PDF bookmarks (if you are using the {{LaTeX/Package|hyperref}} package) :

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\makeatletter
\renewcommand*{\toclevel@chapter}{-1} % Put chapter depth at the same level as \part.
\chapter{Epilogue}
\renewcommand*{\toclevel@chapter}{0} % Put chapter depth back to its default value.
\makeatother
}}

In order to further tune the display or the numbering of the table of contents, for instance if the appendix should be less detailed, you can make use of the {{LaTeX/Package|tocvsec2}} package ([http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tocvsec2 CTAN], [http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/tocvsec2/tocvsec2.pdf doc]).

== Book structure ==

The standard LaTeX {{LaTeX/Environment|book}} class follows the same layout described above with some additions. By default a book will be two-sided, ''i.e.'' left and right margins will change according to the page number parity. Furthermore current chapter and section will be printed in the header.

If you do not make use of chapters, it is barely useful to use the {{LaTeX/Environment|book}} class.

Additionally the class provides macros to change the formatting of some places of the document. We will give you some advice on how to use them properly.&lt;ref&gt;http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/20538/what-is-the-right-order-when-using-frontmatter-tableofcontents-mainmatter&lt;/ref&gt;

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{document}
\frontmatter

\maketitle

% Introductory chapters
\chapter{Preface}
% ...

\mainmatter
\chapter{First chapter}
% ...

\appendix
\chapter{First Appendix}

\backmatter
\chapter{Last note}
}}

* The frontmatter chapters will not be numbered. Page numbers will be printed in roman numerals. Frontmatter is not supposed to have sections, since they will be number {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=0.n&lt;!----&gt;}} because there is no chapter numbering. Check the [[LaTeX/Counters|Counters]] chapter for a fix.
* The mainmatter chapters works as usual. The command resets the page numbering. Page numbers will be printed in arabic numerals.
* The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\appendix&lt;!----&gt;}} macro can be used to indicate that following sections or chapters are to be numbered as appendices. Appendices can be used for the article class too:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\appendix
\section{First Appendix}
}}

Only use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\appendix&lt;!----&gt;}} macro once for all appendices.

* The backmatter behaves like the frontmatter. It has the same issue with section numbering.

As a general rule you should avoid mixing the command order. Nonetheless all commands are optional, so you might consider using only a few.

Note that the special content like the table of contents is considered as an unnumbered chapter.

=== Page order ===

This is one traditional page order for books.

;Frontmatter
# Half-title
# Empty
# Title page
# Information (copyright notice, ISBN, etc.)
# Dedication if any, else empty
# Table of contents
# List of figures (can be in the backmatter too)
# Preface chapter

;Mainmatter
# Main topic

;Appendix
# Some subordinate chapters

;Backmatter
# Bibliography
# Glossary / Index

&lt;!------ What the heck? Showing how to stick a screwdriver into the knee as well as placing a band-aid on the wound later. Don't!
Since there isn't anything useful in the example shown, i'll remove the block.
------&gt;

== Special pages ==

Comprehensive papers often feature special pages at the end, like indices, glossaries and bibliographies. Since this is a quite complex topic, we will give you details in the dedicated part ''Special Pages''.

=== Bibliography ===

Any good research paper will have a complete list of references. LaTeX has two ways of inserting your references into a document: 
*you can embed them within the document itself. It's simpler, but it can be time-consuming if you are writing several papers about similar subjects so that you often have to cite the same books.
*you can store them in an external [http://www.bibtex.org BibTeX file ] and then link them via a command to your current document and use a [http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/software/latex/showbst.html Bibtex style] to define how they appear. This way you can create a small database of the references you might use and simply link them, letting LaTeX work for you.

To learn how to add a bibliography to your document, see the [[LaTeX/Bibliography_Management|Bibliography Management]] section.

For any academic/research writing, incorporating references into a document is an important task.  Fortunately, LaTeX has a variety of features that make dealing with references much simpler, including built-in support for citing references.  However, a much more powerful and flexible solution is achieved thanks to an auxiliary tool called [http://www.bibtex.org BibTeX] (which comes bundled as standard with LaTeX).  Recently, BibTeX has been succeeded by BibLaTeX, a tool configurable within LaTeX syntax.

BibTeX provides for the storage of all references in an external, flat-file database.  (BibLaTeX uses this same syntax.)  This database can be referenced in any LaTeX document, and citations made to any record that is contained within the file.  This is often more convenient than embedding them at the end of every document written; a centralized bibliography source can be linked to as many documents as desired (write once, read many!).  Of course, bibliographies can be split over as many files as one wishes, so there can be a file containing sources concerning topic A (&lt;code&gt;a.bib&lt;/code&gt;) and another concerning topic B (&lt;code&gt;b.bib&lt;/code&gt;).  When writing about topic AB, both of these files can be linked into the document (perhaps in addition to sources &lt;code&gt;ab.bib&lt;/code&gt; specific to topic AB).

== Embedded system ==

If you are writing only one or two documents and aren't planning on writing more on the same subject for a long time, you might not want to waste time creating a database of references you are never going to use. In this case you should consider using the basic and simple bibliography support that is embedded within LaTeX.

LaTeX provides an environment called &lt;code&gt;thebibliography&lt;/code&gt; that you have to use where you want the bibliography; that usually means at the very end of your document, just before the &lt;code&gt;\end{document}&lt;/code&gt; command. Here is a practical example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{thebibliography}{9}

\bibitem{lamport94}
  Leslie Lamport,
  \emph{\LaTeX: a document preparation system},
  Addison Wesley, Massachusetts,
  2nd edition,
  1994.

\end{thebibliography}
&lt;/source&gt;

OK, so what is going on here? The first thing to notice is the establishment of the environment. &lt;code&gt;thebibliography&lt;/code&gt; is a keyword that LaTeX recognizes as everything between the begin and end tags as being data for the bibliography. The mandatory argument, which I supplied after the begin statement, is telling LaTeX how wide the item label will be when printed. Note however, that the number itself is not the parameter, but the number of digits is. Therefore, I am effectively telling LaTeX that I will only need reference labels of one character in length, which ultimately means no more than nine references in total. If you want more than nine, then input any two-digit number, such as '56' which allows up to 99 references.

Next is the actual reference entry itself. This is prefixed with the &lt;code&gt;\bibitem{''cite_key''}&lt;/code&gt; command. The ''cite_key'' should be a unique identifier for that particular reference, and is often some sort of mnemonic consisting of any sequence of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols (although not a comma). I often use the surname of the first author, followed by the last two digits of the year (hence ''lamport94''). If that author has produced more than one reference for a given year, then I add letters after, 'a', 'b', etc. But, you should do whatever works for you. Everything after the key is the reference itself. You need to type it as you want it to be presented. I have put the different parts of the reference, such as author, title, etc., on different lines for readability. These linebreaks are ignored by LaTeX. I wanted the title to be in italics, so I used the &lt;code&gt;\emph{}&lt;/code&gt; command to achieve this.

== Citations ==
To actually cite a given document is very easy. Go to the point where you want the citation to appear, and use the following: &lt;code&gt;\cite{''cite_key''}&lt;/code&gt;, where the ''cite_key'' is that of the bibitem you wish to cite. When LaTeX processes the document, the citation will be cross-referenced with the bibitems and replaced with the appropriate number citation. The advantage here, once again, is that LaTeX looks after the numbering for you. If it were totally manual, then adding or removing a reference would be a real chore, as you would have to re-number all the citations by hand.

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
Instead of WYSIWYG editors, typesetting systems like \TeX{} or \LaTeX{} \cite{lamport94} can be used.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Referring more specifically ===
Sometimes you want to refer to a certain page, figure or theorem in a text book. For that you can use the arguments to the &lt;code&gt;\cite&lt;/code&gt; command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\cite[chapter, p.~215]{citation01}
&lt;/source&gt;

The argument, &quot;p. 215&quot;, will show up inside the same brackets. Note the tilde in [p.~215], which replaces the end-of-sentence spacing with a non-breakable inter-word space. There are two reasons: end-of-sentence spacing is too wide, and &quot;p.&quot; should not be separated from the page number.

=== Multiple citations ===

When a sequence of multiple citations are needed, you should use a single &lt;code&gt;\cite{}&lt;/code&gt; command. The citations are then separated by commas. Here's an example: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\cite{citation01,citation02,citation03}
&lt;/source&gt;

The result will then be shown as citations inside the same brackets, depending on the citation style.

=== Bibliography styles ===

There are several different ways to format lists of bibliographic references and the citations to them in the text. These are called [[w:Citation#Styles|citation styles]], and consist of two parts: the format of the abbreviated citation (i.e. the marker that is inserted into the text to identify the entry in the list of references) and the format of the corresponding entry in the list of references, which includes full bibliographic details.

Abbreviated citations can be of two main types: numbered or textual. Numbered citations (also known as the [[w:Vancouver system|Vancouver referencing system]]) are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text, and consist in Arabic numerals in parentheses '''(1)''', square brackets '''[1]''', superscript'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''', or a combination thereof'''&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;'''. Textual citations (also known as the [[w:Parenthetical referencing|Harvard referencing system]]) use the author surname and (usually) the year as the abbreviated form of the citation, which is normally fully '''(Smith {{#time:Y | -10 years}})''' or partially enclosed in parenthesis, as in '''Smith ({{#time:Y | -10 years}})'''. The latter form allows the citation to be integrated in the sentence it supports.

&lt;!--In bibtex, these are implemented via &lt;tt&gt;.bst&lt;/tt&gt;--&gt;

Below you can see three of the styles available with LaTeX:
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;[[Image:LaTeX bibliography plain.svg|thumb|400px|none|plain]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;[[Image:LaTeX bibliography abbrv.svg|thumb|400px|none|abbrv]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;[[Image:LaTeX bibliography alpha.svg|thumb|400px|none|alpha]]&lt;/div&gt;
{{clear}}

Here are some more often used styles:
{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;
|-
! Style Name !! Author Name Format !! Reference Format !! Sorting
|-
| plain || Homer Jay Simpson || #ID# || by author
|-
| unsrt || Homer Jay Simpson || #ID# || as referenced
|-
| abbrv || H. J. Simpson || #ID# || by author
|-
| alpha || Homer Jay Simpson || Sim95 || by author
|-
| abstract || Homer Jay Simpson || Simpson-1995a || 
|-
| acm || Simpson, H. J. || #ID# ||
|-
| authordate1 || Simpson, Homer Jay || Simpson, 1995 ||
|-
| apa || Simpson, H. J. (1995) || Simpson1995 ||
|-
| named || Homer Jay Simpson || Simpson 1995 ||
|}

However, keep in mind that you will need to use the natbib package to use most of these.

=== No cite ===

If you only want a reference to appear in the bibliography, but not where it is referenced in the main text, then the &lt;code&gt;\nocite{}&lt;/code&gt; command can be used, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
Lamport showed in 1995 something...  \nocite{lamport95}.
&lt;/source&gt;

A special version of the command, &lt;code&gt;\nocite{*}&lt;/code&gt;, includes all entries from the database, whether they are referenced in the document or not.

=== Natbib ===

|}
Using the standard LaTeX bibliography support, you will see that each reference is numbered and each citation corresponds to the numbers. The numeric style of citation is quite common in scientific writing. In other disciplines, the author-year style, e.g., (Roberts, 2003), such as ''Harvard'' is preferred. A discussion about which is best will not occur here, but a possible way to get such an output is by the &lt;code&gt;natbib&lt;/code&gt; package. In fact, it can supersede LaTeX's own citation commands, as Natbib allows the user to easily switch between Harvard or numeric.

The first job is to add the following to your preamble in order to get LaTeX to use the Natbib package:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage[options]{natbib}
&lt;/source&gt;

Also, you need to change the bibliography style file to be used, so edit the appropriate line at the bottom of the file so that it reads: &lt;code&gt;\bibliographystyle{plainnat}&lt;/code&gt;. Once done, it is basically a matter of altering the existing &lt;code&gt;\cite&lt;/code&gt; commands to display the type of citation you want.

|-
|}

The main commands simply add a ''t'' for 'textual' or ''p'' for 'parenthesized', to the basic &lt;code&gt;\cite&lt;/code&gt; command. You will also notice how Natbib by default will compress references with three or more authors to the more concise ''1st surname et al'' version. By adding an asterisk (*), you can override this default and list all authors associated with that citation. There are some other specialized commands that Natbib supports, listed in the table here. Keep in mind that for instance &lt;code&gt;abbrvnat&lt;/code&gt; does not support &lt;code&gt;\citet*&lt;/code&gt; and will automatically choose between all authors and et al..

The final area that I wish to cover about Natbib is customizing its citation style. There is a command called &lt;code&gt;\bibpunct&lt;/code&gt; that can be used to override the defaults and change certain settings. For example, I have put the following in the preamble:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\bibpunct{(}{)}{;}{a}{,}{,}
&lt;/source&gt;

The command requires six mandatory parameters.

# The symbol for the opening bracket.
# The symbol for the closing bracket.
# The symbol that appears between multiple citations.
# This argument takes a letter: 
#* ''n'' - numerical style.
#* ''s'' - numerical superscript style.
#* ''any other letter'' - author-year style.
# The punctuation to appear between the author and the year (in parenthetical case only).
# The punctuation used between years, in multiple citations when there is a common author. e.g., (Chomsky 1956, 1957). If you want an extra space, then you need &lt;code&gt;{,~}&lt;/code&gt;.  

Some of the options controlled by &lt;code&gt;\bibpunct&lt;/code&gt; are also accessible by passing options to the natbib package when it is loaded.  These options also allow some other aspect of the bibliography to be controlled, and can be seen in the table (right).

So as you can see, this package is quite flexible, especially as you can easily switch between different citation styles by changing a single parameter. Do have a look at the [http://www.ctex.org/documents/packages/bibref/natbib.pdf Natbib manual], it's a short document and you can learn even more about how to use it.

== BibTeX ==

I have previously introduced the idea of embedding references at the end of the document, and then using the &lt;code&gt;\cite&lt;/code&gt; command to cite them within the text. In this tutorial, I want to do a little better than this method, as it's not as flexible as it could be.  I will concentrate on using [[w:BibTeX|BibTeX]].

A BibTeX database is stored as a ''.bib'' file. It is a plain text file, and so can be viewed and edited easily. The structure of the file is also quite simple. An example of a BibTeX entry:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot;&gt;
@article{greenwade93,
    author  = &quot;George D. Greenwade&quot;,
    title   = &quot;The {C}omprehensive {T}ex {A}rchive {N}etwork ({CTAN})&quot;,
    year    = &quot;1993&quot;,
    journal = &quot;TUGBoat&quot;,
    volume  = &quot;14&quot;,
    number  = &quot;3&quot;,
    pages   = &quot;342--351&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Each entry begins with the declaration of the reference type, in the form of &lt;code&gt;@''type''&lt;/code&gt;. BibTeX knows of practically all types you can think of, common ones are: ''book'', ''article'', and for papers presented at conferences, there is ''inproceedings''. In this example, I have referred to an article within a journal.

After the type, you must have a left curly brace '&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;' to signify the beginning of the reference attributes. The first one follows immediately after the brace, which is the ''citation key'', or the ''BibTeX key''. This key must be unique for all entries in your bibliography. It is this identifier that you will use within your document to cross-reference it to this entry. It is up to you as to how you wish to label each reference, but there is a loose standard in which you use the author's surname, followed by the year of publication. This is the scheme that I use in this tutorial.

Next, it should be clear that what follows are the relevant fields and data for that particular reference. The field names on the left are [[w:BibTeX#Bibliographic information file|BibTeX keywords]]. They are followed by an equals sign (=) where the value for that field is then placed. BibTeX expects you to explicitly label the beginning and end of each value. I personally use quotation marks (&quot;), however, you also have the option of using curly braces ('{', '}'). But as you will soon see, curly braces have other roles, within attributes, so I prefer not to use them for this job as they can get more confusing. A notable exception is when you want to use characters with umlauts (ü, ö, etc), since [[../Accents|their notation]] is in the format &lt;code&gt;\&quot;{o}&lt;/code&gt;, and the quotation mark will close the one opening the field, causing an error in the parsing of the reference.  Using &lt;code&gt;\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}&lt;/code&gt; in the preamble to the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; source file can get round this, as the accented characters can just be stored in the &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file without any need for special markup.  This allows a consistent format to be kept throughout the &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file, avoiding the need to use braces when there are umlauts to consider.

Remember that each attribute must be followed by a comma to delimit one from another. You do not need to add a comma to the last attribute, since the closing brace will tell BibTeX that there are no more attributes for this entry, although you won't get an error if you do.

It can take a while to learn what the reference types are, and what fields each type has available (and which ones are required or optional, etc). So, look at this [http://newton.ex.ac.uk/tex/pack/bibtex/btxdoc/node6.html entry type reference] and also this [http://newton.ex.ac.uk/tex/pack/bibtex/btxdoc/node7.html field reference] for descriptions of all the fields. It may be worth bookmarking or printing these pages so that they are easily at hand when you need them.

=== Authors ===

BibTeX can be quite clever with names of authors. It can accept names in ''forename surname'' or ''surname, forename''. I personally use the former, but remember that the order you input them (or any data within an entry for that matter) is customizable and so you can get BibTeX to manipulate the input and then output it however you like. If you use the ''forename surname'' method, then you must be careful with a few special names, where there are compound surnames, for example &quot;John von Neumann&quot;. In this form, BibTeX assumes that the last word is the surname, and everything before is the forename, plus any middle names. You must therefore manually tell BibTeX to keep the 'von' and 'Neumann' together. This is achieved easily using curly braces. So the final result would be &quot;John {von Neumann}&quot;.  This is easily avoided with the ''surname, forename'', since you have a comma to separate the surname from the forename.

Secondly, there is the issue of how to tell BibTeX when a reference has more than one author. This is very simply done by putting the keyword ''and'' in between every author. As we can see from another example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot;&gt;
@book{goossens93,
    author    = &quot;Michel Goossens and Frank Mittelbach and Alexander Samarin&quot;,
    title     = &quot;The LaTeX Companion&quot;,
    year      = &quot;1993&quot;,
    publisher = &quot;Addison-Wesley&quot;,
    address   = &quot;Reading, Massachusetts&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This book has three authors, and each is separated as described. Of course, when BibTeX processes and outputs this, there will only be an 'and' between the penultimate and last authors, but within the .bib file, it needs the ''and''s so that it can keep track of the individual authors.

=== Standard templates===

=== Preserving case of letters ===

In the event that BibTeX has been set by the chosen style to not preserve all capitalization within titles, problems can occur, especially if you are referring to proper nouns, or acronyms. To tell BibTeX to keep them, use the good old curly braces around the letter in question, (or letters, if it's an acronym) and all will be well!  It is even possible that lower-case letters may need to be preserved - for example if a chemical formula is used in a style that sets a title in all caps or small caps, or if &quot;pH&quot; is to be used in a style that capitalises all first letters.

:&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;title = &quot;The {LaTeX} Companion&quot;,&lt;/source&gt;

However, '''avoid''' putting the whole title in curly braces, as it will look odd if a different capitalization format is used:

:&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;title = &quot;{The LaTeX Companion}&quot;,&lt;/source&gt;

For convenience though, many people simply put double curly braces, which may help when writing scientific articles for different magazines, conferences with different BibTex styles that do sometimes keep and sometimes not keep the capital letters:

:&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;title = {{The LaTeX Companion}},&lt;/source&gt;

As an alternative, try other BibTex styles or modify the existing.  The approach of putting only relevant text in curly brackets is the most feasible if using a template under the control of a publisher, such as for journal submissions. Using curly braces around single letters is also to be avoided if possible, as it may mess up the kerning, especially with biblatex,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf The biblatex manual]&lt;/ref&gt; so the first step should generally be to enclose single words in braces.

=== A few additional examples ===

Below you will find a few additional examples of bibliography entries. The first one covers the case of multiple authors in the Surname, Firstname format, and the second one deals with the incollection case.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot;&gt;
@article{AbedonHymanThomas2003,
  author = &quot;Abedon, S. T. and Hyman, P. and Thomas, C.&quot;,
  year = &quot;2003&quot;,
  title = &quot;Experimental examination of bacteriophage latent-period evolution as a response to bacterial availability&quot;,
  journal = &quot;Applied and Environmental Microbiology&quot;,
  volume = &quot;69&quot;,
  pages = &quot;7499--7506&quot;
},

@incollection{Abedon1994,
  author = &quot;Abedon, S. T.&quot;,
  title = &quot;Lysis and the interaction between free phages and infected cells&quot;,
  pages = &quot;397--405&quot;,
  booktitle = &quot;Molecular biology of bacteriophage T4&quot;,
  editor = &quot;Karam, Jim D. Karam and Drake, John W. and Kreuzer, Kenneth N. and Mosig, Gisela
            and Hall, Dwight and Eiserling, Frederick A. and Black, Lindsay W. and Kutter, Elizabeth
            and Carlson, Karin and Miller, Eric S. and Spicer, Eleanor&quot;,
  publisher = &quot;ASM Press, Washington DC&quot;,
  year = &quot;1994&quot;
},
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have to cite a website you can use @misc, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot;&gt;
@misc{website:fermentas-lambda,
      author = &quot;Fermentas Inc.&quot;,
      title = &quot;Phage Lambda: description \&amp; restriction map&quot;,
      month = &quot;November&quot;,
      year = &quot;2008&quot;,
      url = &quot;http://www.fermentas.com/techinfo/nucleicacids/maplambda.htm&quot;
},
&lt;/source&gt;

The note field comes in handy if you need to add unstructured information, for example that the corresponding issue of the journal has yet to appear:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot;&gt;
@article{blackholes,
      author=&quot;Rabbert Klein&quot;,
      title=&quot;Black Holes and Their Relation to Hiding Eggs&quot;,
      journal=&quot;Theoretical Easter Physics&quot;,
      publisher=&quot;Eggs Ltd.&quot;,
      year=&quot;2010&quot;,
      note=&quot;(to appear)&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Getting current LaTeX document to use your .bib file ===

At the end of your LaTeX file (that is, after the content, but before &lt;code&gt;\end{document}&lt;/code&gt;), you need to place the following commands:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{sample1,sample2,...,samplen} 
% Note the lack of whitespace between the commas and the next bib file.
&lt;/source&gt;

Bibliography styles are files recognized by BibTeX that tell it how to format the information stored in the &lt;tt&gt;.bib&lt;/tt&gt; file when processed for output. And so the first command listed above is declaring which style file to use. The style file in this instance is &lt;tt&gt;plain.bst&lt;/tt&gt; (which comes as standard with BibTeX). You do not need to add the .bst extension when using this command, as it is assumed. Despite its name, the plain style does a pretty good job (look at the output of this tutorial to see what I mean).

The second command is the one that actually specifies the &lt;tt&gt;.bib&lt;/tt&gt; file you wish to use. The ones I created for this tutorial were called &lt;tt&gt;sample1.bib&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;sample2.bib&lt;/tt&gt;, . . ., &lt;tt&gt;samplen.bib&lt;/tt&gt;, but once again, you don't include the file extension. At the moment, the &lt;tt&gt;.bib&lt;/tt&gt; file is in the same directory as the LaTeX document too. However, if your .bib file was elsewhere (which makes sense if you intend to maintain a centralized database of references for all your research), you need to specify the path as well, e.g &lt;code&gt;\bibliography{/some/where/sample}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\bibliography{../sample1}&lt;/code&gt; (if the &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file is in the parent directory of the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; document that calls it).

Now that LaTeX and BibTeX know where to look for the appropriate files, actually citing the references is fairly trivial. The &lt;code&gt;\cite{''ref_key''}&lt;/code&gt; is the command you need, making sure that the ''ref_key'' corresponds exactly to one of the entries in the .bib file. If you wish to cite more than one reference at the same time, do the following: &lt;code&gt;\cite{''ref_key1'', ''ref_key2'', ..., ''ref_keyN''}&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Why won't LaTeX generate any output? ===

The addition of BibTeX adds extra complexity for the processing of the source to the desired output. This is largely hidden from the user, but because of all the complexity of the referencing of citations from your source LaTeX file to the database entries in another file, you actually need multiple passes to accomplish the task. This means you have to run LaTeX a number of times.  Each pass will perform a particular task until it has managed to resolve all the citation references. Here's what you need to type (into command line): 
# &lt;code&gt;latex latex_source_code.tex&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;bibtex latex_source_code.aux&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;latex latex_source_code.tex&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;latex latex_source_code.tex&lt;/code&gt;
(Extensions are optional, if you put them note that the bibtex command takes the AUX file as input.)

After the first LaTeX run, you will see errors such as:

&lt;pre&gt;
LaTeX Warning: Citation `lamport94' on page 1 undefined on input line 21.
...
LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references.
&lt;/pre&gt;

The next step is to run bibtex on that same LaTeX source (or more precisely the corresponding AUX file, however not on the actual .bib file) to then define all the references within that document. You should see output like the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
This is BibTeX, Version 0.99c (Web2C 7.3.1)
The top-level auxiliary file: latex_source_code.aux
The style file: plain.bst
Database file #1: sample.bib
&lt;/pre&gt;

The third step, which is invoking LaTeX for the second time will see more errors like &quot;&lt;tt&gt;LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. Don't be alarmed, it's almost complete. As you can guess, all you have to do is follow its instructions, and run LaTeX for the third time, and the document will be output as expected, without further problems.

If you want a pdf output instead of a dvi output you can use &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; as follows:

# &lt;code&gt;pdflatex latex_source_code.tex&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;bibtex latex_source_code.aux&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;pdflatex latex_source_code.tex&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;pdflatex latex_source_code.tex&lt;/code&gt;
(Extensions are optional, if you put them note that the bibtex command takes the AUX file as input.)

Note that if you are editing your source in vim and attempt to use command mode and the current file shortcut (%) to process the document like this:

#&lt;code&gt;:! pdflatex %&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;:! bibtex %&lt;/code&gt;

You will get an error similar to this:  

# &lt;code&gt;I couldn't open file name 'current_file.tex.aux'&lt;/code&gt;

It appears that the file extension is included by default when the current file command (%) is executed.  To process your document from within vim, you must explicitly name the file without the file extension for bibtex to work, as is shown below:

# &lt;code&gt;:! pdflatex %&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;:! bibtex %:r&lt;/code&gt; (without file extension, it looks for the AUX file as mentioned above)
# &lt;code&gt;:! pdflatex %&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;:! pdflatex %&lt;/code&gt;

However, it is much easier to install the Vim-LaTeX plugin from [http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/ here]. This allows you to simply type \ll when not in insert mode, and all the appropriate commands are automatically executed to compile the document. Vim-LaTeX even detects how many times it has to run pdflatex, and whether or not it has to run bibtex. This is just one of the many nice features of Vim-LaTeX, you can read the excellent [http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/documentation/latex-suite-quickstart/ Beginner's Tutorial] for more about the many clever shortcuts Vim-LaTeX provides.

Another option exists if you are running Unix/Linux or any other platform where you have [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29 make]. Then you can simply create a Makefile and use vim's make command or use make in shell. The Makefile would then look like this:

 latex_source_code.pdf: latex_source_code.tex latex_source_code.bib
 	pdflatex latex_source_code.tex
 	bibtex latex_source_code.aux
 	pdflatex latex_source_code.tex
 	pdflatex latex_source_code.tex

=== Including URLs in bibliography ===
As you can see, there is no field for URLs. One possibility is to include Internet addresses in &lt;code&gt;howpublished&lt;/code&gt; field of &lt;code&gt;@misc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt; field of &lt;code&gt;@techreport&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@article&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@book&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
howpublished = &quot;\url{http://www.example.com}&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the usage of &lt;code&gt;\url&lt;/code&gt; command to ensure [[LaTeX/Formatting#Typesetting URLs|proper appearance of URLs]].

Another way is to use special field &lt;tt&gt;url&lt;/tt&gt; and make bibliography style recognise it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
 url = &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You need to use &lt;code&gt;\usepackage{url}&lt;/code&gt; in the first case or &lt;code&gt;\usepackage{hyperref}&lt;/code&gt; in the second case.

Styles provided by Natbib (see below) handle this field, other styles can be modified using [http://purl.org/nxg/dist/urlbst urlbst] program. Modifications of three standard styles (plain, abbrv and alpha) are provided with urlbst.

=== Customizing bibliography appearance ===

One of the main advantages of BibTeX, especially for people who write many research papers, is the ability to customize your bibliography to suit the requirements of a given publication. You will notice how different publications tend to have their own style of formatting references, to which authors must adhere if they want their manuscripts published. In fact, established journals and conference organizers often will have created their own bibliography style (.bst file) for those users of BibTeX, to do all the hard work for you.

It can achieve this because of the nature of the .bib database, where all the information about your references is stored in a structured format, but nothing about style. This is a common theme in LaTeX in general, where it tries as much as possible to keep content and presentation separate.

A bibliography style file (&lt;tt&gt;.bst&lt;/tt&gt;) will tell LaTeX how to format each attribute, what order to put them in, what punctuation to use in between particular attributes etc. Unfortunately, creating such a style by hand is not a trivial task. Which is why &lt;tt&gt;Makebst&lt;/tt&gt; (also known as ''custom-bib'') is the tool we need.

&lt;tt&gt;Makebst&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to automatically generate a .bst file based on your needs. It is very simple, and actually asks you a series of questions about your preferences. Once complete, it will then output the appropriate style file for you to use.

It should be installed with the LaTeX distribution (otherwise, you can 
[http://www.mps.mpg.de/software/latex/localtex/localltx.html#makebst download it]) and it's very simple to initiate. At the command line, type:

 latex makebst

LaTeX will find the relevant file and the questioning process will begin. You will have to answer quite a few (although, note that the default answers are pretty sensible), which means it would be impractical to go through an example in this tutorial. However, it is fairly straight-forward. And if you require further guidance, then there is a comprehensive [http://www.mps.mpg.de/software/latex/localtex/doc/merlin.pdf manual] available. I'd recommend experimenting with it and seeing what the results are when applied to a LaTeX document.

If you are using a custom built .bst file, it is important that LaTeX can find it! So, make sure it's in the same directory as the LaTeX source file, ''unless'' you are using one of the standard style files (such as ''plain'' or ''plainnat'', that come bundled with LaTeX - these will be automatically found in the directories that they are installed. Also, make sure the name of the &lt;tt&gt;.bst&lt;/tt&gt; file you want to use is reflected in the &lt;code&gt;\bibliographystyle{style}&lt;/code&gt; command (but don't include the &lt;tt&gt;.bst&lt;/tt&gt; extension!).

=== Localizing bibliography appearance ===

When writing documents in languages other than English, you may find it desirable to adapt the appearance of your bibliography to the document language. This concerns words such as ''editors'', ''and'', or ''in'' as well as a proper typographic layout. The [http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/babelbib/ &lt;tt&gt;babelbib&lt;/tt&gt; package] can be used here. For example, to layout the bibliography in German, add the following to the header:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage[fixlanguage]{babelbib}
\selectbiblanguage{german}
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, you can layout each bibliography entry according to the language of the cited document:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage{babelbib}
&lt;/source&gt;

The language of an entry is specified as an additional field in the BibTeX entry:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bibtex&quot;&gt;
@article{mueller08,
  % ...
  language = {german}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

For &lt;tt&gt;babelbib&lt;/tt&gt; to take effect, a bibliography style supported by it - one of &lt;tt&gt;babplain&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;babplai3&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;babalpha&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;babunsrt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bababbrv&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;bababbr3&lt;/tt&gt; - must be used:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\bibliographystyle{babplain}
\bibliography{sample}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Showing unused items ===

Usually LaTeX only displays the entries which are referred to with &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\cite&lt;/source&gt;. It's possible to make uncited entries visible:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\nocite{Name89} % Show Bibliography entry of Name89
\nocite{*} % Show all Bib-entries
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Getting bibliographic data ===

Many online databases provide bibliographic data in BibTeX-Format, making it easy to build your own database.  
For example, [http://scholar.google.com Google Scholar] offers the option to return properly formatted output, which can also be turned on in the settings page.

One should be alert to the fact that bibliographic databases are frequently the product of several generations of automatic processing, and so the resulting BibTex code is prone to a variety of minor errors, especially in older entries.

=== Summary ===

Although it can take a little time to get to grips with BibTeX, in the long term, it's an efficient way to handle your references. It's not uncommon to find .bib files on websites that people compile as a list of their own publications, or a survey of relevant works within a given topic, etc. Or in those huge, online bibliography databases, you often find BibTeX versions of publications, so it's a quick cut-and-paste into your own .bib file, and then no more hassle!

Having all your references in one place can be a big advantage. And having them in a structured form, that allows customizable output is another one. There are a variety of free utilities that can load your .bib files, and allow you to view them in a more efficient manner, as well as sort them and check for errors.

== Bibliography in the table of contents ==

If you are writing a ''book'' or ''report'', you'll likely insert your bibliography using something like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{thebibliography}{99}
\bibitem{bib:one_book} some information
\bibitem{bib:one_article} other information
\end{thebibliography}
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, if you are using BibTeX, your references will be saved in a .bib file, and your TeX document will include the bibliography by these commands:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{mybibtexfile}
&lt;/source&gt;

Both of these examples will create a chapter-like (or section-like) output showing all your references. But even though the resulting “References” looks like a chapter or section, it will not be handled quite the same: it will not appear in the Table of Contents.

=== Using tocbibind ===
The most comfortable way of adding your bibliography to the table of contents is to use the dedicated package '''tocbibind''' that works with many standard document classes. Simply include this code in the preamble of your document:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage[nottoc]{tocbibind}
&lt;/source&gt;

This will include the Bibliography in the Table of Contents without numbering. If you want to have proper numbering, include the following code in the preamble:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage[nottoc,numbib]{tocbibind}
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''tocbibind''' package can also handle including the List of Figures, List of Tables and the Table of Contents itself in the Table of Contents. It has many options for numbering, document structure etc. to fit almost any scenario. See [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/tocbibind the '''tocbibind''' CTAN page] for detailed documentation.

=== Other methods ===
==== As unnumbered item ====
If you want your bibliography to be in the table of contents, just add the following two lines just before the ''thebibliography'' environment:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\clearpage% or cleardoublepage
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
&lt;/source&gt;

(OR &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Bibliography}&lt;/source&gt; if you're writing an ''article'')

The first line just terminates the current paragraph and page. If you are writing a ''book'', use &lt;tt&gt;\cleardoublepage&lt;/tt&gt; to match the style used. The second line will add a line in the Table of Contents (first option, ''toc''), it will be like the ones created by chapters (second option, ''chapter''), and the third argument will be printed on the corresponding line in the Table of Contents; here ''Bibliography'' was chosen because it's the same text the ''thebibliography'' environment will automatically write when you use it, but you are free to write whatever you like. If you are using separate bib file, add these lines between &lt;tt&gt;\bibliographystyle&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;\bibliography&lt;/tt&gt;.

If you use [[../Hyperlinks|hyperref]] package, you should also use &lt;code&gt;\phantomsection&lt;/code&gt; command to enable hyperlinking from the table of contents to bibliography.

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\clearpage% or cleardoublepage
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
&lt;/source&gt;

This trick is particularly useful when you have to insert the bibliography in the Table of Contents, but it can work for anything. When LaTeX finds the code above, it will record the info as described and the current page number, inserting a new line in the Contents page.

==== As numbered item ====
If you instead want bibliography to be numbered section or chapter, you'll likely use this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\cleardoublepage % This is needed if the book class is used, to place the anchor in the correct page,
                 % because the bibliography will start on its own page.
                 % Use \clearpage instead if the document class uses the &quot;oneside&quot; argument
\renewcommand*{\refname}{} % This will define heading of bibliography to be empty, so you can...
\section{Bibliography}     % ...place a normal section heading before the bibliography entries.

\begin{thebibliography}{99}
...
\end{thebibliography}
&lt;/source&gt;

Another even easier solution is to use &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\section&lt;/source&gt; inside of the &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\renewcommand&lt;/source&gt; block:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\renewcommand{\refname}{\section{Sources}} % Using &quot;Sources&quot; as the title of the section
\begin{thebibliography}{99}
...
\end{thebibliography}
&lt;/source&gt;

You may wish to use &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\renewcommand*{\refname}{\vspace*{-1em}}&lt;/source&gt; followed by &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\vspace*{-1em}&lt;/source&gt; to counteract the extra space the blank &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\refname&lt;/source&gt; inserts.

If you are using BibTeX, the &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\bibliography&lt;/source&gt; command, and the book or report class, you will need to redefine &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\bibname&lt;/source&gt; instead of &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\refname&lt;/source&gt; like so.

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\renewcommand{\bibname}{\section{Sources}} % Redefine bibname
\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}               % Set any options you want
\bibliography{your_bib_file_names}         % Build the bibliography
&lt;/source&gt;

== biblatex ==
As we said before, biblatex is widely considered the `successor' of BibTeX.  Intended as a full replacement for BibTeX, it is more configurable in its output and provides a multitude of new styles (for output) and fields (for the database) that can be used in a document.  For now, refer to its [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex comprehensive documentation on CTAN].

=== Entry and field types in .bib files ===
The following table shows most field types. Some field types are lists, either &lt;code style=&quot;background:#DDD;&quot;&gt;lists of person names&lt;/code&gt;, others are &lt;code style=&quot;background:#FC9;&quot;&gt;literal lists&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code style=&quot;color:#909;&quot;&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; can either be given in parts or full, some &lt;code style=&quot;color:#F99;&quot;&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; are necessary, page references are provided as &lt;code style=&quot;color:#99F;&quot;&gt;ranges&lt;/code&gt; and certain special fields contain &lt;code style=&quot;color:#090;&quot;&gt;verbatim&lt;/code&gt; code. There are many kinds of &lt;code style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;titles&lt;/code&gt;.

Some entry types are hard to distinguish and are treated the same by standard styles:
* &lt;code&gt;@article&lt;/code&gt; is the same as hypothetic *&lt;code&gt;@inperiodical&lt;/code&gt; and therefore encompasses existing &lt;code&gt;@suppperiodical&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@inbook&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@bookinbook&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@suppbook&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@collection&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@reference&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@mvcollection&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@mvreference&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@incollection&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@suppcollection&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@inreference&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@online&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@electronic&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@www&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@report&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@techreport&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@thesis&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@mastersthesis&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;@phdthesis&lt;/code&gt;

Some field types are defined, but the documentation does not say which entry types they can be used with. This is either because they depend on another field being set to be useful or they can always be used in a user-defined manner, but will never be used in standard styles:
* &lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;annotation&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;entrysubtype&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code title=&quot;special&quot; style=&quot;color:#090;&quot;&gt;file&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;library&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;nameaddon&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code title=&quot;date&quot; style=&quot;color:#909;&quot;&gt;origdate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code title=&quot;literal list&quot; style=&quot;background:#FC9;&quot;&gt;origlocation&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code title=&quot;literal list&quot; style=&quot;background:#FC9;&quot;&gt;origpublisher&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;origtitle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;reprinttitle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;indextitle&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code title=&quot;key&quot; style=&quot;color:#F99;&quot;&gt;pagination&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code title=&quot;key&quot; style=&quot;color:#F99;&quot;&gt;bookpagination&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code title=&quot;name list&quot; style=&quot;background:#DDD;&quot;&gt;shortauthor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code title=&quot;name list&quot; style=&quot;background:#DDD;&quot;&gt;shorteditor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shorthand&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shorthandintro&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shortjournal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shortseries&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;shorttitle&lt;/code&gt;

The only field that is always mandatory, is &lt;code style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;. All entry types also require either &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; and they specify which of &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;editor&lt;/code&gt; they expect or whether they can use both. Some field types can optionally be used with any entry type:
* &lt;code&gt;addendum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code title=&quot;key name list&quot; style=&quot;background:#DDD; color:#F99&quot;&gt;language&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code title=&quot;key&quot; style=&quot;color:#F99;&quot;&gt;pubstate&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code title=&quot;date&quot; style=&quot;color:#909;&quot;&gt;urldate&lt;/code&gt;
All physical (print) entry types share further optional field types:
* &lt;code title=&quot;special&quot;&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code title=&quot;special&quot; style=&quot;color:#090;&quot;&gt;doi&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code title=&quot;special&quot; style=&quot;color:#090;&quot;&gt;eprint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;eprintclass&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;eprinttype&lt;/code&gt;

Multimedia entry types 
* &lt;code&gt;@artwork&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@audio&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@image&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@movie&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@music&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@performance&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@video&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@software&lt;/code&gt;
and legal entry types 
* &lt;code&gt;@commentary&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@jurisdiction&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@legislation&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@legal&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@letter&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@review&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;@standard&lt;/code&gt;
are defined, but not yet supported (well).

The entry types &lt;code&gt;@bibnote&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@set&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@xdata&lt;/code&gt; are special.

=== Printing bibliography ===

Presuming we have defined our references in a file called references.bib, we add this to biblatex by adding the following to the preamble:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\addbibresource{references.bib}&lt;/source&gt;

Print the bibiography with this macro (usually at the end of the document body):
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\printbibliography&lt;/source&gt;

==== Printing separate bibliographies ====

We want to separate the bibliography into papers, books and others
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\printbibliography[title={Book references},type=book]
\printbibliography[title={Article references},type=article]
\printbibliography[title={Other references}, nottype=article, nottype=book]
}}

If the bib entries are located in multiple files we can add them like this:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\addbibresource{references.bib}
\addbibresource{other.bib}
}}

We can also filter on other fields, such as entrysubtype. If we define our online resources like this:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
@misc{some-resource,
   ...
   entrysubtype = {inet},
}
}}
we filter with &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\printbibliography[title={Online resources}, subtype=inet]&lt;/source&gt;

==== Example with prefix keys, subheadings and table of contents ====

As the numbering of the bibliographies are independent, it can be useful to also separate the bibliographies using prefixnumbers such as a, b and c.
In addition we add a main heading for the bibliographies and add that to the table of contents.

To make [[LaTeX/Hyperlinks#Hyperref|Hyperref]] links point to the correct bibliography section, we also add &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\phantomsection&lt;/source&gt; before printing each bibliography

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\printbibheading[
heading=bibintoc, % bibintoc adds the Bibliography to the table of contents
title={Resources} % If we want to override the default title &quot;Bibliography&quot; 
]
\phantomsection % Requires hyperref package
\printbibliography[title={Printed sources}, heading=subbibliography, prefixnumbers={a}, type=book, type=article]
\phantomsection
\printbibliography[title={Online resources}, heading=subbibliography, prefixnumbers={c}, subtype=inet]
\phantomsection
\printbibliography[title={Other}, heading=subbibliography, prefixnumbers={c}, nottype=article, nottype=book, notsubtype=inet]
}}
To add each of the bibliographies to the table of contents as sub-sections to the main Bibliography, replace &lt;code&gt;heading=subbibliography&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;heading=subbibintoc&lt;/code&gt;.

== Multiple bibliographies ==

=== Using &lt;code&gt;multibib&lt;/code&gt; ===

This package is for multiple Bibliographies for different sections in your work. For example, you can generate a bibliography for each chapter.
You can find information about the package on CTAN&lt;ref&gt;http://ctan.org/pkg/multibib&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Using &lt;code&gt;bibtopic&lt;/code&gt; ===

The bibtopic-Package&lt;ref&gt;http://ctan.org/pkg/bibtopic&lt;/ref&gt; is created to differ the citations on more files, so that you can divide the bibliography into more parts.

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{bibtopic}
\begin{document}

\bibliographystyle{alpha}
\section{Testing}
Let’s cite all the books: \cite{ColBenh:93} and
\cite{Munt:93}; and an article: \cite{RouxSmart:95}.

File books.bib is used for this listing:
\begin{btSect}{books}
 \section{References from books}
 \btPrintCited
\end{btSect}
Here, the articles.bib is used, and the listing is in plain-format instead of the standard alpha.
\begin{btSect}[plain]{articles}
 \section{References from articles}
 \btPrintCited
 \section{Articles not cited}
 \btPrintNotCited
\end{btSect}
Just print all entries here with \btPrintAll
\begin{btSect}[plain]{internet}
 \section{References from the internet}
 \btPrintAll
\end{btSect}
\end{document}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Notes and references==

Tables are a common feature in academic writing, often used to summarize research results. Mastering the art of table construction in LaTeX is therefore necessary to produce quality papers and with sufficient practice one can print beautiful tables of any kind.

Keeping in mind that LaTeX is not a spreadsheet, it makes sense to use a dedicated tool to build tables and then to export these tables into the document. Basic tables are not too taxing, but anything more advanced can take a fair bit of construction; in these cases, more advanced packages can be very useful. However, first it is important to know the basics. Once you are comfortable with basic LaTeX tables, you might have a look at more advanced packages or the [[#Using spreadsheets and data analysis tools|export options of your favorite spreadsheet]]. Thanks to the modular nature of LaTeX, the whole process can be automated in a fairly comfortable way.

For a long time, LaTeX tables were quite a chaotic topic, with dozens of packages doing similar things, while not always being compatible with one another. Sometimes you had to make trade-offs. The situation changed recently (2010) with the release of the {{LaTeX/Package|tabu}} package which combines the power of {{LaTeX/Environment|longtable}}, {{LaTeX/Package|tabularx}} and much more. The {{LaTeX/Environment|tabu}} environment is far less fragile and restricted than the older alternatives. Nonetheless, before attempting to use this package for the first time it will be beneficial to understand how the classic environment works, since {{LaTeX/Environment|tabu}} works the same way. Note however that the author of {{LaTeX/Package|tabu}} will not fix bugs to the current version, and that the next version introduces new syntax that will likely break existing documents.&lt;ref&gt;http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/121841/is-the-tabu-package-obsolete&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The ''tabular'' environment ==

The {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} environment can be used to typeset tables with optional horizontal and vertical lines. LaTeX determines the width of the columns automatically.

The first line of the environment has the form:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}[pos]{table spec}
}}

The {{LaTeX/Parameter|table spec}} argument tells LaTeX the alignment to be used in each column and the vertical lines to insert.

The number of columns does not need to be specified as it is inferred by looking at the number of arguments provided. It is also possible to add vertical lines between the columns here. The following symbols are available to describe the table columns (some of them require that the package {{LaTeX/Package|array}} has been loaded):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|l}}
| left-justified column
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|c}}
| centered column
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|r}}
| right-justified column
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|p{'width'}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| paragraph column with text vertically aligned at the top
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|m{'width'}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| paragraph column with text vertically aligned in the middle (requires array package)
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|b{'width'}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| paragraph column with text vertically aligned at the bottom (requires array package)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| vertical line
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| double vertical line
|}

By default, if the text in a column is too wide for the page, LaTeX won’t automatically wrap it. Using {{LaTeX/Parameter|p{'width'}&lt;!----&gt;}} you can define a special type of column which will wrap-around the text as in a normal paragraph. You can pass the width using any unit supported by LaTeX, such as 'pt' and 'cm', or ''command lengths'', such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textwidth&lt;!----&gt;}}. You can find a list in chapter [[LaTeX/Lengths|Lengths]].

The optional parameter {{LaTeX/Parameter|pos}} can be used to specify the vertical position of the table relative to the baseline of the surrounding text. In most cases, you will not need this option. It becomes relevant only if your table is not in a paragraph of its own. You can use the following letters:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|b}}
| bottom
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|c}}
| center (default)
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|t}}
| top
|-
|}

To specify a font format (such as bold, italic, etc.) for an entire column, you can add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&gt;{\format}&lt;!----&gt;}} before you declare the alignment. For example {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{tabular}{ &gt;{\bfseries}l c &gt;{\itshape}r }&lt;!----&gt;}} will indicate a three column table with the first one aligned to the left and in bold font, the second one aligned in the center and with normal font, and the third aligned to the right and in italic. The &quot;array&quot; package needs to be activated in the preamble for this to work.

In the first line you have pointed out how many columns you want, their alignment and the vertical lines to separate them. Once in the environment, you have to introduce the text you want, separating between cells and introducing new lines. The commands you have to use are the following:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&amp;&lt;!----&gt;}}
| column separator
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\&lt;!----&gt;}}
| start new row (additional space may be specified after {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\&lt;!----&gt;}} using square brackets, such as {{LaTeX/Parameter|\\[6pt]}})
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hline&lt;!----&gt;}}
| horizontal line
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newline&lt;!----&gt;}}
| start a new line within a cell (in a paragraph column)
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cline{i-j}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| partial horizontal line beginning in column ''i'' and ending in column ''j''
|}

Note, any white space inserted between these commands is purely down to ones' preferences. I personally add spaces between to make it easier to read.

=== Basic examples ===

This example shows how to create a simple table in LaTeX. It is a three-by-three table, but without any lines.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{ l c r }
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
  4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
  7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\
\end{tabular}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcr} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\ \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Expanding upon that by including some vertical lines:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{ l {{!}} c {{!}}{{!}} r }
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
  4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
  7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\
\end{tabular}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l|c||r} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\ \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

To add horizontal lines to the very top and bottom edges of the table:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{ l {{!}} c {{!}}{{!}} r }
  \hline			
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
  4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
  7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\
  \hline  
\end{tabular}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l|c||r}\hline 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\ \hline \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

And finally, to add lines between all rows, as well as centering (notice the use of the center environment - of course, the result of this is not obvious from the preview on this web page):

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ l {{!}} c {{!}}{{!}} r }
    \hline
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ \hline
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ \hline
    7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l|c||r}\hline 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ \hline  4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ \hline  7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\ \hline \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ {{!}} l {{!}}{{!}} c {{!}}{{!}}{{!}} r }
    \hline
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ \hline
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ \hline \hline
    7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{|l||c|||r}\hline 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ \hline  4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ \hline \hline 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\ \hline \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{{{!}}r{{!}}l{{!}}}
  \hline
  7C0 &amp; hexadecimal \\
  3700 &amp; octal \\ \cline{2-2}
  11111000000 &amp; binary \\
  \hline \hline
  1984 &amp; decimal \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
|render=

}}

=== Text wrapping in tables ===

LaTeX's algorithms for formatting tables have a few shortcomings. One is that it will not automatically wrap text in cells, even if it overruns the width of the page. For columns that will contain text whose length exceeds the column's width, it is recommended that you use the {{LaTeX/Parameter|p}} attribute and specify the desired width of the column (although it may take some trial-and-error to get the result you want). For a more convenient method, have a look at [[#The tabularx package|The tabularx package]], or [[#The tabulary package|The tabulary package]].

Instead of {{LaTeX/Parameter|p}}, use the {{LaTeX/Parameter|m}} attribute to have the lines aligned toward the middle of the box or the {{LaTeX/Parameter|b}} attribute to align along the bottom of the box.

Here is a simple example. The following code creates two tables with the same code; the only difference is that the last column of the second one has a defined width of 5 centimeters, while in the first one we didn't specify any width. Compiling this code:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article} 
\usepackage[english]{babel}

\begin{document}

Without specifying width for last column:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{{{!}} l {{!}} l {{!}} l {{!}} l {{!}}}
    \hline
    Day &amp; Min Temp &amp; Max Temp &amp; Summary \\ \hline
    Monday &amp; 11C &amp; 22C &amp; A clear day with lots of sunshine.
    However, the strong breeze will bring down the temperatures. \\ \hline
    Tuesday &amp; 9C &amp; 19C &amp; Cloudy with rain, across many northern regions. Clear spells 
    across most of Scotland and Northern Ireland, 
    but rain reaching the far northwest. \\ \hline
    Wednesday &amp; 10C &amp; 21C &amp; Rain will still linger for the morning. 
    Conditions will improve by early afternoon and continue 
    throughout the evening. \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

With width specified:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ {{!}} l {{!}} l {{!}} l {{!}} p{5cm} {{!}}}
    \hline
    Day &amp; Min Temp &amp; Max Temp &amp; Summary \\ \hline
    Monday &amp; 11C &amp; 22C &amp; A clear day with lots of sunshine.  
    However, the strong breeze will bring down the temperatures. \\ \hline
    Tuesday &amp; 9C &amp; 19C &amp; Cloudy with rain, across many northern regions. Clear spells 
    across most of Scotland and Northern Ireland, 
    but rain reaching the far northwest. \\ \hline
    Wednesday &amp; 10C &amp; 21C &amp; Rain will still linger for the morning. 
    Conditions will improve by early afternoon and continue 
    throughout the evening. \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{document}
}}

You get the following output:

[[Image:Latex example wrapped table.svg|800px|center]]

Note that the first table has been cropped, since the output is wider than the page width.

=== Manually broken paragraphs in table cells ===
Sometimes it is necessary to not rely on the breaking algorithm when using the {{LaTeX/Parameter|p}} specifier, but rather specify the line breaks by hand. In this case it is easiest to use a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\parbox&lt;!----&gt;}}:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}{cc}
  boring cell content &amp; \parbox[t]{5cm}{rather long par\\new par}
\end{tabular}
}}

=== Space between columns ===

To tweak the space between columns (LaTeX will by default choose very tight columns), one can alter the column separation: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setlength{\tabcolsep}{5pt}&lt;!----&gt;}}.
The default value is 6pt.

=== Space between rows ===

Re-define the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\arraystretch&lt;!----&gt;}} command to set the space between rows:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
}}
Default value is 1.0.

An alternative way to adjust the rule spacing is to add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\noalign{\smallskip}&lt;!----&gt;}} before or after the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hline&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cline{i-j}&lt;!----&gt;}} commands:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}{ {{!}} l {{!}} l {{!}} r {{!}} }
  \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{Item} \\
  \cline{1-2}\noalign{\smallskip}
  Animal &amp; Description &amp; Price (\$) \\
  \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
  Gnat  &amp; per gram &amp; 13.65 \\
        &amp; each     &amp;  0.01 \\
  Gnu   &amp; stuffed  &amp; 92.50 \\
  Emu   &amp; stuffed  &amp; 33.33 \\
  Armadillo &amp; frozen &amp; 8.99 \\
  \noalign{\smallskip}\hline
\end{tabular}
}}

You may also specify the skip after a line explicitly using glue after the line terminator

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Mineral &amp; Color \\[1cm]
Ruby &amp; red \\
Sapphire &amp; blue \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}}

=== Other environments inside tables ===

If you use some LaTeX environments inside table cells, like {{LaTeX/Environment|verbatim}} or {{LaTeX/Environment|enumerate}}:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}{c c}
	\hline
	\begin{verbatim}
	code
	\end{verbatim}
	&amp; description
 	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
}}

you might encounter errors similar to
 ! LaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item.

To solve this problem, change [[#The tabular environment|column specifier]] to &quot;paragraph&quot; ({{LaTeX/Parameter|p}}, {{LaTeX/Parameter|m}} or {{LaTeX/Parameter|b}}).

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}{m{5cm} c}
}}

=== Defining multiple columns ===

It is possible to define many identical columns at once using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=*{num}{str}&lt;!----&gt;}} syntax. This is particularly useful when your table has many columns.

Here is a table with six centered columns flanked by a single column on each side:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
Team              &amp; P &amp; W &amp; D &amp; L &amp; F  &amp; A &amp; Pts \\
\hline
Manchester United &amp; 6 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 10 &amp; 5 &amp; 12  \\
Celtic            &amp; 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp;  8 &amp; 9 &amp;  9  \\
Benfica           &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp;  7 &amp; 8 &amp;  7  \\
FC Copenhagen     &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp;  5 &amp; 8 &amp;  7  \\
\end{tabular}
|render=
[[Image:Latex example defining multiple columns.svg|450px]]
}}

=== Column specification using ''&gt;{\cmd}'' and ''&lt;{\cmd}'' ===

The column specification can be altered using the {{LaTeX/Package|array}} package.  This is done in the 
argument of the tabular environment using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&gt;{\command}&lt;!----&gt;}} for commands executed right 
''before'' each column element and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&lt;{\command}&lt;!----&gt;}} for commands to be executed right
''after'' each column element. 
As an example: to get a column in math mode enter: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{tabular}{&gt;{$}c&lt;{$}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}. 
Another example is changing the font: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{tabular}{&gt;{\small}c}&lt;!----&gt;}} to print the column in a small font.

The argument of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&gt;&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&lt;&lt;!----&gt;}} specifications must be correctly balanced when it comes to {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=}&lt;!----&gt;}} characters. This means that {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&gt;{\bfseries}&lt;!----&gt;}} is valid, while {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&gt;{\textbf}&lt;!----&gt;}} will not work and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&gt;{\textbf{}&lt;!----&gt;}} is not valid. If there is the need to use the text of the table as an argument (for instance, using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textbf&lt;!----&gt;}} to produce bold text), one should use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bgroup&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\egroup&lt;!----&gt;}} commands: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&gt;{\textbf\bgroup}c&lt;{\egroup}&lt;!----&gt;}} produces the intended effect. This works only for some basic LaTeX commands. For other commands, such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\underline&lt;!----&gt;}} to underline text, it is necessary to temporarily store the column text in a box using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=lrbox&lt;!----&gt;}}. First, you must define such a box with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newsavebox{\boxname}&lt;!----&gt;}} and then you can define:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
&gt;{\begin{lrbox}{\boxname} }%
l%
&lt;{\end{lrbox}%
  \underline{\unhbox\boxname} }%
 }
}}

This stores the text in a box and afterwards, takes the text out of the box with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\unhbox&lt;!----&gt;}} (this destroys the box, if the box is needed again one should use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\unhcopy&lt;!----&gt;}} instead) and passing it to {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\underline&lt;!----&gt;}}. (For LaTeX2e, you may want to use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usebox{\boxname}&lt;!----&gt;}} instead of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\unhbox\boxname&lt;!----&gt;}}.)

This same trick done with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\raisebox&lt;!----&gt;}} instead of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\underline&lt;!----&gt;}} can force all lines in a table to have equal height, instead of the natural varying height that can occur when e.g. math terms or superscripts occur in the text.

Here is an example showing the use of both {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=p{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&gt;{\centering}&lt;!----&gt;}} :

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}{&gt;{\centering}p{3.5cm}&lt;{\centering}p{3.5cm} }
Geometry  &amp; Algebra
\tabularnewline
\hline
 Points &amp; Addition 
\tabularnewline
 Spheres &amp; Multiplication 
\end{tabular}
}}

Note the use of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tabularnewline&lt;!----&gt;}} instead of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\&lt;!----&gt;}} to avoid a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=Misplaced \noalign&lt;!----&gt;}} error.

=== @-expressions ===

The column separator can be specified with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=@{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} construct. 

It typically takes some text as its argument, and when appended to a column, it will automatically insert that text into each cell in that column before the actual data for that cell. This command kills the inter-column space and replaces it with whatever is between the curly braces. To add space, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=@{\hspace{''width''}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

Admittedly, this is not that clear, and so will require a few examples to clarify. Sometimes, it is desirable in scientific tables to have the numbers aligned on the decimal point. This can be achieved by doing the following:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{r@{.}l}
  3   &amp; 14159 \\
  16  &amp; 2     \\
  123 &amp; 456   \\
\end{tabular}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}3&amp;.14159\\16&amp;.2\\123&amp;.456\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The space-suppressing qualities of the @-expression actually make it quite useful for manipulating the horizontal spacing between columns. Given a basic table, and varying the column descriptions:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}{ {{!}}l{{!}}l{{!}} }
  \hline
  stuff &amp; stuff \\ \hline
  stuff &amp; stuff \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
}}

{|
| style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{|l|l|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; |
[[Image:specifier1.svg]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{|@{}l|l@{}|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; |
[[Image:specifier2.svg]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{|@{}l@{}|l@{}|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; |
[[Image:specifier3.svg]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{|@{}l@{}|@{}l@{}|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; |
[[Image:specifier4.svg]]
|}

=== Aligning columns at decimal points using dcolumn ===
Instead of using @-expressions to build columns of decimals aligned to the decimal point (or equivalent symbol), it is possible to center a column on the decimal separator using the {{LaTeX/Package|dcolumn}} package, which provides a new column specifier for floating point data. See the [http://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/mirrors/CTAN/macros/latex/required/tools/dcolumn.pdf dcolumn package documentation] for more information, but a simple way to use {{LaTeX/Package|dcolumn}} is as follows.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\usepackage{dcolumn}
\ldots
\newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{\cdot}{#1} }
%the argument for d specifies the maximum number of decimal places
\begin{tabular}{l r c d{1} }
Left&amp;Right&amp;Center&amp;\mathrm{Decimal}\\
1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4\\
11&amp;22&amp;33&amp;44\\
1.1&amp;2.2&amp;3.3&amp;4.4\\
\end{tabular}
|render=[[File:LaTeX_example_dcolumn.png|200px]]
}}
A negative argument provided for the number of decimal places in the new column type allows unlimited decimal places, but may result in rather wide columns.  Rounding is not applied, so the data to be tabulated should be adjusted to the number of decimal places specified.  Note that a decimal aligned column is typeset in math mode, hence the use of \mathrm for the column heading in the example above.  Also, text in a decimal aligned column (for example the header) will be right-aligned before the decimal separator (assuming there's no decimal separator in the text).  While this may be fine for very short text, or numeric column headings, it looks cumbersome in the example above.  A solution to this is to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multicolumn}} command described below, specifying a single column and its alignment. For example to center the header ''Decimal'' over its column in the above example, the first line of the table itself would be {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=Left&amp;Right&amp;Center&amp;\multicolumn{1}{c}{Decimal}\\}}

====Bold text and dcolumn====
To draw attention to particular entries in a table, it may be nice to use bold text.  Ordinarily this is easy, but as dcolumn needs to ''see'' the decimal point it is rather harder to do.  In addition, the usual bold characters are wider than their normal counterparts, meaning that although the decimals may align nicely, the figures (for more than 2--3 digits on one side of the decimal point) will be visibly misaligned.  It is however possible to use normal width bold characters and define a new bold column type, as shown below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/118458/decimals-in-table-dont-align-with-dcolumn-when-bolded|title=Decimals in table don't align with dcolumn when bolded|author=D Carlisle|publisher=Stackexchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Row specification == 

It might be convenient to apply the same command over every cell of a row, just as for column. Unfortunately the {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} environment cannot do that by default.
We will need {{LaTeX/Package|tabu}} instead, which provides the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rowfont&lt;!----&gt;}} option.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}{XX}
\rowfont{\bfseries\itshape\large} Header1 &amp; Header2 \\
\hline
Cell2 &amp; Cell2
\end{tabular}
}}

== Spanning ==

To complete this tutorial, we take a quick look at how to generate slightly more complex tables. Unsurprisingly, the commands necessary have to be embedded within the table data itself.

=== Rows spanning multiple columns ===

The command for this looks like this: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multicolumn{'num_cols'}{'alignment'}{'contents'}&lt;!----&gt;}}. {{LaTeX/Parameter|num_cols}} is the number of subsequent columns to merge; {{LaTeX/Parameter|alignment}} is either {{LaTeX/Parameter|l}}, {{LaTeX/Parameter|c}}, {{LaTeX/Parameter|r}}, or to have text wrapping specify a width {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=p{5.0cm}&lt;!----&gt;}} . And {{LaTeX/Parameter|contents}} is simply the actual data you want to be contained within that cell. A simple example:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{ {{!}}l{{!}}l{{!}} }
  \hline
  \multicolumn{2}{{{!}}c{{!}}}{Team sheet} \\
  \hline
  GK &amp; Paul Robinson \\
  LB &amp; Lucas Radebe \\
  DC &amp; Michael Duberry \\
  DC &amp; Dominic Matteo \\
  RB &amp; Dider Domi \\
  MC &amp; David Batty \\
  MC &amp; Eirik Bakke \\
  MC &amp; Jody Morris \\
  FW &amp; Jamie McMaster \\
  ST &amp; Alan Smith \\
  ST &amp; Mark Viduka \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
|render=
[[Image:multicolumn.svg]]
}}

=== Columns spanning multiple rows ===

The first thing you need to do is add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{multirow}&lt;!----&gt;}} to the preamble&lt;ref name=&quot;multirow&quot;&gt;Package multirow [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/multirow/ on CTAN]&lt;/ref&gt;. This then provides the command needed for spanning rows: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multirow{''num_rows''}{''width''}{''contents''}&lt;!----&gt;}}. The arguments are pretty simple to deduce ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=*&lt;!----&gt;}} for the ''width'' means the content's natural width).

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
...
\usepackage{multirow}
...

\begin{tabular}{ {{!}}l{{!}}l{{!}}l{{!}} }
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{ {{!}}c{{!}} }{Team sheet} \\
\hline
Goalkeeper &amp; GK &amp; Paul Robinson \\ \hline
\multirow{4}{*}{Defenders} &amp; LB &amp; Lucas Radebe \\
 &amp; DC &amp; Michael Duburry \\
 &amp; DC &amp; Dominic Matteo \\
 &amp; RB &amp; Didier Domi \\ \hline
\multirow{3}{*}{Midfielders} &amp; MC &amp; David Batty \\
 &amp; MC &amp; Eirik Bakke \\
 &amp; MC &amp; Jody Morris \\ \hline
Forward &amp; FW &amp; Jamie McMaster \\ \hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Strikers} &amp; ST &amp; Alan Smith \\
 &amp; ST &amp; Mark Viduka \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
|render=
[[Image:multirow.svg]]
}}

The main thing to note when using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multirow&lt;!----&gt;}} is that a blank entry must be inserted for each appropriate cell in each subsequent row to be spanned.

If there is no data for a cell, just don't type anything, but you still need the &quot;&amp;&quot; separating it from the next column's data. The astute reader will already have deduced that for a table of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; columns, there must always be &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; ampersands in each row (unless {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multicolumn&lt;!----&gt;}} is also used).

=== Spanning in both directions simultaneously ===

Here is a nontrivial example of how to use spanning in both directions simultaneously and have the borders of the cells drawn correctly:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\usepackage{multirow}

\begin{tabular}{cc{{!}}c{{!}}c{{!}}c{{!}}c{{!}}l}
\cline{3-6}
&amp; &amp; \multicolumn{4}{ c{{!}} }{Primes} \\ \cline{3-6}
&amp; &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 7 \\ \cline{1-6}
\multicolumn{1}{ {{!}}c  }{\multirow{2}{*}{Powers} } &amp;
\multicolumn{1}{ {{!}}c{{!}} }{504} &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;     \\ \cline{2-6}
\multicolumn{1}{ {{!}}c  }{}                        &amp;
\multicolumn{1}{ {{!}}c{{!}} }{540} &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp;     \\ \cline{1-6}
\multicolumn{1}{ {{!}}c  }{\multirow{2}{*}{Powers} } &amp;
\multicolumn{1}{ {{!}}c{{!}} }{gcd} &amp; 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; min \\ \cline{2-6}
\multicolumn{1}{ {{!}}c  }{}                        &amp;
\multicolumn{1}{ {{!}}c{{!}} }{lcm} &amp; 3 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; max \\ \cline{1-6}
\end{tabular}
|render=
[[Image:multirowandcolumnexample.svg|300px]]
}}

The command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} is just used to draw vertical borders both on the left and on the right of the cell. Even when combined with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multirow{2}{*}{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}, it still draws vertical borders that only span the first row. To compensate for that, we add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} in the following rows spanned by the multirow. Note that we cannot just use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hline&lt;!----&gt;}} to draw horizontal lines, since we do not want the line to be drawn over the text that spans several rows. Instead we use the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cline{2-6}&lt;!----&gt;}} and opt out the first column that contains the text &quot;Powers&quot;.

Here is another example exploiting the same ideas to make
the familiar and popular &quot;2x2&quot; or double dichotomy:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{ r{{!}}c{{!}}c{{!}} }
\multicolumn{1}{r}{}
 &amp;  \multicolumn{1}{c}{noninteractive}
 &amp; \multicolumn{1}{c}{interactive} \\
\cline{2-3}
massively multiple &amp; Library &amp; University \\
\cline{2-3}
one-to-one &amp; Book &amp; Tutor \\
\cline{2-3}
\end{tabular}
|render=
[[Image:Latex-tables-double-dichotomy-example.svg|400px]]
}}

==Controlling table size==

=== Resize tables ===

The {{LaTeX/Package|graphicx}} packages features the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\resizebox{width}{height}{object}&lt;!----&gt;}} which can be used with {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} to specify the height and width of a table. The following example shows how to resize a table to 8cm width while maintaining the original width/height ratio.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{graphicx}
% ...

\resizebox{8cm}{!} {
  \begin{tabular}...
  \end{tabular}
}
}}

Resizing table including the caption

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{table}[h]
\resizebox{1.4\textwidth}{!}{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{tabular}{r{{!}}c{{!}}c{{!}}}
&amp; \multicolumn{1}{c}{noninteractive}
&amp; \multicolumn{1}{c}{interactive} \\
\cline{2-3}
massively multiple &amp; Library &amp; University \\
\cline{2-3}
one-to-one &amp; Book &amp; Tutor \\
\cline{2-3}
\end{tabular}
\caption[Table caption text]{Table taken from \cite[p.10]{refid} }
\label{table:name}
\end{minipage} }
\end{table}
}}

Alternatively you can use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\scalebox{ratio}{object}&lt;!----&gt;}} in the same way but with ratios rather than fixed sizes:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{graphicx}
% ...

\scalebox{0.7}{
  \begin{tabular}...
  \end{tabular}
}
}}

=== Changing font size ===

A table can be globally switched to a different font size by simply adding the desired size command (here: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\footnotesize&lt;!----&gt;}}) in the table scope, which may be after the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{table}&lt;!----&gt;}} statement if you use floats, otherwise you need to add a group delimiter.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
{\footnotesize
  \begin{tabular}{{{!}} r {{!}} r {{!}}{{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}}}
      % ...
  \end{tabular}
}
}}

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{table}[h]\footnotesize
  \caption{Performance at peak F-measure}
  \begin{tabular}{{{!}} r {{!}} r {{!}}{{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}}}
      % ...
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
}}

Alternatively, you can change the default font for all the tables in your document by placing the following code in the preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\let\oldtabular\tabular 
\renewcommand{\tabular}{\footnotesize\oldtabular} 
}}

See [[LaTeX/Fonts#Sizing_text|Fonts]] for named font sizes.  The table caption font size is not affected. To control the caption font size, see [[LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions#Caption_Styles|Caption Styles]].

== Colors ==
=== Alternate row colors in tables ===

The {{LaTeX/Package|xcolor}} package provides the necessary commands to produce tables with alternate row colors, when loaded with the {{LaTeX/Parameter|table}} option.
The command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rowcolors{&lt;''starting row''&gt;}{&lt;''odd color''&gt;}{&lt;''even color''&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}} has to be specified right before the {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} environment starts.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[table]{xcolor}

\begin{document}

\begin{center}
\rowcolors{1}{green}{pink}

\begin{tabular}{lll}
odd 	&amp; odd 	&amp; odd \\
even 	&amp; even 	&amp; even\\
odd 	&amp; odd 	&amp; odd \\
even 	&amp; even 	&amp; even\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{document}
|render=
[[File:LaTeXAlternateRowTable.svg|right]]
}}

The command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hiderowcolors&lt;!----&gt;}} is available to deactivate highlighting from a specified row until the end of the table.
Highlighting can be reactivated within the table via the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\showrowcolors&lt;!----&gt;}} command. If while using these commands you experience &quot;misplaced \noalign errors&quot; then use the commands at the very beginning or end of a row in your tabular.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=\hiderowcolors odd &amp; odd &amp; odd \\&lt;!----&gt;}}
or
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=odd &amp; odd &amp; odd \\ \showrowcolors&lt;!----&gt;}}

=== Colors of individual cells ===

As above this uses the {{LaTeX/Package|xcolor&lt;!----&gt;}} package.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
% Include this somewhere in your document
\usepackage[table]{xcolor}

% Enter this in the cell you wish to color a light grey.
% NB: the word 'gray' here denotes the grayscale color scheme, not the color grey. '0.9' denotes how dark the grey is.
\cellcolor[gray]{0.9}
% The following will color the cell red.
\cellcolor{red}
}}

== Width and stretching ==

We keep providing documentation for {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular*}} and {{LaTeX/Environment|tabularx}} although they are completely eclipsed by the much more powerful and flexible {{LaTeX/Environment|tabu}} environment. Actually {{LaTeX/Environment|tabu}} is greatly inspired by those environments, so it may be worth it to have an idea how they work, particularly for {{LaTeX/Environment|tabularx}}.

=== The ''tabular*'' environment===

This is basically a slight extension on the original tabular version, although it requires an extra argument (before the column descriptions) to specify the preferred width of the table.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular*}{0.75\textwidth}{ {{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}} r {{!}} }
  \hline
  label 1 &amp; label 2 &amp; label 3 &amp; label 4 \\
  \hline 
  item 1  &amp; item 2  &amp; item 3  &amp; item 4  \\
  \hline
\end{tabular*}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX TabWidth1.svg|right]]
}}

However, that may not look quite as intended. The columns are still at their natural width (just wide enough to fit their contents) while the rows are as wide as the table width specified. If you do not like this default, you must also explicitly insert extra column space. LaTeX has ''rubber lengths'', which, unlike others, are not fixed. LaTeX can dynamically decide how long the lengths should be. So, an example of this is the following.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular*}{0.75\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill} } {{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}} r {{!}} }
  \hline
  label 1 &amp; label 2 &amp; label 3 &amp; label 4 \\
  \hline 
  item 1  &amp; item 2  &amp; item 3  &amp; item 4  \\
  \hline
\end{tabular*}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX TabWidth2.svg|right]]
}}

You will notice the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=@{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} construct added at the beginning of the column description. Within it is the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\extracolsep&lt;!----&gt;}} command, which requires a width. A fixed width could have been used. However, by using a rubber length, such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fill&lt;!----&gt;}}, the columns are automatically spaced evenly.

=== The ''tabularx'' package ===

This package provides a table environment called {{LaTeX/Environment|tabularx}}, which is similar to the {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular*}} environment except that it has a new column specifier {{LaTeX/Parameter|X}} (in uppercase). The column(s) specified with this specifier will be stretched to make the table as wide as specified, greatly simplifying the creation of tables.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\usepackage{tabularx}
% ...

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ {{!}}X{{!}}X{{!}}X{{!}}X{{!}} }
  \hline
  label 1 &amp; label 2 &amp; label 3 &amp; label 4 \\
  \hline 
  item 1  &amp; item 2  &amp; item 3  &amp; item 4  \\
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX TabXWidth1.svg|450px|right]]
}}

The content provided for the boxes is treated as for a {{LaTeX/Parameter|p}} column, except that the width is calculated automatically. If you use the package {{LaTeX/Package|array}}, you may also apply any {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&gt;{\cmd}&lt;!----&gt;}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&lt;{\cmd}&lt;!----&gt;}} command to achieve specific behavior (like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\centering&lt;!----&gt;}}, or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\raggedright\arraybackslash&lt;!----&gt;}}) as described previously.

Another option is to use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newcolumntype&lt;!----&gt;}} to format selected columns in a different way. It defines a new column specifier, e.g. {{LaTeX/Parameter|R}} (in uppercase). In this example, the second and fourth column is adjusted in a different way ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\raggedleft&lt;!----&gt;}}):

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\usepackage{tabularx}
% ...

\newcolumntype{R}{&gt;{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}X}%
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ {{!}}l{{!}}R{{!}}l{{!}}R{{!}} }
  \hline
  label 1 &amp; label 2 &amp; label 3 &amp; label 4 \\
  \hline 
  item 1  &amp; item 2  &amp; item 3  &amp; item 4  \\
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX TabXWidth2.svg|450px|right]]
}}

Tabularx with rows spanning multiple columns using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multicolumn&lt;!----&gt;}}. The two central columns are posing as one by using the {{LaTeX/Parameter|X@{}&lt;!----&gt;}} option. Note that the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\multicolumn&lt;!----&gt;}} width (which in this example is 2) should equal the (in this example 1+1) width of the spanned columns:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\usepackage{tabularx}
% ...

\begin{tabularx}{1\textwidth}{ {{!}}&gt;{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X{{!}}&gt;{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\raggedleft}X@{} &gt;{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\raggedright}X{{!}}&gt;{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X{{!}} } 
  \hline
Label 1 &amp; \multicolumn{2}{&gt;{\centering\setlength\hsize{2\hsize} }X{{!}}}{Label 2} &amp; Label 3\tabularnewline
\hline 
  123  &amp; 123  &amp; 456  &amp; 123  \tabularnewline
  \hline
  123  &amp; 123  &amp; 456  &amp; 123  \tabularnewline
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX tabularx_multi.svg|450px|right]]
}}

In a way analogous to how new commands with arguments can be created with \newcommand, new column types with arguments can be created with \newcolumntype as follows:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{tabularx}
\usepackage[table]{xcolor} %Used to color the last column
% ...

\newcolumntype{L}[1]{&gt;{\hsize=#1\hsize\raggedright\arraybackslash}X}%
\newcolumntype{R}[1]{&gt;{\hsize=#1\hsize\raggedleft\arraybackslash}X}%
\newcolumntype{C}[2]{&gt;{\hsize=#1\hsize\columncolor{#2}\centering\arraybackslash}X}%

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ {{!}} L{1} {{!}} R{0.5} {{!}} R{0.5} {{!}} C{2}{gray} {{!}} }
  \hline
  label 1 &amp; label 2 &amp; label 3 &amp; label 4 \\
  \hline
  item 1  &amp; item 2  &amp; item 3  &amp; item 4  \\
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
}}

where since there are 4 columns, the sum of the \hsize's (1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 2) must be equal to 4. The default value used by tabularx for \hsize is 1.

=== The ''tabulary'' package ===

[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tabulary &lt;tt&gt;tabulary&lt;/tt&gt;] is a modified {{LaTeX/Package|tabular*}} allowing width of columns set for equal heights.
{{LaTeX/Package|tabulary}} allows easy and convenient writing of well balanced tables. 

The problem with {{LaTeX/Package|tabularx}} is that it leaves much blank if your cells are almost empty. Besides, it is not easy to have different column sizes.

{{LaTeX/Package|tabulary}} tries to balance the column widths so that each column has at least its natural width, without exceeding the maximum length.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{tabulary}
...

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabulary}{0.7\textwidth}{LCL}
    Short sentences      &amp; \#  &amp; Long sentences                                                 \\
    \hline
    This is short.       &amp; 173 &amp; This is much loooooooonger, because there are many more words.  \\
    This is not shorter. &amp; 317 &amp; This is still loooooooonger, because there are many more words. \\
  \end{tabulary}  
\end{center}
}}

The first parameter is the maximum width. {{LaTeX/Package|tabulary}} will try not to exceed it, but it will not stretch to it if there is not enough content, contrary to {{LaTeX/Package|tabularx}}.

The second parameter is the column disposition. Possible values are those from the {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} environment, plus

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|L}}
| left-justified balanced column
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|C}}
| centered balanced column
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|R}}
| right-justified balanced column
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|J}}
| left-right-justified balanced column
|}

These are all capitals.

=== The ''tabu'' environment ===

It works pretty much like {{LaTeX/Environment|tabularx}}.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=

\begin{tabu} to \linewidth {llX[2]lllXl}
% ...
\end{tabu}
}}

{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=to \linewidth&lt;!----&gt;}} specifies the target width.
The {{LaTeX/Parameter|X}} parameter can have an optional span factor.

== Table across several pages ==

Long tables are natively supported by LaTeX thanks to the {{LaTeX/Environment|longtable}} environment. Unfortunately this environment does not support stretching (X columns).

The {{LaTeX/Package|tabu}} packages provides the {{LaTeX/Environment|longtabu}} environment. It has most of the features of {{LaTeX/Environment|tabu}}, with the additional capability to span multiple pages.

LaTeX can do well with long tables: you can specify a header that will repeat on every page, a header for the first page only, and the same for the footer.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{longtabu} to \linewidth {lX[2]lXl}

\rowfont\bfseries H1 &amp; H2 &amp; H3 &amp; H4 &amp; H5 \\ \hline 
\endhead

\\ \hline
\multicolumn{5}{r}{There is more to come} \\
\endfoot

\\ \hline
\endlastfoot

% Content ...

}}

It uses syntax similar to {{LaTeX/Environment|longtable}}, so you should have a look at its documentation if you want to know more.

Alternatively you can try one of the following packages [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/supertabular &lt;tt&gt;supertabular&lt;/tt&gt;] or [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/xtab &lt;tt&gt;xtab&lt;/tt&gt;], an extended and somewhat improved version of {{LaTeX/Package|supertabular}}.

== Partial vertical lines ==

Adding a partial vertical line to an individual cell:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{ l c r }
  \hline
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ \hline
  4 &amp; 5 &amp; \multicolumn{1}{r{{!}}}{6}  \\ \hline
  7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
|render=
[[Image:Partial-vertical-line-add.svg]]
}}

Removing part of a vertical line in a particular cell:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{ {{!}} l {{!}} c {{!}} r {{!}} }
  \hline
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ \hline
  4 &amp; 5 &amp; \multicolumn{1}{r}{6} \\ \hline
  7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
|render=
[[Image:Partial-vertical-line-remove.svg]]
}}

== Vertically centered images ==

Inserting images into a table row will align it at the top of the cell.
By using the {{LaTeX/Package|array}} package this problem can be solved.
Defining a new columntype will keep the image vertically centered.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcolumntype{V}{&gt;{\centering\arraybackslash} m{.4\linewidth} }
}}

Or use a parbox to center the image.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\parbox[c]{1em}{\includegraphics{image.png} }
}}

A raisebox works as well, also allowing to manually fine-tune the alignment with its first parameter.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\raisebox{-.5\height}{\includegraphics{image.png} }
}}

== Footnotes in tables ==

The {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} environment does not handle footnotes properly. The {{LaTeX/Environment|longtabular}} fixes that.

Instead of using {{LaTeX/Environment|longtabular}} we recommend {{LaTeX/Package|tabu}} which handles footnotes properly, both in normal and long tables.

== Professional tables ==

Many professionally typeset books and journals feature simple tables, which have appropriate spacing above and below lines, and almost ''never'' use vertical rules. Many examples of LaTeX tables (including this Wikibook) showcase the use of vertical rules (using &quot;|&quot;), and double-rules (using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hline\hline&lt;!----&gt;}} or &quot;||&quot;), which are regarded as unnecessary and distracting in a professionally published form.  The [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/ booktabs] package is useful for easily providing this professionalism in LaTeX tables, and the [http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/booktabs.pdf documentation] also provides guidelines on what constitutes a &quot;good&quot; table.

In brief, the package uses {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\toprule&lt;!----&gt;}} for the uppermost rule (or line), {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\midrule&lt;!----&gt;}} for the rules appearing in the middle of the table (such as under the header), and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bottomrule&lt;!----&gt;}} for the lowermost rule. This ensures that the rule weight and spacing are acceptable. In addition, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cmidrule&lt;!----&gt;}} can be used for mid-rules that span specified columns. The following example contrasts the use of booktabs and  two equivalent normal LaTeX implementations (the second example requires {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{array}&lt;!----&gt;}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{dcolumn}&lt;!----&gt;}}, and the third example requires {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{booktabs}&lt;!----&gt;}} in the preamble).

=== Normal LaTeX ===
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{tabular}{llr}

[[Image:LaTeX animal table with booktabs.svg]]


Usually the need arises for footnotes under a table (and not at the bottom of the page), with a caption properly spaced above the table. These are addressed by the [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ctable/ ctable] package. It provides the option of a short caption given to be inserted in the list of tables, instead of the actual caption (which may be quite long and inappropriate for the list of tables). The {{LaTeX/Package|ctable}} uses the {{LaTeX/Package|booktabs}} package.

== Sideways tables ==

Tables can also be put on their side within a document using the {{LaTeX/Package|rotating}} or the {{LaTeX/Package|rotfloat}} package. See the [[LaTeX/Rotations|Rotations]] chapter.

== Table with legend ==

To add a legend to a table the [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/ caption] package can be used. With the caption package a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\caption*{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} statement can be added besides the 
normal {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\caption{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}. Example:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{{{!}} r {{!}} r {{!}}{{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}} c {{!}}}

      ...

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A normal caption}
  \caption*{
    A legend, even a table can be used
    \begin{tabular}{l l}
      item 1 &amp; explanation 1 \\
    \end{tabular}
  }
\end{table}
}}

The normal caption is needed for labels and references.

== The ''eqparbox'' package ==

On rare occasions, it might be necessary to stretch every row in a table to the natural width of its longest line, for instance when one has the same text in two languages and wishes to present these next to each other with lines synching up. A tabular environment helps control where lines should break, but cannot justify the text, which leads to ragged right edges. The {{LaTeX/Package|eqparbox}} package provides the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\eqmakebox&lt;!----&gt;}} which is like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\makebox&lt;!----&gt;}} but instead of a {{LaTeX/Parameter|width}} argument, it takes a tag. During compilation it bookkeeps which {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\eqmakebox&lt;!----&gt;}} with a certain tag contains the widest text and can stretch all {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\eqmakebox&lt;!----&gt;}}es with the same tag to that width. Combined with the {{LaTeX/Package|array}} package, one can define a column specifier that justifies the text in all lines:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newsavebox{\tstretchbox}
\newcolumntype{S}[1]{%
  &gt;{\begin{lrbox}{\tstretchbox} }%
  l%
  &lt;{\end{lrbox}%
  \eqmakebox[#1][s]{\unhcopy\tstretchbox} }%
}
}}

See the documentation of the {{LaTeX/Package|eqparbox}} package for more details.

== Floating with ''table'' ==

In WYSIWYG document processors, it is common to put tables in the middle of the text. This is what we have been doing until now.
Professional documents, however, often make it a point to print tables on a dedicated page so that they do not disrupt the flow. From the point of view of the source code, one has no idea on which page the current text is going to lie, so it is hardly possible to guess which page may be appropriate for our table. LaTeX can automate this task by abstracting objects such as tables, pictures, etc., and deciding for us where they might fit best. This abstraction is called a ''float''. Generally, an object that is floated will appear in the vicinity of its introduction in the source file, but one can choose to control its position also.

To tell LaTeX we want to use our table as a float, we need to place a {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} environment in a {{LaTeX/Environment|table}} environment, which is able to float and add a label and caption.

{{Warning|
Please understand: you do not ''have to'' use floating tables. If you want to place your tables where they lie in your source code and you do not need any label, do not use {{LaTeX/Environment|table}} at all! This is a very common misunderstanding among newcomers.
}}

The {{LaTeX/Environment|table}} environment initiates a type of float just as the environment {{LaTeX/Environment|figure}}. In fact, the two bear a lot of similarities (positioning, captions, etc.). More information about floating environments, captions etc. can be found in [[LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions|Floats, Figures and Captions]].

The environment names may now seem quite confusing. Let's sum it up:
* {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} is for the content itself (columns, lines, etc.).
* {{LaTeX/Environment|table}} is for the location of the table on the document, plus caption and label support.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{table}[position specifier]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{{{!}}l{{!}}}
    ... your table ...
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{This table shows some data}
  \label{tab:myfirsttable}
\end{table}
}}

In the table, we used a label, so now we can refer to it just like any other reference:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\ref{tab:myfirsttable}
}}

The {{LaTeX/Environment|table}} environment is also useful when you want to have a
list of tables at the beginning or end of your document with the command

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\listoftables
}}
The captions show now up in the list of tables, if displayed.

You can set the optional parameter {{LaTeX/Parameter|position specifier}} to define the position of the table, where it should be placed. The following characters are all possible placements. Using sequences of it define your &quot;wishlist&quot; to LaTeX.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|h}}
| where the table is declared ('''h'''ere)
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|t}}
| at the '''t'''op of the page
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|b}}
| at the '''b'''ottom of the page
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|p}}
| on a dedicated '''p'''age of floats
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|!}}
|override the default float restrictions. E.g., the maximum size allowed of a {{LaTeX/Parameter|b}} float is normally quite small; if you want a large one, you need this {{LaTeX/Parameter|!}} parameter as well.
|-
|}

Default is ''tbp'', which means that it is by default placed on the top of the page. If that's not possible, it's placed at the bottom if possible, or finally with other floating environments on an extra page.

You can force LaTeX to use one given position. E.g. ''[!h]'' forces LaTeX to place it exactly where you place it (Except when it's really impossible, e.g you place a table ''here'' and this place would be the last line on a page). Again, understand it correctly: it urges LaTeX to put the table at a specific place, but it will not be placed there if LaTeX thinks it will not look great. If you really want to place your table manually, do not use the {{LaTeX/Environment|table}} environment.

Centering the table horizontally works like everything else, using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\centering&lt;!----&gt;}} command just after opening the {{LaTeX/Environment|table}} environment, or by enclosing it with a {{LaTeX/Environment|center}} environment.

== Using spreadsheets and data analysis tools ==

For complex or dynamic tables, you may want to use a spreadsheet. You might save lots of time by building tables using specialized software and exporting them in LaTeX format. The following plugins and libraries are available for some popular software:
* [http://calc2latex.sourceforge.net/ calc2latex]: for OpenOffice.org Calc spreadsheets,
* [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/excel2latex/ excel2latex]: for Microsoft Office Excel,
* [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4894-matrix2latex matrix2latex]: for MATLAB,
* [https://github.com/TheChymera/matrix2latex matrix2latex]: for Python and MATLAB,
* [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_latex.html pandas]: pandas DataFrame's have a method to convert data they contain to latex,
* [http://rubygems.org/gems/latex-tools latex-tools]: a Ruby library,
* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/index.html xtable]: a library for R,
* [http://orgmode.org/ org-mode]: for Emacs users, org-mode tables can be used inline in LaTeX documents, see [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/A-LaTeX-example.html] for a tutorial.
* [http://emacswiki.org/emacs/AlignCommands Emacs align commands]: the align commands can clean up a messy LaTeX table.
* [http://truben.no/latex/table/ Online Table generator for LATeX]: An online tool for creating simple tables within the browser. LaTeX format is directly generated as you type.
* [http://www.tablesgenerator.com/ Create LaTeX tables online ]: Online tool.

However, copying the generated source code to your document is not convenient at all. For maximum flexibility, generate the source code to a separate file which you can input from your main document file with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\input&lt;!----&gt;}} command.
If your speadsheet supports command-line, you can generate your complete document (table included) in one command, using a Makefile for example.

See [[LaTeX/Modular Documents|Modular Documents]] for more details.

== Need more complicated features? ==

Have a look at one of the following packages:

* [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hhline &lt;tt&gt;hhline&lt;/tt&gt;]:   do whatever you want with horizontal lines
* [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array &lt;tt&gt;array&lt;/tt&gt;]:    gives you more freedom on how to define columns
* [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/colortbl &lt;tt&gt;colortbl&lt;/tt&gt;]: make your table more colorful
* [http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/threeparttable &lt;tt&gt;threeparttable&lt;/tt&gt;] makes it possible to put footnotes both within the table and its caption
* [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/arydshln &lt;tt&gt;arydshln&lt;/tt&gt;]: creates dashed horizontal and vertical lines

There are two possibilities to include graphics in your document. Either create them with some special code, a topic which will be discussed in the ''Creating Graphics'' part, (see [[LaTeX/Introducing Procedural Graphics|Introducing Procedural Graphics]]) or import productions from [[#Third-party graphics tools|third party tools]], which is what we will be discussing here.

Strictly speaking, LaTeX cannot manage pictures directly: in order to introduce graphics within documents, LaTeX just creates a box with the same size as the image you want to include and embeds the picture, without any other processing. This means you will have to take care that the images you want to include are in the right format to be included. This is not such a hard task because LaTeX supports the most common picture formats around.

== Raster graphics vs. vector graphics ==

Raster graphics will highly contrast with the quality of the document if they are not in a high resolution, which is the case with most graphics. The result may be even worse once printed.

Most drawing tools (e.g. for diagrams) can export in vector format. So you should always prefer PDF or EPS to PNG or JPG.

==The ''graphicx'' package==

As stated before, LaTeX can't manage pictures directly, so we will need some extra help: we have to load the {{LaTeX/Package|graphicx}} package[http://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx/] in the preamble of our document:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{graphicx}
}}

This package accepts as an argument the external driver to be used to manage pictures; however, the latest version of this package takes care of everything by itself, changing the driver according to the compiler you are using, so you don't have to worry about this. Still, just in case you want to understand better how it works, here are the possible options you can pass to the package:
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|dvips}} (default if compiling with &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt;), if you are compiling with &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; to get a DVI and you want to see your document with a DVI or PS viewer.
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|dvipdfm}}, if you are compiling with &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; to get a DVI that you want to convert to PDF using ''dvipdfm'', to see your document with any PDF viewer.
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|pdftex}} (default if compiling with &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt;), if you are compiling with &lt;tt&gt;pdftex&lt;/tt&gt; to get a PDF that you will see with any PDF viewer.
But, again, you don't need to pass any option to the package because the default settings are fine in most of the cases.

In many respects, importing your images into your document using LaTeX is fairly simple... ''once'' you have your images in the right format that is! Therefore, I fear for many people the biggest effort will be the process of converting their graphics files. Now we will see which formats we can include and then we will see how to do it.

==Document Options==

The graphics and graphicx packages recognize the {{LaTeX/Parameter|draft}} and {{LaTeX/Parameter|final}} options given in the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\documentclass[...]{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} command at the start of the file. (See [[LaTeX/Document Structure#Document Classes|Document Classes]].) Using {{LaTeX/Parameter|draft}} as the option will suppress the inclusion of the image in the output file and will replace the contents with the name of the image file that would have been seen. Using {{LaTeX/Parameter|final}} will result in the image being placed in the output file. The default is {{LaTeX/Parameter|final}}.

==Supported image formats==

As explained before, the image formats you can use depend on the driver that {{LaTeX/Package|graphicx}} is using but, since the driver is automatically chosen according to the compiler, then the allowed image formats will depend on the compiler you are using.

{{Warning|Using &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; will be usually much more simple for graphics inclusion as it supports widespread formats such as PDF, PNG and JPG. Read this chapter carefully if you are using the DVI compiler (&lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt;), otherwise you might encounter a lot of errors at compile time.}}

Consider the following situation: you have added some pictures to your document in JPG and you have successfully compiled it in PDF. Now you want to compile it in DVI, you run &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; and you get a lot of errors... because you forgot to provide the EPS versions of the pictures you want to insert.

At the beginning of this book, we had stated that the same LaTeX source can be compiled in both DVI and PDF without any change. This is true, as long as you don't use particular packages, and {{LaTeX/Package|graphicx}} is one of those. In any case, you can still use both compilers with documents with pictures as well, as long as you always remember to provide the pictures in two formats (EPS and one of JPG, PNG or PDF).

===Compiling with ''latex''===

The only format you can include while compiling with &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; is [[w:Encapsulated PostScript|Encapsulated PostScript]] ('''EPS''').

The EPS format was defined by Adobe Systems for making it easy for applications to import postscript-based graphics into documents. Because an EPS file declares the size of the image, it makes it easy for systems like LaTeX to arrange the text and the graphics in the best way. EPS is a [[w:Vector graphics|vector format]]—this means that it can have very high quality if it is created properly, with programs that are able to manage vector graphics. It is also possible to store bit-map pictures within EPS, but they will need ''a lot'' of disk space.

===Compiling with ''pdflatex''===

If you are compiling with &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; to produce a PDF, you have a wider choice. You can insert:
* '''JPG''', widely used on Internet, digital cameras, etc. They are the best choice if you want to insert photos.
* '''PNG''', a very common format (even if not as much as JPG); it's a [[w:lossless|lossless]] format and it's the best choice for diagrams (if you were not able to generate a [[w:Vector graphics|vector]] version) and screenshots.
* '''PDF''', it is widely used for documents but can be used to store images as well. It supports both vector and [[w:Raster graphics|bit-map]] images, but it's not recommended for the latter, as JPG or PNG will provide the same result using less disk space.
* '''EPS''' can be used with the help of the {{LaTeX/Package|epstopdf}} package. Depending on your installation,
** you may just need to have it installed, there is no need to load it in your document;
** if it does not work, you need to load it just after the {{LaTeX/Package|graphicx}} package. Additionally, since {{LaTeX/Package|epstopdf}} will need to convert the EPS file into a PDF file and store it, you need to give &quot;writing permissions&quot; to your compiler. This is done by adding an option to the compiling command, ''e.g.'' &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex -shell-escape file.tex&lt;/tt&gt; (if you use a LaTeX editor, they usually allow to modify the command in the configuration options). Check the epstopdf documentation for other compilers.

== Including graphics ==

Now that we have seen which formats we can include and how we could manage those formats, it's time to learn how to include them in our document.
After you have loaded the {{LaTeX/Package|graphicx}} package in your preamble, you can include images with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\includegraphics&lt;!----&gt;}}, whose syntax is the following:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\includegraphics[attr1=val1, attr2=val2, ..., attrn=valn]{imagename}
}}

As usual, arguments in square brackets are optional, whereas arguments in curly braces are compulsory.

The argument in the curly braces is the name of the image. Write it ''without'' the extension. This way the LaTeX compiler will look for any supported image format in that directory and will take the best one (EPS if the output is DVI; JPEG, PNG or PDF if the output is PDF). Images can be saved in multiple formats for different purposes. For example, a directory can have &quot;&lt;tt&gt;diagram.pdf&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for high-resolution printing, while &quot;&lt;tt&gt;diagram.png&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; can be used for previewing on the monitor. You can specify which image file is to be used by &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; through the preamble command:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.png,.jpg}
}}
which specifies the files to include in the document (in order of preference), if files with the same basename exist, but with different extensions.

The variety of possible attributes that can be set is fairly large, so only the most common are covered below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|1=width=xx}}
| width=&quot;50%&quot; | Specify the preferred width of the imported image to ''xx''.
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''NB. Only specifying either width or height will scale the image while maintaining the aspect ratio.''
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|1=height=xx}}
| Specify the preferred height of the imported image to ''xx''.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|keepaspectratio}}
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | This can be set to either ''true'' or ''false''. When true, it will scale the image according to both height and width, but will not distort the image, so that neither width nor height are exceeded.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|1=scale=xx}}
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Scales the image by the desired scale factor. e.g, 0.5 to reduce by half, or 2 to double.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|1=angle=xx}}
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | This option can rotate the image by ''xx'' degrees (counter-clockwise)
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|1=trim=l b r t}}
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | This option will crop the imported image by ''l'' from the left, ''b'' from the bottom, ''r'' from the right, and ''t'' from the top. Where l, b, r and t are lengths.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|clip}}
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | For the {{LaTeX/Parameter|trim}} option to work, you must set {{LaTeX/Parameter|1=clip=true}}.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|1=page=x}}
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | If the image file is a pdf file with multiple pages, this parameter allows you to use a different page than the first.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|1=resolution=x}}
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Specify image resolution in dpi
|}

In order to use more than one option at a time, simply separate each with a comma. The order you give the options matters. E.g you should first rotate your graphic (with angle) and then specify its width. 

Included graphics will be inserted just ''there'', where you placed the code, and the compiler will handle them as &quot;big boxes&quot;. As we will see in the [[LaTeX/Floats, Figures and Captions|floats section]], this can disrupt the layout; you'll probably want to place graphics inside floating objects.

Also note that the trim option does not work with XeLaTex.

Be careful using any options, if you are working with the chemnum-package. The labels defined by {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cmpdref{&lt;label name&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}} might not behave as expected. Scaling the image for instance may be done by {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\scalebox&lt;!----&gt;}} instead.

The ''star'' version of the command will work for .eps files only. For a more portable solution, the standard way should take precedence. The star command will take the crop dimension as extra parameter:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\includegraphics*[100,100][300,300]{mypicture}
}}

=== Examples ===

OK, it's time to see graphicx in action. Here are some examples.  Say you had a file 'chick.jpg' you would include it like:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\includegraphics{chick}
}}

This simply imports the image, without any other processing. However, it is very large (so we won't give an example of how it would look here!) So, let's scale it down:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{chick}
|render=
[[Image:chick1.png]]
}}

This has now scaled it by half. If you wish to be more specific and give actual lengths of the image dimensions, this is how to go about it:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\includegraphics[width=2.5cm]{chick}
|render=

}}

One can also specify the scale with respect to the width of a line in the local environment ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\linewidth&lt;!----&gt;}}), the width of the text on a page ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textwidth&lt;!----&gt;}}) or the height of the text on a page ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textheight&lt;!----&gt;}}) (pictures not shown):

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{chick}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chick}
\includegraphics[height=\textheight]{chick}
}}

To rotate (I also scaled the image down):

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\includegraphics[scale=0.5, angle=180]{chick}
|render=

}}

And finally, an example of how to crop an image should you wish to focus on one particular area of interest:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
%trim option's parameter order: left bottom right top
\includegraphics[trim = 10mm 80mm 20mm 5mm, clip, width=3cm]{chick}
|render=

}}

'''Note:''' the presence of {{LaTeX/Parameter|clip}}, as the trim operation will not work without it.

'''Trick:''' You can also use negative trim values to add blank space to your graphics, in cases where you need some manual alignment.

===Spaces in names===

If the image file were called &quot;chick picture.png&quot;, then you need to include the full filename when importing the image:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{chick picture.png}
|render=
chick_picture.png[[Image:chick1.png]]
}}

One option is to not use spaces in file names (if possible), or to simply replace spaces with underscores (&quot;chick picture.png&quot; to &quot;chick_picture.png&quot;)

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{chick_picture.png}
|render=[[Image:chick1.png]]
}}

=== Borders ===
It is possible to have LaTeX create a border around your image by using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fbox&lt;!----&gt;}}:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setlength\fboxsep{0pt}
\setlength\fboxrule{0.5pt}
\fbox{\includegraphics{chick}&lt;!----&gt;}
}}

You can control the border padding with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setlength\fboxsep{0pt}&lt;!----&gt;}} command, in this case I set it to 0pt to avoid any padding, so the border will be placed tightly around the image. You can control the thickness of the border by adjusting the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setlength\fboxrule{0.5pt}&lt;!----&gt;}} command.

See [[LaTeX/Boxes|Boxes]] for more details on {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\framebox&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fbox&lt;!----&gt;}}.

== Graphics storage ==

The command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\graphicspath&lt;!----&gt;}} tells LaTeX where to look for images, which can be useful if you store images centrally for use in many different documents. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\graphicspath&lt;!----&gt;}} command takes one argument, which specifies the additional paths you want to be searched when the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\includegraphics&lt;!----&gt;}} command is used. Here are some examples (trailing / is required):

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\graphicspath{ {/var/lib/images/} }
\graphicspath{ {images_folder/}{other_folder/}{third_folder/} }
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
\graphicspath{ {c:\mypict~1\camera} }
\graphicspath{ {c:/mypict~1/camera/} } % works well in Win XP
}}

Please see http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf. In the third example shown there should be a directory named &quot;images&quot; in the same directory as your main tex file, i.e. this is RELATIVE addressing. 

Using absolute paths, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\graphicspath&lt;!----&gt;}} makes your file less portable, while using relative paths (like the third example), there should not be any problem with portability.  The fourth example uses the &quot;safe&quot; (MS-DOS) form of the Windows ''MyPictures'' folder because it's a bad idea to use directory names containing spaces.  Again, ensure file names do not contain spaces or alternatively if you are using PDFLaTeX, you can use the package {{LaTeX/Package|grffile}} which will allow you to use spaces in file names.

Note that you cannot make the graphicx package search directories recursively.
Under Linux/Unix, you can achieve a recursive search using the environment variable &lt;tt&gt;TEXINPUTS&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g., by setting it to 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
export TEXINPUTS=./images//:./Snapshots//
&lt;/source&gt;

before running latex/pdflatex or your TeX-IDE.
(But this, of course, is not a portable method.)

== Images as figures ==

The figure environment is not exclusively used for images. We will only give a short preview of figures here. More information on the figure environment and how to use it can be found in [[LaTeX/Floats, Figures and Captions|Floats, Figures and Captions]].

There are many scenarios where you might want to accompany an image with a caption and possibly a cross-reference. This is done using the {{LaTeX/Environment|figure}} environment. The following code sample shows the bare minimum required to use an image as a figure.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{figure}[p]
    \includegraphics{image.png}
\end{figure}
}}

The above code extract is relatively trivial, and doesn't offer much functionality. The following code sample shows an extended use of the figure environment which is almost universally useful, offering a caption and label, centering the image and scaling it to 80% of the width of the text.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{figure}[p]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{image.png}
    \caption{Awesome Image}
    \label{fig:awesome_image}
\end{figure}
}}

== Text wrapping around pictures ==

See [[LaTeX/Floats, Figures and Captions|Floats, Figures and Captions]].

== Seamless text integration ==

The drawback of importing graphics that were generated with a third-party tool is that font and size will not match with the rest of the document. There are still some workarounds though.

The easiest solution is to use the picture environment and then simply use the &quot;put&quot; command to put a graphics file inside the picture, along with any other desired LaTeX element. For example:




{{LaTeX/Example|code=\setlength{\unitlength}{0.8cm}
\begin{picture}(6,5)
\put(3.5,0.4){$\displaystyle
s:=\frac{a+b+c}{2}$}
\put(1,1){\includegraphics[
  width=2cm,height=2cm]{picture.eps} }
\end{picture}
|render=[[image:Latex_picture_example.png|150px]]
}}

Note that the border around the picture in the above example was added by using [[../Importing_Graphics#Borders|&lt;code&gt;\fbox&lt;/code&gt;]], so the contents of the border is the picture as generated by the above code.

Tools like Inkscape or Xfig have a dedicated LaTeX export feature that will let you use correct font and size for text in vector graphics. See [[#Third-party graphics tools|#Third-party graphics tools]].

For a perfect integration of graphics, you might consider [[LaTeX/Introducing Procedural Graphics|procedural graphics]] capabilities of some LaTeX packages like TikZ or PSTricks. It lets you ''draw'' from within a document source. While the learning curve is steeper, it is worth it most of the time.

== Including full PDF pages ==

There is a great package for including full pages of PDF files: [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages pdfpages]. It is capable of inserting entire pages as is and more pages per one page in any layout (e.g. 2x3).

The package has several options:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[ options ]{pdfpages}
}}
Options:
* '''final''': Inserts pages. This is the default.
* '''draft''': Does not insert pages, but prints a box and the filename instead.
* '''enable-survey''': Activates survey functionalities. (Experimental, subject to change.)

The first command is
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\includepdf[ key=val ]{ filename }
}}
Options for '''key=val''' (A comma separated list of options using the key = value syntax)

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| '''pages'''
| Selects pages to insert. The argument is a comma separated list, containing page numbers (pages={3,5,6,8}), ranges of page numbers (pages={4-9}) or any combination. To insert empty pages use {}. For instance {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=pages={3,{},8-11,15}&lt;!----&gt;}} will insert page 3, an empty page, and pages 8, 9, 10, 11, and 15.

Actually not only links but all kinds of PDF annotations will get lost. Page ranges are specified by the following syntax: ''m - n''. This selects all pages from ''m to n''. Omitting m defaults to the first page; omitting n defaults to the last page of the document. Another way to select the last page of the document, is to use the keyword last. (This is only permitted in a page range.)
E.g.: ''pages=-'' will insert all pages of the document, and ''pages=last-1'' will insert all pages in reverse order.
(Default: pages=1)
|-
| '''angle'''
| You can use the angle-option for turning the included page, for exampe for turning a landscape document when the latex-document is portrait. Example: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=angle=90&lt;!----&gt;}}
|-
| '''addtolist'''
| Adds an entry to the list of figures, the list of tables, or any other list (e.g. from float.sty). This option requires four arguments, separated by commas:
{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=addtolist={ page number , type , heading , label }&lt;!----&gt;}}
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|page number}} : Page number of the inserted page.
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|type}}: Name of a floating environment. (figure, table, etc.)
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|heading}}: Title inserted into LoF, LoT, etc.
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|label}}: Name of the label. This label can be referred to with \ref and \pageref.
Like addtotoc, addtolist accepts multiple sets of the above mentioned four arguments, all separated by commas. The proper recursive definition is:
{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=addtolist={ page number , type , heading , label [, lof-list ] }&lt;!----&gt;}}
|-
| '''pagecommand'''
| Declares LaTeX-commands, which are executed on each sheet of paper. (Default: ''pagecommand={\thispagestyle{empty}}''
{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=pagecommand={\label{fig:mylabel}&lt;!----&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}
|-
|}

You can also insert pages of several external PDF documents.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\includepdfmerge[ key=val ]{ file-page-list }
}}

Several PDFs can be placed table-like on one page.
See more information in its [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages/pdfpages.pdf documentation].

==Converting graphics==

;Note:
You should also take a look at [[LaTeX/Export To Other Formats|Export To Other Formats]] for other possibilities.

;epstopdf
You can convert EPS to PDF with the [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/epstopdf/ epstopdf utility], included in package of the same name. This tool is actually called by &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; to convert EPS files to PDF in the background when the {{LaTeX/Package|graphicx}} package is loaded. This process is completely invisible to the user.

You can batch convert files using the command-line.
In Bourne Shell (Unix) this can be done by:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ for i in *.eps; do epstopdf &quot;$i&quot;; done
&lt;/source&gt;

In Windows, multiple files can be converted by placing the following line in a [[w:Batch file|batch file]] (a text file with a &lt;tt&gt;.bat&lt;/tt&gt; extension) in the same directory as the images:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
for %%f in (*.eps) do epstopdf %%f
&lt;/source&gt;
which can then be run from the command line.

If {{LaTeX/Package|epstopdf}} produces whole page with your small graphics somewhere on it, use 
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ epstopdf --gsopt=-dEPSCrop foo.eps
&lt;/source&gt;
 
or try using &lt;tt&gt;ps2pdf&lt;/tt&gt; utility which should be installed with Ghostscript (required for any TeX distribution).
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ ps2pdf -dEPSCrop foo.eps
&lt;/source&gt; 
to crop final PDF.

;eps2eps
When all of the above fails, one can simplify the EPS file before attempting other conversions, by using the [http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/eps2eps1.html eps2eps] tool (also see next section):
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ eps2eps input.eps input-e2.eps
&lt;/source&gt;
This will convert all the fonts to pre-drawn images, which is sometimes desirable when submitting manuscripts for publication. However, on the downside, the fonts are NOT converted to lines, but instead to bitmaps, which reduces the quality of the fonts.

;imgtops
[http://imgtops.sourceforge.net/ imgtops] is  a lightweight graphics utility for conversions between raster graphics (JPG, PNG, ...) and EPS/PS files.

;Inkscape
Inkscape can also convert files from and to several formats, either from the GUI or from the command-line. For instance, to obtain a PDF from a SVG image you can do:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ inkscape -z -D --file=input.svg --export-pdf=output.pdf
&lt;/source&gt;
It is possible to run this from within a LaTeX file, the {{LaTeX/package|svg}} package (when running (pdf)latex with the --shell-escape option) can do this using Inkscape's pdf+tex export option, or a simple macro can be used.  See [http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/2099/28808 How to include SVG diagrams in LaTeX? -- Stackexchange]
See [[LaTeX/Export To Other Formats|Export To Other Formats]] for more details.

;pstoedit
To properly edit an EPS file, you can convert it to an ''editable'' format using [http://www.pstoedit.net/ pstoedit]. For instance, to get an Xfig-editable file, do:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ pstoedit -f fig input.eps output.fig
&lt;/source&gt;
And to get an SVG file (editable with any vector graphics tool like Inkscape) you can do:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ pstoedit -f plot-svg input.eps output.svg
&lt;/source&gt;
Sometimes pstoedit fails to create the target format (for example when the EPS file contains clipping information).

;PDFCreator
Under Windows, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/ PDFCreator] is an open source software that can create PDF as well as EPS files. It installs a virtual printer that can be accessed from other software having a &quot;print...&quot; entry in their menu (virtually any program).

;Raster graphics converters
*[http://pts.szit.bme.hu/sam2p/ Sam2p] (&lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt;) or 
*[http://www.imagemagick.org/ ImageMagick] (&lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt;) or
*[http://www.graphicsmagick.org/ GraphicsMagick] (&lt;tt&gt;gm convert&lt;/tt&gt;).                

These three programs operate much the same way, and can convert between most graphics formats. Sam2p however is the most recent of the three and seems to offer both the best quality and to result in the smallest files.

===PNG alpha channel===
Acrobat Reader sometimes has problems with displaying colors correctly if you include graphics in PNG format with alpha channel. You can solve this problem by dropping the alpha channel. On Linux it can be achieved with &lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt; from the [[w:ImageMagick|ImageMagick]] program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
convert -alpha off input.png output.png
&lt;/source&gt;

===Converting a color EPS to grayscale===

Sometimes color EPS figures need to be converted to black-and-white or grayscale to meet publication requirements. This can be achieved with the [http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/eps2eps1.html eps2eps] of the  [http://ghostscript.com/ Ghostscript] package and [http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/~PatrickJoeckel/pscol/index.html] programs:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ eps2eps input.eps input-e2.eps
$ pscol -0gray input-e2.eps input-gray.eps
&lt;/source&gt;

== Third-party graphics tools ==

We will not tackle the topic of procedural graphics created from within LaTeX code here (TikZ, PSTricks, MetaPost and friends). See [[LaTeX/Introducing Procedural Graphics|Introducing Procedural Graphics]] for that.

You should prefer vector graphics over raster graphics for their quality. Raster graphics should only be used in case of photos. Diagrams of any sort should be vectors.

As we have seen before, LaTeX handles
* EPS and PDF for vector graphics;
* PNG and JPG for raster graphics.

If some tools cannot save in those formats, you may want to [[#Converting graphics|convert]] them before importing them.

===Vector graphics===


;Dia
[http://live.gnome.org/Dia Dia] is a cross platform diagramming utility which can export eps images, or generate tex drawn using the {{LaTeX/Package|tikz}} package.

;Inkscape

Another program for creating vector graphics is [http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape]. It can run natively under Windows, Linux or Mac OS X (with X11). It works with [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)] files, although it can export to many formats that can be included in [[LaTeX]] files, such as EPS and PDF.
From version 0.48, there is a combined PDF/EPS/PS+LaTeX output option, similar to that offered by [[w:Xfig|Xfig]].
[http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/svg-inkscape/InkscapePDFLaTeX.pdf There are instructions] on how to save your vector images in a PDF format understood by LaTeX and have LaTeX manage the text styles and sizes in the image automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctan.mirrorcatalogs.com/info/svg-inkscape/InkscapePDFLaTeX.pdf|title=How to include an SVG image in LATEX|author=Johan B. C. Engelen|publisher=mirrorcatalogs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today there is the {{LaTeX/Package|svg package}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/svg|title=The svg package on CTAN|author=Philip Ilten|publisher=ctan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides an {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\includesvg&lt;!----&gt;}} command to convert and include svg-graphics directly in your LaTeX document using Inkscape. You may have a look at this [http://laclaro.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/updated-includesvg-example/ extended example] too.

An extremely useful plug-in is [http://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/ textext], which can import LaTeX objects. This can be used for inserting mathematical notation or LaTeX fonts into graphics (which may then be imported into LaTeX documents).

;Ipe

The [[w:Ipe (program)|Ipe]] extensible drawing editor is a free vector graphics editor for creating figures in PDF or EPS format.
Unlike Xfig, Ipe represents [[LaTeX]] fonts in their correct size on the screen which makes it easier to place text labels at the right spot.
Ipe also has various snapping modes (for example, snapping to points, lines, or intersections) that can be used for geometric constructions.

;lpic
Yet another solution is provided by the {{LaTeX/Package|lpic}} packages [http://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/~matveyev/lpic/], which allows TeX annotations to imported graphics. See [[LaTeX/Floats, Figures and Captions#Labels in the figures|Labels in the figures]].

;OpenOffice.org
It is also possible to export vector graphics to EPS format using [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] Draw, which is an open source office suite available for Windows, Linux and Mac.

;TpX
Vector editor [http://tpx.sourceforge.net/ TpX] separates geometric objects from text objects. Geometric objects are saved into .PDF file, the rest is saved in .TpX file to be processed by LaTeX. User just create the graphics in TpX editor and calls the .TpX file from latex file by command   \input{...TpX}.

;Xfig
[[w:Xfig|Xfig]] is a basic program that can produce vector graphics, which can be exported to LaTeX. It can be installed on Unix platforms.

On Microsoft Windows systems, Xfig can only be installed using [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin-X]; however, this will require a fast internet connection and about 2 gigabytes of space on your computer. With Cygwin, to run Xfig, you need to first start the &quot;Start X - Server&quot;, then launch &quot;xterm&quot; to bring up a terminal. In this terminal type &quot;xfig&quot; (without the quotation marks) and press return.

Alternatively, [http://www.schmidt-web-berlin.de/winfig/index.shtml WinFIG] is an attempt to achieve the functionality of xfig on Windows computers.

There are many ways to use xfig to create graphics for LaTeX documents. One method is to export the drawing as a LaTeX document. This method, however, suffers from various drawbacks: lines can be drawn only at angles that are multiples of 30 and 45 degrees, lines with arrows can only be drawn at angles that are multiples of 45 degrees, several curves are not supported, etc.

Exporting a file as PDF/LaTeX or PS/LaTeX, on the other hand, offers a good deal more flexibility in drawing. Here's how it's done:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Create the drawing in xfig. Wherever you need LaTeX text, such as a mathematical formula, enter a LaTeX string in a textbox.
&lt;li&gt; Use the Edit tool to open the properties of each of those textboxes, and change the option on the &quot;Special Flag&quot; field to Special. This tells LaTeX to interpret these textboxes when it opens the figure.
&lt;li&gt; Go to File -&gt; Export and export the file as PDF/LaTeX (both parts) or PS/LaTeX (both parts), depending on whether you are using pdflatex or pslatex to compile your file.
&lt;li&gt; In your LaTeX document, where the picture should be, use the following, where &quot;test&quot; is replaced by the name of the image:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \input{test.pdf_t}
 \caption{Your figure}
 \label{figure:example}
\end{figure}
}}

Observe that this is just like including a picture, except that rather than using &lt;tt&gt;\includegraphics&lt;/tt&gt;, we use &lt;tt&gt;\input&lt;/tt&gt;. If the export was into PS/LaTeX, the file extension to include would be .pstex_t instead of .pdf_t.
&lt;li&gt; Make sure to include packages {{LaTeX/Package|graphicx}} and {{LaTeX/Package|color}} in the file, with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage&lt;!----&gt;}} command right below the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\documentclass&lt;!----&gt;}} command, like this:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{color}
}}

&lt;/ol&gt;
And you're done!

For more details on using xfig with LaTeX, [http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig/latex_and_xfig.html this chapter] of the [http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig/contents.html xfig User Manual] may prove helpful.

;Other tools
Commercial vector graphics software, such as Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, and FreeHand are commonly used and can ''read'' and ''write'' EPS figures. However, these products are limited to Windows and Mac OS X platforms.

=== Raster graphics ===
;Adobe Photoshop
It can save to EPS.

;GIMP
[http://www.gimp.org GIMP], has a graphical user interface, and it is multi-platform. It can save to EPS and PDF.

=== Plots and Charts ===

;Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)
[http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/ Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)], maps and a wide range of highly customisable plots.

;Gnumeric
[http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/ Gnumeric], spreadsheets has SVG, EPS, PDF export

;Gnuplot
[http://www.gnuplot.info Gnuplot], producing scientific graphics since 1986. If you want to make mathematical plots, then [http://www.gnuplot.info Gnuplot] can save in any format. You can get best results when used along [[LaTeX/PGF/TikZ|PGF/TikZ]].

;matplotlib
[http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ matplotlib], plotting library written in python, with PDF and EPS export. On the other hand there is a PGF export also.
There are some tricks to be able to import formats other than EPS into your DVI document, but they're very complicated. On the other hand, converting any image to EPS is very simple, so it's not worth considering them.

;R
[http://www.r-project.org/ R], statistical and scientific figures.

===Editing EPS graphics===

As described above, graphics content can be imported into [[LaTeX]] from outside programs as EPS files. But sometimes you want to edit or retouch these graphics files. An EPS file can be edited with any text editor since it is formatted as ASCII. In a text editor, you can achieve simple operations like replacing strings or moving items slightly, but anything further becomes cumbersome.  Vector graphics editors, like Inkscape, may also be able to import EPS files for subsequent editing.  This approach also for easier editing.  However, the importing process may occassionally modify the original EPS image.

The [[LaTeX/Importing Graphics|previous chapter]] introduced importing graphics. However, just having a picture stuck in between paragraphs does not look professional. To start with, we want a way of adding captions, and to be able to cross-reference. What we need is a way of defining ''figures''. It would also be good if LaTeX could apply principles similar to when it arranges text to look its best to arranging pictures as well. This is where ''floats'' come into play.

== Floats ==

Floats are containers for things in a document that cannot be broken over a page. LaTeX by default recognizes &quot;table&quot; and &quot;figure&quot; floats, but you can define new ones of your own (see [[#Custom floats|Custom floats]] below).  Floats are there to deal with the problem of the object that won't fit on the present page, and to help when you really don't want the object here just now.

Floats are not part of the normal stream of text, but separate entities, positioned in a part of the page to themselves (top, middle, bottom, left, right, or wherever the designer specifies). They always have a caption describing them and they are always numbered so they can be referred to from elsewhere in the text. LaTeX automatically floats Tables and Figures, depending on how much space is left on the page at the point that they are processed. If there is not enough room on the current page, the float is moved to the top of the next page. This can be changed by moving the Table or Figure definition to an earlier or later point in the text, or by adjusting some of the parameters which control automatic floating.

Authors sometimes have many floats occurring in rapid succession, which raises the problem of how they are supposed to fit on the page and still leave room for text. In this case, LaTeX stacks them all up and prints them together if possible, or leaves them to the end of the chapter in protest. The skill is to space them out within your text so that they intrude neither on the thread of your argument or discussion, nor on the visual balance of the typeset pages. 

=== Figures ===

To create a figure that floats, use the {{LaTeX/Environment|figure}} environment.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{figure}[placement specifier]
... figure contents ...
\end{figure}
}}

The previous section mentioned how floats are used to allow LaTeX to handle figures, while maintaining the best possible presentation. However, there may be times when you disagree, and a typical example is with its positioning of figures. The ''placement specifier'' parameter exists as a compromise, and its purpose is to give the author a greater degree of control over where certain floats are placed.

{{Anchor|placement}}
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Specifier
! Permission
|-
| &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;
| Place the float ''here'', i.e., ''approximately'' at the same point it occurs in the source text (however, not ''exactly'' at the spot)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;
| Position at the ''top'' of the page.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;
| Position at the ''bottom'' of the page.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;
| Put on a special ''page'' for floats only.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;
| Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining &quot;good&quot; float positions.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;
| Places the float at precisely the location in the LaTeX code. Requires the {{LaTeX/Package|float}} package,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/float/&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{float}&lt;!----&gt;}}. This is somewhat equivalent to {{LaTeX/Parameter|!ht}}.
|}

What you do with these ''placement permissions'' is to list which of the options you wish to make available to LaTeX. These are simply possibilities, and LaTeX will decide when typesetting your document which of your supplied specifiers it thinks is best. Frank Mittelbach describes the algorithm&lt;ref&gt;[http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/39020 Float environment positioning, by Frank Mittelbach]&lt;/ref&gt;:

*If a float is encountered, LaTeX attempts to place it immediately according to its rules (detailed later)
**if this succeeds, the float is placed and that decision is never changed;
**if this does not succeed, then LaTeX places the float into a holding queue to be reconsidered when the next page is started (but not earlier).
*Once a page has finished, LaTeX examines this holding queue and tries to empty it as best as possible. For this it will first try to generate as many float pages as possible (in the hope of getting floats off the queue). Once this possibility is exhausted, it will next try to place the remaining floats into top and bottom areas. It looks at all the remaining floats and either places them or defers them to a later page (i.e., re-adding them to the holding queue once more).
*After that, it starts processing document material for this page. In the process, it may encounter further floats.
*If the end of the document has been reached or if a \clearpage is encountered, LaTeX starts a new page, relaxes all restrictive float conditions, and outputs all floats in the holding queue by placing them on float page(s).

In some special cases LaTeX won't follow these positioning parameters and additional commands will be necessary, for example, if one needs to specify an alignment other than centered for a float that sits alone in one page&lt;ref&gt;http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/28556/how-to-place-a-float-at-the-top-of-a-floats-only-page&lt;/ref&gt;.

Use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\listoffigures&lt;!----&gt;}} to add a list of the figures in the beginning of the document.
To change the name used in the caption from '''Figure''' to '''Example''',
use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\renewcommand{\figurename}{Example}&lt;!----&gt;}} in the figure contents.

==== Figures with borders ====

It's possible to get a thin border around all figures. You have to write the following once at the beginning of
the document:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{float}
\floatstyle{boxed} 
\restylefloat{figure}
}}
The border will not include the caption.

=== Tables ===

Floating tables are covered in a [[LaTeX/Tables#Floating with table|separate chapter]].
Let's give a quick reminder here. The {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} environment that was used to construct the tables is not a float by default. Therefore, for tables you wish to float, wrap the {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} environment within a {{LaTeX/Environment|table}} environment, like this:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{...}
  ... table data ...
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
}}

You may feel that it is a bit long winded, but such distinctions are necessary, because you may not want all tables to be treated as a float.

Use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\listoftables&lt;!----&gt;}} to add a list of the tables in the beginning of the document.

== Keeping floats in their place ==

The {{LaTeX/Package|placeins}}[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/placeins] package provides the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\FloatBarrier&lt;!----&gt;}}, which can be used to prevent floats from being moved over it. This can, e.g., be useful at the beginning of each section. The package even provides an option to change the definition of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\section&lt;!----&gt;}} to automatically include a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\FloatBarrier&lt;!----&gt;}}. This can be set by loading the package with the option {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=[section]&lt;!----&gt;}} ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage[section]{placeins}&lt;!----&gt;}}).  {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\FloatBarrier&lt;!----&gt;}} may also be useful to prevent floats intruding on lists created using {{LaTeX/Environment|itemize}} or {{LaTeX/Environment|enumerate}}.  The {{LaTeX/Package|flafter}} package can be used to force floats to appear after they are defined, and the {{LaTeX/Package|endfloat}}[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat] package can be used to place all floats at the end of a document. The {{LaTeX/Package|float}}[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/float] package provides the &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt; option to floating environments, which stops them from floating.

== Captions ==

It is always good practice to add a caption to any figure or table. Fortunately, this is very simple in LaTeX. All you need to do is use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\caption{''text''}&lt;!----&gt;}} command within the float environment. LaTeX will automatically keep track of the numbering of figures, so you do not need to include this within the caption text.

The location of the caption is traditionally underneath the float. However, it is up to you to therefore insert the caption command after the actual contents of the float (but still within the environment). If you place it before, then the caption will appear above the float. Try out the following example to demonstrate this effect:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}

\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \caption{A picture of a gull.}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{gull}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
    \reflectbox{%
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{gull}&lt;!----&gt;}
  \caption{A picture of the same gull
           looking the other way!}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[!ht]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; l c r &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}
    \hline
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
    7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A simple table}
\end{table}

Notice how the tables and figures
have independent counters.

\end{document}
|render=
[[Image:Latex caption example.png|center|347px]]
}}

Note that the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\reflectbox{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} flips its content horizontally.

=== Side captions ===

It is sometimes desirable to have a caption appear on the side of a float, rather than above or below. The {{LaTeX/Package|sidecap}} package can be used to place a caption beside a figure or table. The following example demonstrates this for a figure by using a {{LaTeX/Environment|SCfigure}} environment in place of the {{LaTeX/Environment|figure}} environment.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{sidecap}

\begin{document}

\begin{SCfigure}
  \centering
  \caption{ ... caption text ... }
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]%
    {Giraff_picture}% picture filename
\end{SCfigure}

\end{document}
|render=
[[Image:Latex example sidecap.png]]
}}

=== Unnumbered captions ===
In some types of document (such as presentations), it may not be desirable for figure captions to start ''Figure:''.  This is easy to suppress by just placing the caption text in the  {{LaTeX/Environment|Figure}} environment, without enclosing it in a {{LaTeX/Environment|Caption}}.  This however means that there is no caption available for inclusion in a list of figures.

=== Renaming table caption prefix ===

In case you want to rename your table caption from &quot;Table&quot; to something else, you can use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\captionsetup&lt;!----&gt;}} command. For example,
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{caption}
\captionsetup[table]{name=New Table Name}
}}

==Lists of figures and tables==

Captions can be listed at the beginning of a paper or report in a &quot;List of Tables&quot; or a &quot;List of Figures&quot; section by using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\listoftables&lt;!----&gt;}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\listoffigures&lt;!----&gt;}} commands, respectively. The caption used for each figure will appear in these lists, along with the figure numbers, and page numbers that they appear on.

The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\caption&lt;!----&gt;}} command also has an optional parameter, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\caption[''short'']{''long''}&lt;!----&gt;}} which is used for the ''List of Tables'' or ''List of Figures''. Typically the {{LaTeX/Parameter|short}} description is for the caption listing, and the {{LaTeX/Parameter|long}} description will be placed beside the figure or table. This is particularly useful if the caption is long, and only a &quot;one-liner&quot; is desired in the figure/table listing. Here is an example of this usage:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}

\listoffigures

\section{Introduction}

\begin{figure}[hb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4in]{gecko}
  \caption[Close up of \textit{Hemidactylus} sp.]
   {Close up of \textit{Hemidactylus} sp., which is
   part the genus of the gecko family. It is the
   second most speciose genus in the family.}
\end{figure}

\end{document}
|render=
[[Image:LaTeX figure caption with lof entry.png|400px]]
}}

== Labels and cross-referencing ==

Labels and cross-references work fairly similarly to the general case - see the [[LaTeX/Labels and Cross-referencing|Labels and Cross-referencing]] section for more information.

{{Warning|If you want to label a figure so that you can reference it later, you have to add the label '''after the caption''' (inside seems to work in LaTeX 2e) but '''inside the floating environment'''. If it is declared outside, it will give the section number.}}

If the label picks up the section or list number instead of the figure number, put the label inside the caption to ensure correct numbering.  If you get an error when the label is inside the caption, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\protect&lt;!----&gt;}} in front of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\label&lt;!----&gt;}} command.

== Wrapping text around figures ==

An author may prefer that some floats do not break the flow of text, but instead allow text to wrap around it. (Obviously, this effect only looks decent when the figure in question is significantly narrower than the text width.) 

A word of warning: Wrapping figures in LaTex will require a lot of manual adjustment of your document. There are several packages available for the task, but none of them works perfectly. Before you make the choice of including figures with text wrapping in your document, make sure you have considered all the options. For example, you could use a layout with two columns for your documents and have no text-wrapping at all.

Anyway, we will look at the package {{LaTeX/Package|wrapfig}}. Note that {{LaTeX/Package|wrapfig}} may not come with the default installation of LaTeX; you might need to [[LaTeX/Installing Extra Packages|install additional packages]]. Noted also, wrapfig is incompatible with the enumerate and itemize environments

To use {{LaTeX/Package|wrapfig}}, you must first add this to the preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{wrapfig}
}}
This then gives you access to:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{wrapfigure}[lineheight]{position}{width}
}}

There are overall eight possible positioning targets:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| r
| R
| right side of the text
|-
| l
| L
| left side of the text
|-
| i
| I
| inside edge–near the binding (in a {{LaTeX/Parameter|twoside}} document)
|-
| o
| O
| outside edge–far from the binding
|}

The uppercase-character allows the figure to float, while the lowercase version means &quot;exactly here&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;http://ftp.univie.ac.at/packages/tex/macros/latex/contrib/wrapfig/wrapfig-doc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''width'' is, of course, the width of the figure. An example:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{gull}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A gull}
\end{wrapfigure}
|render=
[[Image:Latex example wrapfig.png|center|337px]]
}}

You can also allow LaTeX to assign a width to the wrap by setting the width to 0pt. \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0pt}

Note that we have specified a size for both the {{LaTeX/Environment|wrapfigure}} environment and the image we have included. We did it in terms of the text width: it is always better to use relative sizes in LaTeX, let LaTeX do the work for you! The &quot;wrap&quot; is slightly bigger than the picture, so the compiler will not return any strange warning and you will have a small white frame between the image and the surrounding text. You can change it to get a better result, but if you don't keep the image smaller than the &quot;wrap&quot;, you will see the image ''over'' the text.

The wrapfig package can also be used with user-defined floats with float package. See below in the [[#Custom floats|section on custom floats]].

===Tip for figures with too much white space===

It happens that you'll generate figures with too much (or too little) white space on the top or bottom. In such a case, you can simply make use of the optional argument {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=[lineheight]&lt;!----&gt;}}. It specifies the height of the figure in number of lines of text. Also remember that the environment {{LaTeX/Environment|center}} adds some extra white space at its top and bottom; consider using the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\centering&lt;!----&gt;}} instead.

Another possibility is adding space within the float using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vspace{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} command. The argument is the size of the space you want to add, you can use any unit you want, including pt, mm, in, etc. If you provide a negative argument, it will add a ''negative'' space, thus removing some white space. Using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vspace&lt;!----&gt;}} tends to move the caption relative to the float while the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=[lineheight]&lt;!----&gt;}} argument does not. Here is an example using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vspace&lt;!----&gt;}} command, the code is exactly the one of the previous case, we just added some negative vertical spaces to shrink everything up:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
  \vspace{-20pt}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{gull}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-20pt}
  \caption{A gull}
  \vspace{-10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}
|render=
[[Image:Latex example wrapfig vspace.png|center|336]]
}}

In this case it may look too shrunk, but you can manage spaces the way you like. In general, it is best not to add any space at all: let LaTeX do the formatting work!

(In this case, the problem is the use of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{center}&lt;!----&gt;}} to center the image. The {{LaTeX/Environment|center}} environment adds extra space that can be avoided if {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\centering&lt;!----&gt;}} is used instead.)

You can use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=intextsep}} parameter to control additional space above and below the figure: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setlength\intextsep{0pt}&lt;!----&gt;}}

Alternatively you might use the {{LaTeX/Package|picins}} package instead of the wrapfig package which produces a correct version without the excess white space out of the box without any hand tuning.

There is also an alternative to {{LaTeX/Package|wrapfig}}: the package {{LaTeX/Package|floatflt}} [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/floatflt].

To remove the white space from a figure once for all, one should refer to the program pdfcrop, included in most TeX installations.

== Subfloats ==

A useful extension is the {{LaTeX/Package|subcaption}}[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subcaption] package which uses subfloats within a single float. The {{LaTeX/Package|subfigure}} and {{LaTeX/Package|subfig}} packages are deprecated however they are useful alternatives when used in-conjunction with latex templates (i.e templates for journals from Springer and IOP, IEEETran and ACM SIG) that are not compatible with {{LaTeX/Package|subcaption}}. These packages give the author the ability to have subfigures within figures, or subtables within table floats. Subfloats have their own caption, and an optional global caption.  An example will best illustrate the usage of the {{LaTeX/Package|subcaption}} package:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gull}
        \caption{A gull}
        \label{fig:gull}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad, \hfill etc. 
      %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tiger}
        \caption{A tiger}
        \label{fig:tiger}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad, \hfill etc. 
    %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mouse}
        \caption{A mouse}
        \label{fig:mouse}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Pictures of animals}\label{fig:animals}
\end{figure}
}}

[[Image:Latex example subfig.png|center|500px]]

You will notice that the figure environment is set up as usual. You may also use a table environment for subtables. For each subfloat, you need to use: 

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{table}[&lt;placement specifier&gt;]
    \begin{subtable}[&lt;placement specifier&gt;]{&lt;width&gt;}
        \centering
        ... table 1 ...
    \caption{&lt;sub caption&gt;}
    \end{subtable}
    ~
    \begin{subtable}[&lt;placement specifier&gt;]{&lt;width&gt;}
        \centering
        ... table 2 ...
        \caption{&lt;sub caption&gt;}
    \end{subtable}
\end{table}
}}

If you intend to cross-reference any of the subfloats, see where the label is inserted; {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\caption&lt;!----&gt;}} outside the {{LaTeX/Environment|subfigure}}-environment will provide the global caption. 

{{LaTeX/Package|subcaption}} will arrange the figures or tables side-by-side providing they can fit, otherwise, it will automatically shift subfloats below. This effect can be added manually, by putting the newline command ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\&lt;!----&gt;}}) before the figure you wish to move to a newline.

Horizontal spaces between figures are controlled by one of several commands, which are placed in between {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{subfigure}&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end{subfigure}&lt;!----&gt;}}:
*A non-breaking space (specified by ~ as in the example above) can be used to insert a space in between the subfigs.
*[[LaTeX/Mathematics#Controlling_horizontal_spacing|Math spaces]]: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\qquad&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\;&lt;!----&gt;}}, and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\,&lt;!----&gt;}}
*Generic space: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hspace{''length''}&lt;!----&gt;}}
*Automatically expanding/contracting space: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hfill&lt;!----&gt;}}

==Wide figures in two-column documents==

If you are writing a document using two columns (i.e. you started your document with something like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\documentclass[twocolumn]{article}&lt;!----&gt;}}), you might have noticed that you can't use floating elements that are wider than the width of a column (using a LaTeX notation, wider than {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=0.5\textwidth&lt;!----&gt;}}), otherwise you will see the image overlapping with text. If you really have to use such wide elements, the only solution is to use the &quot;starred&quot; variants of the floating environments, that are {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={figure*}&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={table*}&lt;!----&gt;}}. Those &quot;starred&quot; versions work like the standard ones, but they will be as wide as the page, so you will get no overlapping.

A bad point of those environments is that they can be placed only at the top of the page or on their own page. If you try to specify their position using modifiers like ''b'' or ''h'', they will be ignored. Add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{dblfloatfix}&lt;!----&gt;}} to the preamble in order to alleviate this problem with regard to placing these floats at the bottom of a page, using the optional specifier {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=[b]&lt;!----&gt;}}. Default is {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=[tbp]&lt;!----&gt;}}. However, ''h'' still does not work.

To prevent the figures from being placed out-of-order with respect to their &quot;non-starred&quot; counterparts, the package {{LaTeX/Package|fixltx2e}}  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=2colfltorder&lt;/ref&gt; should be used (e.g. {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{fixltx2e}&lt;!----&gt;}}).

== Custom floats ==

If tables and figures are not adequate for your needs, then you always have the option to create your own! Examples of such instances could be source code examples, or maps. For a program float example, one might therefore wish to create a float named {{LaTeX/Parameter|program}}. The package {{LaTeX/Package|float}} is your friend for this task. ''All commands to set up the new float must be placed in the preamble, and not within the document.''

# Add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{float}&lt;!----&gt;}} to the preamble of your document
# Declare your new float using: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newfloat{type}{placement}{ext}[outer counter]&lt;!----&gt;}}, where:
#* ''type'' - the new name you wish to call your float, in this instance, 'program'.
#* ''placement'' - t, b, p, or h (as previously described in [[#placement|Placement]]), where letters enumerate permitted placements.
#* ''ext'' - the file name extension of an auxiliary file for the list of figures (or whatever). Latex writes the captions to this file. 
#* ''outer counter'' - the presence of this parameter indicates that the counter associated with this new float should depend on outer counter, for example 'chapter'.
# The default name that appears at the start of the caption is the type. If you wish to alter this, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\floatname{type}{floatname}&lt;!----&gt;}}
# Changing float style can be issued with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\floatstyle{style}&lt;!----&gt;}} (Works on all subsequent {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newfloat&lt;!----&gt;}} commands, therefore, must be inserted before {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newfloat&lt;!----&gt;}} to be effective). 
#* {{LaTeX/Parameter|plain}} - the normal style for Latex floats, but the caption is always below the content.
#* {{LaTeX/Parameter|plaintop}} - the normal style for Latex floats, but the caption is always above the content.
#* {{LaTeX/Parameter|boxed}} - a box is drawn that surrounds the float, and the caption is printed below.
#* {{LaTeX/Parameter|ruled}} - the caption appears above the float, with rules immediately above and below. Then the float contents, followed by a final horizontal rule.

Float styles can also be customized as the second example below illustrates.

An example document using a new {{LaTeX/Parameter|program}} float type:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{float}

\floatstyle{ruled}
\newfloat{program}{thp}{lop}
\floatname{program}{Program}

\begin{document}

\begin{program}
  \begin{verbatim}

class HelloWorldApp {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    //Display the string
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{The Hello World! program in Java.}
\end{program}

\end{document}
}}

The {{LaTeX/Environment|verbatim}} environment is an environment that is already part of LaTeX. Although not introduced so far, its name is fairly intuitive! LaTeX will reproduce everything you give it, including new lines, spaces, etc. It is good for source code, but if you want to introduce a lot of code you might consider using the {{LaTeX/Package|listings}} package, that was made just for it.

While this is useful, one should be careful when embedding the float within another float. In particular, the error
 not in outer par mode
may occur. One solution might be to use the [H] option (not any other) on the inner float, as this option &quot;pins&quot; the inner float to the outer one.

Newly created floats with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newfloat&lt;!----&gt;}} can also be used in combination with the {{LaTeX/Package|wrapfig}} package from above. E.g. the following code creates a floating text box, which floats in the text on the right side of the page and is complete with caption, numbering, an index file with the extension .lob and a customization of the float's visual layout:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}

% have hyperref package before float in order to get strange errors with .\theHfloatbox
\usepackage{hyperref}

\usepackage{float}

% allows use of &quot;@&quot; in control sequence names
\makeatletter

% this creates a custom and simpler ruled box style
\newcommand\floatc@simplerule[2]{&lt;!----&gt;{\@fs@cfont #1 #2}\par}
\newcommand\fs@simplerule{\def\@fs@cfont{\bfseries}\let\@fs@capt\floatc@simplerule
  \def\@fs@pre{\hrule height.8pt depth0pt \kern4pt}%
  \def\@fs@post{\kern4pt\hrule height.8pt depth0pt \kern4pt \relax}%
  \def\@fs@mid{\kern8pt}%
  \let\@fs@iftopcapt\iftrue}

% this code block defines the new and custom floatbox float environment
\floatstyle{simplerule}
\newfloat{floatbox}{thp}{lob}[section]
\floatname{floatbox}{Text Box}

\begin{document}

\begin{floatbox}{r}{}
  \textit{Bootstrapping} is a resampling technique used 
  for robustly estimating statistical quantities, such as 
  the model fit $R^2$. It offers some protection against 
  the sampling bias.
  \caption{Bootstrapping}
\end{floatbox}

\end{document}
}}

=== Caption styles ===

To change the appearance of captions, use the {{LaTeX/Package|caption}} [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/caption] package. For example, to make all caption labels small and bold:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[font=small,labelfont=bf]{caption}
}}

The KOMA script packages [http://www.komascript.de/] have their own caption customizing features with e.g. {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\captionabove&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\captionformat&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setcapwidth&lt;!----&gt;}}. However these definitions have limited effect on newly created float environments with the {{LaTeX/Package|wrapfig}} package.

Alternatively, you can redefine the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thefigure&lt;!----&gt;}} command:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\thefigure}{\arabic{section}.\arabic{figure}&lt;!----&gt;}
}}

See [[LaTeX/Counters|this page]] for more information on counters.
Finally, note that the {{LaTeX/Package|caption2}} package has long been deprecated.

==Labels in the figures==

There is a LaTeX package {{LaTeX/Package|lpic}} [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/lpic] to put LaTeX on top of included graphics, thus allowing to add TeX annotations to imported graphics. 
It defines a convenient interface to put TeX over included graphics, and allows for drawing a white background under the typeset material to overshadow the graphics.
It is a better alternative for labels inside of graphics; you do not have to change text size when rescaling pictures, and all LaTeX power is available for labels.

A very similar package, with somewhat different syntax, is {{LaTeX/Package|pinlabel}} [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pinlabel].  The link given also points to the packages {{LaTeX/Package|psfrag}} and {{LaTeX/Package|overpic}}.

A much more complicated package which can be used in the same way is [[LaTeX/PGF/TikZ|TikZ]]. TikZ is a front-end to a drawing library called pgf (which is used to make beamer for instance). It can be used to label figures by adding text nodes on top of an image node.

== Summary ==

That concludes all the fundamentals of floats. You will hopefully see how much easier it is to let LaTeX do all the hard work and tweak the page layouts in order to get your figures in the best place. As always, the fact that LaTeX takes care of all caption and reference numbering is a great time saver.

Altering the paragraph formatting is rarely necessary in academic writing. It is primarily used for formatting text in floats or for more exotic documents.

== Paragraph alignment ==

Paragraphs in LaTeX are usually fully justified, ''i.e.'' flush with both the left and right margins. For whatever reason, should you wish to alter the justification of a paragraph, there are three environments at hand, and also LaTeX command equivalents.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Alignment
! Environment
! Command
|-
| Left justified
| {{LaTeX/Environment|flushleft}}
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\raggedright&lt;!----&gt;}}
|-
| Right justified
| {{LaTeX/Environment|flushright}}
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\raggedleft&lt;!----&gt;}}
|-
| Center
| {{LaTeX/Environment|center}}
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\centering&lt;!----&gt;}}
|}

All text between the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end&lt;!----&gt;}} of the specified environment will be justified appropriately. The commands listed are for use within other environments. For example, {{LaTeX/Parameter|p}} (paragraph) columns in {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}}.

{{Warning| There is no way (in standard LaTeX) to set full justification explicitly. It means that if you do not enclose the previous 3 commands into a group, the rest of the document will be affected.
So the right way of doing this with commands is
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
{\raggedleft{}Some text flushed right.}
}}
}}

However, if you ''really'' need to disable one of the above commands locally (for example because you have to use some broken package), you can use the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\justifying&lt;!----&gt;}} from package {{LaTeX/Package|ragged2e}}.

== Paragraph indent and break ==

By default, the first paragraph after a heading follows the standard Anglo-American publishers' practice of no indentation. The size of subsequent paragraph indents is determined by a parameter called {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\parindent&lt;!----&gt;}}. The default length that this constant holds is set by the document class that you use. It is possible to override it by using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setlength&lt;!----&gt;}} command. This will set paragraph indents to 1cm:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setlength{\parindent}{1cm} % Default is 15pt.
}}

Whitespace in LaTeX can also be made flexible (what Lamport calls &quot;rubber&quot; lengths). This means that values such as extra vertical space inserted before a paragraph {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\parskip&lt;!----&gt;}} can have a default dimension plus an amount of expansion minus an amount of contraction. This is useful on pages in complex documents where not every page may be an exact number of fixed-height lines long, so some give-and-take in vertical space is useful. You specify this in a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setlength&lt;!----&gt;}} command like this:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setlength{\parskip}{1cm plus4mm minus3mm}
}}

If you want to indent a paragraph that is not indented, you can use
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\indent
}}
at the beginning of the paragraph. Obviously, this will only have an effect when {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\parindent&lt;!----&gt;}} is not set to zero. If you want to indent the beginning of every section, you can use the {{LaTeX/Package|indentfirst}} package: once loaded, the beginning of any chapter/section is indented by the usual paragraph indentation.

To create a non-indented paragraph, you can use
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\noindent
}}

as the first command of the paragraph. This might come in handy when you start a document with body text and not with a sectioning command.

Be careful, however, if you decide to set the indent to zero, then it means you will need a vertical space between paragraphs in order to make them clear. The space between paragraphs is held in {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\parskip&lt;!----&gt;}}, which could be altered in a similar fashion as above. However, this parameter is used elsewhere too, such as in lists, which means you run the risk of making various parts of your document look very untidy by changing this setting. If you want to use the style of having no indentation with a space between paragraphs, use the {{LaTeX/Package|parskip}} package, which does this for you, while making adjustments to the spacing of lists and other structures which use paragraph spacing, so they don't get too far apart. If you want both indent and break, use

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{parskip}
\setlength{\parindent}{15pt}
}}

To indent subsequent lines of a paragraph, use the TeX command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hangindent&lt;!----&gt;}}. (While the default behaviour is to apply the hanging indent after the first line, this may be changed with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hangafter&lt;!----&gt;}} command.)  An example follows.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\hangindent=0.7cm This paragraph has an extra indentation at the left.
}}

The TeX commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\leftskip&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rightskip&lt;!----&gt;}} add additional space to the left and right sides of each line, allowing the formatting for subsequent paragraphs to differ from the overall document margins.  This space is in addition to the indentation added by {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\parindent&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hangindent&lt;!----&gt;}}.

To change the indentation of the last line in a paragraph, use the TeX command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\parfillskip&lt;!----&gt;}}.

== \paragraph line break ==
Default style for {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\paragraph&lt;!----&gt;}} may seem odd in the first place, as it writes the following text next to the title. If you do not like it, use a class other than the traditional article/book, or use ConTeXt or PlainTeX. Hacking of the class in use is really not the way LaTeX is intended to be used, and you may encounter a lot of frustrating issues.

Anyway, let's analyse the problem. If you add a manual line break with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\&lt;!----&gt;}}, LaTeX will complain that 

 There's no line here to end.

Simply adding an empty space will do it:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\paragraph{Title} \hspace{0pt} \\
Text...
}}

Alternatively you can use the shorter, yet not completely equivalent syntax:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\paragraph{Title} ~\\
Text...
}}

== Line spacing ==
To change line spacing in the whole document use the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\linespread&lt;!----&gt;}} covered in [[LaTeX/Text Formatting#Line Spacing|Text Formatting]].

Alternatively, you can use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{setspace}&lt;!----&gt;}} package, which is also covered in [[LaTeX/Text Formatting#Line Spacing|Text Formatting]]. This package provides the commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\doublespacing&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\onehalfspacing&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\singlespacing&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setstretch{baselinestretch}&lt;!----&gt;}}, which will specify the line spacing for all sections and paragraphs until another command is used. Furthermore, the package provides the following environments in order to change line spacing within the document but not document-wide:
* {{LaTeX/Environment|doublespace}}: lines are double spaced;
* {{LaTeX/Environment|onehalfspace}}: line spacing set to one-and-half spacing;
* {{LaTeX/Environment|singlespace}}: normal line spacing;
* {{LaTeX/Environment|spacing}}: customizable line spacing, e.g. {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{spacing}{\baselinestretch} ... \end{spacing}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

See the section on [[LaTeX/List Structures#Customizing Lists|customizing lists]] for information on how to change the line spacing in lists.

== Manual breaks ==

LaTeX takes care of formatting, breaks included. You should avoid manual breaking as much as possible, for it could lead to very bad formatting.

Controlling the breaks should be reserved to macro and package writers. Here follows a quick reference.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newline&lt;!----&gt;}}
| Breaks the line at the point of the command.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\&lt;!----&gt;}}
| Breaks the line at the point of the command; it is usually a shorter version of the previous command, but LaTeX sometimes redefines it for several environments. This command also features the vertical space as optional parameter.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\*&lt;!----&gt;}}
| Breaks the line at the point of the command and additionally prohibits a page break after the forced line break. This command also features the vertical space as optional parameter.
|-
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\[extra-space]&lt;!----&gt;}}
|  Command \\ has an optional argument that specifies the amount of extra vertical space to be inserted before the next line. This amount can be  negative. 
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\linebreak[number]&lt;!----&gt;}}
| Breaks the line at the point of the command. The ''number'' you provide as an argument represents the priority of the command in a range from 0 (it will be easily ignored) to 4 (do it anyway). LaTeX will try to produce the best line breaks possible. If it cannot, it will decide whether including the linebreak or not according to the priority you have provided.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\break&lt;!----&gt;}} (TeX)
| Breaks the line without filling the current line. This will result in an underful badness if you do not fill the line yourself, ''i.e.'' {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=...\hfill\break ...&lt;!----&gt;}}. Actually {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hfill\break&lt;!----&gt;}} produces the same as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newline&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\&lt;!----&gt;}}.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\par&lt;!----&gt;}} (TeX)
| Starts a new paragraph. It is a horizontal mode command, so you can only use it in a paragraph.
|}

The page breaks are covered in [[LaTeX/Page Layout#Manual page formatting|Page Layout]]. More details on manual spaces between paragraphs (such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bigskip&lt;!----&gt;}}) can be found in [[LaTeX/Lengths|Lengths]].

== Special paragraphs ==

=== Verbatim text ===

There are several ways to introduce text that won't be interpreted by the compiler. If you use the {{LaTeX/Environment|verbatim}} environment, everything input between the ''begin'' and ''end'' commands are processed as if by a typewriter. All spaces and new lines are reproduced as given, and the text is displayed in an appropriate fixed-width font. Any LaTeX command will be ignored and handled as plain text. This is ideal for typesetting program source code. Here is an example:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{verbatim}
The verbatim environment
  simply reproduces every
 character you input,
including all  s p a c e s!
\end{verbatim}
|render=
[[Image:verbatim.svg]]
}}

Note: once in the {{LaTeX/Environment|verbatim}} environment, the only command that will be recognized is {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end{verbatim}&lt;!----&gt;}}. Any others will be output. The font size in the verbatim environment can be adjusted by placing a [[#Sizing_text|font size command]] before {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{verbatim}&lt;!----&gt;}}. If this is a problem, you can use the {{LaTeX/Package|alltt}} package instead, providing an environment with the same name:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{alltt}
Verbatim extended with the ability
to use normal commands.  Therefore, it
is possible to \emph{emphasize} words in
this environment, for example.
\end{alltt}
|render=
[[Image:alltt.svg]]
}}

Remember to add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{alltt}&lt;!----&gt;}} to your preamble to use it though! 
Within the {{LaTeX/Environment|alltt}} environment, you can use the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\normalfont&lt;!----&gt;}} to get back the normal font.
To write equations within the {{LaTeX/Environment|alltt}} enviroment, you can use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\(&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\)&lt;!----&gt;}} to enclose them, instead of the usual {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$&lt;!----&gt;}}.

When using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textbf{}&lt;!----&gt;}} inside the {{LaTeX/Environment|alltt}} enviroment, note that the standard font has no bold TT font. Txtfonts has bold fonts: just add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\renewcommand{\ttdefault}{txtt}&lt;!----&gt;}} after {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{alltt}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

If you just want to introduce a short verbatim phrase, you don't need to use the whole environment, but you have the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\verb&lt;!----&gt;}} command:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\verb+my text+
}}

The first character following {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\verb&lt;!----&gt;}} is the delimiter: here we have used &quot;+&quot;, but you can use any character you like except *; {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\verb&lt;!----&gt;}} will print verbatim all the text after it until it finds the next delimiter. For example, the code:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\verb;\textbf{Hi mate!};
}}
will print {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textbf{Hi mate!}&lt;!----&gt;}}, ignoring the effect {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textbf&lt;!----&gt;}} should have on text.

For more control over formatting, however, you can try the {{LaTeX/Package|fancyvrb}} package, which provides a {{LaTeX/Environment|Verbatim}} environment (note the capital letter) which lets you draw a rule round the verbatim text, change the font size, and even have typographic effects inside the {{LaTeX/Environment|Verbatim}}  environment. It can also be used in conjunction with the {{LaTeX/Package|fancybox}} package and it can add reference line numbers (useful for chunks of data or programming), and it can even include entire external files.

To use verbatim in beamer, the frame needs to be made fragile: \begin{frame}[fragile] .
====Typesetting URLs====

One of either the {{LaTeX/Package|hyperref}} or {{LaTeX/Package|url}} packages provides the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\url&lt;!----&gt;}} command, which properly typesets URLs, for example:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
Go to \url{http://www.uni.edu/~myname/best-website-ever.html} for my website.
}}

will show this URL exactly as typed (similar to the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\verb&lt;!----&gt;}} command), but the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\url&lt;!----&gt;}} command also performs a hyphenless break at punctuation characters (only in PDFLaTeX, not in plain LaTeX+ dvips). It was designed for Web URLs, so it understands their syntax and will never break midway through an unpunctuated word, only at slashes and full stops. Bear in mind, however, that spaces are forbidden in URLs, so using spaces in {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\url&lt;!----&gt;}} arguments will fail, as will using other non-URL-valid characters.

When using this command through the {{LaTeX/Package|hyperref}} package, the URL is &quot;clickable&quot; in the PDF document, whereas it is not linked to the web when using only the {{LaTeX/Package|url}} package. Also when using the {{LaTeX/Package|hyperref}} package, to remove the border placed around a URL, insert {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=pdfborder = {0 0 0 0}&lt;!----&gt;}} inside the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hypersetup{}&lt;!----&gt;}}. (Alternately {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=pdfborder = {0 0 0}&lt;!----&gt;}} might work if the four zeroes do not.)

You can put the following code into your preamble to change the style, how URLs are displayed to the normal font:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\urlstyle{same}
}}
See also [[LaTeX/Hyperlinks#Customization|Hyperlinks]]

==== ''Listing'' environment ====

This is also an extension of the verbatim environment provided by the {{LaTeX/Package|moreverb}} package. The extra functionality it provides is that it can add line numbers along side the text. The command: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{listing}[step]{first line}&lt;!----&gt;}}. The mandatory ''first line'' argument is for specifying which line the numbering shall commence. The optional ''step'' is the step between numbered lines (the default is 1, which means every line will be numbered).

To use this environment, remember to add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{moreverb}&lt;!----&gt;}} to the document preamble.

===Multiline comments===

As we have seen, the only way LaTeX allows you to add comments is by using the special character {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=%}}, that will comment out all the rest of the line after itself. This approach is really time-consuming if you want to insert long comments or just comment out a part of your document that you want to improve later, unless you're using an [[../Introduction#Getting_a_text_editor|editor]] that automates this process. Alternatively, you can use the {{LaTeX/Package|verbatim}} package, to be loaded in the preamble as usual:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{verbatim} 
}}

(you can also use the {{LaTeX/Package|comment}} package instead)
you can use an environment called {{LaTeX/Environment|comment}} that will comment out everything within itself. Here is an example:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
This is another
\begin{comment}
rather stupid,
but helpful
\end{comment}
example for embedding
comments in your document.
|render=
This is another example for embedding comments in your document.
}}

Note that this won’t work inside complex environments, like math for example. You may be wondering, why should I load a package called {{LaTeX/Package|verbatim}} to have the possibility to add comments? The answer is straightforward: commented text is interpreted by the compiler just like verbatim text, the only difference is that verbatim text is introduced within the document, while the comment is just dropped.

Alternatively, you can define a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\comment{} }} command, by adding the following to the document's preamble: 
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand{\comment}[1]{}
}}

Then, to comment out text, simply do something like this:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\comment{This is a long comment and can extend over multiple lines, etc.} But it won't show.
|render=But it won't show.
}}

This approach can, however, produce unwanted spaces in the document, so it may work better to use
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand{\comment}[2]{#2}
}}
Then if you supply only one argument to {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\comment{} }}, this has the desired effect without producing extra spaces.

Another drawback is that content is still parsed and possibly expanded, so you cannot put anything you want in it (such as LaTeX commands).
=== Skipping parts of the source ===

A more robust way of making the TeX engine skip some part of the source is to use the TeX {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\iffalse }}-conditional. The typical use is
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
This we want to keep

\iffalse % ----- START THE CUT ---------

But this part 
$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty\mathrm{d}x\,x^{-2}$$ 
we want to skip

\fi % ---------- END THE CUT -----------

Here it begins again
|render=
This we want to keep

Here it begins again
}}
The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\iffalse }}-conditional is always false.

=== Quoting text===

LaTeX provides several environments for quoting text; they have small differences and they are aimed for different types of quotations. All of them are indented on either margin, and you will need to add your own quotation marks if you want them. The provided environments are:
;{{LaTeX/Environment|quote}}
:for a short quotation, or a series of small quotes, separated by blank lines.
;{{LaTeX/Environment|quotation}}
:for use with longer quotations, of more than one paragraph, because it indents the first line of each paragraph.
;{{LaTeX/Environment|verse}}
:is for quotations where line breaks are important, such as poetry. Once in, new stanzas are created with a blank line, and new lines within a stanza are indicated using the newline command, &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\\&lt;/source&gt;. If a line takes up more than one line on the page, then all subsequent lines are indented until explicitly separated with &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\\&lt;/source&gt;.

=== Abstracts ===

In scientific publications it is customary to start with an abstract which gives the reader a quick overview of what to expect. See [[LaTeX/Document Structure#Abstract|Document Structure]].

LaTeX and the document class will normally take care of page layout issues for you. For submission to an academic publication, this entire topic will be out of your hands, as the publishers want to control the presentation. However, for your own documents, there are some obvious settings that you may wish to change: margins, page orientation and columns, to name but three. The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to configure your pages.

We will often have to deal with TeX lengths in this chapter. You should have a look at [[LaTeX/Lengths|Lengths]] for comprehensive details on the topic.

== Two-sided documents ==

Documents can be either one- or two-sided. Articles are by default one-sided, books are two-sided. Two-sided documents differentiate the left (even) and right (odd) pages, whereas one-sided do not. The most notable effect can be seen in page margins. If you want to make the ''article class two-sided'', use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\documentclass[twoside]{article}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

Many commands and variables in LaTeX take this concept into account. They are referred to as ''even'' and ''odd''.
For one-sided document, only the ''odd'' commands and variables will be in effect.

== Page dimensions ==

A page in LaTeX is defined by many internal parameters. Each parameter corresponds to the length of an element of the page, for example, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\paperheight&lt;!----&gt;}} is the physical height of the page. Here you can see a diagram showing all the variables defining the page. All sizes are given in TeX points (pt), there are 72.27pt in an inch or 1pt ≈ 0.3515mm.


&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:2em&quot;&gt;[[Image:Latex_layout.svg|500px|left]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;column-count:2; -moz-column-count:2; -webkit-column-count:2; ms-column-count:2; -o-column-count:2; column-width:20em; -moz-column-width:20em; -webkit-column-width:20em; -ms-column-width:20em; -o-column-width:20em;&quot;&gt;
# one inch + {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hoffset&lt;!----&gt;}}
# one inch + {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\voffset&lt;!----&gt;}}
# {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\oddsidemargin&lt;!----&gt;}} = 31pt
# {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\topmargin&lt;!----&gt;}} = 20pt
# {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\headheight&lt;!----&gt;}} = 12pt
# {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\headsep&lt;!----&gt;}} = 25pt
# {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textheight&lt;!----&gt;}} = 592pt
# {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textwidth&lt;!----&gt;}} = 390pt
# {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\marginparsep&lt;!----&gt;}} = 10pt
# {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\marginparwidth&lt;!----&gt;}} = 35pt
# {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\footskip&lt;!----&gt;}} = 30pt
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\marginparpush&lt;!----&gt;}} = 7pt (not shown)
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hoffset&lt;!----&gt;}} = 0pt
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\voffset&lt;!----&gt;}} = 0pt
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\paperwidth&lt;!----&gt;}} = 597pt
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\paperheight&lt;!----&gt;}} = 845pt
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br clear=all/&gt;

The current details plus the layout shape can be printed from a LaTeX document itself. Use the ''layout'' package and the command of the same name: &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;\usepackage{layout} ... \layout{}&lt;/source&gt;
To render a frame marking the margins of a document you are currently working on, add &lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\usepackage{showframe}&lt;/source&gt; to the document.

== Page size ==

It will not have been immediately obvious - because it doesn't really cause any serious problems - that the default page size for all standard document classes is ''US letter''. This is shorter by 18 mm (about 3/4 inch), and slightly wider by 8 mm (about 1/4 inch), compared to A4 (which is the standard in almost all the rest of the world). While this is not a serious issue (most printers will print the document without any problems), it is possible to specify alternative sizes as [[LaTeX/Document Structure#Document Classes|class option]]. For A4 format:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
}}

{{Warning|Note that the standard LaTeX classes use ''US Letter'' by default regardless of your TeX distribution configuration. If you have TeX Live configured to use A4 paper, it will be the default only for plainTeX and classes not specifying the paper dimension.}}

{{Warning|The a4paper option with the article document class by itself has no effect. It will only affect the page size
in connection with some appropriate package, like the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package or the {{LaTeX/Package|hyperref}} package.}}
=== More size options with ''geometry'' ===

One of the most versatile packages for page layout is the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package. The immediate advantage of this package is that it lets you customize the page size even with classes that do not support the options. For instance, to set the page size, add the following to your preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[a4paper]{geometry}
}}

The {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package has many pre-defined page sizes, like {{LaTeX/Parameter|a4paper}}, built in.  Others include:
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|a0paper}}, {{LaTeX/Parameter|a1paper}}, ..., {{LaTeX/Parameter|a6paper}},
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|b0paper}}, {{LaTeX/Parameter|b1paper}}, ..., {{LaTeX/Parameter|b6paper}},
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|letterpaper}},
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|legalpaper}},
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|executivepaper}}.

To explicitly change the paper dimensions using the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package, the {{LaTeX/Parameter|paperwidth}} and {{LaTeX/Parameter|paperheight}} options can be used. For example:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[paperwidth=5.5in, paperheight=8.5in]{geometry}
}}


=== Page size issues ===

If you intend to get a PDF in the end, there are basically three ways:
* TeX → PDF
 pdflatex myfile               # TeX → PDF
* TeX → DVI → PDF
 latex myfile                  # TeX → DVI

Sadly the PDF output page size may not be completely respectful of your settings. Some of these tools do not have the same interpretation of the DVI, PS and PDF specifications, and you may end up with a PDF which has not exactly the right size. Thankfully there is a solution to that: the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\special&lt;!----&gt;}} command lets the user pass PostScript or PDF parameters, which can be used here to set the page size appropriately.

* For &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; to work fine, using the package {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} usually works.
* For the DVI and PS ways, the safest way to always get the right paper size in the end is to add
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[...,a4paper,...]{...}
\special{papersize=210mm,297mm}
}}
to the tex file, and to append the appropriate parameters to the processors used during output generation:
 dvips -t a4 ...
 ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 ... # On Windows: ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE#a4 ... &lt;ref&gt;[http://ghostscript.com/doc/current/Use.htm#MS_Windows How to use Ghostscript]&lt;/ref&gt;

If you want US Letter instead, replace {{LaTeX/Parameter|210mm,297mm}} by {{LaTeX/Parameter|8.5in,11in}} and {{LaTeX/Parameter|a4paper}} by {{LaTeX/Parameter|letter}}. Also replace &lt;tt&gt;a4&lt;/tt&gt; by &lt;tt&gt;letter&lt;/tt&gt; in command-line parameters.

=== Page size for tablets ===

Those who want to read on tablets or other handheld digital devices need to create documents without the extra whitespace. In order to create PDF documents with optimal handheld viewing, not only must the text field and margins be adjusted, so must the page size. If you are looking for a sensible dimension, consider following the paper size used by the Supreme Court of the United States, 441pt by 666pt (or 6.125 inches by 9.25 inches), which looks great on tablets. You could also use the Supreme Court's text field size of 297 pt by 513 pt, but this is too wide for fonts other than Century Schoolbook, the font required by the Supreme Court.

== Margins ==

Readers used to perusing typical physical literature are probably wondering why there is so much white space surrounding the text. For example, on A4 paper a document will typically have 44 mm margin widths on the left and right of the page, leaving about 60% of the page width for text. The reason is improved readability. Studies have shown&lt;ref&gt;http://webtypography.net/2.1.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability&lt;/ref&gt; that it's easier to read text when there are 60&amp;ndash;70 characters per line&amp;mdash;and it would seem that 66 is the optimal number. Therefore, the page margins are set to ensure optimal readability, and excessive margin white space is tolerated as a consequence. Sometimes, this white space is left in the inner margin with the assumption that the document will be bound.

If you wish to avoid excessive white space, rather than changing the margins, consider instead using a two-column (or more) layout. This approach is the one usually taken by print magazines because it provides both readable line lengths and good use of the page. Another option for reducing the amount of whitespace on the page without changing the margins is to increase the font size using the {{LaTeX/Parameter|12pt}} option to the document class.

If you wish to change the margins of your document, there are many ways to do so:

* One older approach is to use the {{LaTeX/Package|fullpage}} package for somewhat standardized smaller margins (around an inch), but it creates lines of more than 100 characters per line at with the 10pt default font size (and about 90 if the {{LaTeX/Parameter|12pt}} documentclass option is used):

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{fullpage}
}}

For even narrower margins, the {{LaTeX/Package|fullpage}} package has a {{LaTeX/Parameter|cm}} option (around 1.5cm), which results in about 120 characters per line at the 10pt default font size, about double what is considered readable:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[cm]{fullpage}
}}

* A more modern and flexible approach is to use the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package.  This package allows you to specify the 4 margins without needing to remember the particular page dimensions commands.  You can enter the measures in centimeters and inches as well. Use {{LaTeX/Parameter|cm}} for centimeters and {{LaTeX/Parameter|in}} for inches after each value (''e.g.'' 1.0in or 2.54cm). Note that by default (''i.e.'' without any options) this package already reduces the margins, so for a 'standard layout' you may not need to specify anything. These values are relative to the edge of paper (0in) and go inward. For example, this command provides more conventional margins, better using the vertical space of the page, without creating the dramatically long lines of the {{LaTeX/Package|fullpage}} package (if the the {{LaTeX/Parameter|11pt}} documentclass option is used, the line lengths are about 88 characters for letter-sized paper and slightly less when using {{LaTeX/Parameter|a4paper}}). 

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[top=1in, bottom=1.25in, left=1.25in, right=1.25in]{geometry}
}}

It can also recreate the behavior of the {{LaTeX/Package|fullpage}} package using
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
}}

You can combine the margin options with the page size options seen in [[#More size options with geometry |this paragraph]].

* You should not use the {{LaTeX/Package|a4wide}} package for a page with A4 document size with smaller margins. It is obsolete and buggy. Use geometry package instead like this:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[a4paper,includeheadfoot,margin=2.54cm]{geometry}
}}

* Edit individual page dimension variables described above, using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\addtolength&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setlength&lt;!----&gt;}} commands. See the [[LaTeX/Lengths|Lengths]] chapter. For instance, 

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setlength{\textwidth}{6.5in}
\addtolength{\voffset}{-5pt}
}}

=== Odd and even margins ===

Using the geometry package, the options left and right are used for the inside and outside margins respectively. They also have aliases inner and outer. Thus, the easiest way to handle different margins for odd and even pages is to give the twoside option in the document class command and specify the margins as usually.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[twoside]{report}
\usepackage[inner=4cm,outer=2cm]{geometry} %left=4cm,right=2cm would be equivalent
}}

This will result in a value of 4cm on all inner margins (left margin for odd number pages and right margin for even pages) and 2cm margin on outer margins. 

Setting the same value for the inner and outer for geometry will remove the difference between the margins. Another quick way to eliminate the difference in position between even and odd numbered pages would be setting the values to '''evensidemargin''' and '''oddsidemargin''' to the half of odd's default:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{15.5pt} 
\setlength{\evensidemargin}{15.5pt}
}}

By default, the value of '''evensidemargin''' is larger than '''oddsidemargin''' in the two-sided layout, as one could wish to write notes on the side of the page. The side for the large margin is chosen opposite to the side where pages are joined together.

See the [[LaTeX/Lengths|Lengths]].

=== Top margin above Chapter ===
The top margin above a chapter can be changed using the {{LaTeX/Package|titlesec}} package. Example: [http://www.ctex.org/documents/packages/layout/titlesec.pdf]

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{titlesec}
\titlespacing*{\chapter}{0pt}{-50pt}{20pt}
\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\normalfont\huge\bfseries}{\chaptertitlename\ \thechapter}{20pt}{\Huge}
}}

The command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\titleformat&lt;!----&gt;}} must be used when the spacing of a chapter is changed. In case of a section this command can be omitted.

== Page orientation ==

When you talk about changing page orientation, it usually means changing to landscape mode, since portrait is the default. We shall introduce two slightly different styles of changing orientation.

=== Change orientation of the whole document ===

The first is for when you want all of your document to be in landscape from the very beginning. There are various packages available to achieve this, but the one we prefer is the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package. All you need to do is call the package, with ''landscape'' as an option:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}
}}

Although, if you intend to use {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} to set your paper size, don't add the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage&lt;!----&gt;}} commands twice, simply string all the options together, separating with a comma:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[a4paper,landscape]{geometry}
}}

Using standard LaTeX classes, you can use the same class options:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass[a4paper,landscape]{article}
}}

=== Change orientation of specific part ===

The second method is for when you are writing a document in portrait, but you have some contents, like a large diagram or table that would be displayed better on a landscape page. However, you still want the consistency of your headers and footers appearing the same place as the other pages.

The {{LaTeX/Package|lscape}} package is for this very purpose. It supplies a {{LaTeX/Environment|landscape}} environment, and anything inside is basically rotated. No actual page dimensions are changed. This approach is more applicable to books or reports than to typical academic publications.  Using {{LaTeX/Package|pdflscape}} instead of {{LaTeX/Package|lscape}} when generating a PDF document will make the page appear right side up when viewed: the single page that is in landscape format will be rotated, while the rest will be left in portrait orientation.

Also, to get a table to appear correctly centered on a landscaped page, one must place the {{LaTeX/Environment|tabular}} environment inside a {{LaTeX/Environment|table}} environment, which is itself inside the {{LaTeX/Environment|landscape}} environment. For instance it should look like this:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{pdflscape}
% ...

\begin{landscape}
\begin{table}
\centering     % optional, probably makes it look better to have it centered on the page
\begin{tabular}{....}
% ...
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{landscape}
}}

For books (and in general documents using the &lt;tt&gt;twoside&lt;/tt&gt; option), the &lt;tt&gt;landscape&lt;/tt&gt;-environment unfortunately does not pay attention to the different layout of even and odd pages. The macro can be fixed using a few lines of extra code in the preamble&lt;ref&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4982219/how-to-make-landscape-mode-rotate-properly-in-a-twoside-book/5320962#5320962&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Change orientation of floating environment ===

If you use the above code, you will see that the table is inserted where it is in the code. It will not be floated! To fix this you need the package {{LaTeX/Package|rotating}}. See the [[LaTeX/Rotations|Rotations]] chapter.

== Margins, page size and rotation of a specific page ==

If you need to rotate the page so that the figure fits, the chances are good that you need to scale the margins and the font size too. Again, the {{LaTeX/Package|geometry}} package comes in handy for specifying new margins for a single page only.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{geometry}
\usepackage{pdflscape}
% ...

\newgeometry{margin=1cm}
\begin{landscape}
\thispagestyle{empty} %% Remove header and footer.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize %% Smaller font size.

\begin{tabular}{....}
% ...
\end{tabular}

\end{center}
\end{table}

\end{landscape}
\restoregeometry
}}

Note that order matters!

== Page styles ==

Page styles in Latex terms refers not to page dimensions, but to the running headers and footers of a document. These headers typically contain document titles, chapter or section numbers/names, and page numbers.

=== Standard page styles ===

The possibilities of changing the headers in plain Latex are actually quite limited. There are two commands available: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagestyle{''style''}&lt;!----&gt;}} will apply the specified style to the current and all subsequent pages, and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thispagestyle{''style''}&lt;!----&gt;}} will only affect the current page. The possible styles are:

{|
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|empty}}
| Both header and footer are cleared
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|plain}}
| Header is clear, but the footer contains the page number in the center.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|headings}}
| Footer is blank, header displays information according to document class (e.g., section name) and page number top right.
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|myheadings}}
| Page number is top right, and it is possible to control the rest of the header.
|}

The commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\markright&lt;!----&gt;}}  and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\markboth&lt;!----&gt;}} can be used to set the content of the headings by hand. The following commands placed at the beginning of an article document will set the header of all pages (one-sided)  to contain &quot;John Smith&quot; top left, &quot;On page styles&quot; centered and the page number top right:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\pagestyle{headings}
\markright{John Smith\hfill On page styles\hfill}
}}

There are special commands containing details on the running page of the document.

{|
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thepage&lt;!----&gt;}}     || number of the current page
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\leftmark&lt;!----&gt;}}    || current chapter name printed like &quot;CHAPTER 3. THIS IS THE CHAPTER TITLE&quot;
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rightmark&lt;!----&gt;}}   || current section name printed like &quot;1.6. THIS IS THE SECTION TITLE&quot;
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\chaptername&lt;!----&gt;}} || the name ''chapter'' in the current language. If this is English, it will display &quot;Chapter&quot;
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thechapter&lt;!----&gt;}}  || current chapter number
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thesection&lt;!----&gt;}}  || current section number
|}

Note that {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\leftmark&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rightmark&lt;!----&gt;}} convert the names to uppercase, whichever was the formatting of the text. If you want them to print the actual name of the chapter without converting it to uppercase use the following command:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{ \markboth{#1}{} }
\renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{ \markright{#1}{} }
}}

Now {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\leftmark&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rightmark&lt;!----&gt;}} will just print the name of the chapter and section, without number and without affecting the formatting. Note that these redefinitions must be inserted ''after'' the first call of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagestyle{fancy}&lt;!----&gt;}}.  The standard book formatting of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\chaptermark&lt;!----&gt;}} is:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{\markboth{\MakeUppercase{\chaptername\ \thechapter.\ #1}&lt;!----&gt;}{}&lt;!----&gt;}
}}

Watch out: if you provide long text in two different &quot;parts&quot; only in the footer or only in the header, you might see overlapping text.

Moreover, with the following commands you can define the thickness of the decorative lines on both the header and the footer:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0.5pt}
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0pt}
}}

The first line for the header, the second for the footer. Setting it to zero means that there will be no line.

==== Plain pages issue ====

An issue to look out for is that the major sectioning commands ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\part&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\chapter&lt;!----&gt;}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\maketitle&lt;!----&gt;}}) specify a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thispagestyle{plain}&lt;!----&gt;}}. So, if you wish to suppress all styles by inserting a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagestyle{empty}&lt;!----&gt;}} at the beginning of your document, then the style command at each section will override your initial rule, for those pages only. To achieve the intended result one can follow the new section commands with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thispagestyle{empty}&lt;!----&gt;}}. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\part&lt;!----&gt;}} command, however, cannot be fixed this way, because it sets the page style, but also advances to the next page, so that {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thispagestyle{}&lt;!----&gt;}} cannot be applied to that page. Two solutions:
* simply write {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{nopageno}&lt;!----&gt;}} in the preamble. This package will make {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagestyle{plain}&lt;!----&gt;}} have the same effect as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagestyle{empty}&lt;!----&gt;}}, effectively suppressing page numbering when it is used.
* Use {{LaTeX/Package|fancyhdr}} as described below.

The tricky problem when customizing headers and footers is to get things like running section and chapter names in there. Standard LaTeX accomplishes this with a two-stage approach. In the header and footer definition, you use the commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rightmark&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\leftmark&lt;!----&gt;}} to represent the current section and chapter heading, respectively. The values of these two commands are overwritten whenever a chapter or section command is processed. For ultimate flexibility, the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\chapter&lt;!----&gt;}} command and its friends do not redefine {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rightmark&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\leftmark&lt;!----&gt;}} themselves. They call yet another command ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\chaptermark&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sectionmark&lt;!----&gt;}}, or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\subsectionmark&lt;!----&gt;}}) that is responsible for redefining {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rightmark&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\leftmark&lt;!----&gt;}}, except if they are starred -- in such a case, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\markboth{Chapter/Section name}{}&lt;!----&gt;}} must be used inside the sectioning command if header and footer lines are to be updated.

Again, several packages provide a solution:
* an alternative one-stage mechanism is provided by the package {{LaTeX/Package|titleps}});
* {{LaTeX/Package|fancyhdr}} will handle the process its own way.

=== Customizing with ''fancyhdr'' ===

To get better control over the headers, one can use the package {{LaTeX/Package|fancyhdr}} written by
Piet van Oostrum. It provides several commands that allow you to customize the header and footer lines of
your document. For a more complete guide, the author of the package produced this [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/fancyhdr/fancyhdr.pdf documentation].

To begin, add the following lines to your preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\setlength{\headheight}{15.2pt}
\pagestyle{fancy}
}}

You can now observe a new style in your document.

The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\headheight&lt;!----&gt;}} needs to be 13.6pt or more, otherwise you will get a warning and possibly formatting issues. Both the header and footer comprise three elements each according to its horizontal position (left, centre or right).

The styles supported by {{LaTeX/Package|fancyhdr}}:
* the four LaTeX styles;
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|fancy}} defines a new header for all pages but ''plain-style'' pages such as chapters and titlepage;
* {{LaTeX/Parameter|fancyplain}} is the same, but for absolutely all pages.

==== Style customization ====

The styles can be customized with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=fancyhdr&lt;!----&gt;}} specific commands.
Those two styles may be configured directly, whereas for LaTeX styles you need to make a call to the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancypagestyle&lt;!----&gt;}} command.

To set header and footer style, {{LaTeX/Package|fancyhdr}} provides three interfaces. They all provide the same features, you just use them differently. Choose the one you like most.

* You can use the following six commands.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\lhead[&lt;even output&gt;]{&lt;odd output&gt;}
\chead[&lt;even output&gt;]{&lt;odd output&gt;}
\rhead[&lt;even output&gt;]{&lt;odd output&gt;}
}}
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\lfoot[&lt;even output&gt;]{&lt;odd output&gt;}
\cfoot[&lt;even output&gt;]{&lt;odd output&gt;}
\rfoot[&lt;even output&gt;]{&lt;odd output&gt;}
}}

Hopefully, the behaviour of the above commands is fairly intuitive: if it has ''head'' in it, it affects the head etc, and obviously, ''l'', ''c'' and ''r'' means '''l'''eft, '''c'''entre and '''r'''ight respectively.

* You can also use the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancyhead&lt;!----&gt;}} for header and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancyfoot&lt;!----&gt;}} for footer. They work in the same way, so we'll explain only the first one. The syntax is:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\fancyhead[selectors]{output you want}
}}

You can use multiple selectors optionally separated by a comma. The selectors are the following:
{|
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|E}} || even page
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|O}} || odd page
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|L}} || left side
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|C}} || centered
|-
| {{LaTeX/Parameter|R}} || right side
|-
|}
so {{LaTeX/Parameter|CE,RO}} will refer to the center of the even pages and to the right side of the odd pages. 

* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancyhf&lt;!----&gt;}} is a merge of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancyhead&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancyfoot&lt;!----&gt;}}, hence the name. There are two additional selectors {{LaTeX/Parameter|H}} and {{LaTeX/Parameter|F}} to specify the header or the footer, respectively. If you omit the {{LaTeX/Parameter|H}} and the {{LaTeX/Parameter|F}}, it will set the fields for both.

These commands will only work for {{LaTeX/Parameter|fancy}} and {{LaTeX/Parameter|fancyplain}}. To customize LaTeX default style you need the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancyplainstyle&lt;!----&gt;}} command. See below for examples.

For a clean customization, we recommend you start from scratch. To do so you should ''erase'' the current pagestyle.  Providing empty values will make the field blank. So
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\fancyhf{}
}}
will just delete the current heading/footer configuration, so you can make your own.

==== Plain pages ====

There are two ways to change the style of plain pages like chapters and titlepage.

First you can use the {{LaTeX/Parameter|fancyplain}} style. If you do so, you can use the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancyplain{...}{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} inside {{LaTeX/Package|fancyhdr}} commands like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\lhead{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}, etc.

When LaTeX wants to create a page with an empty style, it will insert the first argument of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancyplain&lt;!----&gt;}}, in all the other cases it will use the second argument. For instance:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\pagestyle{fancyplain}
\fancyhf{}
\lhead{ \fancyplain{}{Author Name} }
\rhead{ \fancyplain{}{\today} }
\rfoot{ \fancyplain{}{\thepage} }
}}

It has the same behavior of the previous code, but you will get empty header and footer in the title and at the beginning of chapters.

Alternatively you could redefine the ''plain'' style, for example to have a really plain page when you want. The command to use is {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancypagestyle{plain}{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} and the argument can contain all the commands explained before. An example is the following:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\pagestyle{fancy}

\fancypagestyle{plain}{ %
  \fancyhf{} % remove everything
  \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt} % remove lines as well
  \renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0pt}
}
}}

In that case you can use any style but {{LaTeX/Parameter|fancyplain}} because it would override your redefinition.

==== Examples ====

For two-sided, it's common to mirror the style of opposite pages, you tend to think in terms of ''inner'' and ''outer''. So, the same example as above for two-sided is:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\lhead[Author Name]{}
\rhead[]{Author Name}
\lhead[]{\today}
\rhead[\today]{}
\lfoot[\thepage]{}
\rfoot[]{\thepage}
}}

This is effectively saying author name is top outer, today's date is top inner, and current page number is bottom outer. Using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancyhf&lt;!----&gt;}} can make it shorter:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\fancyhf[HLE,HRO]{Author's Name}
\fancyhf[HRE,HLO]{\today}
\fancyhf[FLE,FRO]{\thepage}
}}

Here is the complete code of a possible style you could use for a two-sided document:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\setlength{\headheight}{15pt}

\pagestyle{fancy}
\renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{ \markboth{#1}{} }
\renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{ \markright{#1} }

\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[LE,RO]{\thepage}
\fancyhead[RE]{\textit{ \nouppercase{\leftmark}&lt;!----&gt;} }
\fancyhead[LO]{\textit{ \nouppercase{\rightmark}&lt;!----&gt;} }

\fancypagestyle{plain}{ %
  \fancyhf{} % remove everything
  \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt} % remove lines as well
  \renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0pt}
}
}}

Using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fancypagestyle&lt;!----&gt;}} one can additionally define multiple styles for one's document that are easy to switch between. Here's a somewhat complicated example for a two-sided book style:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\fancypagestyle{fancybook}{%
    \fancyhf{}%
    % Note the ## here. It's required because \fancypagestyle is making a macro (\ps@fancybook).
    % If we just wrote #1, TeX would think that it's the argument to \ps@fancybook, but
    % \ps@fancybook doesn't take any arguments, so TeX would complain with an error message.
    % You are not expected to understand this.
    \renewcommand*{\sectionmark}[1]{ \markright{\thesection\ ##1} }%
    \renewcommand*{\chaptermark}[1]{ \markboth{\chaptername\ \thechapter: ##1}{} }%
    % Increase the length of the header such that the folios 
    % (typography jargon for page numbers) move into the margin
    \fancyhfoffset[LE]{6mm}% slightly less than 0.25in
    \fancyhfoffset[RO]{6mm}%
    % Put some space and a vertical bar between the folio and the rest of the header
    \fancyhead[LE]{\thepage\hskip3mm\vrule\hskip3mm\leftmark}%
    \fancyhead[RO]{\rightmark\hskip3mm\vrule\hskip3mm\thepage}%
}
}}

=== Page ''n'' of ''m'' ===

Some people like to put the current page number in context with the whole document. LaTeX only provides access to the current page number.  However, you can use the {{LaTeX/Package|lastpage}} package to find the total number of pages, like this:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{lastpage}
...
\cfoot{\thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage} }
}}

''Note the capital letters''. Also, add a backslash after {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\thepage&lt;!----&gt;}} to ensure adequate space between the page number and 'of'. And recall, when using references, that you have to run LaTeX an extra time to resolve the cross-references.

=== Alternative packages ===

Other packages for page styles are {{LaTeX/Package|scrpage2}}, very similar to {{LaTeX/Package|fancyhdr}}, and {{LaTeX/Package|titleps}}, which takes a one-stage approach, without having to use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\leftmark&lt;!----&gt;}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rightmark&lt;!----&gt;}}.

== Page background ==

The {{LaTeX/Package|eso-pic}} package will let you print content in the background of every page or individual pages.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=

The starred-version of the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\AddToShipoutPicture&lt;!----&gt;}} command applies to the current page only.

== Multi-column pages ==
=== Using the ''twocolumn'' optional class argument ===
Using a standard Latex document class, like article, you can simply pass the optional argument ''twocolumn'' to the document class: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\documentclass[twocolumn]{article}&lt;!----&gt;}} which will give the desired effect.

While this approach is useful, it has limitations. The {{LaTeX/Package|multicol}} package provides the following advantages:

* Can support up to ten columns.
* Implements a ''multicols'' environment, therefore, it is possible to mix the number of columns within a document.
* Additionally, the environment can be nested inside other environments, such as {{LaTeX/Environment|figure}}.
* {{LaTeX/Package|multicol}} outputs ''balanced'' columns, whereby the columns on the final page will be of roughly equal length.
* Vertical rules between columns can be customised.
* Column environments can be easily customised locally or globally.

=== Using {{LaTeX/Package|multicol}} package ===
The {{LaTeX/Package|multicol}} package overcomes some of the shortcomings of ''twocolumn'' and provides the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=multicol}} environment. To create a typical two-column layout:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{multicols}{2}
  lots of text
\end{multicols}
}}

Floats are not fully supported by this environment. It can only cope if you use the starred forms of the float commands (e.g., {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{figure*}&lt;!----&gt;}} ) which makes the float span all columns. This is not hugely problematic, since floats of the same width as a column may be too small, and you would probably want to span them anyway. See [[../Floats, Figures and Captions#Wide figures in two column documents|this section]] for a more detailed discussion.

The {{LaTeX/Package|multicol}} package has two important parameters which can be [[../Lengths#Length manipulation|set]] using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\setlength}}:

* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\columnseprule&lt;!----&gt;}}, sets the width of the vertical rule between columns and defaults to 0pt
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\columnsep&lt;!----&gt;}}, sets the horizontal space between columns and the defaults to 10pt, which is quite narrow

To force a break in a column, the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\columnbreak&lt;!----&gt;}} is used.

== Manual page formatting ==

There may be instances, especially in very long documents, such as books, that LaTeX will not get all page breaks looking as good as it could. It may, therefore, be necessary to manually tweak the page formatting. Of course, you should only do this at the very final stage of producing your document, once all the content is complete. LaTeX offers the following:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\newpage&lt;!----&gt;}}
| Ends the current page and starts a new one.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pagebreak[number]&lt;!----&gt;}}
| Breaks the current page at the point of the command. The optional ''number'' argument sets the priority in a scale from 0 to 4.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\nopagebreak[number]&lt;!----&gt;}}
| Stops the page being broken at the point of the command. The optional ''number'' argument sets the priority in a scale from 0 to 4.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\clearpage&lt;!----&gt;}}
| Ends the current page and causes any floats encountered in the input, but yet to appear, to be printed.
|}

== Widows and orphans ==
{{wikipedia|Widows and orphans}}
In professional books, it's not desirable to have single lines at the beginning or end of a page. In typesetting such situations are called 'widows' and 'orphans'. Normally it is possible that widows and orphans appear in LaTeX documents. You can try to deal with them using manual page formatting, but there's also an automatic solution.

LaTeX has a parameter for 'penalty' for widows and orphans ('club lines' in LaTeX terminology). With the greater penalty LaTeX will try more to avoid widows and orphans. You can try to increase these penalties by putting following commands in your document preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\widowpenalty=300
\clubpenalty=300
}}

If this does not help, you can try increasing these values even more, to a maximum of 10000. However, it is not recommended to set this value too high, as setting it to 10000 forbids LaTeX from doing this altogether, which might result in strange behavior.

It also helps to have rubber band values for the space between paragraphs:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\setlength{\parskip}{3ex plus 2ex minus 2ex}
}}

Alternatively, you can use the &lt;tt&gt;needspace&lt;/tt&gt; package to ''reserve'' some lines and thus to prevent page breaking for those lines.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\needspace{5\baselineskip}
Some
text
on
5
lines.
}}

== Troubleshooting ==
A very useful troubleshooting and designing technique is to turn on the showframe option in the geometry package (which has the same effect
as the showframe package described above).  It draws bounding boxes around the major page elements, which can be helpful because the boundaries of various regions are usually invisible, and complicated by padding whitespace.


{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[showframe]{geometry}
}}

== Ingredients ==
* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120 g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
* 1 [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] (946 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]

== Procedure ==  
# Beat the eggs, the sugar, the salt, and the vanilla together.
# [[cookbook:Scalding|Scald]] the milk and add it very slowly, stirring constantly. (See [[cookbook:Tempering|Tempering]].)
# Pour the mixture into a greased or buttered baking dish or greased or buttered small molds.
# Place the baking dish or the molds in a pan of water in a slow oven and bake for between 30 and 40 minutes.
# Test if the custard is cooked with a knife, which will come out clean when the custard is thoroughly baked.

==Tips and Variations==
* For caramel custard, add 4 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Caramel Sauce|caramel sauce]] to the eggs.

* A [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]], or frosting for the top, requires about a tablespoonful of fine sugar to the beaten white of one egg; to be placed on the top after the custard or pudding is baked, smoothed over with a broad-bladed knife dipped in cold water, and replaced in the oven to brown slightly.

*[[Cookbook:Applesauce|Applesauce]] or [[Cookbook:Quince|quince]] preserves can be placed in the bottom of the dish before baking. When set, add some more quince or apple sauce (heated) on the top with some chopped [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]] and serve hot.  When starting with fresh fruit, stew it (optionally, with sugar to taste), flavoring with the rind of a half [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], and pass it through a [[Cookbook:Sieve|sieve]], or use a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]].  The resulting puree can be decorated with some thin lemon peel cut into stars.

One of the greatest motivating forces for Donald Knuth when he began developing the original TeX system was to create something that allowed simple construction of mathematical formulae, while looking professional when printed. The fact that he succeeded was most probably why TeX (and later on, LaTeX) became so popular within the scientific community. Typesetting mathematics is one of LaTeX's greatest strengths. It is also a large topic due to the existence of so much mathematical notation.

If your document requires only a few simple mathematical formulas, plain LaTeX has most of the tools that you will need. If you are writing a scientific document that contains numerous complicated formulas, the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/publications/authors/tex/amslatex&lt;/ref&gt; introduces several new commands that are more powerful and flexible than the ones provided by LaTeX. The {{LaTeX/Package|mathtools}} package fixes some {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} quirks and adds some useful settings, symbols, and environments to amsmath.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mathtools/mathtools.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To use either package, include:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage{amsmath}
&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage{mathtools}
&lt;/source&gt;
in the preamble of the document. The {{LaTeX/Package|mathtools}} package loads the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package and hence there is no need to &lt;code&gt;\usepackage{amsmath}&lt;/code&gt; in the preamble if {{LaTeX/Package|mathtools}} is used.

== Mathematics environments ==

LaTeX needs to know beforehand that the subsequent text does indeed contain mathematical elements. This is because LaTeX typesets maths notation differently from normal text. Therefore, special environments have been declared for this purpose. They can be distinguished into two categories depending on how they are presented:

* ''text'' &amp;mdash; text formulas are displayed inline, that is, within the body of text where it is declared, for example, I can say that ''a'' + ''a'' = 2''a'' within this sentence.
* ''displayed'' &amp;mdash; displayed formulas are separate from the main text.

As math requires special environments, there are naturally the appropriate environment names you can use in the standard way. Unlike most other environments, however, there are some handy shorthands to declaring your formulas. The following table summarizes them:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; latexfontsize=&quot;scriptsize&quot;
!width=&quot;15%&quot;|Type
!Inline (within text) formulas
!Displayed equations
!Displayed and automatically numbered equations
|-
!Environment
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=math}}
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=displaymath}}
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=equation}}
|-
! width=&quot;15%&quot;|LaTeX shorthand
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\(...\) }}
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\[...\]}}
|
|-
!width=&quot;15%&quot;|TeX shorthand
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$...$}}
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$$...$$ }}
|
|-
!width=&quot;15%&quot;|Comment
|
|
|{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=equation*}} (starred version) suppresses numbering, but requires amsmath
|}
'''Suggestion''': Using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$$...$$}} should be avoided, as it may cause problems, particularly with the AMS-LaTeX macros. Furthermore, should a problem occur, the error messages may not be helpful.

The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=equation*}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=displaymath}} environments are functionally equivalent.

If you are typing text normally, you are said to be in ''text mode'', but while you are typing within one of those mathematical environments, you are said to be in ''math mode'', that has some differences compared to the ''text mode'':
# Most spaces and line breaks do not have any significance, as all spaces are either derived logically from the mathematical expressions, or have to be specified with special commands such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}}
# Empty lines are not allowed. Only one paragraph per formula.
# Each letter is considered to be the name of a variable and will be typeset as such. If you want to typeset normal text within a formula (normal upright font and normal spacing) then you have to enter the text using [[#Adding text to equations|dedicated commands.]]

=== Inserting &quot;Displayed&quot; maths inside blocks of text === 
In order for some operators, such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\lim}} or {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sum}} to be displayed correctly inside some math environments (read {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$......$}}), it might be convenient to write the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\displaystyle}} class inside the environment. Doing so might cause the line to be taller, but will cause exponents and indices to be displayed correctly for some math operators. For example, the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$\sum$}} will print a smaller Σ and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=$\displaystyle \sum$}} will print a bigger one &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sum&lt;/math&gt;, like in equations (This only works with AMSMATH package). It is also possible to force this behaviour for all math environments by declaring {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\everymath{\displaystyle} }} at the very beginning (i.e. before {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{document} }}), which is useful in longer documents.

== Symbols ==

Mathematics has many symbols! One of the most difficult aspects of learning LaTeX is remembering how to produce symbols. There is of course a set of symbols that can be accessed directly from the keyboard:
 + - = ! / ( ) [ ] &lt; &gt; | ' :

Beyond those listed above, distinct commands must be issued in order to display the desired symbols. There are many examples such as Greek letters, set and relations symbols, arrows, binary operators, etc.

For example: 

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon
 \,&lt;/math&gt;}}

Fortunately, there's a tool that can greatly simplify the search for the command for a specific symbol. Look for &quot;Detexify&quot; in the [[#External links|external links]] section below. Another option would be to look in the &quot;The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List&quot; in the [[#External links|external links]] section below.

==Greek letters==

Greek letters are commonly used in mathematics, and they are very easy to type in ''math mode''. You just have to type the name of the letter after a backslash: if the first letter is lowercase, you will get a lowercase Greek letter, if the first letter is uppercase (and only the first letter), then you will get an uppercase letter. Note that some uppercase Greek letters look like Latin ones, so they are not provided by LaTeX (e.g. uppercase ''Alpha'' and ''Beta'' are just &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; respectively).
Lowercase epsilon, theta, kappa, phi, pi, rho, and sigma are provided in two different versions.  The alternate, or ''var''iant, version is created by adding &quot;var&quot; before the name of the letter:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\alpha, \Alpha, \beta, \Beta, \gamma, \Gamma, \pi, \Pi, \phi, \varphi, \Phi   


|render=&lt;math&gt;\alpha, \Alpha, \beta, \Beta, \gamma, \Gamma, \pi, \Pi, \phi, \varphi, \Phi&lt;/math&gt;}}

Scroll down to [[#List of Mathematical Symbols]] for a complete list of Greek symbols.

== Operators ==
An operator is a function that is written as a word: e.g. trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms and exponentials (log, exp), limits (lim), as well as trace and determinant (tr, det). LaTeX has many of these defined as commands:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \cos (2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta

|render=&lt;math&gt;\cos (2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

For certain operators such as [[w:Limit (mathematics)|limits]], the subscript is placed underneath the operator:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0

|render=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}

For the [[w:Modular arithmetic|modular operator]] there are two commands: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bmod}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pmod}}:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 a \bmod b

|render=&lt;math&gt;
 a \, \bmod \, b
\,&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 x \equiv a \pmod b

|render=&lt;math&gt;
 x \equiv a \pmod b
\,&lt;/math&gt;}}

To use operators that are not pre-defined, such as [[w:argmax|argmax]], see [[../Advanced Mathematics#Custom operators|custom operators]]

== Powers and indices ==
Powers and indices are equivalent to superscripts and subscripts in normal text mode. The caret (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;; [[w:Caret|also known as the circumflex accent]]) character is used to raise something, and the underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) is for lowering. If more than one expression is raised or lowered, they should be grouped using curly braces (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;).
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}

|render=&lt;math&gt;
k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}
 \,&lt;/math&gt;}}

For powers with more than one digit, surround the power with {}.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 n^{22}
|render=&lt;math&gt;
n^{22}
 \,&lt;/math&gt;}}

An underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) can be used with a vertical bar (&lt;math&gt; | &lt;/math&gt;) to denote evaluation using subscript notation in mathematics:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 f(n) = n^5 + 4n^2 + 2 {{!}}_{n=17}

|render=&lt;math&gt;
 f(n) = n^5 + 4n^2 + 2 |_{n=17}
 \,&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Fractions and Binomials ==
A fraction is created using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\frac{numerator}{denominator}&lt;!----&gt;}} command. (for those who need their memories refreshed, that's the ''top'' and ''bottom'' respectively!). Likewise, the [[w:Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficient]] (aka the Choose function) may be written using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\binom}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}

|render=
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

It is also possible to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\choose}} command without the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}

|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

You can embed fractions within fractions:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}&lt;!----&gt;}{y-z}

|render=
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}}{y-z}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Note that when appearing inside another fraction, or in inline text &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, a fraction is noticeably smaller than in displayed mathematics. The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tfrac}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dfrac}} commands&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; force the use of the respective styles, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textstyle}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\displaystyle}}. Similarly, the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tbinom}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dbinom}} commands typeset the binomial coefficient.

Another way to write fractions is to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\over}} command without the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 {n! \over k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}

| render=
&lt;math&gt;
 {n! \over k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

For relatively simple fractions, especially within the text, it may be more aesthetically pleasing to use [[#Powers and indices|powers and indices]]:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 ^3/_7

|render=&lt;math&gt;
^3/_7
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

If this looks a little &quot;loose&quot; (overspaced), a tightened version can be defined by inserting some negative space
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

%running fraction with slash - requires math mode.
\newcommand*\rfrac[2]{{}^{#1}\!/_{#2}}

\rfrac{3}{7}
|render=&lt;math&gt;
{{}^{3}\!/_{7}}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

If you use them throughout the document, usage of {{LaTeX/Package|xfrac}} package is recommended.
This package provides {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sfrac}} command to create slanted fractions. Usage:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
Take $\sfrac{1}{2}$ cup of sugar, \dots
 
  3\times\sfrac{1}{2}=1\sfrac{1}{2}
 

Take ${}^1/_2$ cup of sugar, \dots
 
  3\times{}^1/_2=1{}^1/_2
 
|render=[[Image:LaTeX-xfrac-example.png|400px]]}}

If fractions are used as an exponent curly braces have to be used around the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sfrac}} command:

  $x^\frac{1}{2}$ % no error
  $x^\sfrac{1}{2}$ % error
  $x^{\sfrac{1}{2}}$ % no error

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
  $x^\frac{1}{2}$ % no error
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
x^\frac{1}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

In some cases, using the package alone will result in errors about certain font shapes not being available. In that case, the {{LaTeX/Package|lmodern}} and {{LaTeX/Package|fix-cm}} packages need to be added as well.



Alternatively, the {{LaTeX/Package|nicefrac}} package provides the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\nicefrac}} command, whose usage is similar to {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sfrac}}.

=== Continued fractions ===
Continued fractions should be written using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cfrac}} command&lt;ref name=amsmath/&gt;:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
  x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 
          + \cfrac{1}{a_2 
          + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{a_4} } } }
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;   x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 
           + \cfrac{1}{a_2 
           + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{a_4}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Multiplication of two numbers ===
To make multiplication visually similar to a fraction, a nested array can be used, for example multiplication of numbers written one below the other.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\begin{equation}
\frac{
    \begin{array}[b]{r}
      \left( x_1 x_2 \right)\\
      \times \left( x'_1 x'_2 \right)
    \end{array}
  }{
    \left( y_1y_2y_3y_4 \right)
  }
\end{equation}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\frac{
    \begin{array}[b]{r}
      \left( x_1 x_2 \right)\\
      \times \left( x'_1 x'_2 \right)
    \end{array}
  }{
    \left( y_1y_2y_3y_4 \right)
  }
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Roots ==
The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sqrt}} command creates a square root surrounding an expression. It accepts an optional argument specified in square brackets (&lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;) to change magnitude:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}&lt;!----&gt;}

|render=
&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

\sqrt[n]{1+x+x^2+x^3+\ldots}

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt[n]{1+x+x^2+x^3+\ldots}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}


Some people prefer writing the square root &quot;closing&quot; it over its content. This method arguably makes it more clear what is in the scope of the root sign. This habit is not normally used while writing with the computer, but if you still want to change the output of the square root, LaTeX gives you this possibility. Just add the following code in the preamble of your document:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
% New definition of square root:
% it renames \sqrt as \oldsqrt
\let\oldsqrt\sqrt
% it defines the new \sqrt in terms of the old one
\def\sqrt{\mathpalette\DHLhksqrt}
\def\DHLhksqrt#1#2{%
\setbox0=\hbox{$#1\oldsqrt{#2\,}$}\dimen0=\ht0
\advance\dimen0-0.2\ht0
\setbox2=\hbox{\vrule height\ht0 depth -\dimen0}%
{\box0\lower0.4pt\box2}&lt;!----&gt;}
|render=[[Image:Latex_new_squareroot.png|thumb|right|250px|The new style is on left, the old one on right]]
}}
This TeX code first renames the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sqrt}} command as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\oldsqrt}}, then redefines {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sqrt}} in terms of the old one, adding something more. The new square root can be seen in the picture on the left, compared to the old one on the right. Unfortunately this code won't work if you want to use multiple roots: if you try to write &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[b]{a}&lt;/math&gt; as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sqrt[b]{a}&lt;!----&gt;}} after you used the code above, you'll just get a wrong output. In other words, you can redefine the square root this way only if you are not going to use multiple roots in the whole document.

An alternative piece of TeX code that does allow multiple roots is
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

\usepackage{letltxmacro}
\makeatletter
\let\oldr@@t\r@@t
\def\r@@t#1#2{%
\setbox0=\hbox{$\oldr@@t#1{#2\,}$}\dimen0=\ht0
\advance\dimen0-0.2\ht0
\setbox2=\hbox{\vrule height\ht0 depth -\dimen0}%
{\box0\lower0.4pt\box2}&lt;!----&gt;}
\LetLtxMacro{\oldsqrt}{\sqrt}
\renewcommand*{\sqrt}[2][\ ]{\oldsqrt[#1]{#2} &lt;!----&gt;}
\makeatother


$\sqrt[a]{b} \quad \oldsqrt[a]{b}$

|render=[[Image:LaTeX example sqrt.png]]
}}
However this requires the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{letltxmacro}&lt;!----&gt;}} package

== Sums and integrals ==
The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sum}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\int}} commands insert the sum and integral symbols respectively, with limits specified using the caret (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) and underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;).  The typical notation for sums is:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i 

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i 
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
or
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i 

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}


The limits for the integrals follow the same notation.  It's also important to represent the integration variables with an upright d, which in math mode is obtained through the \mathrm{} command, and with a small space separating it from the integrand, which is attained with the \, command.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \int_0^\infty \mathrm{e}^{-x}\,\mathrm{d}x

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^\infty \mathrm{e}^{-x}\,\mathrm{d}x
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

There are many other &quot;big&quot; commands which operate in a similar manner:
{|
| &lt;code&gt;\sum&lt;/code&gt; ||width=&quot;5%&quot;| &lt;math&gt;\sum \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\prod&lt;/code&gt; ||width=&quot;5%&quot;| &lt;math&gt;\prod&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\coprod&lt;/code&gt; ||width=&quot;5%&quot;| &lt;math&gt;\coprod&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\bigoplus&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bigoplus&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\bigotimes&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bigotimes&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\bigodot&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bigodot&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\bigcup&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bigcup&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\bigcap&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bigcap&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\biguplus&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\biguplus&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\bigsqcup&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bigsqcup&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\bigvee&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bigvee&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\bigwedge&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\int&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\int&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\oint&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\oint&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\iint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\iint&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\iiint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\iiint&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\iiiint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\iiiint&lt;/math&gt; 
|style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot;|
| &lt;code&gt;\idotsint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\int \! \cdots \! \int&lt;/math&gt; 
|}

For more integral symbols, including those not included by default in the Computer Modern font, try the {{LaTeX/Package|esint}} package.

The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\substack}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; allows the use of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}} to write the limits over multiple lines:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \sum_{\substack{
   0&lt;i&lt;m \\
   0&lt;j&lt;n
  }&lt;!----&gt;} 
 P(i,j)

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\overset{\scriptstyle 0&lt;i&lt;m} {\scriptstyle 0&lt;j&lt;n}} P(i,j)
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

If you want the limits of an integral to be specified above and below the symbol (like the sum), use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\limits}} command:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \int\limits_a^b

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_a^b
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
However if you want this to apply to ALL integrals, it is preferable to specify the {{LaTeX/Parameter|intlimits}} option when loading the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[intlimits]{amsmath}
}}

Subscripts and superscripts in other contexts as well as other parameters to {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package related to them are described in [[LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics#Advanced_formatting|Advanced Mathematics]] chapter.

For bigger integrals, you may use personal declarations, or the {{LaTeX/Package|bigints}} package &lt;ref name=LM&gt; http://hdl.handle.net/2268/6219&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Brackets, braces and delimiters ==
&lt;small&gt;''How to use braces in multi line equations is described in the [[LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics#Braces_spanning_multiple_lines|Advanced Mathematics]] chapter.''&lt;/small&gt;

The use of delimiters such as brackets soon becomes important when dealing with anything but the most trivial equations. Without them, formulas can become ambiguous. Also, special types of mathematical structures, such as matrices, typically rely on delimiters to enclose them.

There are a variety of delimiters available for use in LaTeX:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

( a ), [ b ], \{ c \}, {{!}} d {{!}}, \{{!}} e \{{!}},
\langle f \rangle, \lfloor g \rfloor,
\lceil h \rceil, \ulcorner i \urcorner

|render=&lt;math&gt;
( a ), [ b ], \{ c \}, | d |, \| e \|, \langle f \rangle, \lfloor g \rfloor, \lceil h \rceil, \ulcorner i \urcorner
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
where \lbrack and \rbrack may be used in place of [ and ]. 


=== Automatic sizing ===
Very often mathematical features will differ in size, in which case the delimiters surrounding the expression should vary accordingly. This can be done automatically using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right}}, and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\middle}} commands. Any of the previous delimiters may be used in combination with these:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \left(\frac{x^2}{y^3}\right)

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{x^2}{y^3}\right)
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 P\left(A=2\middle{{!}}\frac{A^2}{B}&gt;4\right)

|
render=[[Image:Latex_example_middle.png|150px]]
}}
Curly braces are defined differently by using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left\{}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right\} }},

{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \left\{\frac{x^2}{y^3}\right\}

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\left\{\frac{x^2}{y^3}\right\}
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
 
If a delimiter on only one side of an expression is required, then an invisible delimiter on the other side may be denoted using a period (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;).
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \left.\frac{x^3}{3}\right{{!}}_0^1

|render=&lt;math&gt;
 \left.\frac{x^3}{3}\right|_0^1
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Manual sizing ===
In certain cases, the sizing produced by the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right}} commands may not be desirable, or you may simply want finer control over the delimiter sizes. In this case, the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\big}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Big}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bigg}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Bigg}} modifier commands may be used:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 ( \big( \Big( \bigg( \Bigg( 

|render=&lt;math&gt;
( \big( \Big( \bigg( \Bigg( 
 \,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
These commands are primarily useful when dealing with nested delimiters. For example, when typesetting
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d x} \left( k g(x) \right)

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d x} \left( k g(x) \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
we notice that the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right}} commands produce the same size delimiters as those nested within it. This can be difficult to read. To fix this, we write
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d x} \big( k g(x) \big)

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d x} \big( k g(x) \big)
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Manual sizing can also be useful when an equation is too large, trails off the end of the page, and must be separated into two lines using an align command. Although the commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\left.}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\right.}} can be used to balance the delimiters on each line, this may lead to wrong delimiter sizes.  Furthermore, manual sizing can be used to avoid overly large delimiters if an {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\underbrace}} or a similar command appears between the delimiters.

=== Typesetting intervals ===

To denote open and half-open intervals, the notations ]a,b[, (a,b), ]a,b], (a,b], [a,b[ and [a,b) are used. If the square bracket notation is used, then the interval must be put between curly braces (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;) in order to have correct spacing. Similarly, if a (half-)open interval starts with a negative number, then the number including its minus-symbol must also be put between curly brackets, so that LaTeX understands that the minus-symbol is the unary operation. Compare:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
x \in [-1,1]
|render=&lt;math&gt;x \in [-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
x \in {[-1,1]}
|render=&lt;math&gt;x \in {[-1,1]}&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
x \in {[{-1},1]}
|render=&lt;math&gt;x \in {[{-1},1]}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Matrices and arrays ==
A basic matrix may be created using the {{LaTeX/Environment|matrix}} environment&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;&gt;requires the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package&lt;/ref&gt;: in common with other table-like structures, entries are specified by row, with columns separated using an ampersand ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&amp;}}) and a new rows separated with a double backslash ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}})
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \begin{matrix}
  a &amp; b &amp; c \\
  d &amp; e &amp; f \\
  g &amp; h &amp; i
 \end{matrix}

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
a &amp; b &amp; c \\
d &amp; e &amp; f \\
g &amp; h &amp; i
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

To specify alignment of columns in the table, use starred version&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;&gt;requires the {{LaTeX/Package|mathtools}} package&lt;/ref&gt;:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \begin{matrix}
  -1 &amp; 3 \\
  2 &amp; -4
 \end{matrix}
 =
 \begin{matrix*}[r]
  -1 &amp; 3 \\
  2 &amp; -4
 \end{matrix*}

|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{matrix}
  -1 &amp; 3 \\
  2 &amp; -4
 \end{matrix}
 =
 \begin{matrix}
  -1 &amp; \,\;\;3 \\
  \,\;\;2 &amp; -4
 \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The alignment by default is {{LaTeX/Parameter|c}} but it can be any column type valid in {{LaTeX/Environment|array}} environment.

However matrices are usually enclosed in delimiters of some kind, and while it is possible to use the [[#Automatic sizing|&lt;code&gt;\left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\right&lt;/code&gt; commands]], there are various other predefined environments which automatically include delimiters:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Environment name
! Surrounding delimiter
! Notes
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|pmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;( \, ) &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|pmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;( \, ) &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of columns in optional parameter
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|bmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;[ \, ] &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|bmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;[ \, ] &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of columns in optional parameter
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|Bmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\{ \, \} &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|Bmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\{ \, \} &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of columns in optional parameter
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|vmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;| \, | &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|vmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;| \, | &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of columns in optional parameter
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|Vmatrix}}&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\| \, \| &lt;/math&gt;
| centers columns by default
|-
| {{LaTeX/Environment|Vmatrix*}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mathtools&quot;/&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\| \, \| &lt;/math&gt;
| allows to specify alignment of colums in optional parameter
|}

When writing down arbitrary sized matrices, it is common to use horizontal, vertical and diagonal triplets of dots (known as [[w:ellipsis|ellipses]]) to fill in certain columns and rows. These can be specified using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cdots}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vdots}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ddots}} respectively:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 A_{m,n} = 
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  &amp; \vdots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} &amp; a_{m,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{m,n} 
 \end{pmatrix}

|render=&lt;math&gt;
A_{m,n} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1,n} \\
a_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2,n} \\
\vdots  &amp; \vdots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots  \\
a_{m,1} &amp; a_{m,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{m,n} 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
In some cases you may want to have finer control of the alignment within each column, or want to insert lines between columns or rows. This can be achieved using the {{LaTeX/Environment|array}} environment, which is essentially a math-mode version of the [[../Tables#The tabular environment|&lt;code&gt;tabular&lt;/code&gt; environment]], which requires that the columns be pre-specified:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \begin{array}{c{{!}}c}
  1 &amp; 2 \\ 
  \hline
  3 &amp; 4
 \end{array}

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c|c}
1 &amp; 2 \\ 
\hline
3 &amp; 4
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

You may see that the AMS matrix class of environments doesn't leave enough space when used together with fractions resulting in output similar to this:

&lt;math&gt;
 M = \begin{bmatrix}
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; 0\\
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; 0           &amp; \frac{1}{6}\\
       0           &amp; \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6}
     \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

To counteract this problem, add additional leading space with the optional parameter to the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}} command:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 M = \begin{bmatrix}
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; 0           \\[0.3em]
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; 0           &amp; \frac{1}{6} \\[0.3em]
       0           &amp; \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6}
     \end{bmatrix}

|render=&lt;math&gt;
 M = \begin{bmatrix}
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6} &amp; 0           \\[0.3em]
       \frac{5}{6} &amp; 0           &amp; \frac{1}{6} \\[0.3em]
       0           &amp; \frac{5}{6} &amp; \frac{1}{6}
     \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

If you need &quot;border&quot; or &quot;indexes&quot; on your matrix, plain TeX provides the macro {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bordermatrix}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

M = \bordermatrix{~ &amp; x &amp; y \cr
                  A &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \cr
                  B &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \cr}

|render=[[Image:bordermatrix.png|150px]]
}}


=== Matrices in running text ===
To insert a small matrix, and not increase leading in the line containing it, use {{LaTeX/Environment|smallmatrix}} environment:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
A matrix in text must be set smaller:
$\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
a&amp;b \\ c&amp;d
\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$
to not increase leading in a portion of text.
|render=[[Image:LaTeX-smallmatrix.png]]
}}

== Adding text to equations ==

The math environment differs from the text environment in the representation of text.  Here is an example of trying to represent text within the math environment:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 50 apples \times 100 apples = lots of apples^2

|render=&lt;math&gt;
 50 apples \times 100 apples = lots of apples^2
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

There are two noticeable problems: there are no spaces between words or numbers, and the letters are italicized and more spaced out than normal. Both issues are simply artifacts of the maths mode, in that it treats it as a mathematical expression: spaces are ignored (LaTeX spaces mathematics according to its own rules), and each character is a separate element (so are not positioned as closely as normal text).

There are a number of ways that text can be added properly. The typical way is to wrap the text with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\text{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} command &lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; (a similar command is {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mbox{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}, though this causes problems with subscripts, and has a less descriptive name). Let's see what happens when the above equation code is adapted:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 50 \text{apples} \times 100 \text{apples} 
 = \text{lots of apples}^2

|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 50 \text{apples} \times 100 \text{apples} = \text{lots of apples}^2
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The text looks better. However, there are no gaps between the numbers and the words. Unfortunately, you are required to explicitly add these. There are many ways to add spaces between maths elements, but for the sake of simplicity we may simply insert space characters into the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\text}} commands.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 50 \text{ apples} \times 100 \text{ apples}
 = \text{lots of apples}^2

|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 50 \text{ apples} \times 100 \text{ apples} = \text{lots of apples}^2
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

=== Formatted text ===
Using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\text}} is fine and gets the basic result. Yet, there is an alternative that offers a little more flexibility. You may recall the introduction of [[LaTeX/Text Formatting#Font Styles|font formatting commands]], such as {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textrm}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textit}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textbf}}, etc. These commands format the argument accordingly, e.g., {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textbf{bold text}&lt;!----&gt;}} gives '''bold text'''. These commands are equally valid within a maths environment to include text. The added benefit here is that you can have better control over the font formatting, rather than the standard text achieved with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\text}}.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 50 \textrm{ apples} \times 100
 \textbf{ apples} = \textit{lots of apples}^2

|render=&lt;math&gt;
 50 \;\textrm{ apples} \times 100 \;\textbf{ apples} = \textit{lots~of~apples}^2
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Formatting mathematics symbols ==
:''See also: [[w:Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols]], [[w:Help:Displaying a formula#Alphabets and typefaces]] and [[w:Wikipedia:LaTeX symbols#Fonts]]''
We can now format text; what about formatting mathematical expressions? There are a set of formatting commands very similar to the font formatting ones just used, except that they are specifically aimed at text in math mode (requires {{LaTeX/Package|amsfonts}})

These formatting commands can be wrapped around the entire equation, and not just on the textual elements: they only format letters, numbers, and uppercase Greek, and other math commands are unaffected. 

To bold lowercase Greek or other symbols use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\boldsymbol}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt;; this will only work if there exists a bold version of the symbol in the current font. As a last resort there is the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\pmb}} command&lt;ref name=&quot;amsmath&quot;/&gt; (poor mans bold): this prints multiple versions of the character slightly offset against each other.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1,\beta_2,\dotsc,\beta_n)

|render=
&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1,\beta_2,\dotsc,\beta_n)
\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}
To change the size of the fonts in math mode, see [[../Advanced Mathematics#Changing font size|Changing font size]].

=== Accents ===
So what to do when you run out of symbols and fonts? Well the next step is to use accents:

{| 
| &lt;code&gt;a' or a^{\prime}&lt;/code&gt; ||width=&quot;15%&quot;| &lt;math&gt;a'\,&lt;/math&gt; 
|  style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;a''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a''\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\hat{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\hat{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; | &lt;code&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\bar{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\grave{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\grave{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; | &lt;code&gt;\acute{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\acute{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;\dot{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\dot{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; | &lt;code&gt;\ddot{a}&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\ddot{a} \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|-

|-

|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;a'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a'''\,&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-left:20px&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;a''''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a''''\,&lt;/math&gt;

|-

|}

== Color ==
The package {{LaTeX/Package|xcolor}}, described in [[../Colors#Adding_the_color_package|Colors]], allows us to add color to our equations. For example,
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
k = {\color{red}x} \mathbin{\color{blue}-} 2
|render=&lt;math&gt;
k = {\color{red}x} \mathbin{\color{blue}-} 2
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
The only problem is that this disrupts the default {{LaTeX}} formatting around the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=-}} operator. To fix this, we enclose it in a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\mathbin}} environment, since {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=-}} is a binary operator. This process is described [http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/21598/how-to-color-math-symbols here].

==Plus and minus signs==

LaTeX deals with the + and − signs in two possible ways. The most common is as a binary operator. When two maths elements appear on either side of the sign, it is assumed to be a binary operator, and as such, allocates some space either side of the sign. The alternative way is a sign designation. This is when you state whether a mathematical quantity is either positive or negative. This is common for the latter, as in maths, such elements are assumed to be positive unless a − is prefixed to it. In this instance, you want the sign to appear close to the appropriate element to show their association. If you put a + or a − with nothing before it but you want it to be handled like a binary operator you can add an ''invisible'' character before the operator using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={}&lt;!----&gt;}}. This can be useful if you are writing multiple-line formulas, and a new line could start with a = or a +, for example, then you can fix some strange alignments adding the invisible character where necessary.

A plus-minus sign is written as:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \pm

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\pm
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Similarly, there exists also a minus-plus sign:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=

 \mp

|render=&lt;math&gt;
\mp
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Controlling horizontal spacing ==

LaTeX is obviously pretty good at typesetting maths—it was one of the chief aims of the core TeX system that LaTeX extends. However, it can't always be relied upon to accurately interpret formulas in the way you did. It has to make certain assumptions when there are ambiguous expressions. The result tends to be slightly incorrect horizontal spacing. In these events, the output is still satisfactory, yet any perfectionists will no doubt wish to ''fine-tune'' their formulas to ensure spacing is correct. These are generally very subtle adjustments.

There are other occasions where LaTeX has done its job correctly, but you just want to add some space, maybe to add a comment of some kind. For example, in the following equation, it is preferable to ensure there is a decent amount of space between the maths and the text.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=

\[ f(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    n/2       &amp; \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\
    -(n+1)/2  &amp; \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}\\
  \end{cases}
\]


|render=
&lt;math&gt;
f(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    n/2       &amp; \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\
    -(n+1)/2  &amp; \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}\\
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

This code produces errors with Miktex 2.9 and does not yield the results seen on the right.
Use \mathrm instead of just \text.


(Note that this particular example can be expressed in more elegant code by the {{LaTeX/Environment|cases}} construct provided by the {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package described in [[LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics#The_cases_environment|Advanced Mathematics]] chapter.)

LaTeX has defined two commands that can be used anywhere in documents (not just maths) to insert some horizontal space. They are {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\qquad}}

A {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}} is a space equal to the current font size. So, if you are using an 11pt font, then the space provided by {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}} will also be 11pt (horizontally, of course.) The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\qquad}} gives twice that amount. As you can see from the code from the above example, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}}s were used to add some separation between the maths and the text.

OK, so back to the fine tuning as mentioned at the beginning of the document. A good example would be displaying the simple equation for the indefinite integral of ''y'' with respect to ''x'':

&lt;math&gt;\int y\, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;

If you were to try this, you may write:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \int y \mathrm{d}x 
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int y \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
}}

However, this doesn't give the correct result. LaTeX doesn't respect the white-space left in the code to signify that the ''y'' and the d''x'' are independent entities. Instead, it lumps them altogether. A {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\quad}} would clearly be overkill in this situation—what is needed are some small spaces to be utilized in this type of instance, and that's what LaTeX provides:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Command
! Description
! Size
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\,}}
| small space
| 3/18 of a quad
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\:}}
| medium space
| 4/18 of a quad
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\;}}
| large space
| 5/18 of a quad
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\!}}
| negative space
| -3/18 of a quad
|}

NB you can use more than one command in a sequence to achieve a greater space if necessary.

So, to rectify the current problem:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \int y\, \mathrm{d}x 
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int y\, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \int y\: \mathrm{d}x 
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int y\;\;\!\! \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
}}
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \int y\; \mathrm{d}x 
|render=
&lt;math&gt;\int y\; \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The negative space may seem like an odd thing to use, however, it wouldn't be there if it didn't have ''some'' use! Take the following example:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=

  \left(
    \begin{array}{c}
      n \\
      r
    \end{array}
  \right) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}

|render=
&lt;math&gt;\left(
   \begin{matrix}
     n \\
     r
   \end{matrix}
   \right) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}&lt;/math&gt;
}}


The matrix-like expression for representing binomial coefficients is too padded. There is too much space between the brackets and the actual contents within. This can easily be corrected by adding a few negative spaces after the left bracket and before the right bracket.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=

  \left(\!
    \begin{array}{c}
      n \\
      r
    \end{array}
  \!\right) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}

|render=
&lt;math&gt;\left(\!
   \begin{matrix}
     n \\
     r
   \end{matrix}
   \!\right) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

In any case, adding some spaces manually should be avoided whenever possible: it makes the source code more complex and it's against the basic principles of a What You See is What You Mean approach. The best thing to do is to define some commands using all the spaces you want and then, when you use your command, you don't have to add any other space. Later, if you change your mind about the length of the horizontal space, you can easily change it modifying only the command you defined before. Let us use an example: you want the ''d'' of a ''dx'' in an integral to be in roman font and a small space away from the rest. If you want to type an integral like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\int x \, \mathrm{d} x}}, you can define a command like this:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand{\dd}{\mathop{}\,\mathrm{d}&lt;!----&gt;}
}}
in the preamble of your document. We have chosen {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dd}} just because it reminds the &quot;d&quot; it replaces and it is fast to type. Doing so, the code for your integral becomes {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\int x \dd x}}. Now, whenever you write an integral, you just have to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dd}} instead of the &quot;d&quot;, and all your integrals will have the same style. If you change your mind, you just have to change the definition in the preamble, and all your integrals will be changed accordingly.

== Manually Specifying Formula Style ==
To manually display a fragment of a formula using text style, surround the fragment with curly braces and prefix the fragment with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textstyle}}. The braces are required because the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textstyle}} macro changes the state of the renderer, rendering all subsequent mathematics in text style. The braces limit this change of state to just the fragment enclosed within. For example, to use text style for just the summation symbol in a sum, one would enter
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{equation}
   C^i_j = {\textstyle \sum_k} A^i_k B^k_j
\end{equation}
}}
The same thing as a command would look like this:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\newcommand{\tsum}[1]{{\textstyle \sum_{#1}}}
}}
Note the extra braces. Just one set around the expression won't be enough. That would cause all math after {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tsum k}} to be displayed using text style.

To display part of a formula using display style, do the same thing, but use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\displaystyle}} instead.

==Advanced Mathematics: AMS Math package==

The AMS ([[Wikipedia:American Mathematical Society|American Mathematical Society]]) mathematics package is a powerful package that creates a higher layer of abstraction over mathematical LaTeX language; if you use it it will make your life easier. Some commands {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} introduces will make other plain LaTeX commands obsolete: in order to keep consistency in the final output you'd better use {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} commands whenever possible. If you do so, you will get an elegant output without worrying about alignment and other details, keeping your source code readable. If you want to use it, you have to add this in the preamble:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{amsmath}
}}

===Introducing dots in formulas===
{{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} defines also the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dots}} command, that is a generalization of the existing {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots}}. You can use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dots}} in both text and math mode and LaTeX will replace it with three dots &quot;…&quot; but it will decide according to the context whether to put it on the bottom (like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots}}) or centered (like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cdots}}).

===Dots===

LaTeX gives you several commands to insert dots (ellipses) in your formulae. This can be particularly useful if you have to type big matrices omitting elements. First of all, here are the main dots-related commands LaTeX provides:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Code !! Output !! Comment
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\dots}} || &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; || generic dots (ellipsis), to be used in text (outside formulae as well). It automatically manages whitespaces before and after itself according to the context, it's a higher level command.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots}}|| &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; || the output is similar to the previous one, but there is no automatic whitespace management; it works at a lower level.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cdots}} || &lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; || These dots are centered relative to the height of a letter. There is also the binary multiplication operator, &lt;code&gt;\cdot&lt;/code&gt;, mentioned below.
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\vdots}} || &lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt; || vertical dots
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ddots}} || &lt;math&gt;\ddots&lt;/math&gt; || diagonal dots
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\iddots}} ||  || inverse diagonal dots (requires the {{LaTeX/Package|mathdots}} package)
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\hdotsfor{n}&lt;!----&gt;}} || &lt;math&gt;\ldots \ldots&lt;/math&gt;|| to be used in matrices, it creates a row of dots spanning ''n'' columns. 
|}

Instead of using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ldots}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\cdots}}, you should use the semantically oriented commands. It makes it possible to adapt your document to different conventions on the fly, in case (for example) you have to submit it to a publisher who insists on following house tradition in this respect. The default treatment for the various kinds follows American Mathematical Society conventions.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Code !! Output !! Comment
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=A_1,A_2,\dotsc,}} || [[File:LaTeX Dotsc.png]] || for &quot;dots with commas&quot;
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=A_1+\dotsb+A_N}} || [[File:LaTeX Dotsb.png]] || for &quot;dots with binary operators/relations&quot;
|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=A_1 \dotsm A_N}} || [[File:LaTeX Dotsm.png]] || for &quot;multiplication dots&quot;

|-
| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=A_1\dotso A_N}} || [[File:LaTeX Dotso.png]] || for &quot;other dots&quot; (none of the above)

== Summary ==

As you begin to see, typesetting math can be tricky at times. However, because LaTeX provides so much control, you can get professional quality mathematics typesetting with relatively little effort (once you've had a bit of practice, of course!). It would be possible to keep going and going with math topics because it seems potentially limitless. However, with this tutorial, you should be able to get along sufficiently.

{{TODO|
* introduce symbols from [http://www.andy-roberts.net/res/writing/latex/symbols.pdf]
* add symbols from [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/wasysym/wasysym.pdf]
* consider adding symbols from [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf] -- the list of nearly all symbols available for LaTeX
* Consider, instead of using the symbols from the above mentioned, using what has already been introduced in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_markup] instead of retyping the tables
* How to box an equation within an align environment
* Color in equations

This tutorial is aimed at getting familiar with the bare bones of [[LaTeX/Introduction|LaTeX]].

Before starting, ensure you have LaTeX installed on your computer (see [[LaTeX/Installation|Installation]] for instructions of what you will need).
* We will first have a look at the LaTeX syntax.
* We will create our first LaTeX document.
* Then we will take you through how to feed this file through the LaTeX system to produce quality output, such as postscript or PDF.
* Finally we will have a look at the file names and types.

== The LaTeX syntax ==

LaTeX uses a markup language in order to describe document structure and presentation. LaTeX converts your source text, combined with the markup, into a high quality document. For the purpose of analogy, web pages work in a similar way: the HTML is used to describe the document, but it is your browser that presents it in its full glory - with different colours, fonts, sizes, etc.

The input for LaTeX is a [[w:plain text|plain text]] file. You can create it with any text editor. It contains the text of the document, as well as the commands that tell LaTeX how to typeset the text.

A minimal example looks something like the following (the commands will be explained later):

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
Hello world!
\end{document}
}}

===Spaces===

The LaTeX compiler normalises whitespace so that whitespace characters, such as [space] or [tab], are treated uniformly as &quot;space&quot;: several consecutive &quot;spaces&quot; are treated as one, &quot;space&quot; opening a line is generally ignored, and a single line break also yields “space”. A double line break (an empty line), however, defines the end of a paragraph; multiple empty lines are also treated as the end of a paragraph. An example of applying these rules is presented below: the left-hand side shows the user's input (.tex), while the right-hand side depicts the rendered output (.dvi/.pdf/.ps).

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
It does not matter whether you
enter one or several             spaces
after a word.

An empty line starts a new
paragraph.
|render=It does not matter whether you enter one or several spaces after a word.

An empty line starts a new paragraph.
}}

===Reserved Characters===
The following symbols are reserved characters that either have a special meaning under LaTeX or are unavailable in all the fonts. If you enter them directly in your text, they will normally not print but rather make LaTeX do things you did not intend.

 # $ % ^ &amp; _ { } ~ \

As you will see, these characters can be used in your documents all the same by adding a prefix backslash:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\# \$ \% \^{} \&amp; \_ \{ \} \~{} \textbackslash{}
}}

The backslash character {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\}} ''cannot'' be entered by adding another backslash in front of it ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\\}}); this sequence is used for line breaking. For introducing a backslash in math mode, you can use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\backslash}} instead.

The commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\~}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\^}} produce respectively a tilde and  a hat which is placed over the next letter. For example {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\~n}} gives ñ. That's why you need braces to specify there is no letter as argument. You can also use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textasciitilde}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textasciicircum}} to enter these characters; or [http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/9363/how-does-one-insert-a-backslash-or-a-tilde-into-latex other commands ].  

If you want to insert text that might contain several particular symbols (such as URIs), you can consider using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\verb}} command, which will be discussed later in the section on [[LaTeX/Formatting|formatting]]. For source code, see [[LaTeX/Source Code Listings|Source Code Listings]]

The 'less than' (&lt;) and 'greater than' (&gt;) characters are the only visible ASCII characters (not reserved) that will not print correctly. See [[LaTeX/Special Characters#Less_than_.3C_and_greater_than_.3E|Special Characters]] for an explanation and a workaround.

Non-ASCII characters (''e.g.'' accents, diacritics) can be typed in directly for most cases. However you must ''configure'' the document appropriately. The other symbols and many more can be printed with special commands as in mathematical formulae or as accents. We will tackle this issue in [[LaTeX/Special Characters|Special Characters]].

===LaTeX groups===
Sometimes a certain state shall be kept local, ''i.e.'' limiting its
scope. This can be done by enclosing the part to be changed locally in curly 
braces. In certain occasions, using braces won't be possible. LaTeX provides
{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\bgroup}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\egroup}} to begin and
end a group, respectively.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
normal text {\itshape walzing \bfseries Wombat} more normal text

normal text \bgroup\itshape walzing \bfseries Wombat\egroup{} more normal text
\end{document}
}}

Environments form an implicit group.

===LaTeX environments===

''Environments'' in LaTeX have a role that is quite similar to commands, but they usually have effect on a wider part of the document. Their syntax is:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{environmentname}
text to be influenced
\end{environmentname}
}}

Between the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin}} and the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end}} you can put other commands and nested environments. The internal mechanism of environments defines a group, which makes its usage safe (no influence on the other parts of the document).
In general, environments can accept arguments as well, but this feature is not commonly used and so it will be discussed in more advanced parts of the document. 

Anything in LaTeX can be expressed in terms of commands and environments.

===LaTeX commands===
LaTeX commands are case sensitive, and take one of the following two formats:
* They start with a backslash {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\}} and then have a name consisting of letters only. Command names are terminated by a space, a number or any other &quot;non-letter&quot;.
* They consist of a backslash {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\}} and exactly one non-letter.

Some commands need an argument, which has to be given between curly braces {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={ }&lt;!----&gt;}} after the command name. Some commands support optional parameters, which are added after the command name in square brackets {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=[ ]}}. The general syntax is:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\commandname[option1,option2,...]{argument1}{argument2}...
}}

Most standard LaTeX commands have a ''switch'' equivalent. Switches have no arguments but apply on the rest of the scope, ''i.e.'' the current group or environment. A switch should (almost) never be called outside of any scope, otherwise it will apply on the rest of the document.

{{Warning|Commands with arguments and switches should not be confused. This is a very common error!}}

Example:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
% \emph is a command with argument, \em is a switch.
\emph{emphasized text}, this part is normal % Correct
{\em emphasized text}, this part is normal % Correct

\em emphasized text, this part is normal % Incorrect
\em{emphasized text}, this part is normal % Incorrect
}}

===Comments===
When LaTeX encounters a {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=%}} character while processing an input file, it ignores the rest of the current line, the line break, and all whitespace at the beginning of the next line.

This can be used to write notes into the input file, which will not show up in the printed version.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=This is an % stupid
% Better: instructive &lt;----
example: Supercal%
            ifragilist%
icexpialidocious
|render= This is an example: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
}}

Note that the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=%}} character can be used to split long input lines that do not allow whitespace or line breaks, as with Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious above.

The core LaTeX language does not have a predefined syntax for commenting out regions spanning multiple lines. Refer to [[LaTeX/Paragraph_Formatting#Multiline_comments|multiline comments]] for simple workarounds.

==Our first document==

Now we can create our first document. We will produce the absolute bare minimum that is needed in order to get some output; the well known '''Hello World!''' approach will be suitable here.

* Open your favorite text-editor. [[Learning the vi Editor/Vim|vim]], [[emacs]], Notepad++, and other text editors will have syntax highlighting that will help to write your files.
* Reproduce the following text in your editor. This is the LaTeX source.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
% hello.tex - Our first LaTeX example!
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello World!
\end{document}
}}

* Save your file as &lt;tt&gt;hello.tex&lt;/tt&gt;.
When picking a name for your file, make sure it bears a &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; extension.

=== What does it all mean? ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=% hello.tex - Our first LaTeX example!}}
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | The first line is a ''comment''. This is because it begins with the percent symbol (%); when LaTeX sees this, it simply ignores the rest of the line. Comments are useful for people to annotate parts of the source file. For example, you could put information about the author and the date, or whatever you wish.
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\documentclass{article}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | This line is a command and tells LaTeX to use the {{LaTeX/Environment|article}} document class. A document class file defines the formatting, which in this case is a generic article format. The handy thing is that if you want to change the appearance of your document, substitute article for another class file that exists.
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\begin{document}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | This line is the beginning of the environment called {{LaTeX/Environment|document}}; it alerts LaTeX that content of the document is about to commence. Anything above this command is known generally to belong in the ''preamble''.
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=Hello World!}}
| This was the only actual line containing real content - the text that we wanted displayed on the page.
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end{document}&lt;!----&gt;}}
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | The {{LaTeX/Environment|document}} environment ends here. It tells LaTeX that the document source is complete, anything after this line will be ignored.
|}

As we have said before, each of the LaTeX commands begins with a backslash ({{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\}}). This is LaTeX's way of knowing that whenever it sees a backslash, to expect some commands. Comments are not classed as a command, since all they tell LaTeX is to ignore the line. Comments never affect the output of the document.

==Compilation==
=== Compilation process ===

The general concept is to transform a plain text document into a publishable
format, mostly a DVI, PS or PDF file. This process is called ''compilation'', which is done by an executable file called a ''compiler''.

There are two main compilers.
* &lt;tt&gt;tex&lt;/tt&gt; compiler reads a TeX &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; file and creates a &lt;tt&gt;.dvi&lt;/tt&gt;.
* &lt;tt&gt;pdftex&lt;/tt&gt; compiler reads a TeX &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; file and creates a &lt;tt&gt;.pdf&lt;/tt&gt;.

These compilers are basically used to compile Plain TeX, not LaTeX. There is no such LaTeX compiler since LaTeX is just a bunch of macros for TeX. However, there are two executables related to the previous compilers:
* &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; executable calls &lt;tt&gt;tex&lt;/tt&gt; with LaTeX initialization files, reads a LaTeX &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; file and creates a &lt;tt&gt;.dvi&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; executable calls &lt;tt&gt;pdftex&lt;/tt&gt; with LaTeX initialization files, reads a LaTeX &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; file and creates a &lt;tt&gt;.pdf&lt;/tt&gt;

If you compile a Plain TeX document with a LaTeX compiler (such as &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt;) it will work while the opposite is not true: if you try to compile a LaTeX source with a TeX compiler you will get many errors. 

As a matter of fact, following your operating system &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; are simple scripts or symbolic links.

Most of the programs should be already within your LaTeX distribution; the others come with [[Ghostscript]], which is a free and multi-platform software as well.
Here are common programs you expect to find in any LaTeX distribution:
* &lt;tt&gt;dvi2ps&lt;/tt&gt; converts the &lt;tt&gt;.dvi&lt;/tt&gt; file to &lt;tt&gt;.ps&lt;/tt&gt; (postscript).
* &lt;tt&gt;dvi2pdf&lt;/tt&gt; converts the &lt;tt&gt;.dvi&lt;/tt&gt; file to &lt;tt&gt;.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;dvi2pdfm&lt;/tt&gt; is an improved version).
and with Ghostscript:
* &lt;tt&gt;ps2pdf&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;pdf2ps&lt;/tt&gt; converts the &lt;tt&gt;.ps&lt;/tt&gt; file to &lt;tt&gt;.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; and vice-versa.

When LaTeX was created, the only format it could create was DVI; later PDF support was added by &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt;. PDF files can be created with both &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;dvipdfm&lt;/tt&gt;.  The output of &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; takes direct advantage of modern features of PDF such as hyperlinks and embedded fonts, which are not part of DVI.  Passing through DVI imposes limitations of its older format.  On the other hand, some packages, such as PSTricks, exploit the process of conversion to DVI, and therefore will not work with pdflatex. Some of those packages embed information in the DVI that doesn't appear when the DVI is viewed, but reemerges when the DVI is converted to another, newer format.

You would write your document slightly differently depending on the compiler you are using (&lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt;).  But as we will see later it is possible to add a sort of abstraction layer to hide the details of which compiler you're using, while the compiler can handle the translation itself.

The following diagram shows the relationships between the LaTeX source code and the formats you can create from it:

[[Image:LaTeX_diagram.svg|650px|center]]

The boxed red text represents the file formats, the blue text on the arrows represents the commands you have to use, the small dark green text under the boxes represents the image formats that are supported. Any time you pass through an arrow you lose some information, which might decrease the features of your document. Therefore, you should choose the shortest route to reach your target format. This is probably the most convenient way to obtain an output in your desired format anyway. Starting from a LaTeX source, the best way is to use only ''latex'' for a DVI output or ''pdflatex'' for a PDF output, converting to PostScript only when it is necessary to print the document.

Chapter [[../Export To Other Formats/]] discusses more about exporting LaTeX source to other file formats.

=== Generating the document ===

It is clearly not going to be the most exciting document you have ever seen, but we want to see it nonetheless. I am assuming that you are at a command prompt, already in the directory where &lt;tt&gt;hello.tex&lt;/tt&gt; is stored.
LaTeX itself does not have a GUI (graphical user interface), since it is just a program that crunches away at your input
files, and produces either a DVI or PDF file. Some LaTeX installations feature a graphical front-end where you can click LaTeX into compiling your input file. On other systems there might
be some typing involved, so here is how to coax LaTeX into compiling your input file on a text based system. Please note: this description assumes that you already have a working LaTeX installation on your computer.

# Type the command: &lt;code&gt;latex hello&lt;/code&gt; (the &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; extension is not required, although you can include it if you wish)
# Various bits of info about LaTeX and its progress will be displayed. If all went well, the last two lines displayed in the console will be: 

 Output written on hello.dvi (1 page, 232 bytes).
 Transcript written on hello.log.

This means that your source file has been processed and the resulting document is called ''hello.dvi'', which takes up 1 page and 232 bytes of space.
Now you may view the DVI file. On Unix with X11 you can type &lt;code&gt;xdvi foo.dvi&lt;/code&gt;, on Windows you can use a program called ''yap'' (yet another previewer). (Now evince and okular, the standard document viewers for many Linux distributions are able to view DVI files.)

This way you created the DVI file, but with the same source file you can create a PDF document. The steps are exactly the same as before, but you have to replace the command &lt;code&gt;latex&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;pdflatex&lt;/code&gt;:
# Type the command: &lt;code&gt;pdflatex hello&lt;/code&gt; (as before, the &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; extension is not required)
# Various bits of info about LaTeX and its progress will be displayed. If all went well, the last two lines displayed in the console will be: 

 Output written on hello.pdf (1 page, 5548 bytes).
 Transcript written on hello.log.

you can notice that the PDF document is bigger than the DVI, even if it contains exactly the same information. The main differences between the DVI and PDF formats are:
* '''DVI''' needs less disk space and it is faster to create. It does not include the fonts within the document, so if you want the document to be viewed properly on another computer, there must be all the necessary fonts installed. It does not support any interactivity such as hyperlinks or animated images. DVI viewers are not very common, so you can consider using it for previewing your document while typesetting.
* '''PDF''' needs more disk space and it is slower to create, but it includes all the necessary fonts within the document, so you will not have any problem of portability. It supports internal and external hyperlinks. It also supports advanced typographic features: [[Wikipedia:Hanging punctuation|hanging punctuation]], font expansion and margin kerning resulting in more flexibility available to the TeX engine and better looking output. Nowadays it is the ''de facto'' standard for sharing and publishing documents, so you can consider using it for the final version of your document.

About now, you saw you can create both DVI and PDF document from the same source. This is true, but it gets a bit more complicated if you want to introduce images or links. This will be explained in detail in the next chapters, but for now assume you can compile in both DVI and PDF without any problem.

Note, in this instance, due to the simplicity of the file, you only need to run the LaTeX command once. However, if you begin to create complex documents, including bibliographies and cross-references, etc, LaTeX needs to be executed multiple times to resolve the references. But this will be discussed in the future when it comes up.

=== Autobuild Systems ===

Compiling using only the &lt;tt&gt;latex&lt;/tt&gt; binary can be quite tricky as soon as you start working on more complex documents as previously stated. A number of programs exist to automatically read in a TeX document and run the appropriate compilers the appropriate number of times. For example, &lt;tt&gt;latexmk&lt;/tt&gt; can generate a PDF from most TeX files simply: 
 $ latexmk -pdf file.tex
Note that most [[LaTeX/Installation#Editors|editors]] will take care of it for you.

=== Compressed PDF ===
For a PDF output, you may have noticed that the output PDF file is not always the same size depending on the engine you used to compile the file. So &lt;tt&gt;latex → dvips → ps2pdf&lt;/tt&gt; will usually be much smaller than &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt;.
If you want &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; features along with a small output file size, you can use the Ghostscript command:

 $ gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=&quot;Compressed.pdf&quot; &quot;Original.pdf&quot;

== Files ==
===Picking suitable filenames===

Never, ever use directories (folders) or file names that contain spaces. Although your operating system probably supports them, some don't, and they will only cause grief and tears with TeX. Make filenames as short or as long as you wish, but strictly avoid spaces. Stick to lower-case letters without accents (a-z), the digits 0-9, the hyphen (&amp;ndash;), and only one full point or period (.) to separate the file extension (somewhat similar to the conventions for a good Web URL): it will let you refer to TeX files over the Web more easily and make your files more portable. Some operating systems do not distinguish between upper-case and lower-case letters, others do. Therefore it's best not to mix them.

===Ancillary files===
The TeX compilers are single-pass processes. It means that there is no way for a compiler to ''jump'' around the document, which would be useful for the table of contents and references. Indeed the compiler cannot guess at which page a specific section is going to be printed, so when the table of contents is printed before the upcoming sections, it cannot set the page numbers.

To circumvent this issue, many LaTeX commands which need to ''jump'' use ancillary files which usually have the same file name as the current document but a different extension. It stores temporary data into these files and use them for the next compilation. So to have an up-to-date table of contents, you need to compile the document twice. There is no need to re-compile if no section moved.

For example, the temporary file for the table of contents data is &lt;tt&gt;filename.toc&lt;/tt&gt;.

None of these files contains unrecoverable information. It means you can delete them safely, compiling will regenerate them automatically.
{{Warning| The only important file types are &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.cls&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.sty&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.bib&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.bst&lt;/tt&gt; for BibTeX, these are not temporary and should not be deleted.}}

When you work with various capabilities of LaTeX (index, glossaries, bibliographies, etc.) you will soon find yourself in a maze of files with various extensions and probably no clue. The following list explains the most common file types you might encounter when working with TeX:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+Common file extensions in LaTeX
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.aux&lt;/tt&gt;
| A file that transports information from one compiler run to the next. Among other things, the &lt;tt&gt;.aux&lt;/tt&gt; file is used to store information associated with cross-references.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.bbl&lt;/tt&gt;
| Bibliography file output by BiBTeX and used by LaTeX
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.bib&lt;/tt&gt; 
| Bibliography database file. (where you can store a list of full bibliographic citations) 
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.blg&lt;/tt&gt;
| BiBTeX log file. (errors are logged here)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.bst&lt;/tt&gt;
| BiBTeX style file.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.cls&lt;/tt&gt;
| Class files define what your document looks like. They are selected with the &lt;code&gt;\documentclass&lt;/code&gt; command.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt;
| Documented TeX. This is the main distribution format for LaTeX style files. If you process a &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; file you get documented macro code of the LaTeX package contained in the &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; file.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.ins&lt;/tt&gt;
| The installer for the files contained in the matching &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; file. If you download a LaTeX package from the net, you will normally get a &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; and a &lt;tt&gt;.ins&lt;/tt&gt; file. Run LaTeX on the &lt;tt&gt;.ins&lt;/tt&gt; file to unpack the &lt;tt&gt;.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; file.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.fd&lt;/tt&gt;
| Font description file telling LaTeX about new fonts.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.dvi&lt;/tt&gt;
| Device Independent File. This is the main result of a LaTeX compile run with ''latex''. You can look at its content with a DVI previewer program or you can send it to a printer with dvips or a similar application.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.pdf&lt;/tt&gt;
| Portable Document Format. This is the main result of a LaTeX compile run with ''pdflatex''. You can look at its content or print it with any PDF viewer.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.log&lt;/tt&gt;
| Gives a detailed account of what happened during the last compiler run.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.toc&lt;/tt&gt;
| Stores all your section headers. It gets read in for the next compiler run and is used to produce the table of contents.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.lof&lt;/tt&gt;
| This is like &lt;tt&gt;.toc&lt;/tt&gt; but for the list of figures.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.lot&lt;/tt&gt;
| And again the same for the list of tables.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.idx&lt;/tt&gt;
| If your document contains an index. LaTeX stores all the words that go into the index in this file. Process this file with makeindex.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.ind&lt;/tt&gt;
| The processed .idx file, ready for inclusion into your document on the next compile cycle.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.ilg&lt;/tt&gt;
| Logfile telling what makeindex did.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.sty&lt;/tt&gt;
| LaTeX Macro package. This is a file you can load into your LaTeX document using the \usepackage command.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt;
| LaTeX or TeX input file. It can be compiled with latex.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;.out&lt;/tt&gt;
| hyperref package file, just one for the master file.
|-

;{{tlx|LaTeX/Example}}: Is used to show examples of LaTeX code together with rendering, like this: {{LaTeX/Example|code=\[ a^2+b^2=c^2 \]|render=&lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt;}}
;{{tlx|LaTeX/Usage}}: Is used to show usage of particular LaTeX command as if it was used in a &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file, like this: {{LaTeX/Usage|code=\usepackage{amsmath}&lt;!----&gt;}}

== This Wikibook Conventions (discussion) ==
I propose following conventions for writing LaTeX code:
;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: all in-line LaTeX commands, macros, environment names, parameters, etc.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:all LaTeX excerpts on lines of their own
; &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
: package names
To see how it looks go to the [[LaTeX/Formatting]] chapter.

The only downside of this convention that I noticed, is that if we write about parameters to LaTeX macros or environment names in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; they are not colored, just typeset in mono spaced font (using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; isn't much better).

I see three solutions:
* Using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;{parameter}&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to force coloring (enclose the parameter in braces) --- ugly
* Color using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000080&quot;&gt;TEXT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; --- very ugly in the syntax, nice result
* or use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; just for them --- doesn't distinguish them enough in text IMO

: Somehow I hadn't noticed this proposal before, been rather busy lately I guess.  I do not particualrly support it.  I liked the style only boxes around latex terminal/log output and I had been working toward restoring that after a software change. I also left a note on your talk page to this effect, one way or another we should work together. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:34, 23 June 2010 (UTC)
:: Unfortunately I noticed that it makes some of the examples hard to read. Case in point: &quot;Spaces&quot; example in &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; site [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=LaTeX/Absolute_Beginners&amp;oldid=1813108 before] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=LaTeX/Absolute_Beginners&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=1813108 after]. In my opinion, the LaTeX coloring differentiates them enough from terminal/log output and we don't really have much of raw terminal output in this book. [[User:Tomato86|Tomato86]] ([[User talk:Tomato86|talk]]) 22:05, 23 June 2010 (UTC)

:::I tend to disagree, I find too many boxes hurt the readability.  I feel the change of color ans font are enough to set apart LaTeX code, and part of using boxes just for things happening at the terminal works so well is because it doesn't need to come up often.  The real problem with the example in spaces is that there is no border separating input from output, unlike the examples in [[LaTeX/Formatting]].  A side point, not really relating to us, is that this is another example (of many) where HTML is being used to simulate LaTeX output, which I think is a problem.  

::: But, in the spirit of being welcoming, I will not stand in your way and may help out down the road.  At the moment I am trying to sort out the [[Algebra]] book and that may turn out to be a life long commitment with the terrible state that it is in.  Maybe someday when I am finished I will revisit this issue and think about it again, then be bold and do something.  In the mean time, have fun. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:08, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
:::: I tend to disagree that we shouldn't reach consensus, my sense of style is nearly non-existent :)

:::: While looking through the &quot;Formatting&quot; chapter (one that I already &quot;fixed&quot;), I've noticed that examples with rendering are set inside a table, with a black line separating the LaTeX code from the example. I think it would work quite well for illustrating examples, like such:
{|
|style=&quot;border-right:2px black solid;padding-right:3em;&quot;|
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
\newcommand{\oops}[1]{\textbf{#1}}

Do not \oops{enter} this room,
it’s occupied by \oops{machines}
of unknown origin and purpose.
&lt;/source&gt;
|style=&quot;padding-left:3em;&quot;|Do not '''enter''' this room, it’s occupied by '''machines''' of unknown origin and purpose.
|}
:::: Instead of:
{|
||
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\newcommand{\oops}[1]{\textbf{#1}}

Do not \oops{enter} this room,
it’s occupied by \oops{machines}
of unknown origin and purpose.
&lt;/source&gt;
||Do not '''enter''' this room, it’s occupied by '''machines''' of unknown origin and purpose.
|}
:::: Still, I think that examples without rendering blend too much with the normal text, maybe that's because I have a very Arial-ish monospaced font used by default. IMO they need an additional indentation or the box added by &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to set them apart.
:::: What I aim to, is to create more of a reference book than a tutorial per se, most readers will need only the basics to help them started -- that's where a tutorial writing style is needed -- but not all the content will be used by everyone, most people will use few, very specific, commands above the standard. Additional emphasis on the usage helps the reader find the commands he's looking for. [[User:Tomato86|Tomato86]] ([[User talk:Tomato86|talk]]) 10:10, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

::::: Well we are agreed on certain points I think.  I like your suggestions about inline latex and package names.  I am glad you like the black bar separating example and formatting, it was my idea.  As I was going through the book just before you I found this would be a problem and introduced it [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=LaTeX%2FTitle_Creation&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1800527&amp;oldid=1800325 here] and I had put the bars in Formatting but hadn't gotten a chance to go back and retroactively fix the earlier pages.  Leading to the example above in Absolute Basics. I suppose I could live with the around blocks of code that do not have output aligned next to them.  Maybe though we could place text that is occuring at the terminal in a different type of box, such as a {{tlx|TextBox}}? Thus adding to the visual difference between the two? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:37, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::: {{tlx|TextBox}} for console output and {{tlx|LaTeX/Example}} for examples with rendering? (yes, I just finished making it and went here to propose its usage :) All in all I think we should use templates for at least this, and additional two templates coloring package names (in blue, as it is in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and package parameters (in orange) in running text. This way any change of ideas about the look of formatting will be easy to do, possibly we could also use it for creating [[LaTeX/Index]]? I'm thinking about creating a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{LaTeX/LaTeX}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template to use instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; as it will make it easier and faster to write than the full &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. [[User:Tomato86|Tomato86]] ([[User talk:Tomato86|talk]]) 23:10, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::: OK, I think I've covered all the uses. Proposed rendering:

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #ffffff&quot;&gt;
Limits below and under:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=\begin{equation}
  \int\limits_a^b x^2
\end{equation}|render=&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_a^b x^2&lt;/math&gt;}}

To change default placement in all instances of summation-type symbol to the side add {{LaTeX/Parameter|nosumlimits}} option to {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package. This way you must include it like this:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=\usepackage[nosumlimits]{amsmath} }}
A similar tag, used to place limits on summation-like characters, is the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sideset}} command.
&lt;/div&gt;

:::::: And the code that produces it:

&lt;pre&gt;
Limits below and under:
{{LaTeX/Example|code=\begin{equation}
  \int\limits_a^b x^2
\end{equation}|render=&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_a^b x^2&lt;/math&gt;}}

To change default placement in all instances of summation-type symbol to the side add 
{{LaTeX/Parameter|nosumlimits}} option to {{LaTeX/Package|amsmath}} package. This way
you must include it like this:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=\usepackage[nosumlimits]{amsmath} }}

A similar tag, used to place limits on summation-like characters, is the
{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sideset}} command.
&lt;/pre&gt;

:::::: As you've probably noticed, I changed the way the usage of LaTeX code without examples is rendered. The {{tlx|LaTeX/Usage}} adds 3em padding on the left and 1.5em margin on the top and bottom to separate it from text. So, how about this? Maybe reduce the left padding in {{tlx|LaTeX/Usage}} and introduce it in {{tlx|LaTeX/Example}}? I've also created few additional templates: {{tlx|LaTeX/Environment}}, {{tlx|LaTeX/Package}}, {{tlx|LaTeX/Parameter}} and the already mentioned {{tlx|LaTeX/LaTeX}} [[User:Tomato86|Tomato86]] ([[User talk:Tomato86|talk]]) 11:35, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

==Creation==
Andy Roberts agreed to add [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/latextutorial1.html his tutorials].  I've uploaded these as HTML source, and changed the links on the front page to lead to them (not that I have anyhting against the previous modules, which I haven't deleted, and I hope can be incorporated.  Andy's are just a lot more polished and complete).  Hopefully, now people will reorganize and add to these, since we have a lot more to work with now.

Please, if you use any material that I have posted here from Andy's webpage, or think you might have, add the tag &lt;nowiki&gt;{{A-Roberts}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  This adds the message:

I see no help how to write [http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/ltx-91.html letters] and slides [http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/reference/slides/] [http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/prosper/]. Furthermore, there is not much about creating books with LaTeX. I haven't found any mention about the possibility to use another title of chapter in TOC and text (&lt;tt&gt;\section[Short]{Long title}&lt;/tt&gt;) or hide a chapter/section in the TOC (&lt;tt&gt;\section*{Hidden section}&lt;/tt&gt;). Perhaps we should introduce three separate chapters of this wikibook: Letters, Slides and Books with tips for every document class.

== Great news: including books! ==

Great news everyone: since we have already introduced a book within this wikibook, I have contacted the authors of other books about LaTeX asking them for the permission to include their work as well. Now we have the permission to include [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/beginlatex/beginlatex-3.6.pdf Beginner's guide] by Peter Flynn and [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf the not so short introduction to LaTeX] by Tobias Oetiker. I will add more details about licensing in the [[LaTeX/Links]] page, but if you want to improve this wikibook, you are allowed to copy and paste here as you wish. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 20:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Syntax highlighting ==

{{Warning|This syntax is no longer valid. Use the templates defined at the beginning of this page instead.}}

Hi, I've scanned through all the chapters, and standardized many of the code snippets that were previously declared either using:
#&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;\latexcode{}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; \latexcode{}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (1 space indent)
#&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;code&gt;\latexcode{}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;tt&gt;\latexcode{}&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;)
with a more formal (and new):
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\latexcode{}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Look in the chapters to see real examples. There are many advantages using this format, most notably is the highlighting of code to help users discern the elements of the code. Also, you can use direct source from your LaTeX projects, and not have to worry about converting &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc. (if you used &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;…&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt;…&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags). However, I've seen a few disadvantages of using the syntax highlighting, which are the associated bugs. So far, I've identified one minor one:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\section{Results}
There is a 40\% increase of production between $a$ and $b$.
&lt;/source&gt;
where the &lt;code&gt;\%&lt;/code&gt; is a valid escape, and not the beginning of a comment. I suppose if there are any other easily identifiable bugs, report them to the project page: [http://qbnz.com/highlighter/ GeSHi]. Considering that these bugs can be fixed in future releases of WikiMedia, using this syntax highlighting to existing LaTeX code in this Wikibook is a compatible upgrade.

== Reuse of LaTeX wikibook ==

JISC has published an [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/fundingopportunities/funding_calls/2007/10/reuseofcontent.aspx invitation to submit proposals] for the re-use of learning content.  I'm considering applying for this, and would like to use this WikiBook as one of the sources to be reused.

I intend to use [http://www.mathtran.org MathTran] and something like  [http://www.tlhiv.org/LaTeXpreviewer/ Troy Henderson's LaTeX previewer] to provide interactivity.

The best way to contact me about this is by email, to J.Fine at open.ac.uk.  Applications close on 30th November 2007, but for other reasons I have to complete my work on this application by 20th November.  So time is short.

== Capitalization ==

I would propose to capitalize the headings of the sections of this textbook in ''title case'', as opposed to ''sentence case''.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Case
! Appearance
|-
| title case
| The Title of the Section
|-
| sentence case
| The title of the section
|}
Currently, the capitalization of section headings in this book is inconsistent. The [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|Wikibooks naming convention]] requires the names of the ''chapters'' (not of sections) to be in title case. Interestingly enough, the policy itself uses sentence case in section headings. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:25, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

: A downside to this proposal is that the majority of section headings in the book now seem to be in sentence case. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:28, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

== Hey, we are quite popular ==

According to http://wikistics.falsikon.de/latest/wikibooks/en/, LaTeX textbook was 5th most popular wikibook in August. Yay! More than 800 hits per day for the table of contents is not so bad at all, and chapters like Floats, Tables, Mathematics and Formatting get 300-400 hits per day. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:36, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

== Structuring the book ==

At its inception, the book was structured and the names of the chapters chosen by the ''task'' or ''aim'' the user wants to achieve (like &quot;Creating Mathematical Graphics&quot;), and not what the technical ''means'' there is for doing it (like &quot;xyPic&quot;). I propose this approach is continued.

For the purpose of quickly finding the right place in the book by a keyword, such as &quot;xyPic&quot;, the right tool is ''index''; the purpose of ''table of contents'' is different.

Put differently, this is much more a ''user guide'' than a ''reference manual''.

--[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:10, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

:Everything has been done following this approach for the past years. The 'graphics' part is quite different however. It is not possible to tackle the matter in one chapter, encompassing TikZ, PSTricks, and so on. That's why I suggest this part should be the only one where packages have their dedicated chapter. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 13:13, 24 December 2012 (UTC)

== Packages ==

Adding the individual packages to the table of contents can easily clutter the structure of the book. I propose that packages are added with care, possibly only as sections of either the Packages chapter or Package Reference chapter.

Also, creating chapters for tasks, not for packages, is IMHO preferable.

Examples: 
* [[LaTeX/Mathematical Graphics]] includes the XY-pic package.
* [[LaTeX/Indexing]] includes the makeidx package.
* [[LaTeX/Presentations]] includes the beamer package.

Users coming to grips with LaTeX have the names of tasks in their minds already present (such as &quot;I want to create and ''Index'', and I see the idea under the letter ''I'', not under ''M'' of ''makeidx''.

--[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:05, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

: I have now added some packages to [[LaTeX/Index]], so please, before you start a chapter on a package (which is IMHO a poor idea anyway), check whether the package is already covered, by looking in the index. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 11:01, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

: Okay, creating a chapter on a package is not all that bad. Someone will need to edit it, and move it around, but the text will already be there. The point is: try to find out the task that the package should achieve, and create a chapter for that task, documenting the package in that chapter. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 14:28, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

== Glossary ==

The current Glossary chapter is not a [[wikt:glossary]] but an alphabetical index of LaTeX keywords. AFAIK, glossary defines terms used in the book, not keywords.

--[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:24, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

: Okay, so this actually is a glossary, provided it defines the commands, and what I have called &quot;keywords&quot; is usually called ''commands'' in the LaTeX context. I have moved the page to [[LaTeX/Command Glossary]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 11:47, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

== Order of chapters ==

I have moved &quot;Importing Graphics&quot; after &quot;Letters&quot;, so that it neighbors &quot;Creating Graphics&quot;. In any case, &quot;Importing Graphics&quot; was before &quot;Formatting&quot;, which is suprising, as &quot;Formatting&quot; should be IMHO one of the first, basic chapters. Also, &quot;Importing Graphics&quot; was also before &quot;Mathematics&quot;, another surprising fact, as LaTeX is AFAIK mostly used for mathematical typesetting, which does not always require graphics; and the mathematics support is built in, while the support for graphics comes through packages. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 18:40, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

:Yes, 'Importing Graphics' should not be before the stuff about formatting text and paragraphs. But I do not agree with you when stating that LaTeX is used primarily for math typesetting. Anyway, the book is now organized differently, with a 'Common Elements' part featuring 'Importing Graphics'. The math stuff is in a seperate part. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 13:13, 24 December 2012 (UTC)

== Multiple parts about: Creating packages ==
There are some multiple parts about 'creating packages'
See
* [[LaTeX/Customizing LaTeX#Creating your own package]]
* [[LaTeX/Advanced Topics#Creating your own package]]

And I think it should be under the section [[LaTeX/Packages]].

: One way of ensuring that the coverage of topics in the book is documented, which can minimize duplication of content, is to add the topic to the index, as I did for the topic of &quot;creating packages&quot; in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=LaTeX%2FIndex&amp;diff=1486152&amp;oldid=1464078 this edit]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 14:00, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

== Book Errors ==

&lt;code&gt;&lt; /code&gt;\input&lt; /code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

== Sectioning the book ==

Considering there is at least 3 dozen chapters, what about dividing the table of contents on main page into parts? For example, the first three chapters and the 'Errors and Warnings' may be chapters within Part 1 (perhaps called introduction too?), while structure, title creation, page layout, and fonts could be another part. --[[User:Sargas|Sargas]] ([[User talk:Sargas|talk]]) 18:40, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

: Just for the hell of it I made these changes, someone please comment on how it looks, revert if ya don't like. Looking at the tips and tricks and the advanced chapters I think those can be moved to the other pages, which is why they are in the category they are in.--[[User:Sargas|Sargas]] ([[User talk:Sargas|talk]]) 15:46, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

Looks like someone has since reverted the changes. I do think it was a good idea using sections: the list is getting quite long, and the current order is rather arbitrary and confusing (why is fonts at the bottom, and not near formatting?). My ideas for headings:
* Introduction and basics (first 5 of current list)
* Formatting and layout (formatting, page layout, fonts, colours, labels,  hyperlinks, etc.)
* Mathematics (currently two, but could probably be split better)

== Changing &quot;Algorithms and Pseudocode&quot; and adding Code ==

This chapter doesn't quite make sense. The &lt;tt&gt;listings&lt;/tt&gt; package described works for code, not pseudo-code, so it is out of place. I think it is more useful then the algorithm typesetting packages listed, so perhaps we can combine listings (with the information in [[LaTeX/Packages/Listings]] with a section on the &lt;tt&gt;verbatim&lt;/tt&gt; package. Anyone know any other techniques for programming languages? --[[User:Sargas|Sargas]] ([[User talk:Sargas|talk]]) 06:06, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

Another package for pseudocode is &lt;tt&gt;clrscode&lt;/tt&gt;. I would like to see it described but (1) there are already lots of alternative and (2) I don't have time myself to do a good job now :( [[Special:Contributions/193.1.132.191|193.1.132.191]] ([[User talk:193.1.132.191|talk]]) 17:33, 21 October 2009 (UTC)

== Algorithms bundle ==

Hi. I am the maintainer of the &lt;tt&gt;algorithms&lt;/tt&gt; bundle (i.e., &lt;tt&gt;algorithm.sty&lt;/tt&gt; + &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic.sty&lt;/tt&gt;). I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that my package is being featured in the LaTeX wikibook. If anybody desires, I can edit the document to highlight things that I have implemented and some ways to use the package.

== Source .tex file for LaTeX PDF file ==
I believe that .tex sources for this wikibook would be really helpful. On the one hand, they would be excellent materials for self-learning and teaching LaTeX. On the other hand, it would facilitate a lot to transform PDF to different needings such as produce a DinA5 size PDF and printed book

== Consider covering algorithmicx ==
Hi, great book (I use it a lot)...  Anyway, just wanted to recommend that you briefly cover the [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/ algorithmicx] package. The algorithmic package is great, but doesn't allow you to write recursive algorithms, it has no &lt;code&gt;\Function&lt;/code&gt; command. If you don't think usage of algorithmicx should be the first recommendation, I would suggest that readers are encouraged to look at it, should they need something more than what algorithmic offers. If you think this is a good idea, I wouldn't mind writing a few lines about it, just email me jopsen at gmail dot com

I created a collection and turned it into a pdf, which I think should be the easy way to get it. I would like to know if there are objections to me uploading it as the updated pdf version which, even though it is far from the way it should look like, It is up to date and is easier to mantain.

The PDF version is quite outdated. It was created in July, 2012. Since then a lot of changes have been made in the online version. An updated pdf should be created. (Today is 8 Feb 2013)

== Book general organization and duplicates ==

I noticed several duplicates and arguable organization in the book:

* ''Absolute Beginners'' and ''Basic'' could be merged (their titles does not show much difference). ==&gt; DONE.
* Move ''Document Structure'' to Formatting (should be first IMO). ==&gt; DONE.
* Move ''Useful Measurement Macros'' at the beginning of ''Formatting''  (I can't see what is ''Advanced'' in it). ==&gt; DONE.

* Remove ''Useful Size Commands'' since it is in ''Formatting/Formatting#Text Formatting''. ==&gt; DONE, page should be removed.

* Split the much-too-long formatting section into several sections.
** Text formatting
** Paragraph formatting (along with Special Paragraph)
** Footnotes (along with margin notes)
==&gt; DONE.
* Rename the section having the same name than their parent chapter (e.g. ''Formatting'' and ''Advanced Topics''). ==&gt; DONE.
* Merge ''Basics#Big Project'' and ''Multiple files'' to ''General guidelines'', keep link in Basics. I don't think the title ''General guidelines'' speaks for itself.Something like ''Project guildelines'' perhaps. ==&gt; DONE.
* The beginning of ''Packages'' could be merged with ''Basics#Packages''. The end eventually tends to serve as a package reference, so why not merging this part with the ''Package Reference'' section? The documentation for every package could be found from there. But obviously it should not be displayed in the TOC. Besides, the other part of the current ''Package'' page shoud be renamed to ''Creating your own packages'' or sth like that. ==&gt; DONE.
* I think that ''Advanced Topics'' should be split into the following section for the sake of clarity (even if those sections are short)
** Counters
** Boxes
** Rules and struts
The ''Boxes'' and ''Rules'' would take better place in the ''Formatting'' chapter. ==&gt; DONE.
Besides, ''List Structure'' makes use of counters, so it should link to the new ''Counters'' section.
==&gt; DONE.
* Merge 'Installation' and the same section from the introduction. Introduction could link to the page in the Appendice. ==&gt; DONE.
* Move 'Labels and Cross-referencing' to the Formatting part. ==&gt; DONE.

* Move ''Tips_and_Tricks#Graphics_and_Graph_editors'' to ''Formatting#Importing Graphics and PDF files''.
* Move ''Bibliography Management'' to Special Pages merged with ''More Bibliographies'' (it does not really belong to the ''Getting Started'' part). ==&gt; Moved, but need to merge the two pages.
* Move Creating Graphics to a new chapter, and create section for the different solutions. In fact, graphics in LaTeX is a huge topic, if not as huge as LaTeX itself. ==&gt; DONE.
**Besides, move the ''Linguistics#tikz-qtree'' to a ''TikZ'' dedicated section, and add a link to it on the ''Linguistics'' page.

If you see any arguable suggestion or have better ones, feel free to share them.
I will commit the changes in a few days.

Back to business! It has been a long time, sorry for the delay. I did a major overhaul of the overall book structure. Hopefully it will be more clear and consistent.

== Can we discuss my copyright?  ==

Dear editors,

Andy Roberts here - writer of Getting to Grips with LaTeX...

There's no doubt about it, the LaTeX wikibook is excellent. I am honoured to have been part of the project from the very early stages as my content was possible the first batch to be included. And as you'd expect permission was granted.

I don't want to be a PITA about this but the original permission was granted on the understanding that there was a clear acknowledgement of my work (it used to be at the bottom of a page where my content was included). Although the book has deviated significantly from the structure of my tutorials, I can look at a random sample of pages and find my writing all over the place, and in some places it's very similar to my original text.

So similar in fact that I get two types of email: 1. Wikibooks has plagiarised your tutorials. 2) You've plagiarised Wikibooks.

Neither are satisfactory and I did begin wondering why such messages were getting more frequent, and that's because some time ago the acknowledgement that a page contained my material was taken away. It is no longer straight-forward to deduce the source of the content. Ok, it's possible to browse to the authors page and see my name acknowledged, fair enough. But I'm not convinced people are likely to take the trouble. It's not like a paper book where it's almost impossible to miss the names of the contributors before beginning flicking through the pages. The likelihood being that users land on a page via a search engine, and if they do navigate back to the TOC it's to view other sections and not to discover more about the writers.

I'm not expecting special treatment but I do feel the spirit of the original understanding is no longer being adhered to. I'd rather have the acknowledgement reintroduced at the bottom of each page containing my content. Or perhaps there's an alternative you can think of? Because the final option is to assert control of my copyright and remove my content from the book. Obviously my contribution now looks pretty small and I dare say it wouldn't be missed.

I am anxious to not come across as a complete jackass about this but I want manage my copyright fairly.

:I'm probably not the right one to speak about it since I was not involved in the Wikibook when it first started. There is still a lot of ''A-Roberts'' template here and there. Regarding the ones you would be expecting and that are missing, I guess this kind of agreement is hard to maintain on a Wiki system. The content gets heavily modified all the time, pages are split and merged, many contributors are anonymous and casual users who are not necessarily aware of the agreement, etc. As time goes by, it gets very hard to keep track of specific parts in this chaos. That's how wikis work. Perhaps I'm getting wrong here, but I fear that this kind of agreement is not possible at all in the long run. What are the other users thinking about it?

::I do understand the mechanics but that's not my problem to handle. As you can see at the top of this page there is a Wikibooks Convention section that does outline the policy to adopt regarding my content. I'd have thought regulars at least would consult that and be on top of whether minor edits done by infrequent contributors adhere. Anyway, I think there's little appetite to do anything about it which I also understand - you'd be better off not being encumbered with my content. I presume editors won't be upset if over the next few weeks I remove all content that is identifiably mine. --[[User:Arooaroo|Arooaroo]] ([[User talk:Arooaroo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Arooaroo|contribs]]) 17:26, 28 January 2013 (UTC)

== Book title typesetting? ==

A few days ago, I changed the typesetting of the title from &quot;LaTeX&quot; to &quot;{{LaTeX}}&quot;. However, I'm not so sure that is a good idea anymore, due to [[w:Wikipedia:Article titles#Standard English and trademarks|Wikipedia's manual of style for article titles containing trademarks]]. Yes, that is Wikipedia, but I wasn't sure how to find the corresponding manual of style for Wikibooks.

On the other hand, maybe it is different for book titles, which is what this is about. So, anyone knows how the title for this book should be typeset? —[[User:Kri|Kri]] ([[User talk:Kri|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kri|contribs]]) 08:59, 15 June 2012 (UTC)

== All article navigation boxes have to be updated ==

As it seems, no one has been looking after the navigation boxes in the article footers for a long while – all of them seem to be pointing to the wrong pages, or someone has recently been rearranging the table of contents and forgot to update the navigation boxes. Anyone knows what happened?

I corrected all navigation boxes up to the page [[LaTeX/Useful Measurement Macros]]; then I got tired. The rest of the navigation boxes on the other pages also have to be fixed in order to make them point at the right pages. —[[User:Kri|Kri]] ([[User talk:Kri|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kri|contribs]]) 12:53, 27 June 2012 (UTC)

But you can see it in action on the [[Conlang]] book.  It generates the TOC and top-and-bottom nav boxes, and could in principle generate different styles of any of those, a side nav box, presumably also a &quot;Print version&quot; page transcluding all the pages in order with suitable section headings.  All from a single master file specifying the book outline.  The price is, that master file is a somewhat peculiar-looking template (I meant, and still mean, to rearrange the package so that template would be in template space, because really that's where it belongs).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:36, 19 December 2012 (UTC)

== Major change in organization==


I recently reorganized the complete book:
* I removed many duplicates (still a lot wandering around I guess).
* I've put chapters in their appropriate part
* Chapters now follow a more ''natural'' progression. For example, Installation regroups the 2 and a half chapters that where all around the book before, and is placed at the beginning, 2nd chapter.

I've added a brief description of the organization logic on the main page.
I hope the overview of the organization is much more straightforward now.

I hope the new organization will reduce the number of duplicates due to newcomers lost among the confuse titles and the lack of natural order.

Feel free to contribute. Any suggestion is welcome. And if you find duplicates or inappropriate locations, tell us!

== Renaming Formatting part + Modular Documents==

Following my previous message, this is about the new organization.
There is still one big mistake in my opinion: the Formatting part. Well, actually, most chapters are not really about formatting. I'd even say there is only 2 formatting chapters, the Text and the Paragraph ones.

I dare say this is an insult to LaTeX to talk about formatting for a whole part: LaTeX actually ''does'' the formatting for the user, it is the whole purpose of the LaTeX macros, so why should we speak so much about it?

Formatting is definitely a bad title, but I cannot think of a correct one.

Suggestions:
* Common documents
* Elements
* Common elements
* Writing documents

[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 17:29, 21 December 2012 (UTC)

== End of contribution wave ==

For those who have been checking the book recently, you may have noticed constant changes. Don't worry, that is going to stop right now. I've been fixing, rewriting, sorting, completing the content of the book for the past 3 weeks. I've removed/merged a lot of duplicates and added cross-references here and there. Finally I've tried to replace as much 'tt', 'code' and 'source' tags as possible, using the LaTeX templates instead. I've been focusing on the following parts:
* Getting Started
* Common Elements
* Mechanics
* Programming
* Help and Recommendations/FAQ
You can check a more detailed list of changes on my user page.
Hope you'll appreciate it!

I guess this ungrateful work was made largely easier thanks to Emacs. But I've had enough for now, I'll leave it there.

::Thanks for the support. Regarding the PDF version, it is fairly outdated and does not contain any of the 2012-2013 changes (so this has nothing to do with my work). I surely agree the PDF should be updated (and I do not like the font either). Sadly, this is not that simple since there is no trivial way to convert Mediawiki syntax to LaTeX. This has always lacked to this book in my opinion. For the past few years, this wikibook was using Dirk's all-in-one conversion system (see above), which is an almost complete TeX distribution with some scripts. This system is not very flexible and it takes time to generate a new version of the book, that's partly why it gets updated so rarely. I'm currently working on another system that would hopefully ease the process. I'm doing some shell scripting, AWK and using pandoc for wiki-&gt;LaTeX conversion, so it should basically run on any Unix system. I'll keep you up to date. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 18:09, 31 January 2013 (UTC)

== New PDF Book ==

I uploaded a new version of the book. I used todays wiki data as source. I used the latin modern roman font, which is the vector version of computer modern roman. The Latex source code of the book is attached to the pdf file. So if you want an other font, other paper format or stuff like that you can just recompile it and upload yourself. I do check the dicussion pages of the pdfs / books I did regularly and try to fix any issues reported there.--[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 15:31, 11 March 2013 (UTC)


::Thanks for the new update! I've skimmed through it and that's quite an impressive work ! However I've found some mistakes. Here is my bug report:
* First the chapter order does not follow the new one. There is only 6 parts in your book, againt 11 on the Wiki page. The book has been heavily reorganized to feel more natural and progressive. It was an attempt to be more KISS, not having two separate installation or bibliography chapters, etc. If you want to suggest another chapter organization, we can discuss it on this page.
''I will fix this tomorrow. I currently use this [[User:Dirk Hünniger/latex]] but I can regenerate this page from the toc in the wiki.''
* The links could be in color (dark red or dark blue for instance), since it's not obvious that you can follow hyperlinks otherwise. Debatable request though.
''I try to avoid color since that has got advantages in printing.''
* The ''Advanced Topics'' chapter does not exist anymore, and appears empty in the book.
''This will hopefully go away with the new TOC''
* Several chapters seem to be missing, among them the PlainTeX chapter and the FAQ. These two chapters are essential in my opinion.
''This will hopefully go away with the new TOC''
* Chapter ''Links'': the first line '''w:TeX1 w:LaTeX2''' is strange...
''I can put them in a noinclude''
* Some ''References'' sections do not display links correctly.
''I think this is because their targets don't exist. Example [[LaTeX/Creating Graphics#XY-pic|&lt;tt&gt;xy&lt;/tt&gt; package]]. First its a redirect, and I don't consider any redirects second the section XY-pic does not exists on that page. So this is your job you need to make all links point to existing places without any redirects. ''
* You should not include the inter-language links. I could find a few of them. [[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 17:00, 11 March 2013 (UTC)

I made a new version based on the new toc. So most issues should be resolved now. You will still have to edit some details in the wiki source.

I uploaded a new version. I am happy with it now.  The only remaining issues are that still a few references are pointing to the web instead of the pdf although I correct a lot. Further more there are some links that you want removed. You can simply put them in noincludes. Send me an Email, an I will make a new version after you did your corrections to the wiki code. But for now I think its ok. --[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 10:42, 12 March 2013 (UTC)

:Again, nice work, and thanks for this precious contribution!
* Some TOC problems:
** Glossaries and Bibliographies are swallowed by Index.
** References and External Links from Linguistics appear as separate chapters.
** Index and Command glossary: you should remove the TOC entries (and the PDF bookmarks) as I believe it's rather useless and it make the TOC look bloated.
* Figures
** Many pictures display in the wrong size, see Tables and Math for instance. (I know how it's hard to get working.) 
* Colors: well, PDF has the nice ability to behave differently on-screen and when printed. hyperref can use this ability to print links in black and to display then in color. I'm not sure if it works everywhere though (every PDF viewer, every printer), but it's worth trying.

I will fix the two first TOC issues soon. The third toc issues seems technically to complicated and not that much of a problem. The size of the figure can by change with 400px in the wiki text for full text width and 200px for half the page width and fractions thereof of course. You can do these edits if this is important to you. I am also afraid that the trick about colors you proposed won't work everywhere, so I will just leave it the way it is for now.--[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 07:29, 13 March 2013 (UTC)

I have tried downloading the PDF version ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/LaTeX.pdf ) but everytime the download never finishes as if something was corrupted. At first I thought it was just the bad internet connection I was using at uni, but after trying again from other places it seems to fail here as well.

: I've had what sounds like the same problem downloading large audio or video files from commons.  My problem has evidently nothing to do with the content of the file, just its size.  My solution, inconvenient but, fortunately, possible for me:  switch platforms, from the one I use most of the time &amp;mdash; a laptop running Windows&amp;nbsp;7 &amp;mdash; to an Ubuntu desktop.

==Wiki LaTeX converter==

A few months ago I mentionned a new wiki-&gt;latex system. I've been working on it for a while and I achieved a decent result, until I hit a major hindrance: templates. Pandoc does not handle them. So I thought I could do a naive implementation in AWK, but that was actually hopeless since templates can be used anywhere and can even be nested. So it needs a real grammar and that's too much for AWK I guess. Meanwhile I was busy with other projects, so I have no finished solution yet. If I have time I'll write a real parser and finish my work. [[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 17:19, 11 March 2013 (UTC)

I wrote a real parser in Haskell with parsec it is part of my project it can handle templates. Of course the source it is a available. Pandoc is also written in Haskell and uses parsec. I do not recommend you to learn haskell and write your own parse since you can use mine and it was an extreme amount of work to learn all these technologie and write a parser. --[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 17:35, 11 March 2013 (UTC)

:I completely agree, however there is no solution that seems completely satsifactory to me. Besides I believe you wrote your haskell parser after javalatex, so I guess you didn't like it either in the first place! ;) Your solution is great and I (together with a lot of contributors too I guess) would like to contribute. But there a huge problem in your project (which I should have mentionned earlier I confess): the packaging. Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems like there is no source code versioning at all, only this huge archive with an almost complete TeX distribution. Can you explain why you are embedding the distribution, and not leaving it as an external dependency? It would be light and simple. -- [[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 13:51, 12 March 2013 (UTC)

The source code is managed by svn as you can see on the sourceforge page. I made an .deb file including the dependencies. See http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf/ubuntu. Its an old version and I currently only update the windows version. It is still possible although not trvial to build the current revsion on Linux. See http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf/ubuntu_microtype. And I am currently using it this way. The major problem is that I need a special font, which is a merge of several GPLed fonts, which legal but will not be accetepted by debian since it is not beautiful enough. I included the full latex distribution because it is awfully hard to install that special font. I need this font since I need to cover full unicode and there is no font covering the full range, so I can just merge existsting fonts.--[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 15:02, 12 March 2013 (UTC)

:My mistake for the source code, I guess I got fooled by the new SourceForge layout (not pretty new actually; but I haven't been there for a long time). Still, I do not understand the need to package everything together. I believe you can make a simple shell script (or python script, but I'm not sure that's the best idea) to automate everything. Can you explain why it is necessary to have a ''megafont''? I mean it's fine to tell LaTeX to use several fonts, or use special environment for CJK and so on. I may be wrong, but if you have a look at the UTF-8 definition, the coverend Unicode range is far from complete. Besides, I think you do not need to edit the files in the root tree (/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf) you can do a per-user modification so that you do not need root rights, and leave everything clean (see TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFHOME). I'll see what if I can install your parser in a more portable manner in the next few days. [[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 11:18, 14 March 2013 (UTC)

I always ran into probelms when switching fonts in the middle of a document with pdflatex. lualatex was ruled out because it takes a large amout of computing resources when dealing with huge fonts and xelatex does not allow for the microtype package and was ruled out because of this. I will happyly accept any solution that works without the megafont. But for now it is the only working solution I found. I often received comments asking for smaller download without the full compiler if you want to work on this point you are happily inviter to do so, just make a sourceforge account for you and send me an Email, I will give you access to svn. --[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 11:52, 14 March 2013 (UTC)

And about javalatex. I used the same ideas in the eary stages of my project. Now I could proof that the grammer is not context free. That means BNF are to weak to describe the grammer and in particular this means that regexes are to weak. See proof http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf/parser .--[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 15:21, 12 March 2013 (UTC)

==What country did they live in?==
Japan, which they call '日本’ (Nihon), which means &quot;source of the sun&quot;, since the sun rises in the east and Japan is east of Asia; this is why Japan is sometimes called &quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;. The word &quot;Japan&quot; comes from a western mistranslation of the Mandarin word &quot;Ze-pan,&quot; which was how the symbols of the name (which were originally Chinese symbols) were pronounced by the Chinese during the Middle Ages.

Japan is an archipelago, or a group of islands, east of China and Korea. It is made up of many different islands, but the four main islands are Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku and Hokkaido. Japan is a country with a lot of mountains, and because there is so little space in the centre of the islands to build, most Japanese cities and towns are built close to the sea. The nearby Ryukyu Islands - and the biggest of the islands, Okinawa - were a group of islands near to Japan, but they were taken over by the Japanese in the 1800s, and are now considered by some to be part of Japan.

==What did their buildings look like?==
The earliest Japanese people lived in wooden buildings elevated above the ground. The Japanese quickly adopted Chinese style architecture, with curved roofs to resemble the wings of a bird and multiple tiers of roofs, and set about building larger and more impressive buildings similar to the Chinese. Japanese buildings often featured sliding doors and thin walls, and later the Japanese built large castles with many small gardens and towers.

==What did they eat?==
The main foods in Japan were mostly rice, since it was easy to plant lots of rice in flooded fields, and fish, because most of Japan's cities and towns have to be built close to the shore, since further in land, the mountains make building difficult. The Japanese also ate other types of vegetables, such as algae or soy beans, and they could grow buckwheat to make noodles. The Japanese used chopsticks to eat most of their foods. Tea was, and still is, a very popular drink in Japan, and the steps of making, serving and drinking tea were parts of a very important and celebrated ritual to the Japanese. 

==What did they wear?==

* Kimono - meaning clothing or things to wear, is the basic Japanese clothing
* Yukata - the summer kimono
* Nagajugan - undergarments
* Clothing Accessories - obi, shoes, socks. Obi: a shash to hold together a kimono.
* Haori - short silk jackets
* Michiyuki - Overcoats
* Hakama - Japanese pants
* Uchikake - most formal kimono
* Shiro-maku - wedding kimono

Customarily, woven patterns, dyed clothing and repetitive patterns are considered informal Japanese clothing. Examples of traditional informal Japanese clothing are; cotton yukata, woven cotton haori and dyed ikat kimono. These types of Japanese clothes would be used as daily wear, for traveling to and from bath houses or for informal friend and family visits.  

Formal Japanese clothing normally takes on either of two characteristics; very elaborate designs or a simple elegant designs. A few examples of elaborate designed Japanese clothes worn for an event are uchikake wedding kimono and festive happi coats. The more elegant designs, subdued colors or solid pattern formal Japanese clothes would be worn for paying formal visits, funerals or by married women for weddings or formal functions.    

The Japanese wore clogs for shoes, they are called getas. Japanese women did not wear jewelry. But wore lipstick made of crushed flower petals and white rice powder on their faces. Both men and women slept with their heads on padded wooden headrests to protect their hair styles, which took a long time to create. They often wore hair combs and sticks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Japan|author=Andrew Haslam and Clare Doran|page=10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What did their writing look like?==

The Japanese handwriting works the same way as cuneiform and hieroglyphics. A type of writing the Japanese do is Haiku. Haiku is a type of poetry that's purpose is to be simple. Books were printed from wooden writing blocks. It didn’t cost much to print books. The finest piece of Japanese literature was called the Tale of Genii Witch was written in 1010 by a lady named Murasaki Sikibu. It was the first novel written in the Japanese language. Most of the Japanese words are shaped like what they mean. The art of Japanese handwriting was popular during the time period of Heeians. The Japanese also used fancy paint brushes to write their words. Japanese isn’t just a language its a form of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Look What came from Japan|author=Miles Harvey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nihonshoki_jindai_kan_pages.jpg|left|thumb|207px|Two pages from the &quot;Reigns of the Gods&quot; chapters of the Chronicles of Japan.]]
Before the fifth century, aristocrats and samurai and men used Chinese characters to transcribe the sounds of the Japanese language, called &quot;manyogana.&quot; Writing forms similar to Chinese writing is still used today, even though the modern kanji is more developed than what they used a long time ago. The simpler words in the old version resemble symbols of real-life items. In the fifth century, the simpler hiragana was developed from the shosho form of Chinese calligraphy and became much more widely used, becoming mixed with Chinese characters, or kanji. In the seventh century, an even more simplified form of writing, katakana, was created by Buddhist monks as a shorthand. Each katakana represented a Chinese character and the sound the Chinese character represented in manyogana. Japanese language became a mix of kanji, hiragana, and katakana, with katakana being used more to transcribe sounds and foreign words.

==What did they believe?==
The native religion of Japanese is Shinto, which means &quot;the way of the Gods &quot;. Shinto has existed in Japan since prehistoric times. Shinto involves the worship of gods, or &quot;kami&quot; that are related to nature or other spiritual presences. The sun, water, mountains, trees and stones play an important part in Shinto worship. Shinto mythology said that Japan's emperors were direct descendants of the supreme Kami, the sun goddess. 

In Shinto rituals and ceremonies, offerings are made to the Kami, along with prayers. To celebrate special occasions, festivals called matsuri are held in order to honor a particular god. 

Around A.D. 552, Buddhism was brought into Japan from Korean and China. During this period, Japan was highly influenced by Chinese ideas. Buddhism involves the belief that people can achieve peace and be free from suffering by letting go of attachments to material things.

Prior to the government mandated separation of the Shintoism and Buddhism in 1868 (Shinbutsu buri, &quot;Separation of Kami and Buddhas), Shintoism and Buddhism coexisted in many temples and shrines with artifacts of both religions present in the same temple or shrine and shrine priests would teach Buddhist doctrines. Even today, though the two religions are to be separate, many Japanese will visit both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples when appropriate.

== What is Left of Them Today? ==

Archaeologically, the famous burial mounds of the Yamato civilization are dotted all around Southern and Western Japan. This civilization existed around 1700 years ago, and ruled much of Southern Japan. They were once a band of tribes fighting amongst themselves, but they got together and conquered other civilizations at the time, such as the Izumo.

Today, Japan is a thriving nation. They make some of the things that we use everyday. Like cars, video games, electronics, table lamps, flower pots, and many other things. They have also created many cartoons that we watch, including Pokémon, Digimon and Card Captor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Despite its being one of the four greatest ancient civilizations, the Chinese civilization had a slower progress than any other. The Chinese civilization has made countless contributions to the world, including the invention of compass, paper, gunpowder, silk, noodle, porcelain, and paper money and other things that are a part of our lives today. There were also many great works of architecture, such as, the Great Wall.

The Chinese is the only of the four greatest ancient civilizations that managed to survive throughout the five thousand years of its history and one of a few ancient civilizations that have lasted into modern times. The Chinese civilizations is normally divided in four characteristic periods (Pre-history and Shang, Han Empire, Qing [Manchu] Empire 1644- 1912 and Modern age). Due to their extensive record keeping little mystery is left to us, much unlike the Egyptians and Babylonians. The present-day China is the continuation of that evolution. The influence of Chinese civilization also spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.

[[Image:ChinaGeography.png|right|thumb|300px]]
The geography of ancient China is often described by geologists in a system of three steps: 
The first step is to the far west near present day [[w:Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR)]] (Tibet or Xizang for short). With the highest mountains on earth the climate is quite cold and in the summer quite warm. This area is widely considered inhospitable, from -40℃ (-40°F) in the winter to 37℃ (100°F) in the summer. Because of these extremes, there aren’t many villages and the villages that are there are quite small.

The next step is the middle of China. It’s covered with desert and a small amount of grassland. People there raise yaks, a type of grazing cattle. There are some low hills but no snow. With cold winters and hot summers this area was never densely populated.

Eastern China supported most of China's ancient population. Three rivers flow through this area: the Huang He in the north, the Chang Jiang (Yangzi Jiang) in the center, and the Sikiang in the south. The Huang He is the main river and is more commonly known in the Western World as the Yellow River. This is because the water and the soil around this river is yellow. There was plenty of water for crops and agriculture flourished. Wheat was the main crop in the north, and rice was more common in the southwest.

==What do their buildings look like?==
[[Image:XiAn_CityWall_DiLou.jpg|thumb|left|300px|City wall of Xi'an is the best preserved city wall in China.]]
Most ancient Chinese buildings have not survived because they were made of wood. A small number of buildings were made of stone. However, the forbidden palace, which is still located in China, Beijing, has survived, and many tourists visit it every day. The Temple of Heavens, or Tian Tan, is also a famous tourist attraction.
Chinese architecture has curved roofs to resemble the wings of a bird. Roof colors also hold significance; blue was usually reserved for religious buildings, orange/yellow was reserved for imperial buildings, etc.

==What do they eat?==
Northern Chinese people eat wheat; southern Chinese people eat rice; and they both eat with chopsticks. Many of them eat noodles, which are long, thin pieces of dough that they boil in hot water. A main meat was pork, each family would keep a live pig if they could afford it. They would feed it table scraps, and pigs were also popular as a pet as well as dogs. They also grew fruits like lemons, oranges, peaches, apricots and ginger

==What do they wear?==
In ancient China, the wealthy wore silk, while commoners wore cotton. The color yellow/gold could only be worn by the emperor and other royalty. A dragon was sometimes sewn on the Emperor's clothes, and gold was often woven into clothing. The color red indicates celebrity or happiness and is usually worn on holidays. They also sometimes wore jade depending on what they were doing, since jade was highly valued
{{clear}}

They wore a style of clothing known as the Hanfu, which was robes tied together with a sash or belt. Hanfus vary
from simple versions worn by commoners to scholarly versions worn by court officials to elaborate versions worn by the rich.

The Hanfu very much resembles and is the predecessor of the Japanese yukata/kimono, the Korean hanbok, and the Vietnamese Áo tứ thân.

In the 17th century, Manchurian nomads invaded the Ming Dynasty, and created the Qing Dynasty. They ordered everyone to wear Manchurian clothing, which is now known as the Cheongsam; Changshan (male) and the Qipao (female). This type of clothing is what most westerners picture when they think of Chinese clothing.

==What does their writing look like?==
[[Image:Replica of oracle turtle shell with ancient Chinese oracle scripts.jpg|thumb|left|Replica of ancient Chinese script on an oracle turtle shell]]
[[Image:Hanzi.png|thumb|Simplified Chinese (left) alongside traditional Chinese (right)]]
The ancient form of writing evolved into the character system that is still in use today. Traditional Chinese script includes cursive, semi-cursive, wild cursive, clerical, seal, etc. Today, mainland PR-China uses simplified Chinese script, introduced to improve literacy rate, but criticized by historians.

[[w:Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[w:Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and [[w:Macao|Macao]] continue to use traditional script.

==What do they believe in?==
During the Bronze Age most of China worshiped many gods and spirits. The most important of these being Ti or “Deity Above&quot;. He was believed to help those that pleased him and punish those that didn’t. Ti was in charge of all the gods and goddesses in the pantheon. The gods and goddesses all represented something in nature, e.g. the “God of Soil&quot;. Some of the emperors brought their servants with them to the after life. Priests and Priestess’s main job was to act as mediums between the gods and goddesses and the worshipers they specialized in sacrificing and ceremonies of specific gods and goddesses. A special type of medium was an Augur. An Augur asked questions of the gods and goddesses or read oracle bones.

After the Bronze Age, Three Doctrines or Ideologies became important Chinese Religions. The Three ideologies can also be viewed as philosophies but they also have a spiritual element, which is why they are classified as religions. Daoism and Confucianism were native to China and developed in isolation. The Third Doctrine, Buddhism was brought from China by traveling monks from India.

Confucius was alive during when the Chou dynasty (a part of the Zhou Dynasty) was decaying it was riddled with corruption. Confucius experienced the corruption firsthand as he held a position in government. He believed that decline was because the Chinese had abandoned old traditions and old concepts of honor, politeness morality and social roles had been forgotten; this is the base of Confucianism.

Confucianism filtered into different aspect of Chinese culture. Confucius’ teachings became the basis for education in China and his writings became the classics that every child in China reads.

The basis of Daoism is the concept of Dao. Dao is translated as “the path” or “the way.”  The term has no conclusive definition it refers to a wide force in nature and is the source of all things.

Daoism in its purest form calls followers to pursue Dao. This means he or she should not try to alter nature or force it to do what it was not meant to do. A follower must remain inactive and not make plans. A follower must not do anything contrary to Dao for example building a house or damming a river. Daoists were members of the educated wealthy elite. Some of the less privileged did learn about it but altered it to be more about magic and alchemy than the purest form of Daoism.

Siddharta Gautama founded Buddhism around 500 BC; He was later called The Enlightened One or the Buddha. Buddhism spread to China via the Silk Road. When it first arrived it was considered part of Daoism because of how similar Daoism and Buddhism are. How ever a number of Buddhist monks came from India to China and kept the religion from being incorporated into Daoism. Buddhism encourages followers to throw off self-interest. Through meditation and right living, a Buddhist can reach Nirvana or absence of suffering which was a similar concept to Dao.

All three religions were not intolerant of each other although they did not always agree. Many people were subscribers of more than one religion and all three subtly influenced each other.

==What is their history?==
The first step of the Chinese civilization was started by the rule of the Shang dynasty (kings), who ruled a group of towns and cities. They ruled from 1766 - 1027 BC. They were mostly located in the North West of the present-day China, and the rest of the land was run by other tribes who the Shang could not reach. In 1027 BC, the Shang king was replaced by the Zhou Dynasty, and these people ruled for 400 years. They extended the kingdom southwards and towards central China. In 772 BC, barbarians destroyed the capital Hao and a new capital was built at Luoyang. But the Chou were never as powerful again and from 772 - 481 BC the land was split into many small kingdoms run by chiefs. Around 500 BC the hundreds of tiny kingdoms had turned into around 20 states. Peace was proposed to end the wars in the area, but war returned in 481 BC. This lasted until 221 BC in a period known as &quot;The Warring States&quot;. After this time, there were seven big kingdoms. Starting in 230 BC, one of them, the Qin kingdom defeated everyone and Prince Cheng named himself Shi Huangdi, the First Emperor of China. The name Qin was also given to the land, and it still remains today as China.

==Are some of them famous?==
Confucius (known in Chinese as Kongzi) is widely known as the prototypical Chinese sage. He spawned a whole school of philosophy. His follower, Mencius, is also known today. There are other ancient Chinese people known today, although their origin is thought of as legendary: Laozi, writer of the Daode jing, one of the five major classics of ancient Chinese wisdom; Sunzi, the military theorist who wrote the &quot;Bing Fa&quot;, know in the West as &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Historiographically, there is a rather important name: Sima Qian, the first major Chinese historian, dating from Western Han.

Politically, there are maybe two major figures: Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor and the first builder of the Great Wall of China. Originally named Ying Zheng, he conquered the remaining Chinese kingdoms and became the first &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; to aggregate &quot;All-Under-Heaven&quot;, the whole territory. Nearly 60 years later, Emperor Wu of Han (Han Wudi) rose to power, marking the true beginning of Confucianism as &quot;the&quot; building block of the Imperial State.

Zheng He is another famous person.  He explored the world on big ships in 1405, almost a century before Ferdinand Magellan set sail.  Zheng He visited India, the Persian Gulf, Egypt, and possibly even the most southern tip of Africa!

DNA-Chip Analyzer (dChip) is a software package implementing model-based expression analysis of oligonucleotide arrays (Li and Wong 2001a) and several high-level analysis procedures. The model-based approach allows probe-level analysis on multiple arrays. By pooling information across multiple arrays, it is possible to assess standard errors for the expression indexes. This approach also allows automatic probe selection in the analysis stage to reduce errors due to cross-hybridizing probes and image contamination. High-level analysis in dChip includes comparative analysis and hierarchical clustering. Also see the comparison with Affy MAS software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Obtain the [[dChip]] software and gene information files and store them into a local directory, and double-click the program icon to start dChip. This manual is written in a tutorial style. It is best to explore the functionalities of dChip by following the steps described here sequentially. Paragraphs labeled as “[Analysis example]” may be skipped in first reading. Please cite Li and Wong 2001a if dChip results are used in manuscripts.

[[dChip]] is a single executable program running on Windows 2000, under which it is being developed. Presumably it can also run properly on Windows NT/XP, but some functions such as clustering picture zooming and image saving do not work properly on Windows 95/98. The computer memory should be as large as the number of chips (e.g. if there are 100 chips to analyze together, we need &gt; 100M memory), since dChip reads in all CEL data of a group of arrays into the memory. dChip is written in Visual C++ and uses Windows-specific functions for graphic tasks. Victoria Perreau has run dChip on an iBook, using the Connectix Virtual PC Windows 2000 software which costs about $225. When running on the iBook (466MHz, 320 RAM) it takes about 7 times longer to do the analysis than a PC (1000Mhz Pentium III , 256RAM),  i.e. 6 CEL files are normalized in 8 minutes instead of 1.

Please send dChip usage questions and discussions of microarray data analysis to dChip Yahoo group, and send function suggestions and bug reports of dChip to Cheng Li (cli@hsph.harvard.edu). It will be helpful if the followings are attached with email for diagnostic purpose: dChip version and downloading dates, analysis outputs and error messages (use “Analysis/Copy” or “Analysis/ Save”), dChip exported data and image files, parameter files (with .INI extension and in the same directory as dchip.exe), or the screenshot (Press PrintScreen key and paste into Paint software to save). If dChip crashes or you observe strange things happening, you may also try one or more of the following: 

 

· In the clustering picture, the part of figure is overlapped or not displayed: use Arrow keys, Control+Arrow keys and Shift+Arrow keys to adjust.

· Click the &quot;Tools/Options/Reset Default&quot; button to reset settings, or delete the existing “group_name”.ini files (in the same directory as dchip.exe) and then restart dChip. 

· Download and use the latest version of Gene information files or dChip itself. If needed copy these files and the CEL data files (but not the *.ini files containing dChip settings) into a new directory, and start dChip from here.

· Change to another PC or Windows system.

· When opening a group, check “Open group/ignore existing DCP file” and “Open group/Other information/ignore existing cdf.bin file” to re-extract the CEL and CDF files.

· “Gene information file” may have been saved in Excel format. Open files in Excel and use “File/Save As” to save in tab-delimited text format.

· If “out of memory” when clustering many genes, you can uncheck “Tools/Options/Clustering/Pre-calculate distance” before clustering.

· Clustering image exporting problem.

=Open Sicilian=
Moves: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+

The move Bb5+ is considered an Anti-Sicilian, and is the most commonly seen thereof. White develops his bishop with a tempo, enabling kingside castling, and may seek to develop rapidly along similar lines to the Ruy Lopez in order to meet Black's later attack head-on, or simply to control d5 by playing c4 but, not wishing to have the king's bishop stuck behind the c4 pawn, exchanging it off first. However, Black's own development can carry on unhindered and he tends to get an equal game - trying to sabotage the Sicilian this early on may be a cure worse than the disease.

Black has three replies, assuming no sentient being would block the check with the queen.
*[[/3...Nc6/]] leads to a Lopez-type setup in which Black has already played the useful c5;
*[[/3...Nd7/]] a more defensive variant of the above considered to grant White a minor advantage;
*[[/3...Bd7/]] wins a tempo by compelling the exchange of bishops but gives White more options.

I hope Wikibooks really takes off.  This is a really great idea worth a little of all our time.  I've already edited a page just by correcting some spelling errors with my Word spell checker.  Let's make this a repository of knowledge we can all be proud of.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Fuzheado. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Fuzheado~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

WebObjects is Apple's suite of tools and object-oriented frameworks for creating and deploying scalable, reusable web and client-server applications for the Internet and intranets. WebObjects supports the development, deployment, and extension of standards-based web services without the need to write low-level SOAP, XML or WSDL code. Tools enable code-free generation, configuration, and testing of applications from existing data assets.

According to Apple, &quot;WebObjects gives you the power to quickly develop robust applications that can be distributed over the Internet&quot; (http://developer.apple.com). If you ask me, that sounds a little like 'marketing-speak' and it doesn't really tell you much. Wikipedia have a much more thorough definition of WebObjects which states, in part, that WebObjects is &quot;a range of tools and frameworks to develop and deploy Web applications and Web services&quot; (my emphasis - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebObjects). To me, this is a much better definition as it makes it clear that WebObjects is both a set of tools (software applications) and frameworks (programming libraries) that you can use to both develop and then deploy web applications.

==== What does this mean to you? ====

WebObjects includes a number of applications that you can use to develop the interface of your application, write underlying application logic and model the database that you'll use to store your data. It also includes a number of programming libraries that you can call on so that you don't have to handle many of the mundane tasks associated with developing a web application.

Another way of defining WebObjects is that it is the technology that powers the iTunes Music Store (http://www.apple.com/itunes/).

==== Why Would You Care? ====

Because your time is best spent thinking about things specific to your applications (rather than dealing with the same generic data-access code every time).

The thing that makes you unique are your ideas and your understanding of your customers' or users' needs. When you're writing a web application it is because you've got a fantastic new idea or because you've identified a need that can be met by a new application. As such, your time is best spent writing code that relates directly to the purpose of your application. Why should you have to spend your time (re)writing the same kind of routine code that has already had to be written for every other web application?

To me, the beauty of WebObjects is that it allows me to focus on the parts of my application that are unique - rather than requiring me to write lots of repetitive code.

==== So What's this Book All About Then? ====

One of the criticisms that has been levelled at WebObjects is that there aren't many resources available to help people learn how to use WebObjects. Whilst I'm not sure if I agree with this assessment, the more quality material that is available, the better. This wikibook is an attempt to add to the available resources for people who are new to WebObjects and those who just want to know more.

Before you can start developing your first WebObjects applications it is worth understanding a bit about the programming libraries that you'll be using. When you develop WebObjects applications, you'll be writing Java code and making use of the WebObjects frameworks. This book assumes that you're familiar with Java and introduces you to the WebObjects frameworks. The fundamental frameworks used in developing even the most basic WebObjects applications are covered in the [[Programming:WebObjects/Foundation|Foundation]] section, while the powerful framework that is used to interact with databases is covered in the [[Programming:WebObjects#Enterprise_Object_Framework_.28EOF.29|Enterprise Object Framework (EOF)]] section. Whilst WebObjects comes with very rich set of programming libraries, there are a number of open source libraries that you can make use of in developing your applications. This book introduces one such library in the [[Programming:WebObjects#Project_WONDER|Project WONDER]] section.

WebObjects allows you to create HTML-based web applications (see the [[Programming:WebObjects#Web_Applications|Web Applications]] section), SOAP-based web services (see the [[Programming:WebObjects#Web_Services|Web Services]] section) and client-server applications (see [[Programming:WebObjects#Java_Client|Java-Client]]).

Once you start to become familiar with WebObjects you might like to explore different ways that you can develop WebObjects applications. Apple provide a suite of tools that you can use to develop your applications, XCode, WebObjects Builder, EOModeler. These tools are described in detail in the [[Programming:WebObjects#Development_Tools|Development Tools]] section which also covers alternative tools that you might be interested in using.

==== Where Do I Start? ====

If you've come here because you want to know more about the history of WebObjects and to understand the underlying concepts in more detail - continue reading the rest of this book in order. As you progress through the chapters you'll develop an in-depth understanding of WebObjects.

If on the other hand, you've come here because you've just noticed this weird 'WebObjects thing' in the optional extras section of the Developer Tools installer that comes with Mac OS X and you're itching to get started developing your first application, you might want to jump ahead to the [[Programming:WebObjects#Web_Applications|Web Applications]] section.

'''Storage'''

'''REMEMBER!!!'''

~ DISTRIBUTING any type of copyrighted files is ILLEGAL (unless, of course, you have permission to distribute the music from the author or the publisher). ~

Gmail is extremely handy if you want to send mp3 files to friends. It takes a while, but when Gmail is ready sending your mp3 message, it copies a version of your message to your sent items. This way, you can have all your mp3 files online, wherever you go, without any use of electronic equipment.

If you want to subscribe to a service using a Gmail account, you can use the [[Wikipedia:E-mail_address#plus_addressing|plus addressing technique]] -- a modified name of your account that you use to keep track of that subscription.
As an example, if your account is mario@gmail.com, and you want to subscribe to the newsletter &quot;bestnewsletter&quot;, you can use the mario+bestnewsletter@gmail.com: the emails will still go to your mario@gmail.com account, but looking the &quot;to:&quot; field will you will have mario+bestnewsletter@gmail.com.
This can then be used for a filter, and one can understand who is giving away the account to spammers.

==Deletion ==
If you store all your messages, you can excess the quota. To avoid this, you can use  filter.

For example, you can create a filter with the operators '''is:starred''' and '''label:''' (i.e. label:saved, if you created the label ''saved'' and marked all your important messages with this label) and select '''Delete it'''.

You can go to the Trash to read your messages. After reading the message, if it is an important one, you can star it and press the &quot;Move to Inbox&quot;  button to save it. Your starred messages are not going to be moved to the Trash again, creating the indicated filter (with the &quot;is:starred label&quot; in the &quot;Doesn´ t have&quot; field).

The emails in the Trash are automatically deleted forever in 30 days.</text>

This page uses the term 'shebang'. I only have ever seen hashbang used for the #!, shouldn't it use the most used term for it?

I hear shebang a lot more than hashbang but both are informal language. Perhaps we should use the real term, if we can figure out what it is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">WebObjects is used for many different purposes. While commercial use is well known to many people, the &lt;b&gt;academic use&lt;/b&gt; is not that well known. One example of how WebObjects made it possible to build a complex solution for E-Learning is [http://www.everlearn.info EverLearn]. Have a visit there to get an idea.

&lt;b&gt;Several new things were created with EverLearn:&lt;/b&gt;

* Wiki-like page-editing without the need to know HTML
* Editing of pictures inline in-browser
* Seamless localization/internationalization
* Live chat-tool done with direct actions
* ...and many more

Sure, merging seems reasonable.
Most things one uses a microcontroller for could conceivably be thought of as a robot sub-assembly. (There are a few exceptions, such as the

Should we make things like [[PIC]] and [[Atmel AVR]] and [[8051]] as mere pages (or perhaps subsections) in the Microcontroller book? (in other words, rename them to [[Microcontroller:PIC]] and [[Microcontroller:Atmel AVR]] and [[Microcontroller:8051]]).

:I do vote that this book get's merged into the Robotics book. Eventually I would like to start another book on &quot;Microprocessor Systems&quot;, or something similar that will also touch on Microcontrollers, however. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:40, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[Embedded Systems]] book ==

I have put forth a motion that this book should be merged into the [[Embedded Systems]] book. by merging this book into a book dedicated to topics about microprocessors and microcontrollers, the robotics book will be free to link to this resource, if needed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:00, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navigate|Prev=Congruence|Curr=The Side-Side-Side congruence theorem|Next=The Side-Angle-Side congruence theorem}}

The first congruence theorem we will discuss is the Side-Side-Side theorem.

== The Side-Side-Side congruence theorem ==
Given two triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt; such that their sides are equal, hence:
# The side &lt;math&gt;\overline {AB} &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\overline {DE} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[image:Geom side conth 01.png|374 px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
# The side &lt;math&gt;\overline {BC} &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\overline {EF} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[image:Geom side conth 02.png|374 px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
# The side &lt;math&gt;\overline {AC} &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\overline {DF} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[image:Geom side conth 03.png|374 px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Then the triangles are congruent and their angles are equal too.&lt;br/&gt;[[image:Geom side conth 04.png|374 px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

== Method of Proof ==

In order to prove the theorem we need a new postulate.
The postulate is that one can move or flip any shape in the plane without changing it.
In particular, one can move a triangle without changing its sides or angles.
Note that this postulate is true in plane geometry but not in general.
If one considers geometry over a ball, the postulate is no longer true.


Given the postulate, we will show how can we move one triangle to the other triangle location and show that they coincide.
Due to that, the triangles are equal.

=== The construction ===
# [[../Copying a line segment | Copy The line Segment]] side &lt;math&gt;\overline {AB} &lt;/math&gt; to the point '''D'''.
# [[../Our_tools:_Ruler_and_compass# how to draw a circle?| Draw the circle ]]  &lt;math&gt;\circ D,\overline{AB} &lt;/math&gt;.
# The circle &lt;math&gt;\circ D,\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; and the segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{DE} &lt;/math&gt; intersect at the point '''E''' hence we have a copy of  &lt;math&gt;\overline {AB} &lt;/math&gt; such that it coincides with &lt;math&gt;\overline{DE} &lt;/math&gt;.
# [[../Constructing a triangle | Construct a triangle]] with &lt;math&gt;\overline{DE} &lt;/math&gt; as its base, &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC} &lt;/math&gt; as the sides and the vertex at the side of the vertex '''F'''. Call this triangle triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEG &lt;/math&gt;

=== The claim ===
The triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; congruent.



=== The proof ===
# The points '''A''' and '''D''' coincide.
# The points '''B''' and '''E''' coincide.
# The vertex '''F''' is an intersection point of &lt;math&gt;\circ D,\overline{DF} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\circ E,\overline{EF} &lt;/math&gt;.
# The vertex '''G''' is an intersection point of &lt;math&gt;\circ D,\overline{AC} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\circ E,\overline{BC} &lt;/math&gt;.
# It is given that &lt;math&gt;\overline{DF} &lt;/math&gt; equals  &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC} &lt;/math&gt;.
# It is given that &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF} &lt;/math&gt; equals  &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC} &lt;/math&gt;.
# Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\circ D,\overline{DF} &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\circ D,\overline{AC} &lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;\circ E,\overline{EF} &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\circ E,\overline{BC} &lt;/math&gt;.
# However, circles of different centers have at most one intersection point in one side of the segment that joins their centers.
# Hence, the points '''G''' and '''F''' coincide.
# [[../Lines# Axiom: there is only a single straight line between two points|There is only a single straight line between two points]], therefore &lt;math&gt;\overline {EG} &lt;/math&gt;  coincides with &lt;math&gt;\overline {EF} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline {GD} &lt;/math&gt; coincides with &lt;math&gt;\overline {DF} &lt;/math&gt;.
# Therefore, the &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEG &lt;/math&gt; coincides with &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt; and the two are congruent.
# Due to the postulate &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEG &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; are equal and therefore congruent.
# Hence, &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; are congruent.
# Hence, &lt;math&gt;\angle ABC &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\angle DEF &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\angle BCA &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\angle EFD &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\angle CAB &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\angle FDE &lt;/math&gt;.

== Note ==

The Side-Side-Side congruence theorem appears as [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI8.html Book I, prop 8] at the Elements.
The proof here is in the spirit of the original proof.
In the original proof Euclid claims that the vertices '''F''' and '''G''' must coincide but doesn’t show why.
We used the assumption that “circles of different centers have at most one intersection point in one side of a segment that joins their centers”.
This assumption is true in plane geometry but doesn’t follows from Euclid’s original postulates. 
Since Euclid himself [[../Constructing equilateral triangle  |had to use such an assumption]], we preferred to give a more detailed proof, though the extra assumption.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The contents of this wikibook are out of date and have now moved to http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WO/Home. 

==== Create a New WebObjects Project ====

Launch Xcode (found in Developer-&gt;Applications). Choose ‘New Project...’ from the ‘File’ menu to display to ‘New Project’ Assistant.
Scroll to the bottom of the list of project types and choose ‘WebObjects Application’.


Click ‘Next’.
Type ‘HelloWorld’ as the ‘Project Name’ and click on the ‘Set...’ button to specify that you’d like to save your project to the desktop, or where ever you’d like to save your project. Note that earlier versions of WebObjects had problems building projects if their path had any spaces.


Click ‘Next’ lots more times until you come to a ‘Finish’ button, and click it (we’ll cover all those other screens later).
If you did everything right, you’ll end up with something that looks like this (depending on how you’ve configured Xcode).

==== Edit the ‘Main’ Component ====
You should now be looking at a brand-new WebObjects project. This is your ‘blank canvas’ if you’re fond of analogies.
It may seem a little complicated if you’re used to creating web sites that consist only of HTML files and images, but it isn’t too much more complicated. The main files we’re interested in are in the ‘Web Components’ group.


When you first create a WebObjects project, you will have just one ‘Component’, the ‘Main’ one.
A WebObjects component consists of a folder and a bunch of files, but at this stage we’re really only interested in 2:
&lt;ul&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Main.wo - which contains the interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main.java - where we’ll put the logic for the Main.wo page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Double-click on the ‘Main.wo’ file to edit the interface in WebObjects Builder.



￼You should see something like the screen above. This is how a WebObjects component looks in WebObjects Builder. The top half of the window is a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (most of the time (WYSIWYG(MOTT)) HTML editor where you can design your pages. The bottom half of the window is used to connect interface elements to variables in the ‘logic’ section of your web application.
Add the text “Hello, what is your name?” by typing in the top half of the window.


Add some form elements to the page by selecting a ‘WOForm’, a ‘Text Field’ and a ‘Submit Button’ from the ‘Forms’ menu bar item.
Finally, add a place-holder String2 by selecting ‘String’ from the ‘WebObject’ menu bar item.
You now have a finished interface: a heading inviting visitors to your web application to enter their name, a text field where they can type their name, a button so they can submit the form and a place-holder for the string of characters that you want to display in response.

==== Add an Action and a Key ====
Now that you have an interface, you need to write the logic of your first WebObjects application. This application allows a user to type their name in to a form and displays a message in response. In order to achieve this, we’re going to write a little Java code.
Each WebObjects component has a Java file that contains the logic for the component. Java is an object-oriented programming language so if you’re not familiar with object-oriented programming the next section might introduce some new concepts. At this stage you don’t need to know the gory details of object-oriented programming, but it might help to understand some basic terminology.
Each Java file contains a class which is like a recipe (it seems I like the analogies). The class contains both variables which are kind of like ingredients and methods which are like the steps in a recipe.
The main difference between a Java class and a recipe is that with Java you don’t know what you’re baking until you start, so whilst a recipe might say ‘take 1 cup of flour and mix it’, a Java class will say ‘take 1 cup of stuff and mix it’ and you get to decide exactly what stuff is when the application is running.
Anyway, enough background - let’s get our hands dirty. In order for our application to behave in the way that we want we need to modify the ‘Main’ class associated with our page. We want to add two things: a variable (think ingredient) to keep track of what the user types in and a method (think step) outlining what we should do with the variable.
To make matters even more interesting, WebObjects builder uses its own terminology when talking about variables and methods. It refers to ‘Keys’ and ‘Actions’. I’m going to do what WebObjects should and make things simpler by using the terminology that the rest of the world uses to refer to Java classes, so when WebObjects says ‘Key’ think ‘Variable’ and when you hear ‘Action’ think ‘Method’ (you’ll get used to it).

So, to add a variable to keep track of our visitors name, click on the ‘Interface’ menu bar item and select ‘Add Key...’.


In the property sheet that slides down, type visitorsName (the capitalisation is a convention when programming in Java) in the ‘Name’ field, ‘String’ in the ‘Type’ field and make sure ‘An instance variable’ is ticked before clicking ‘Add’.


You should now see ‘visitorsName’ in the bottom-half of the window under ‘Application’ and ‘Session’. This indicates that the Java class associated with this component has a variable called visitorsName that is available to ‘bind’ to interface components.
Repeat this step to add a ‘message’ variable to the ‘Main’ component.
Next, we need to add a method to the class that we will execute when visitors click on the submit button.
Click again on the ‘Interface’ menu item and this time choose ‘Add Action...’.


Type ‘sayHello’ as the ‘Action name’ and click ‘Add’.
Open up the Main.java file to see the variables and method that have been added to this file. It should now look like the code below:
&lt;pre&gt;
public class Main extends WOComponent {
    public String visitorsName;
    public String message;
	
    public Main(WOContext context) {
        super(context);
    }

    public WOComponent sayHello() {
        return null;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Connect the Interface to the Logic ====
Now you’ve created the interface and added a variable and method to the underlying Java code, all that we need to do is ‘hook-up’ the interface to the logic.
We need to specify that the ‘sayHello’ method should happen when the button is clicked and that the value for the ‘visitorsName’ variable should come from the text field. To do this we need to switch back to WebObjects Builder.

Click and drag from the space next to ‘visitorsName’ in the bottom half of the window to the text field and choose ‘value’ from the drop-down menu to indicate that you want the ‘visitorsName’ variable to get its value from the text field.
Repeat this step to bind the ‘value’ of the dynamic String to the ‘message’ variable and the ‘action’ of the ‘Submit’ button to the ‘sayHello’ method in the underlying Java class.

 
Once you’ve hooked up the interface to the logic, the only thing left to do is write a line (or two) of Java code to compose a custom message in response to the click of the button.

==== Edit the Java Code ====
Open the ‘Main.java’ file by double-clicking on it.
Fill out the details of the sayHello method like the example below. Basically, when this method is executed we want to construct a custom message based on the variable ‘visitorsName’ which will contain the name of the person we want to greet.
&lt;pre&gt;
public class Main extends WOComponent {
    public String visitorsName;
    public String message;
	
    public Main(WOContext context) {
        super(context);
    }

    public WOComponent sayHello() {
        message = &quot;Hi there, &quot; + visitorsName + &quot;!&quot;;
        return null;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Congratulations - you’ve just written your first WebObjects application. Make sure you’ve saved both the Main.wo file in WebObjects Builder and the Main.java file in XCode and you’re ready to compile your code and run the application. Click on the ‘Build and Go’ button in XCode to test your application.

=Human Visual System=

Yes, this article is a bit tongue-in-cheek!  Of course it's not possible to produce a concrete list of &quot;specifications&quot; for the human visual system because it functions in such a fundamentally different way to a man-made-camera.  Oh, and there's the small issue that we didn't design the eye.  If we're being completely honest then we have to admit that our understanding of the human visual system is patchy.  That said, it is useful and interesting to compare the human eye to man-made cameras.  Not least because an important aim of photography and cinematography is to exploit and mimic the various eccentricities of the human visual system.

==Dynamic Range==

At any given instant, the retina can resolve a contrast ratio of around 100:1 (about 6 1/2 [[w:F_stop|stops]]).  As soon as your eye moves (saccades) it re-adjusts its exposure both chemically and by adjusting the iris.  This is like having a camera on auto exposure.  Hence, over time, you can resolve a contrast ratio of about 1,000,000:1 (about 20 [[w:F_stop|stops]]).

The challenge for photographic systems is to display far more than the eye can instantaneously resolve, so that we can &quot;read&quot; a scene.

Typically a screen-projected image (film, DLP, whatever) won't ever have a brightness range of more than 1,000:1 and often less. If you make brighter highlights then scattered light from those areas of the screen will light up the shadows.  This is where curve shaping (the S shape of film stocks etc) comes in to pack more original scene brightness in at each end of the range
without apparently reducing the contrast of the mid-tones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already met gravitational fields, where the gravitational field strength of a planet multiplied by an objects mass gives us the weight of that object, and that the gravitational field strength, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of Earth is equal to the acceleration of free fall at its surface, &lt;math&gt;9.81 ms^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;. We will now consider gravitational fields that are not uniform and how to calculate the value of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; for any given mass.

==Gravity as a field of force==

The effects of the Earth's gravity extend far out into space. For example, the Moon is kept in orbit by the Earth even though it is 400,000km away (where gravity is the centripetal force). The Earth has a gravitational field that will attract any object with mass towards the centre of the planet.

===Radial Fields===
[[Image:Gravitymacroscopic.png|right|150px|thumb|The Earths radial gravitational field is represented by the lines.]]

The Earth has a '''radial field''' of gravity, which means that the gravitational field is circular and acts from the centre point.

You can see on the diagram that near the Earth's surface the lines are closer together than higher up. The closeness of the lines represent the relative strength of the field, so from the diagram, you can tell that the strength of the field decreases with altitude. Further apart lines represent points where the field is weaker.

The arrows show the direction in which the force on an object will act, which is towards the centre of the Earth.

===Uniform fields===
[[File:Gravity field is arbitrary.gif|left|thumb|Gravity field lines representation is arbitrary as illustrated here represented in 30x30 grid to 0x0 grid and almost being parallel and pointing straight down to the center of the Earth]][[Image:Gravityroom.png|left|150px|thumb|The Earth's gravitational field is represented by parallel lines on small scales.]]

A '''uniform field''', however, has the lines perfectly parallel. The Earth's gravitational field can be considered to be uniform on the scale of small things such as cars, balls, and planes. For small heights at this scale (a few dozen kilometres), the strength of the field doesn't change enough to be noticeable. Again, the arrows point towards the centre of the Earth, since that is the way objects fall.

==Newton's ideas of gravity==

Isaac Newton was trying to find a way to explain why objects fell towards the centre of the Earth instead of simply staying put. He began to link the falling of an apple, with the &quot;falling&quot; of the Moon towards the Earth, and came up with his '''law of gravitation'''.

He suggested that any two objects with a mass would have a force of attraction between them. This force of attraction would be proportional to their masses, so that larger masses would have a stronger force of attraction than a smaller mass.

The gravitational field of every object is a radial field, since the mass is concentrated at the objects centre, and as you already know, this is the point at which gravity could be said to act.

[[image:InverseSquareLaw.png|200px|thumb|right|As you can see, a quarter of lines of force goes through the plane when the distance is doubled.]] The strength of a radial field decreases as you move further away from it. As you can see on the diagram on the right, the number of field lines going through the plane quarter when the distance is doubled, and it will be &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{9}&lt;/math&gt; of the original value if the distance was tripled.

This is called the inverse square law, and is true for anything which is a point source, such a light from a point or the amount of radiation emitted.

The inverse square law follows &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the above, Newton suggested that the force of attraction was proportional to the two masses as well as the distance between them:

:&lt;math&gt;F \propto \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This relationship is the basis of how Newton's law of gravitation is often stated:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
Any two point masses attract each other with a force that is proportional to each of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

However, to make this into an equation, we need to add in a constant of proportionality, G:

:&lt;math&gt;F=-G\frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Where G is the '''gravitational constant''', &lt;math&gt;6.67 \times 10^{-11}&lt;/math&gt;. There is also a minus sign in the equation, which will be explained in the &quot;electric fields&quot; module, where we will encounter repelling as well as attracting forces.

&lt;math&gt;F=-G\frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt; is also sometimes written as &lt;math&gt;F=-G\frac {M m}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;, so that capital M represents a large mass such a planet, and lower case m represents a small mass such as a ball or an aeroplane.

==Gravitational field strength==

===Defining the gravitational field strength===

The gravitational field strength tells us how strong a gravitational field is. You may recall that the gravitational field strength of the Earth near its surface is &lt;math&gt;9.81m/s^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This means an object that is near the surface of the earth will accelerate towards it at &lt;math&gt;9.81m/s^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. We could then define the gravitational field strength as the acceleration an object will experience within that gravitational field.

A better definition, however, can be derived from the equation, &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt;. Making &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the subject of this gives us &lt;math&gt;a=\frac {F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;g=\frac {F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;. From this arrangement of the equation, our definition of gravitational field strength now becomes:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The gravitational field strength at a point is the force per unit mass exerted on a mass placed at that point.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This means that the gravitational field strength, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the force experienced by a mass of 1kg in that gravitational field.

From the new definition, it follows that gravitational field strength is measured in &lt;math&gt;N\ kg^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, though it is perfectly acceptable to use &lt;math&gt;ms^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; for situations where it is treated as an acceleration (such as the acceleration of an object in free fall).

===Finding the field strength of a mass===

Since &lt;math&gt;F=-G \frac {M m}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ F=mg&lt;/math&gt;, they can be combined to give:

:&lt;math&gt;mg=-G \frac {M m}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt; (by substituting F for mg)

:&lt;math&gt;g=-G \frac {M}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt; (by cancelling the lower case 'm's)

You can use this to find the gravitational field strength of a mass at a particular point, r.

Note that the gravitational field strength of the Earth near its surface is numerically equal to the acceleration of free fall, &lt;math&gt;9.81 m s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Publishing Wikibooks ==

Yes, getting a PDF file is indeed the very next that needs to happen, and I'm glad that you are working on that.  What comes after that is going to require a bit of money, and we as a group of Wikibooks editors need to decide if we are going to stick with the Wikimedia Foundation (or work under it), or perhaps go off and start our own little group for the things that are going to require some money.  I would prefer this secondary approach, of trying to establish a non-profit organization that is organized to physically publish content from Wikibooks.  I've approached several other people here on Wikibooks that are interested, but for now I've kept this idea rather low-key.

What I'd like to do is to register a ISBN publisher code for Wikibooks that would be owned by this publishing group, and to set up some sort of e-commerce website to offer direct sales of Wikibooks content.  Political and financial control of the group would be organized along the lines of a commercial cooperative with an exact heirarchy and format that we can decide once we have some content to work with.  As for the physical publishing of the content, I already have some experience with that, including one Wikibook that is sitting right in front of me that is dog-eared from my kids going through it.  (I physically published the [[Wikijunior Solar System]] book for a few people near where I live.)

All of this both requires some money, but it also has a small revenue stream as well.  I want to get this very well organized, and I also want to be very careful because I don't want Wikibooks to turn into a vanity press either.  It certainly has the potential of becoming that if we don't watch out.  I believe that once we have some outstanding content, given our relationship to Wikipedia and general visibility that Wikibooks already has, book distributors are going to come to us asking to use our content.  Or just out right stealing it and publishing it themselves.  Either way I don't mind, but this at least allows us to get something going and can get this content to other places that would not normally be reading something from Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:55, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

:Certainly Wikibooks is an excellent &quot;route to market&quot; - even if, as in this case, the online product is substantially free.  

:I would be interested in your draft corporate constitution.  Monitoring the accounts would be most problematical if the people contributing money are in disparate parts of the world -do you think that official reports of the Pay Pal account, or account of whatever system is being used, would need to be accessible to the senior project team? I know this sounds very 1980s but I believe that the principle people involved should be allowed to have an adequate reward, such as a percentage of profits, as a motivation for producing and marketing hard copy.

:Quality, consistency and completeness are the main problems with the adult texts. It is also amazing to me that the high school texts are so incomplete. The lack of quality chemistry, physics, biology, maths, US history, general history, world geography, english and french textbooks at the high school level is very surprising. Perhaps three or four contributors could focus on each of these in turn.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:28, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

Have you considered A Print on demand publisher.  They pay quite high roylaties(20 - 30%), which could help defray any costs, or be returned, in whole or part to wikibooks or the wikimedia foundation, or given to another charity.  gets it in print fairly cheaply, without much rick of over printing, and keeps it in print for as long as neccesary.  Normally requires copyright to be owned by the person submitting it ot thwem, but if you explain the copyright situation with wikibooks, they would probaly be ok with that.  Arima looks good.  I am not affiliated with them in any way, just for the record. [http://www.arimapublishing.co.uk/arima200.htm Arima] [[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 11:29, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

::I made the print version then viewed and saved it. I opened this file in MS Word and saved it once more in Word format.  This allowed Word to set the pagination, produce a TOC etc. The document &quot;read&quot; differently as a whole book so I did some final edits and juggled with the image placements. I then downloaded PDFCreator and printed the Word document to PDF.  This preserved the page breaks, which are the big problem with the HTML original whether printed direct or converted to PDF and printed.

::I tried to upload the PDF in Wikibooks but, although it would upload it could not be viewed. At the moment the PDF is being hosted on another site ( http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lka/Consciousness%20studies.pdf ).

::::The PDFs are the same.

::::The PDF file looks fine to me as well (at least for being able to download the content).  Actually, I am very impressed with the overall appearance of the book itself.  I'm using Mozilla, and generally I download the PDF files directly to my hard drive, because they tend to lock up my browser with the plug-in support.  I would like to add that you should consider adding the names of some of the major contributors to the content (the GFDL requires the top 3-5 authors... U.S. copyright law requires all of them (except obvious vandals who have been reverted).  You also need to include the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]] within the contents of the book, even though it can be very fine print.  Otherwise, it is looking great!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:20, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:::::Thanks for the suggestions, I have implemented these and re-uploaded. 
:::::I can right click on the Wikibooks URL for the PDF and save it without any problems. The difficulty arises when I left-click on it to open the PDF in Acrobat directly. From what you and Derbeth are saying it is likely to be some problem at my end.  However, I can link directly to PDFs everywhere else so, just in case anyone else has my problem, I have included instructions on how to save the file to disk - which is probably a good idea with a 225 page book anyway.

I was just poking around after initializing an WikiBooks account. I saw your notice (8 April) in the staff lounge about moving this discussion to ... ''something''.  Might I suggest that would best be a link to allow continuity. 
:I'm curious to see for such proposals you ''WikiBookians'' aren't using an RFC [[WB:RFC]] project page to discuss guidelines and policy proposals as I understand to be historic wiki tradition (i.e. pre-wikipedia foundation). Obviously, I'm a total newbie here, but such forums categorize and focus the discussion to the topic at hand, leaving the lounge uncluttered save for mentions of the original and the links to same. &lt;B&gt;[[User:Fabartus|Fra&lt;/B&gt;]][[User talk:Fabartus|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;nk'''B'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:17, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

*Hi again. 
**I never got to my WikiWork today as I browsed through the staff lounge and saw a familiar theme from various wikipedia archives, this time, in time to make [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#A_Quasi-Veteren_Perspective_.28from_WikiP.29 a timely contribution].  I've also taken a good read on ''special relativity'', and so kudos![[User:Fabartus|Fabartus]]//&amp;#91;&amp;#91;&amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;green&amp;quot;&amp;gt;User talk:Fabartus&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]] 21:00, 8 April 2006 (UTC) (I wish I knew how to fix this sig!)

==explain comment==

My comment to jguk is only stating that as long as there is a question
as to whether or not my effort on [[THINKSTARSHIP]] isin contravention, it seems irrational for me to continue that effort, until the issue of whether or not i am in contravention is resolved.
It is not a personal attack, only stating that i'd like to see the issue resolved, and explaining that it makes no sense for me to continue working until it is.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 17:50, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

:RobinH, let me assure you that I am not seeking to override a vote (although, following Robert Horning's comments in the Staff Lounge, I would question how you have determined what the result to be). What I do believe we should be looking for is consensus. There have been a number of comments made on the talk page of [[WB:NPA]] that should, in my opinion, be followed up. They are legitimate concerns (even if you disagree withthem), and surely you are not saying that the wording of [[WB:NPA]] is so perfect that it cannot be improved upon? There's no real need to rush things, it's clear that no-one is advocating making personal attacks on fellow wikibookians. I should therefore be grateful if you would do me the courtesy of responding to my concerns on WB:NPA, then letting a time pass for others to make comments if they seek fit, before seeking a vote under clear rules and time constraints, and with full publicity (along the lines Rob suggested) before marking the policy as &quot;enforced&quot;. I'd also note that at worst (from your point of view) there should only be a two month delay in marking it as &quot;enforced&quot;. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:54, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

== Since you left word on April 28th ==

Hi! RobinH&amp;mdash;Sorry, I've been swamped over at Wikipedia and Life too! I'll take a peek at the policy proposals sometime this weekend. It's been a while so I don't know what good it will do!
Best regards, [[User:Fabartus|FrankB]]-&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User talk:Fabartus]] 06:00, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

:RobinH, I just read your message from April 28. It looks like your most desired policy, the Ad hoc administration committee, was not approved. Is there anything I can still do for you on this issue? I support the no personal attacks policy and the editing disputes policy. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 00:58, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

== IRC ==

Robin, I know we have differences in methodology, but I really do think we are close in what we believe our aim should be. If you are able to come to irc on the #wikibooks channel, it would be good to talk through where and why we disagree, which would help us come to a solution which ought to be good for wikibooks as a whole, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:22, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

== Behaviour policies ==

Why not rename [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] so that it becomes [[Wikibooks:Behaviour policy]]? By all means have a note on it saying that whilst the bits included are enforced, the policy is still undergoing development. Then propose adding bits, such as the editing disputes bit, to then-existing Behaviour policy. 

Such an approach would: (1) Meet the requests of those who only want to see one behaviour policy; (2) Make policy easier to find because all related policy would be on one page; (3) Helps make sure that we do not make inconsistent policy (ie say something on one page and something else on another); (4) Helps us identify common themes which would allow some condensing of policy. As it is, the &quot;editing disputes&quot; and &quot;no personal attacks&quot; proposals have some overlap - for instance, certainly on Wikipedia, many editing disputes turn into personal attack wars and ''vice versa''. It makes sense to consider these issues together, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:12, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:This is an interesting idea that might be incorporated into your policy rewrite. The reason that I am keen to get the two behaviour policies into &quot;enforced&quot; status fairly soon is that I really do feel exposed at Wikibooks. I am contemplating writing a section on genetics in the GCSE Biology book and can just imagine some Intelligent Design/Creationist objector wrecking it. With the two policies in place we would have to discuss the problems outside of the book, we would be forced to be civilised and finally, if agreement were not possible, an administrator could be asked to adjudicate. This might result in an ID appendix or similar (hopefully not) but would not wreck the book. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:37, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

The GCSE Biology book needs to have content relevant to the GCSE syllabus (which one is being applied should be identified), and nothing that is irrelevant to the syllabus. I'm aware that one board is now proposing to teach (at least a little bit of) creationism - and therefore it should be covered to such an extent as is required to meet with that syllabus's requirements - no more, no less. Similarly, whatever you write on genetics should be based solely on the syllabus requirements, and you should not let any personal views you may have on the subject affect what you write. If anyone tries to remove (as opposed to rephrase) material that is relevant to the syllabus, or add information that is unrelated to the syllabus, then let me assure you of my support in stopping them. I believe this is justified under current (unwritten) policy.

Incidentally, your &quot;editing disputes&quot; proposal would not help you here. It would give the person disrupting you the upper hand (as you would be the one to do the first &quot;revert&quot;, you would have to give way or fall foul of the proposed three revert rule. You also wouldn't be able to re-address the issue ever again without risking being banned.

:Unlike the Wikipedia three revert rule we would need to show evidence of an attempt at compromise on a disputed edit page. If compromise were not possible an admin would need to be involved and the matter could be pushed to a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:11, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

It's for reasons such as this that I do not like prescriptive rules that address only some potential issues. I appreciate that your proposals are well-intentioned, I just think they unintentionally open up a hornet's nest too. Non-prescriptive principle-based rules are far more flexible in that regard - for example, in the situation you outline someone can come in, see that you are trying to have a book that reflects the syllabus and another person is disrupting you rather than helping you, and come down hard on the one being disruptive without having to sanction you. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:57, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:The problem with a non-prescriptive basis is that it puts all of the power in the hands of admins. We have already seen wheel wars at Wikibooks... [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:11, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

::Incidentally, where are the wheel wars? I've seen others mention this, but I don't think I've seen it on Wikibooks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

== [[GCSE Biology]] ==

You refer to the GCSE Biology book above, but we don't have one, do we? If you're about to start one, that would be great - and maybe Wikipedia's Biology WikiProject could help. Have you seen [[Wikistudy]]? It would fit in well there, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:03, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:See [[GCSE Science/Contents#Biology]]. I have 2 sons who have done this course and who have bookshelves full of textbooks and revision guides. I also have a PhD in biophysics. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:05, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

Great stuff! I'd love to see Wikibooks host books for all core GCSE and A-level syllabuses - which is one of the reasons I put the [[Wikistudy]] idea forward. There appears to be a lot of goodwill for such a project, but it just has not been harnessed together in one place yet. Hopefully it will happen, and hopefully it will happen here at Wikibooks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:42, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

==Game Guides==
Wow, nice to see someone fighting so much for them :-) I am also a  big fan, I much prefer my kids playing videogames than being TV couch potatos! I gave up on games at Wikibooks, but if you still want to  fight the battle here are some links for ya:
* [http://iam.colum.edu/IamAdmin/Diagram/GameCore.aspx] Interactive Arts and Media Course Diagrams Columbia College Chicago 
* [http://www.adigitaldreamer.com/game-design-schools.htm] Video Game Design Schools &amp; Colleges (Check Devry's they are excellent!)
* [http://www.northwesternbc.edu/361.htm] Video Game Design and Development at Northwestern

::Robin, I'm not quite sure what point you are trying to make over at the staff lounge. It is accepted that there can be textbooks on games. However, games walkthroughs are not textbooks and should go. Jimbo's position has been quite clear on this from his amendment to [[WB:WIW]] (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=434945]) onwards. I think you will find that Jimbo's mind is quite made up on this one, and will not change regardless of what arguments you or others put forward.

::On a completely different note, it is clear that you care about Wikibooks, and I for one look forward to your future additions relating to GCSE Biology. May I ask whether you're willing to put yourself forward on [[WB:RFA]]? If you do, you can be sure of my support, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:38, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

== Policy Votes ==

I know you are working really hard to get all the policy here in order, and I certainly appreciate the effort. I feel that we as a community definately need these policies to operate better. However, the dispute resolution policy was too hard-edged as you put it, so I had to take my vote away. If you change it to milder language, I will probably put my vote back. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:23, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

I have to agree with Whiteknight. At this point, I think it would impede the work of the administrators, all of which I trust. Maybe if there were more contributors, or more problems with this type of thing, this would have an easier time getting passed. The last dispute I saw was with Jguk and Johnny, Jguk and Whiteknight seemed to handle the situation just fine, without this policy. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 00:40, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

:Perhaps I should just tidy up the current loose ends in the area of policy and let the rest soak for a while. As you say, there is little real trouble at the moment. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:28, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

== Compliments ==

We're arguing over the Disputed Editing policy, and that's not so good, but I wanted you to know that I took a look at some of your pages on Turgor in plant cells and the structure of the eye, and found them to be useful and engaging.  I wish I understood biology better than I do, and maybe this summer I'll run through the Wikibooks biology book and learn a few things.  Thank you for working on that.  -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 19:48, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

== Creating PDF versions ==

Can you explain me, step by step, how do you create PDF files from print versions? I tried method described in [[Help:Print versions#PDF versions]] but it did not work. I was saving true print version (without navigation bar, print version notice and so on) as HTML file with images using Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer and opening them as HTML file in OpenOffice.org 2.0.2 and Microsoft Word 2003. None of these combinations worked. The thing I got in word processor was text with print version notice, section edit links and so on. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:03, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

:I save articles as &quot;Web page complete&quot;. MS Word displays the files properly for me (looking like the Print Version) provided they are small (under 50 pages). Larger files may need breaking into parts for viewing. Recently I have used Wordpad to &quot;top and tail&quot; the files before viewing. I remove all the unnecessary code before the BODY tag and after the end of text, before the /BODY tag. I just stick the standard HTML HEAD /HEAD sequence in front of the BODY tag. 

:Once the file has been saved as a word processor file it looks like the Print Version but does have irritating additions such as section templates still in place. I chop off the Print Version heading and any Table of Contents and use recorded macros in Word to cut out all the repeating elements that are not needed such as &quot;edit&quot; links and templates. I then page through the whole file looking for headings that have the wrong 'level', links that are incorrect and missing graphics. If there is a missing graphic I go to the online version and copy and paste the graphic into place. Once the text looks OK I insert a Cover Page and Table of Contents at the start. The whole process takes about 45 minutes for a 200 page book so it is a labour of love if you are a busy person. Once the Word Document is complete I print it to file using PDF Creator and upload.  

:Some books make Word 'hang' when you try to view them as HTML. The only way round this (that I have found) is to chop them into pieces, top and tail the small files with HTML tags and combine them in Word. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

Since I know you are very active in policy matters, I figured I would alert you, and get your opinion. I've created this proposal in response to some of the criticisms from the original proposal. This version removes all mention of percentages (which was a big stumbling block for some people), reinforces the notion of concensus, and generally tries to be more forgiving and friendly. I don't think this should go up for a vote the way it is, but I would like to get some other eyes on it, to fix any holes that i might have missed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:13, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

:I would like to call a vote on this new policy proposal by the end of the week sometime, and I wanted to know if you had any last minute comments or suggestions on it? If we can get an official voting policy on the books (even if it is vague and interpretable), we can start to move forward on some of the other policy proposals that have sat undecided for long periods of time. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

I changed some of your previous edits on this proposal, I hope you don't take offense to this. I am pushing for a more &quot;freeform&quot; version of this policy, with few strict guidelines, and plenty of room for interpretation. Setting specific timeframes, majority overrides, numbers of voting attempts, etc. seems counter-productive towards this end. My sincere hope is that the notions of &quot;community&quot; and &quot;consensus&quot; and &quot;compromise&quot; are put forward, and that people learn to work together towards a common goal. I know you are strongly concerned about the rights of the minority, so my rewrite here specifically mentions that minority opinions must be addressed before a final declaration of consensus. Users who are in stubborn, uncompromising opposition to a discussion, can be viewed as acting in bad faith, and not working towards compromise nor concensus. To this end, no single user nor a small minority can &quot;block&quot; a vote, but they can offer compromises which must be considered. Now, if it is found that minority opinions are stalemating some discussions, perhaps we can work out an alternate method of decision-making, such as 3rd-party arbitrators, subcommittees, etc. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

== Modern Physics ==

[[Modern Physics]] is an epic project, which is why it saddens me to see it with so few reoccuring contributors. Most of the people who were a driving force for this book originally have not contributed in a year or more, and the book has essentially be left abandoned. I do agree however, that the material in [[Modern Physics]] is disparent enough to warrant being separated out into separate books, just as [[Special Relativity]] has been already. Perhaps I will work on separating out the material into new books, instead of trying to rename and reformat all of the current pages. The [[Modern Physics:Gravity:Contents|Gravity]] section, and the [[Modern Physics:Constants:Contents|Constants appendix]] however, should probably remain in this book, because they are not big enough to be weaned from the mother quite yet. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:52, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

== Hi Again ==

I've ported two new useful interwiki templates {{tl|w2}} &amp; {{tl|w2c}} from {{w2|the commons}} that allows pipetricks and interlanguage reaches to wikipedia pages &amp; commons pages respectively (as demonstrated below)... depending on the users default language. 

I'm very much involved in sisterwiki project cross linking studies and experiments (nothing yet seems absolutely workable), so if you'd be so kind as to drop your key template categories, I'll drop by later tonight and fix things up. The redlinks on that template obviously don't fit up well with what you're all using! 

*Also, take a look at {{w2|CAT:CAT}} &amp; {{w2c|:Category:CommonsRoot}} and let me know if you want that big multiligual template on your main category page ([http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Main_page this page]) interestingly 'different' by name. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 20:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

:Thank you for this information. [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]], [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]], [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]], [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] and other active admins are probably better able to put this scheme into effect. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:05, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

== Human physiology textbook input request ==

Robin,

I saw that you are a retired physiologist. I am not a physiologist, but I am teaching introductory human physiology. Currently I am teaching the class to a remote site 90 miles away, and we decided to make a Wikibook instead of holding a traditional course. We have completed our first of three phases for our [[human physiology]] book, and I am quite proud of what the students have accomplished so far. Since you are very experienced with both physiology and Wikibooks, I wondered if you could look at our book and give us suggestions for where to go next. Whiteknight has helped us a lot with formatting questions. I would love to hear any thoughts from you on content, format, further directions, etc. Thanks! [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 14:39, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

== General voting rules: note to admins ==

I mentioned on the voting rules that I would be sending out a note to all active admins, requesting that they come in and take a look at the current policy. Here is the text of the note that I will be copy+pasting on to each of their pages, and possibly staff lounge. I will wait for confirmation from you to make sure that it is fair, but descriptive:
:I would like to personally call all active wikibooks admins and users to come take a look at the proposed version of the [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal|General Voting Rules policy]] that is currently under discussion. The current text of the policy puts a focus on &quot;consensus&quot; as the primary method of making decisions. However, it has been asserted that such a policy would allow disruptive or stubborn users to &quot;block&quot; votes, or prolong them indefinately. This policy has the power to affect all users here at wikibooks, and it is imperative therefore that all users read the proposed text of the policy, and join in [[Wikibooks talk:General voting rules/Proposal|the discussion]]. 
Let me know if you like it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:07, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

:If we changed some text in the policy, to make it more like the original version, would the policy make more sense? I'm by no means in stubborn defense of this particular wording, I just want to address a few key points about &quot;consensus&quot;, &quot;compromise&quot; and &quot;community&quot;. I'd be willing to alter nearly all the text of this proposal, so long as we don't explicitly introduce a mechanism for majority voting (unless we include a clause that the method by which a decision is arrived at can be decided before the vote, so long as all participants agree on the terms). If we had enough ambiguity in the policy, so that consensus was the stated primary method of decision making, but other methods were implicitly allowed (assuming all members could agree on those other methods beforehand), I would be in favor of that policy as well. I do think that in some matters, wikibookians should be able to say &quot;Okay, we have a disagreement on issue X, if everybody is okay with it, I would like to call a vote, and a 75% majority wins the day&quot;, especially in matters that are trivial (and I say trivial to mean local matters, such as issues concerning a single book, issues not affecting policy, etc). I don't think that such &quot;alternate methods&quot; should be allowed when discussin policy, VFD, RFA, or things of that nature, however.  Let me know what you think beforehand, we could make some changes before we invite everybody in to look at it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Kellen's Version ==

I agree with you, I like the points of Kellen's version of this policy. However, I do think that for this policy proposal to &quot;fit in&quot; with the rest of our policy cannon, it should contain more prose, and fewer bullets. I'm going to '''be bold''', and write up a prose version that mirrors the points from kellen's proposal. Hopefully, my rhetoric doesn't murk it up. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:38, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Untagged Images ==

Hey robin, long time no see! I just wanted to let you know that within the next month or so, we are trying to delete all the untagged images on wikibooks (some of them are years old, and there are now more then 3000 of them). The records show that you have uploaded at least 7 images without licenses. [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikilang=en&amp;wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;since=&amp;until=&amp;img_user_text=RobinH&amp;order=img_user_text&amp;max=500&amp;order=img_user_text&amp;format=html you can see the list here]. Since we all know you and trust you, If you tell me what license to release these images under, I will gladly tag them for you. 

PS. I noticed that you don't have a valid email address stored in the system, and so I couldn't email you about this.

Hi RobinH,

thanks for the update/explanation about the SR Introduction. I understand that you agree and disagree with me on some points. That's fine. i think i may pull out of wikibooks special relativity because I feel I'm out of your league. The target audience may be closer to your demographic than the layperson-type that I thought it was aimed at. Perhaps in this case your appraoch is better suited for the intended audience.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

==Wikibooks as content for printed textbooks in developing nations==
I've searched around a bit for folks that are publishing Wikibooks at rockbottom costs (which means more volume than on-demand) for the purposes of providing textbooks in developing nations.  I've gotten a couple of data points that show that crumby knock-off photo-copy versions of textbooks cost between $6 and $8 in Togo. (See, for example: http://far-togo.blogspot.com/2007/01/peace-corps-update-16.html  .)  Separately, I've found that offset printing costs for moderately large volumes (10,000 and up) are below $2.  A check of the pulp novel section of the local bookstore shows that really high volume printing costs must be under $1.

I mention all this because of my interest in lowering the barriers to education in poor nations.  If the content is free (other pages around Wikibooks suggest that this can be achieved for printing purposes, if careful about fair use images), and the printing cost minimized, and distribution is handled by some charitable org, then one obstacle can be significantly reduced or even eliminated. I am interesting in supporting existing efforts, or if I don't find any, I'll look into starting an effort of my own.

I'm writing here because Google sent me here :-).  I'm hopeful that you can direct me, or other readers can direct me. Thanks! (Readers, I can be reached at: curtbeckmann at gmail dot com) (Robin, if I have violated a protocol with this note, please let me know.)  --[[User:Curtbeckmann|Curtbeckmann]] 23:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

:Hi, and welcome to Wikibooks.  Your best contact for low cost printing on Wikibooks is probably [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] (See [[User_talk:Robert_Horning#Publishing.2C_etc| Publishing etc]]).  Paperback prices are now surprisingly low, my company gets a 150 page manual with glossy cover printed for about £2.50 ($5) from a local printer if volumes are over 1000 copies.  It looks like a proper paperback, possibly better quality than most.  Have you thought of talking to a local printer and persuading him to do charitable printing for cost price?  I would guess that the cost price on our manuals is nearer $3 than $5.  You would need to supply the text &quot;print ready&quot; in Word or one of the Mac formats. (I bet you could get an even better deal in Hong Kong or New Delhi). [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:07, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
::Thanks, Robin, I'll check into it.  It would be cool to do the printing locally to the recipients, which may mean Africa; New Delhi may be good also.  Prices might not be the absolute lowest, but reducing shipping costs is worth something, plus driving production in the region is a worthy goal.  Thanks again.  --[[User:24.6.122.219|24.6.122.219]] 06:51, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Ad Hoc Arbitration ==

What I was talking about with my comment against Ad hoc arbitration is the ability of a person to act as an arbiter and impose a binding solution without a proper arbitration policy to back it up. There are some people here who are more qualified to impose solutions onto disputes then other people are. This is a function of experience and knowledge of wikibooks policy.

Arbitration is very serious, and from my comments you should probably know that I oppose arbitration unless it is a final, binding step in dispute resolution. If arbitration isn't final, then I see no reason to have it at all, and if it isn't binding, then it is nothing but regular mediation.

There has been some criticism of the establishment of a standing ArbCom, but I wonder if that criticism is enough to prevent it's creation anyway. That point aside, what I am basically envisioning now is similar in spirit to your old proposal on ad hoc arbitration: A pool of qualified arbiters, from which a few neutral parties are selected in response to a specific dispute. We could then specify the rules and procedures for such an arbitration in policy, so that there was no confusion or ambiguity.

While I was opposed to your proposal initially, the political climate here has changed much since then, and hindsight is always 20/20. At least you've been far to polite to say &quot;I told you so&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]] ==

So long as I am thinking about it, I wanted to ask for your opinion of the editorial board proposal. I think a formal board like this would really work wonders here, and help some of our better books get the attention that they really deserve. 

I'm really excited about this proposal, and I really want to see it succeed. Any input would be appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:38, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

== Arbitration Committees ==

I am opposed to a standing arbitration committee because the Wikibooks community is too small to ensure an impartial committee and so committee members should be chosen when needed and should always be non-biased and completely neutral (as much as possible).  SBJohnny is one of the best Wikibooks members and admins but he is central to the Panic arguement and so can't be considered as completely impartial although I certainly wouldn't call him biased.  I also didn't like the tone of the proposal which sought to incriminate Panic from the start and was dragging this issue on yet again with the threats of permanent blocks which, in my opinion, should only ever be used for blatant trouble-makers - we can probably all agree that Panic is not blatantly trying to cause trouble however much he may be at fault.

I'd prefer to see an end to this issue and for everyone incolved to exercise restraint for now.  Failing that I'd agree to a restart of the original arbitration with Robert or someone else who is pretty neutral (or maybe Herby) taking charge.  This whole issue is a mess and my actions were done with good intentions - others agreed that Panic should be unblocked (and reblocked for the original 2 weeks) but they felt that they were in a biased position and such a move wouldn't be possible.  I am probably biased myself but I stand by my actions. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:23, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

:The Panic problem might be showing that Wikibooks needs procedures.  If we agree a constitution, or set of procedures, then everyone involved knows that the process is fair.  This in itself takes some of the heat out of a conflict. Your idea of collecting together admins for a particular case seems good to me.  We would need a set of procedures describing how this might be accomplished and the extent of their powers after they have formed an ad hoc group. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:09, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

::Considering the roll of arbitration, and the potential power it might have, we should likely only pick arbiters from the pool of currently active admins. Given that, I think the process could easily be modeled off the idea of jury selection: both disputants could go down the list of current active admins, and select admins that they don't suspect are biased against them. Any names that make it onto both lists will be eligible to be arbiters (the admins should probably have to agree to it first). This raises the problem of polarized situations where all admins are either biased or opt not to get involved, which will require some other sort of compromise. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:42, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Front Page ==

The changes I made try to both reduce the size of the page, so its not overfull and trying to find a balance between readers and contributors. I think in the past the front page has tended to switch between focusing entirely on readers or entirely on contributors, when Wikibooks needs both in order to work. That said I've added 'By print version' to Search and Browse which links to the PDF versions page and added 'Good books' to Special Groups that links to Featured books page. I don't feel like its the right time to do much more than that, since there seems to be some debate as how to move forward with regards to publishing books, ways to improve existing books and ways to bring attention to good books that I believe will effect both of those pages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:I think the addition of the &quot;Featured Books&quot; link in the sidebar should qualify in your request to have a link to our good books. We can add another link to that page if you want, but Frankly i find it a little embarrassing. The list is completely unmaintained, and (as i've said a million times before) there are books on that list that shouldn't be, and books that aren't on that list that should. If we had a list worth pointing to, I agree that a link to it should be posted right on the main page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:21, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

::I have transferred this discussion to the Staff Lounge.[[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Changes_to_main_page]] [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:08, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

== Main page ==

Thanks for support. I like the direction you have taken in your project, but nonetheless I don't like few things.

First of all, the table with &quot;excellent books&quot; (is &quot;excellent&quot; the best word? Aren't we exaggerating?) leaves too much space in left and right; this looks odd. Perhaps the solution is to make a two-column layout to use all of existing space? Look how long is the page now; it should be not like that, especially when category selection is deep on the bottom.

Secondly, I don't think that putting PDF's in front is a good idea. We are wiki and should be focused on wiki materials. PDF's are: inconsistent in look, require user to download a large ammount of data at once, may be seriously outdated and are something &quot;external&quot; to our project (internal links, categories do not work). I think that part of Wikipedia success is that you read and simultaniously fix mistakes you find. Showing out non-editable form of our books would be a shot in our foot in my opinion. So, the order should be the opposite: book titles should lead to books on our wiki (cover pages when possible), and links to PDF versions should be given as an option.

Less important things: table with Wikijunior books has an inconsistent look with the rest of the page. &quot;Search and browse&quot; with category selection together with list of sister projects leave to much white space on left and right. They should be aligned more horizontally; be wider but lower.

Things I particularly like are book descriptions with cover images; this brings some diversity to the main page. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:28, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== Concern about growth of Wikibooks ==

I want to let you know that I share your concern about the growth of Wikibooks and feel that the current direction that the &quot;leaders&quot; of Wikibooks have taken in recent months in response to issues that have been raised and abrasiveness toward new users and new ideas is directly related to the current decline in readership and overall growth of this project.

And for myself, I have been pushed off of the Staff Lounge and no longer feel welcome to post comments there, or really on nearly any page here on Wikibooks for that matter.  I hope that changes and changes soon, and cosmetic changes such as the front page also not going to completely fix this problem.

I'm still watching Wikibooks, but I'm not going to be actively participating in much of anything for what I hope are obvious reasons to somebody who can read my user page.  It looks like Karl Wick is coming back into the fray and going to try and make some changes.  If he does, I would strongly urge you to treat him as if he was Jimbo.  Seriously.  While not completely of the God-King role that Jimbo was, if he wants to do a major cleanup of Wikibooks I guarentee that the WMF board will listen strongly to any suggestion he makes.

At the same time, Karl is not one to make huge waves and does an amazing job of concensus building.  The main page is something he strongly looks at, and he was instrumental in making the front page what it was about a year ago when we did the last major overhaul of that page.  If he steps into a leadership role and does some policy cleanup too (that isn't his style, but who knows), I might get involved here again in a more substantive way.  And it will be a very positive experience for all Wikibookians.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:37, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

Hello. I've had a look at [[Introduction to Paleoanthropology]] and it seems only 13 pages need to be renamed -- perhaps it's better done manually than with a bot?

== Books on Main page ==

Maybe we should start a thread about this issue on the staff lounge project chat or something, because alot of people seem to have many varied opinions on the issue and it's something that we should maybe discuss more publicly then on talk pages. 

For myself, i think that putting more books on the main page then can fit without scrolling is a waste: the books at the bottom won't be seen as frequently and will be at a disadvantage compared to the books that are at the top of the page. The current system rotates the books in sets of 5 or 6 onto the main page each minute, so everytime the page is loaded it should show a new set of books. The disadvantage to this method, of course, is that many people may only load the main page once, and then open a book and start reading. 

We could probably fit more books on there if we just listed the titles and included no pictures or descriptions (the way the main page was months ago), and I just dont feel like that's an acceptable option. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:52, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

== Special relativity, mathematical transformations ==

How do you get:


&quot;But from the length contraction formula:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dt^'}{dt} = \frac {\gamma(u^')}{\gamma(u)}&lt;/math&gt;&quot;

in the &quot;Acceleration transformation&quot; section? I think it needs a little bit of extra equations. [[User:Moriconne|Moriconne]]

:Thanks for raising this, someone else put in this method originally but &quot;length contraction&quot; is a &quot;bum steer&quot;! I have fixed the derivation (see http://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p139/homework/eight.pdf for a Berkeley University source).  There are definitely shorter ways of getting to the acceleration transformation but the expression above is interesting in its own right. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:11, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

:: Thank you,the &quot;length contraction&quot; was sure a red herring. Very interesting and not so trivial :-)  [[User:Moriconne|Moriconne]]

== Special Relativity, General Cleanup ==

Hey RobinH, I wanted to do a little work on the special relativity book, and I figured I should give you a heads up about it all. I've created a page-header template for use on every page, {{tlx|Special Relativity}}. It's not the prettiest template, but it's better then how navigation was handeled before (every page had something different). I've also created a template for use on the TOC, {{tlx|Special Relativity/Section}}. You can see the results of this template on the TOC now, in the few places where i've been able to use it. If you don't like this template, that's fine it is a little experimental.

I tagged the book with {{tlx|cleanup-nc}} also, because some of the pages use a forward-slash convention and some of them use a colon convention. I want to go through and fix this, but I want to take some time and make sure I know where all the dependencies are so I don't create too many double-redirects. I also want to go through and make sure that the print version doesnt get all messed up. I won't be touching the LaTeX version or the PDF version or anything. Those can be updated later, if I make too many copyedits.

I really want to help this book out, so let me know if there is anything special that you think I should do while I'm feeling motivated to do it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:48, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Hit counts ==

Teh only thing that I worry about is forcing people to load up an arbitrary amount of proprietary javascript. Making any kind of global change that forces people to load an unspecified amount of javascript (in addition to the mountains of code that some users already have) should be done cautiously. I'm not against google, and I'm not against the idea of getting a page count, but I would like to know what are going to be the performance side-effects, what are going to be the benefits, etc. If we ask people to &quot;opt in&quot; that would be one thing, but if everybody doesnt opt in, then the results would be no better then an alexa ranking. I'm not going to fight against the issue, but i have enough concerns to prevent me from pushing ahead at full speed. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:33, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

:I'm not entirely sure if i've done this correctly. Google analytics says they are &quot;receiving data&quot;, but i wont receive any results until tomorrow. To join in my little test, add this to your javascript:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
//Google analytics script, test run. 
document.write('&lt;script src=&quot;http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;');
document.write('&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;_uacct = &quot;UA-2667267-1&quot;;urchinTracker();&lt;/script&gt;');
&lt;/source&gt;

I just added the code for you. Your personal javascript page is located at [[User:RobinH/monobook.js]]. If you want to delete/modify the code, that is the place to do it.

:No, code added on a book page won't be executed. The only way to get javascript to execute is to put it in your personal file, or to put it into a global file (such as [[MediaWiki:Common.js]]). I want to test the script for performance issues and accuracy issues. Once we test it, we can put the code into the global script so that all users will be running it.
:Hopefully I'll be able to filter out the results to give me per-book results, which would be the most useful.

Foundation members came down hard on my post to the mailing list. Nobody said it was a bad idea, but every body raised the same privacy concerns that darklama mentioned on staff lounge. Even for the case of just unregistered users, using the hit counter violates the privacy policy. There is some amount of hope, however, as my post seemed to get a couple people thinking about an alternative hit-counting mechanism. 

The google analytics thing can stay active, but it's going to be strictly opt-in for registered users only. Nothing we can do about that. We could maybe try and come up with a home-brew page counting solution, but that would be a large effort.

== Can Quantum Mechanics explained by the twin paradox?? ==

Hi RobinH, I know you contributed to the twin paradox in the Special Relativity Book.

I have a theoretical question:
I know that the speed of light can not be reached, but let suppose that we are traveling on a space ship going at the speed of light. At the speed of light time stops. What happens when time stops? Does it mean that we are frozen, unmoved objects for eternity until we slow down, and time start again?

Lets say that we collide to an object in that high speed and our space ship split two halves, each continue going at the speed of light. Because time stopped for us, does it meant the split did not happened for us, we still be in one piece. For the observer however, we are two pieces. But when the observer ask a property of one of our halves, one halves also represent the whole, since the split did not happened for us. 

Is this similar to the twin paradox? 

The reason I am asking, it is not what we see when in Quantum Mechanics, in an accelerator, a particle is split apart and each travel a distance, and when we measure the property of one, the property of the other halves get known instantly, even if they are far away to each other. And It is unknown how could that information be there faster than the speed of light. 
Can it be explained by the twin paradox? 
The particle was split apart for us, but it was still one piece for the particle point of view, when the measurement of the property was made

Hi Ervinn, I have not visited Wikibooks for several years, except occasionally to check on vandalism, so I missed your question.  Particles with rest mass cannot reach the speed of light, although they might reach 0.999999..*c so if the split happened half way through a journey that registered 1 femtosecond on the spacehip's clocks there would still be 0.5 femtosecond either side of the split.  However, there have been numerous attempts to link QM to relativity.  Take a look at [http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_toc.html |The Transactional Interpretation of QM] which is, so far, a theory that has withstood all challenges.

==Postulates of Special Relativity==
Hi RobinH,

Thanks for your response to my comment about the SR postulates, and in particular about the role of symmetry in SR and the clock paradox. I look forward to hearing from you about the invariance of physical laws. Some of my comments were inappropriate and I have removed them. I am a total neophyte in Wikibooks so hope I'm doing it right and you get this OK.[[User:Cosmo|Cosmo]] ([[User talk:Cosmo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cosmo|contribs]]) 22:41, 10 April 2013 (UTC)

I checked your response to my criticism of SR postulates and it seems that you condemn them as &quot;incorrect&quot;. Please provide me with a little more detail of what is wrong. Can you just label it as incorrect and have it removed? Please let me know who makes the judgement call and perhaps we can take this further. Thanks. [[User:Cosmo|Cosmo]] ([[User talk:Cosmo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cosmo|contribs]]) 21:30, 21 May 2013 (UTC)

I may have been a little premature in my comment as I'm not sure what you are referring to as &quot;the amendment&quot;. So I will wait and see what changes you make if any.[[User:Cosmo|Cosmo]] ([[User talk:Cosmo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cosmo|contribs]]) 03:54, 24 May 2013 (UTC)

Hello Robin,

Could you please tell me, the background &amp; where these images originated from, before they were uploaded?

Are they original works by you? If so I don't want them removed, I am just curious as I get a sense of deja vu seeing them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== *Linear recurrence relations revisited* ==
We have already discussed linear recurrence relations in the [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Counting and Generating Functions| Counting and Generating functions]] chapter. We shall study it again using matrices. Consider the Fibonacci numbers
:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
where each number is the sum of two preceding numbers. Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be the (''n'' + 1)th Fibonacci number, we can write:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x_n\\
  x_{n-1}
  \end{pmatrix}
&amp;
  =
&amp;
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}\\
  x_{n-1}
  \end{pmatrix}
\\
\\
&amp;
  =
&amp;
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp;1\\
  1 &amp;0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{n-1}\\
  x_{n-2}
  \end{pmatrix}
\\
\\
&amp;
  =
&amp;
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp;1\\
  1 &amp;0
  \end{pmatrix}^2
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{n-2}\\
  x_{n-3}
  \end{pmatrix}
\\
\\
&amp;...
\\
\\
&amp;
  =
&amp;
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp;1\\
  1 &amp;0
  \end{pmatrix}^{n-1}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{1}\\
  x_{0}
  \end{pmatrix}
\\
\\
&amp;
  =
&amp;
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp;1\\
  1 &amp;0
  \end{pmatrix}^{n-1}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1\\
  1
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
In fact many linear recurrence relations can be expressed in matrix form , e.g.
:&lt;math&gt;x_n = 2x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}; \ \mbox{if n} \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x_n\\
x_{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;1\\
1&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
x_{n-1}\\
x_{n-2}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x_n\\
x_{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;1\\
1&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
^{n-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

So if we knew how to compute the powers of matrices quickly then we can work out the (''n'' + 1)th Fibonacci number rather quickly!

=== Computing Powers Quickly ===
Note that from now on we emphasise if a matrix is a vector by writing an arrow on top of it.

Consider
:&lt;math&gt;
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; -2\\
1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\overrightarrow{x} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\
-1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\overrightarrow{y} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Something interesting happens when you multiply ''A'' by either &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{y}&lt;/math&gt; (''Try it''). In fact
:&lt;math&gt;A\overrightarrow{x} = 2\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;A\overrightarrow{y} = 3\overrightarrow{y}&lt;/math&gt;.

Generally for a matrix ''B'', if a vector ''w'' &amp;ne; ''0'' (the matrix with all entries zero) such that
:&lt;math&gt; B\overrightarrow{ w } = \lambda \overrightarrow{ w }&lt;/math&gt;
for some scalar &amp;lambda;, then &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{ w } &lt;/math&gt; is called a eigenvector of ''B'' and &amp;lambda; the eigenvalue of ''B'' (corresponding to ''w''). 

This is a feature of matrices that be exploited to compute powers easily. Here's how, using ''A'', ''x'' and ''y'' from above, we write the two pieces of information together in matrix form:
:&lt;math&gt;
A\begin{pmatrix}\overrightarrow{x} &amp; \overrightarrow{y}\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\overrightarrow{x} &amp; \overrightarrow{y}\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}2 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
or written completely in numeral form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; -2\\
1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

=

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

you are encouraged to check the above is correct. What we did was we merged &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{y}&lt;/math&gt; into a matrix using each vector as a column, next we multiplied it by the diagonal matrix whose entries are the ''eigenvalue'' of each ''eigenvector'' correspondingly.

How to now exploit this matrix form to calculate powers of ''A'' quickly? We require a simple but ingenius step -- post-multiply (i.e. multiply from the right) both sides by the inverse of 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; -2\\
1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}2 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now to calculate ''A''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, we need only to do
:&lt;math&gt;A^n = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; -2\\
1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}^n
=
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}2 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}

...

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}2 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}

&lt;/math&gt;

but inverses multiply to give ''I'', so we are left with
:&lt;math&gt;A^n = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; -2\\
1 &amp; 4
\end{pmatrix}^n
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}2 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}^n

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is very easy to compute since powers of a diagonal matrix are easy to compute (just take each entry to the power).

====Example 1====
Compute ''A''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; where ''A'' is given above.

'''Solution'''
We do 
:&lt;math&gt;
A^5 = 

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}2 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}^5

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
A^5 = 

\begin{pmatrix}
2  &amp; -1\\
-1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}2^5 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 3^5\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
1  &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
A^5 = 

\begin{pmatrix}
2^6-3^5  &amp; 2^6-2\times 3^5\\
-2^5+3^5 &amp; -2^5 + 2\times 3^5
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 2====
Let 
:&lt;math&gt;B = \begin{pmatrix}
-13  &amp; 28\\
-8 &amp; 17
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and its eigenvectors are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
2\\  
1 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
7\\  
4 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Calculate ''B''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; directly (optional), and again using the method above.

''' Solution '''
We need to first determine its eigenvalues. We do
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
-13  &amp; 28\\
-8 &amp; 17
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2\\  
1 
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
2\\  
1 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
so the eigenvalue corresponding to
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
2\\  
1 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is 1.

Similarly,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
-13  &amp; 28\\
-8 &amp; 17
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
7\\  
4 
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
21\\  
12 
\end{pmatrix} =
3\begin{pmatrix}
7\\  
4 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
so the other eigenvalue is 3.

Now we write them in the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
-13  &amp; 28\\
-8 &amp; 17
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 7\\  
1 &amp; 4 
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 7\\  
1 &amp; 4 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0\\  
0 &amp; 3 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
now make ''B'' the subject
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
-13  &amp; 28\\
-8 &amp; 17
\end{pmatrix}
 = 
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 7\\  
1 &amp; 4 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0\\  
0 &amp; 3 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
4 &amp; -7\\  
-1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
-13  &amp; 28\\
-8 &amp; 17
\end{pmatrix}^5
 = 
\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 7\\  
1 &amp; 4 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1^5 &amp; 0\\  
0 &amp; 3^5 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
4 &amp; -7\\  
-1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:so multiplying the right hand side out, we get
&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
-13  &amp; 28\\
-8 &amp; 17
\end{pmatrix}^5
 = 
\begin{pmatrix}
8-7\times 3^5 &amp; 14(3^5-1)\\  
4(3^5-1) &amp; -7+8\times 3^5
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Eigenvector and eigenvalue ===
We know from the above section that for a matrix if we are given its eigenvectors, we can find the corresponding eigenvalues, and then we can compute its powers quickly. So the last hurdle becomes finding the eigenvectors.

An eigenvectors &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; of a matrix ''A'' and its corresponding eigenvalue &amp;lambda; are related by the following expression:
:&lt;math&gt;A\overrightarrow{x} = \lambda \overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt;
where x &amp;ne; ''0'' where ''0'' is the zero matrix (all entries zero). We can safely assume that ''A'' is given so there are two unknowns -- &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &amp;lambda;. We have enough information now to be able to work out the eigenvalues (and from that the eigenvectors):

:&lt;math&gt;A\overrightarrow{x} - \lambda \overrightarrow{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\overrightarrow{x} - \lambda I \overrightarrow{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A - \lambda I) \overrightarrow{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
The matrix (''A'' - &amp;lambda;''I'') must ''NOT'' have an inverse, because if it does then &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; = ''0''. Therefore det(''A'' - &amp;lambda;''I'') = 0.
Suppose
:&lt;math&gt;
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;b\\
c&amp;d
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;
A-\lambda I = 
\begin{pmatrix}
a - \lambda&amp;b\\
c&amp;d - \lambda
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
0 = \det(A-\lambda I) = (a - \lambda)(d - \lambda) - bc
&lt;/math&gt;

Now we see det(A-&amp;lambda;I) is a polynomial in &amp;lambda; and det(''A''-&amp;lambda;''I'') = 0. We are already well-trained in solving quadratics, so it's easy to work out the values of &amp;lambda;. Once we've worked out the values of &amp;lambda;, we can work out &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; (see examples).

==== Example 1 ====
Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
:&lt;math&gt;A =
\begin{pmatrix}
-4&amp;15\\
-2&amp;7
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and then find ''D'' and ''P'' such that ''A'' = ''P''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;''DP''.

'''Solution'''

We aim to find &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &amp;lambda; such that
:A&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt; = &amp;lambda;&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x}&lt;/math&gt;
we proceed
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
-4&amp;15\\
-2&amp;7
\end{pmatrix}
\overrightarrow{x} = \lambda \overrightarrow{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
-4 - \lambda &amp;15\\
-2&amp;7 - \lambda
\end{pmatrix}
\overrightarrow{x} = 0
&lt;/math&gt; (**)

:det(''A'' - &amp;lambda;''I'') =
:0 = (-4 - &amp;lambda;)(7 - &amp;lambda;) + 30
:0 = -28 - 3&amp;lambda; + &amp;lambda;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 30
:0 = &amp;lambda;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 3&amp;lambda; +  2
:0 = (&amp;lambda; - 1)(&amp;lambda; - 2)
:&amp;lambda; = 1, 2

Now for each eigenvalue we will get a different corresponding eigenvector. So we consider the case &amp;lambda; = 1 and  &amp;lambda; = 2 separately.

Consider first &amp;lambda; = 1, from (**) we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
-4 - 1 &amp;15\\
-2&amp;7 - 1
\end{pmatrix}
x = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
-5&amp;15\\
-2&amp; 6
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
u\\
v
\end{pmatrix}
= 0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x = 
\begin{pmatrix}
u\\
v
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
since det(''A'' - &amp;lambda;''I'') = 0, we know that there is no ''unique'' solution to the above equation. But we note that:
:&lt;math&gt;x = 
\begin{pmatrix}
3t\\
1t
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
for any real number ''t'' is a solution, and we choose ''t'' = 1 as our solution because it's the simpliest. Therefore 
:&lt;math&gt;x = 
\begin{pmatrix}
3\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is the eigenvector corresponding to &amp;lambda; = 1. (***)

Similarly, if &amp;lambda; = 2, from (**) we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
-4 - 2 &amp;15\\
-2&amp;7 - 2
\end{pmatrix}
x = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
-6&amp;15\\
-2&amp; 5
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
u\\
v
\end{pmatrix}
= 0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x = 
\begin{pmatrix}
u\\
v
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
we note that:
:&lt;math&gt;x = 
\begin{pmatrix}
5t\\
2t
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
for any real number ''t'' is a solution, as before we choose ''t'' = 1 as our solution. Therefore 
:&lt;math&gt;x = 
\begin{pmatrix}
5\\
2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; is the eigenvector corresponding to &amp;lambda; = 2. (****)

We summarise the result of (***) and (****), we have
:&lt;math&gt; 
A
\begin{pmatrix}
3\\
1
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
3\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; 
A
\begin{pmatrix}
5\\
2
\end{pmatrix} = 2
\begin{pmatrix}
5\\
2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 

we combine the results into one
:&lt;math&gt; 
A
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;5\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;5\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0\\
0&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 
and so
:&lt;math&gt; 
A
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;5\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0\\
0&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;5\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 2 ====
:a) Diagonalize ''A'', i.e find ''P'' (invertible) and ''B'' (diagonal) such that ''AP'' = ''PB''
:b) Compute ''A''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2\\
-1&amp;4
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''a) We are solving ''Ax'' = &amp;lambda;''x'', where &amp;lambda; is a constant and ''x''' a column vector.
Firstly
:&lt;math&gt;Ax - \lambda Ix = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A - \lambda I)x = 0&lt;/math&gt;
since '''x''' &amp;ne; 0 we have
:&lt;math&gt;det(A - \lambda I) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;
\det\begin{pmatrix}
1-\lambda&amp;2\\
-1&amp;4-\lambda
\end{pmatrix}
= 0
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(1-\lambda)(4-\lambda) + 2 &amp;=&amp; 0\\
\lambda^2-5\lambda + 6     &amp;=&amp; 0
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = 3,\ 2&lt;/math&gt;

For &amp;lambda; = 3, 
:&lt;math&gt;(A-3I)x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{pmatrix}
  -2&amp;2\\
  -1&amp;1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x\\
  y
  \end{pmatrix}
  = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a solution. Note that we do not accept ''x'' = 0 as an solution, because we assume ''x'' &amp;ne; 0. Note also that 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
t\\
t
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
for some constant ''t'' is also a solution. Indeed we could use ''x'' = ''y'' = 2, 3 or 4 as a solution, but for convenience we choose the simplest i.e. ''x'' = ''y'' = 1.

For &amp;lambda; = 2, 
:&lt;math&gt;(A-2I)x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{pmatrix}
  -1&amp;2\\
  -1&amp;2
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x\\
  y
  \end{pmatrix}
  = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
2\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a solution.

Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;
A
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;0\\
0&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a solution and 
:&lt;math&gt;
A
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;1\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;1\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;0\\
0&amp;3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is also a solution.

:b)
:&lt;math&gt;
A^5 = \begin{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;1\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;0\\
0&amp;3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;1\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1} \end{pmatrix} ^5
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
A^5 =
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;1\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;0\\
0&amp;3
\end{pmatrix}^5
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;1\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
A^5 =
\begin{pmatrix}

1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2^5&amp;0\\
0&amp;3^5
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;-1\\
-1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
A^5 =
\begin{pmatrix}
2^6-3^5&amp;2^6-2\times 3^5\\
2^5-3^5&amp;-2^5+2\times 3^5
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 3 ====
Solve the linear recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x_n &amp;=&amp; 5x_{n-1}&amp; -&amp; 6x_{n-2}; \ \mbox{if n} \ge 2\\
x_1 &amp;=&amp; 1\\
x_0 &amp;=&amp; 0\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x_n\\
x_{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
5&amp;-6\\
1&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}^{n-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We need to diagonalize 
:&lt;math&gt;
A = \begin{pmatrix}
5&amp;-6\\
1&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
we proceed:
:&lt;math&gt;\det{(A - \lambda I)} = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
we get
:&amp;lambda; = 2, 3

For &amp;lambda; = 2
:&lt;math&gt;(A - 2I)x = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x=
\begin{pmatrix}
2\\
1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

For &amp;lambda; = 3
:&lt;math&gt;(A - 3I)x = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x=
\begin{pmatrix}
3\\
1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;A =
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;3\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;0\\
0&amp;3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;3\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now
:&lt;math&gt;A^{n-1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;3\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;0\\
0&amp;3
\end{pmatrix}^{n-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
-1&amp;3\\
1&amp;-2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A^{n-1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;3\\
1&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
2^{n-1}&amp;0\\
0&amp;3^{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
-1&amp;3\\
1&amp;-2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^{n-1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
-2^n+3^n&amp;3\times 2^n-2\times 3^n\\
-2^{n-1}+3^{n-1}&amp;3\times 2^{n-1}-2\times 3^{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x_n\\
x_{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-2^n+3^n&amp;3\times 2^n-2\times 3^n\\
-2^{n-1}+3^{n-1}&amp;3\times 2^{n-1}-2\times 3^{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x_n\\
x_{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-2^n+3^n\\
-2^{n-1}+3^{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
i.e
:&lt;math&gt;x_n = -2^n + 3^n \!&lt;/math&gt;

2. A 2 by 2 matrix '''''A''''' has the following property
:&lt;math&gt;A\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Project -- Elementary matrices ==
Throughout,
&lt;math&gt; A = \begin{pmatrix}a &amp; b\\ c &amp; d\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

1. The matrices below are called ''elementary matrices''. How are the matrices below different from the identity matrix ''I'', describe each one. 
* &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; f \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; where f is a scalar
* &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ f &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; where f is a scalar
* &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} f &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; where f is a scalar
* &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; f \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; where f is a scalar

2. In each of the cases, compute '''B''' then describe how is '''B''' different from '''A'''
* &lt;math&gt;B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}A&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; f \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}A&lt;/math&gt; where f is a scalar
* &lt;math&gt;B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ f &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}A&lt;/math&gt; where f is a scalar
* &lt;math&gt;B = \begin{pmatrix} f &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}A&lt;/math&gt; where f is a scalar
* &lt;math&gt;B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; f \end{pmatrix}A&lt;/math&gt; where f is a scalar

3. The matrix &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2\\4 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; has determinant not equal to zero. We can ''decompose'' the matrix into products of elementary matrices pre-multiplying the identity:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2\\4 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\1 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 3\\0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\1 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 5\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; -3\\0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Now suppose det('''''A''''') &amp;ne; 0, can '''''A''''' be expressed as the product of elementary matrices and the identity?

4. 
a) Show that every elementary matrix has an inverse. Hint: use determinant.

b) Prove that every invertible matrix (a matrix that has an inverse) is the product of some elementary matrices pre-multiplying the identity.

5.
A ''transpose'' of a matrix '''''C''''' is the matrix '''''C'''''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; where the ''i''th row of '''''C''''' is the ''i''th column of '''''C'''''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.
Prove using elementary matrices that
:&lt;math&gt;(DE)^T = E^TD^T&lt;/math&gt;
for arbitrary matrices '''''D''''' and '''''E'''''.

6. Show that every invertible matrix is also the product of some elementary matrices '''post'''-multiplying the identity.

7. How about non-invertible matrices? What can you say about them?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the fascinating and often rewarding world of PlayStation Portable Programming. This set of Learning Modules will provide you with the basic knowledge necessary to apprehend, acquire, install, and configure a PlayStation Portable Programming Laboratory from which all sorts of useful and entertaining tools, utilities, programs, games, and other forms of interactive media can be produced by you. I hope that this learning experience is both enjoyable and enlightening for you.

For new PSP programmers, try Python: It's a good place to start. However, the recommended language for PSP homebrew is C, since the firmware, homebrew, and most games use C as their native language, and it allows deeper memory management (which, given that you have only 32MB/64MB available, you really need to do it).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A short introduction as to the subject of this wikibook.

=== The PSP ===
Sony's PSP (official acronym for PlayStation Portable) is a powerful handheld console. To read more about the hardware capabilities of the PSP, you should go to the [[PSP Programming/Hardware Description|next page]].

=== Homebrew ===
Homebrew are applications which run on a system that wasn't designed to let the user program for it. What this means is that even though Sony did not plan to let users develop applications for the PSP, some people managed to find a way around which led to a toolchain which anybody can use to program for the PSP.

=== Why program on the PSP ===
There are several reasons a person might want to program for the PSP. First of all, the PSP is a handheld multimedia system, not just designed for games. Another reason is because it has been homebrew capable for quite a while, and thus has quite a community following because of that. Yet another reason, is because one might want to expand their knowledge to other platforms which might have their own limitations which the developer must program around.

=== Requirements ===
In order to program for the PSP you will of course '''need a PSP'''. How else would you look at your progress? Your PSP should also be homebrew capable, and you will also need to have a memory card from which you can run your programs. Aside from the material possessions which you will need, you also need to have acquired some knowledge of general programming in the 'C' language. Although this wikibook won't assume you are an expert in 'C' or 'C++', it won't go out of its way to explain to you the fundamentals of programming.

= Open Sicilian =
Black captures White's d-pawn with cxd4 to reduce White's control of the centre, expecting the pawn to be recaptured. White usually plays [[/4. Nxd4/]] so that the knight may subsequently move to b3 to assist in the defence of his king following queenside castling. A knight on d4 also eyes the f5 square and once the king is safe on the queenside can support the advance of a barrage of pawns at Blacks castled position. After [[/4. Qxd4/]] the White queen, while nicely centralised, is liable to be kicked around by Black and forced to retreat while the f3 knight is blocking the f-pawn from advancing to support a kingside attack. Provided Black avoids a transposition to the Rossolimo variation, White can have trouble activating his kings bishop after Qxd4. In general, though Qxd4 is solid enough, Nxd4 injects more life into the position, which 1.e4 players tend to be happy about. 

Also in keeping with the position is the gambit [[/4. c3/]], usually transposing into the Morra Gambit. White obtains a lead in development and aims to fully open the c-file to counter Black's influence thereof.

      <comment>/* Shooting Slow Motion */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Slow motion is the process of remapping time in film. Slow motion is generally used in dramatic or action scenes in Movies or Science and Nature shows on TV.

==The Thinking==
No matter whether you are shooting slow motion or faking slow motion, some mathematics is first required to calculate the frame rate needed. First, you need to choose the frame rate you are displaying in. For this example, we will choose 25fps. Then you want to to estimate the time of the event, and the time you want the event to be displayed for. 

For example:
* Projection rate is 25fps.
* Event is 5 seconds long.
* Event will be on screen for 20 seconds.
Then,


&lt;math&gt;\frac{Screen Time}{Event Length}*Projection Rate=Shooting Frame Rate&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this in, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{20}{5}*25=100 fps&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that the frame rate we need to shoot at to meet our requirements is ''100 FPS'''. From this, the footage can be slowed down, slow motion is achieved.

This equation can also be used for calculating the interval between frames when shooting a time lapse.

==Shooting Slow Motion==
Shooting slow motion is generally the easiest method to accomplishing slow motion as little to no processing work is needed, however, this is usually the most expensive. Expensive cameras are generally required to shoot higher frame rates as cheaper consumer cameras do not have this capability. Film is still a common option for some as it doesn't require large memory cards however film needs to be reloaded. Some of these digital cameras include;
* Arri Alexa &amp; Amira (200fps @ 2K)
* Red Epic (Up to 300fps @ 2K)
* Vision Research Phantom (Up to 1,052fps @ 1920x1080 OR 4,410fps @ 256x256)
* Slit Camera (Up to 1 trillion fps)

Light is another problem when shooting Ultra Slow Motion as higher shutter speeds are needed. If shooting at 1000fps, a minimum shutter speed would have to be 1/1000th, however 1/2000th is more ideal. For this reason, expensive lighting may be needed to light a scene. Ordinary house lights are not advised as the refresh rates may cause flickering during a video, A diffuser can lessen this effect, but a constant source like sunlight is preferred.

Don't be tricked into thinking higher frame rates are better, if the resolution of each frame is four megapixels at record rates of 1000 frames per second, after one second, you wil have 300mb+ and 40 seconds of data for a lossy compression. For this reason, larger and faster recording devices are needed which cost more money. This is extremely important when shooting at higher resolutions, larger colour spaces and faster frame rates. This is another reason why film is preferred when shooting slow motion. 

'''NB: A slit camera is an expensive piece of science equipment used for medical imaging but has recently been modified to capture photons. For this reason, it is impracticable for movies.'''

==Interpolation==
Interpolation is the process of letting the computer draw in extra frames to smooth out video footage. Interpolation has other uses other than slow motion, these include Matrix Bullet Time, animations and can help remove drop frames.

When preparing to interpolate footage, it is helpful to remove motion blur by using higher shutter speeds and provide contrast between the background and subject. This means to film against plain backgrounds rather than complex patterns. 

Even though you might follow all of these steps, warping may still appear, which can wreck your footage however if it does work, it is a cheap way to create that slow motion effect.

Software that supports Interpolation;
* Twixtor (Plugin)
* After Effects (Frame blending)

==Fake Slow Motion==

Fake Slow motion is the acting slow instead of actually filming in slow motion. This cuts out a lot of movements that can be accomplished through slow motion like jumping, but it is the cheapest way to get a slow motion effect with no budget. Avoid shooting with naturally moving objects such as fans, trees or near a road, these can ruin the effect and make your footage look amatuerish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Example method description using dChip'''

Array normalization, expression value calculation and clustering analysis were performed using DNA-Chip Analyzer (www.dchip.org; Li &amp; Wong 2001a). The Invariant Set Normalization method (Li &amp; Wong 2001b) was used to normalize arrays at probe cell level to make them comparable, and the model-based method (Li &amp; Wong 2001b) was used for probe-selection and computing expression values. These expression levels were attached with standard errors as measurement accuracy, which were subsequently used to compute 90% confidence intervals of fold changes in two-sample or two-group comparisons (Li &amp; Wong 2001b). The lower confidence bounds of fold changes were conservative estimate of the real fold changes. Genes with increased or decreased expression after treatments by more than 2 fold (lower confidence bound) were selected for further study.

Hierarchical clustering analysis (Eisen et al. 1998) is used to group genes with same expression pattern. A genes is selected for clustering if (1) its expression values in the 20 samples has coefficient of variation (standard deviation / mean) between 0.5 to 10 (2) it is called “Present” by MAS5 (or GCOS or dChip) software in more than 5 samples. Then the expression values for a gene across the 20 samples are standardized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 by linear transformation, and the distance between two genes is defined as 1 - r where r is the standard correlation coefficient between the 20 standardize values of two genes. Two genes with the closest distance are first merged into a super-gene and connected by branches with length representing their distance, and are deleted for future merging. The expression level of the newly formed super-gene is the average of standardized expression levels of the two genes (average-linkage) for each sample. Then the next pair of genes (super-genes) with the smallest distance are chosen to merge and the process is repeated until all genes are merged into one cluster. The dendrogram in Figure ? illustrates the final clustering tree, where genes close to each other have high similarity in their standardized expression values across the 20 samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Designing microarray experiments'''


'''Randomize samples'''

 

To minimize experimental variation, it is desirable to have the same person perform all the experiments in the same microarray core facility. However if an experiment involves many samples we have to do them on different days. Arrays generated at different days may have “batch difference”, since different reagents are used to amplify and label the samples. This may be detected by unsupervised clustering. Although “Array list file” can be used to alleviate the situation, it is better to consider such effects before doing experiment. For example, if an experiment compares two conditions with multiple samples in each condition, it is less desirable to have all samples of condition A amplified and hybridized in one day, and all samples of condition B done in another day. In such case even if batch effects happen, we cannot tell since they are mixed with real biological variations that we are interested in. Thus it is more reasonable to consider a balanced design where samples of all conditions are randomly distributed into different sample amplification and hybridization days. 

 
'''Replicate samples'''

 

Another way to reduce the experimental variation is to have replicate samples. If variations are introduced in an unbiased manner in the experimental or analysis steps after the replication point, averaging the final expression values can better estimate the “expression level” at the replication point (variance of the average is inversely proportional to the number of replicates). Replicates can be done from early point to late point following this rough scale: different individuals (cell line strains), independently grown cell lines (pure strain animals), different tissue sample from the same individual, split tissue samples, split mRNA, split IVT, and scanning one array multiple times. We have observed that replicates at split-IVT level usually agree well in terms of expression values and cluster very tightly. Therefore such replications may not help us to better estimate and reduce the variation introduced before the IVT-splitting point.

 

The practical choice of the point of replication should suit experimental purpose. For example, when an investigator only has very small amount of RNA, the choices are using double-round amplification (which may have 5' bias) or pooling RNA from different animals in the same litter. Pooling more samples is good as long as the gene expression variation among the pooled animals is expected to be smaller than the gene expression difference among the studied biological conditions, but this choice may be more expensive. Even when the sample amount is enough, the choice exists between whether to process the sample of each animal and hybridize it to a different array, or pool the sample of different animals first and then split the pooled samples into several aliquots, and do IVT and hybridization separately into replicate arrays. This situation is more complex and the answer is probably dependent on specific experiment (the number of replicates, what point to replicate and pool, and the variation of genes at these points).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Classify genes by annotation terms'''

 

After a list of genes is obtained by “Compare samples” or “Filter genes”, we can use the “Tools/Classify Genes” dialog to classify these genes into different groups according to GeneOntology or other annotational terms. Gene groups have header lines such as “Found 15 GeneOntology 'response to external stimulus' genes in a 120-group (all: 1068/7734, PValue: 0.661181)”. The p-values are calculated in the same way as for the significant gene clusters. Here 120 is the number of genes having GeneOntology annotation in the input gene list, thus may be fewer than the actual number of genes in the list. Note that at &quot;Tools/Classify genes&quot;, the whole gene list is considered to assess the significant enrichment; while at clustering, every gene clusters with at least 4 annotated genes is considered. Thus the former gives fewer significant gene groups than the latter. 

 

Significant p-values as defined in the “Tools/Options/Clustering” dialog are suffixed by stars (“***”) in the output file. Also one may check the “Only report significant results” box to output only gene groups with significant p-values. The additional data columns such as expression values or fold changes of the “gene list file” will be copied into the output “classified file”. 

 

To prevent multiple probe sets for the same gene from biasing the result of the functional significance computation, it is best to check “Analysis/Open group/Options/Analysis/Mask redundant probe sets” to exclude the redundant probe sets (identified by LocusLink ID) from a gene list. This can also be done at “Tools/Options/Analysis/Mask redundant probe sets”, but redoing “Analysis/Open group” is desired since the array background information on gene annotation is computed after reading in the “gene information file”.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== An introduction to excitable media ==

Excitable media are nonlinear dynamic systems known for exhibiting complex behavior that can be observed as pattern formation. They are usually defined by a ''reaction-diffusion differential equation''.

:&lt;math&gt; u_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D \nabla^2 u(\mathbf{r},t) + f(u(\mathbf{r},t)) &lt;/math&gt;

The diffusion part provides stability and propagation of information, the reactive part provides interesting local dynamics.

A common example of excitable media are prey-predator systems. Such systems are described by a system of differential equations, one function for each of the observed protagonists.

:&lt;math&gt; u_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D_u \nabla^2 u(\mathbf{r},t) + f(u,v) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D_v \nabla^2 v(\mathbf{r},t) + g(u,v) &lt;/math&gt;

We will discuss two different approaches to modeling excitable media. Discretization of differential equations and modeling with cellular automata.

=== Boundary conditions ===

There are different ways to define boundary conditions for the reaction-diffusion equation.

;Dirichlet boundary conditions
The value of the function at the boundary is given explicitly &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{r_0},t)&lt;/math&gt;.

;Cyclic boundaries
If the initial condition &lt;math&gt;u(x,0)&lt;/math&gt; is supposed to be periodic in space, cyclic boundary conditions can be used.

;Zero-flux boundary conditions
If zero-flux is expected at the boundary than the component of the functions first derivative normal to the boundary is zero &lt;math&gt; \vec{n}\cdot \nabla{u}=0 &lt;/math&gt; at the boundary. This can be achieved by reflecting function values from the inside over the boundary to the outside.

== Discretization of differential equations using the explicit FTCS method ==

The traditional method to simulate excitable media is discretization and numerical computation of the governing PDE. First the FTCS (forward-time centered-space method) discretization method is presented. Explicit methods are the simplest and the equations are similar to a cellular automaton, but are inadequate because of stability and convergence problems.

=== Single PDE ===

We will first observe a single PDE describing a single function.

:&lt;math&gt; u_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D \nabla^2 u(\mathbf{r},t) + f(u(\mathbf{r},t)) &lt;/math&gt;

==== One-dimensional problem ====

In the one dimensional case the space vector becomes a single variable &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=x&lt;/math&gt;. The nabla operator becomes &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial{x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{ \partial u(x,t) }{ \partial t } = D \frac{ \partial^2 u(x,t) }{ \partial x^2 }  + f(u(x,t)) &lt;/math&gt;

The partial differential equation is discretized.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{ u(x,t+\Delta{t}) - u(x,t) }{ \Delta{t} } = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad D \frac{ u(x+\Delta{x},t)-2u(x,t)+u(x-\Delta{x},t) }{ \Delta{x}^2 } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad + f(u(x,t)) &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata PDE FTCS 1D.png|thumb|300px|right|Forward-time centered-space method]]

Each finite element at time &lt;math&gt;t+\Delta{t}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from three neighboring elements at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (see figure at the right).

:&lt;math&gt; u(x,t+\Delta{t}) = u(x,t) + \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad + d( u(x+\Delta x,t)-2u(x,t)+u(x-\Delta x,t) ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad + \Delta{t} f(u(x,t)) &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''diffusion number'' is

:&lt;math&gt; d =  D \frac{ \Delta{t} }{ \Delta{x}^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

;Stability

The FTCS method is stable if

:&lt;math&gt; d \leq 1/2 &lt;/math&gt;

;Boundary conditions

For periodic boundaries present values at the left boundary &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; can be used to compute the future values at the right boundary &lt;math&gt;x=L_x&lt;/math&gt; and the other way round.

:&lt;math&gt; u(0,t+\Delta{t}) = u(0,t) + d( u(0+\Delta x,t)-2u(0,t)+u(L_x,t) ) + \Delta{t} f(u(0,t)) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; u(L_x,t+\Delta{t}) = u(L_x,t) + d( u(0,t)-2u(L_x,t)+u(L_x-\Delta x,t) ) + \Delta{t} f(u(L_x,t)) \, &lt;/math&gt;

If there is zero-flux &lt;math&gt;\nabla u(0,t)=0&lt;/math&gt; at the boundaries than values outside the boundary are reflections of values inside &lt;math&gt;u(0+\Delta x,t)=u(0-\Delta x,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; u(0,t+\Delta{t}) = u(0,t) + 2d( u(0+\Delta x,t)-u(0,t) ) + \Delta{t} f(u(0,t)) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; u(L_x,t+\Delta{t}) = u(L_x,t) + 2d( u(L_x,t)+u(L_x-\Delta x,t) ) + \Delta{t} f(u(L_x,t)) \, &lt;/math&gt;

==== Two-dimensional problem ====

In the two-dimensional case, the space vector becomes a variable pair &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=[x,y]&lt;/math&gt;. The nabla operator becomes &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial{x^2}}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial{y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{ \partial u(x,y,t) }{ \partial t } = D \left( \frac{ \partial^2 u(x,y,t) }{ \partial x^2 } + \frac{ \partial^2 u(x,y,t) }{ \partial y^2 } \right) + f(u(x,y,t)) &lt;/math&gt;

The partial differential equation is discretized using the ''forward-time centered-space method''.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ u(x,y,t+\Delta{t}) - u(x,y,t) }{ \Delta{t} } = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad = D \frac{ u(x+\Delta{x},y,t)-2u(x,y,t)+u(x-\Delta{x},y,t) }{ \Delta{x}^2 } + &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad + D \frac{ u(x,y+\Delta{y},t)-2u(x,y,t)+u(x,y-\Delta{y},t) }{ \Delta{y}^2 } + &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad + f(u(x,y,t)) &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:cellular automata PDE FTCS 2D.png|thumb|300px|right|Forward-time centered-space method]]

Each finite element at time &lt;math&gt;t+\Delta{t}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from five neighboring elements at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (see figure at the right).

:&lt;math&gt; u(x,y,t+\Delta{t}) = u(x,t) + \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad + d_x( u(x+\Delta{x},y,t)-2u(x,y,t)+u(x-\Delta{x},y,t) ) + &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad + d_y( u(x,y+\Delta{y},t)-2u(x,y,t)+u(x,y-\Delta{y},t) ) + &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad + \Delta{t} f(u(x,y,t)) &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''diffusion numbers'' are

:&lt;math&gt; d_x=D\frac{\Delta{t}}{\Delta{x}^2} \quad d_y=D\frac{\Delta{t}}{\Delta{y}^2} &lt;/math&gt;

;Stability

The FTCS method is stable if

:&lt;math&gt; d_x \leq 1/2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; d_y \leq 1/2 &lt;/math&gt;

;Boundary conditions

The same ideas as in the one dimensional case can be used for two dimensions.

=== System of PDE ===

A system of PDE describes two functions that interact with each other (prey-predator).

:&lt;math&gt; u_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D_u \nabla^2 u(\mathbf{r},t) + f(u,v) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D_v \nabla^2 v(\mathbf{r},t) + g(u,v) &lt;/math&gt;

The interaction is local, which means, the dispersion part can be computed separately for each equation, and than the reaction part is added to the result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Monster ==

=== Building The Monster ===

The mad scientists at SONY have done it again.  They have created a whole new niche within the economy.  A new breed of educated professional consumer--''the Prosumer''--has been invented.  Prosumers are Tech Savy and know what bells and whistles they need and want on their personal hardware.  They also work hard and play hard.  They are on the go most of the time, and so they need a personal entertainment device which can go with them.  Hence the invention of the PSP.  

==== Giving The Monster A Face ====

PSP is the shorthand for SONY PSP which is the shortened version of the registered, trademarked, copyrighted, and licensed SONY product known as the PlayStation Portable.  The PlayStation Portable is a cool little handheld personal entertainment device.  With a PSP, the user can enjoy movies, music, games, slide shows, and even web browsing and live chat experiences.  At around $200.00 per unit, the PSP is a fairly affordable piece of personal hardware.  
The device currently comes in three flavors, Glossy Black, Bright White and Barbie Pink.  The first two flavors are equally attractive to users, and the third is on 'special offer'.

==== Giving The Monster A Body ====

The PlayStation Portable uses UMD formatted Micro DVD storage media.  It also has a Memory Stick Slot that accepts Memory Stick DUO storage media.  The PSP has a USB interface and a WLAN node.  The PSP has an integrated [[w:Liquid crystal display|LCD]] viewscreen.  The viewscreen is 4.3&quot; in size and has a 480X272 pixel resolution.  It also has two small speakers and a stereo headphone jack.  The stereo headphone jack which comes with a PSP is specially designed to interface as a remote control for audio and video playback on the unit.  

The PlayStation Portable uses an optical media disk with a 60 mm diameter.  This [[w:Universal Media Disc|UMD]] is capable of storing up to 1.8 [[wiktionary:gigabyte|GB]] of data or 80 to 140 minutes of audiovideo.  

The Sony Memory Stick DUO and SanDisk Memory Stick Media currently range in storage capacity from 32 [[wiktionary:megabyte|MB]] to 32.0 [[wiktionary:gigabyte|GB]].  There will probably be large increases in the mass storage capacity of these little sticks in the near future.

==== Giving The Monster A Heart ====

The PlayStation Portable uses a MIPS R4000 Core which consists of an integrated [[wiktionary:Central Processing Unit | CPU]] and [[wiktionary:Floating Point Unit | FPU]] and Coprocessing [[wiktionary:Vector Processing Unit | Vector Unit]]. The [[wiktionary:coprocessor | Coprocessor]] assists with complex vector and matrix math operations.  The entire core unit is called by the name of Allegrex CPU.  The CPU clock can be throttled from 1 [[wiktionary:megahertz | MHz]] to 333 MHz, but 222 MHz is the SONY Mandated limit for software flow, to ensure smooth running of programs created by Developers.  This 222 MHz limit also ensures expanded battery pack life which means longer lasting user experience per single battery pack charge up.  

The PSP also contains a dedicated [[wiktionary:Media Processing Unit | MPU]] chip.  The Media Processing Unit is capable of decoding MP3, ATRAC3, and h.264 signal files, allowing robust hardware side audio stereo pseudo surround sound capability.  The PSP uses a dedicated [[wiktionary:Graphic Processing Unit | GPU]] chip to produce lighting, skinning, subdivision, pixel operations, and additional graphic display functions.  

There are 2 MB of [[wiktionary:Video Ram | Video RAM]] on board the PlayStation Portable.  The PlayStation Portable comes equipped with 32 MB of general RAM as well.  The 32 MB [[wiktionary:RAM | RAM]] is divided up into 8 MB of [[wiktionary:KERNEL Space | KERNEL Space]], and 24 MB of [[wiktionary:Application Space | Application Space]].

==== Giving The Monster A Mind ====

Game, Video, Emulator, or Application programs may be loaded into the 24 MB Application Space RAM.  Special [[wiktionary:Operating System | OS]] Calls and KERNEL Configuration information may be loaded into the KERNEL Space at start up of a particular game, video, emulator, or application program, but in general this is a discouraged behavior.  Manipulating KERNEL Space has accounted for many pieces of hardware becoming big boat anchors.  Why take a chance with your own hardware?  Leave the KERNEL Space alone as much as possible.  

=== Training The Monster ===

Based on the information provided in this module, you have learned that the PlayStation Portable is one of SONY Corporation's jewels.  It shines as a very useable little toy which has some serious workplace potential.  All we have to do is tame this beast and it will begin to do what ''we'' want it to do.  That is the whole idea behind the PSP Development Culture.  

I am glad that you have joined me in working toward making the PSP the best darned little &lt;strike&gt;toy&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;tool&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;video game console&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;DVD player&lt;/strike&gt; ''''''THINGIE'''''' in the world.

Have a tremendous amount of fun!

This page doesn't give a complete information.  It only describe some notation of some move, but that isn't enougth to be able to note all the move of a game.  It is also confusing by presenting to different notation in a incomplete matter.  You should at least add the notation of move where to piece can go to the same place and the switch of king and rook.

----

I am editing the page to note in the move 30. by white the convention for notating &quot;check&quot;, since that is a checking move.  I am also noting that capture in algebraic notation is sometimes denoted with a colon. --[[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 17:15, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

The term cordinate notation can be confusing.  I propose it be changed to long-algebraic notation. What is now algebraic notation can be called short-algebraic notaion.--[[User:Tm chk|Tm chk]] 01:35, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

== ICCF Notation
One variant of this for internal chess engine use numbers the squares from 1 thru 71 skipping multiples of 9 so that the bishops' squares end up odd/even.--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] 19:44, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

== En passant notation ==

The page says that &quot;e.p.&quot; denotes an en passant capture ''if there is ambiguity''.  Does this mean that an en passant capture is usually recorded in the same way as a simple capture? [[User:142.161.73.123|142.161.73.123]] 21:20, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, it does.  Read the text. --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:07, 12 January 2011 (UTC)

== ICCF Notation ==

How exactly are castling, check, and checkmate recorded in ICCF numerical notation?  Examples please. --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:12, 12 January 2011 (UTC)

: ICCF numeric notation does not give them any significants. The start and end positions are simply recorded. ICCF only gives significants to pawn promotion in which a 5th digit is added which indicates the rank to which the pawn is promoted. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:00, 12 January 2011 (UTC)

::(editconflict with Darklama) Yep, that's what I was going to say. Check and checkmate symbols are not essential to recording a move, and usually omitted in ICCF, which tries to be the most &quot;basic&quot; possible notation. However, I did add some examples and explanations to the page just to make all that clear. [[User talk:Tempodivalse#top|'''''Tempodivalse''''']] 16:10, 12 January 2011 (UTC)

== Descriptive notation ==

There is a page for algebraic notation.  Should there be one for descriptive notation? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:30, 30 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

= Open Sicilian =
White's knight removes Black's d-pawn, freeing his f-pawn to advance, and radiates power in all directions from its central post.

The resulting exchanges have left White with a semi-open d-file and Black with a semi-open c-file. White has also swapped a central pawn for a wing pawn. According to Fred Reinfeld, if a center (d- or e-) pawn is worth about $1.00, a bishop's (c- or f-) pawn is worth about $0.90. Therefore, Black has, in effect, swapped a dollar for a dollar, but kept the ten cents as change! Fortunately, to compensate for this, White has a marked spatial advantage in the center, plus a small lead in development. Using his open d-file, White will attempt to pressure Black's d6-point. In some lines, Black voluntarily makes this pawn on d6 backward with the advance ...e7-e5 in exchange for dynamic play in the center and queenside. While it is true that Black does not always achieve this play in the center, he almost always gets queenside play rolling with ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5. If White castles queenside, these pawns will be a dangerous attacking force. However, if White castles kingside, the danger posed by these pawns is significantly less, although they are still part of a positional plan to expand on the queenside.

White has a pawn on the fourth rank. Nominally, it gains space, and many battles have been fought over whether this space advantage is relevant. However, in many variations of the Sicilian (particularly the Najdorf Variation), the e-pawn becomes a target. This can also be seen in the natural development of Black's pieces: ...b7-b5, ...Ng8-f6, and sometimes ...Nb8-d7-c5. When the neighboring pawn on f2 advances to the fourth rank, White gains more space on the kingside, getting good chances for attack there. In all, this adds up to a very sharp game, which is why the Sicilian Defence is the most popular opening today.

== The Stack ==

[[Image:Data stack.svg|right]]
Generally speaking, a '''stack''' is a data structure that stores data values contiguously in memory. Unlike an array, however, you access (read or write) data only at the &quot;top&quot; of the stack. To read from the stack is said &quot;'''to pop'''&quot; and to write to the stack is said &quot;'''to push'''&quot;.
A stack is also known as a LIFO queue (Last In First Out) since values are popped from the stack in ''the reverse order'' that they are pushed onto it (think of how you pile up plates on a table).
Popped data disappears from the stack.

All x86 architectures use a stack as a temporary storage area in RAM that allows the processor to quickly store and retrieve data in memory.
The current top of the stack is pointed to by the '''esp''' register.  The stack &quot;grows&quot; downward, from high to low memory addresses, so values recently pushed onto the stack are located in memory addresses ''above'' the esp pointer. No register specifically points to the bottom of the stack, although most operating systems monitor the stack bounds to detect both &quot;underflow&quot; (popping an empty stack) and &quot;overflow&quot; (pushing too much information on the stack) conditions.

When a value is popped off the stack, the value remains sitting in memory until overwritten. However, you should never rely on the content of memory addresses below esp, because other functions may overwrite these values without your knowledge.

Users of Windows ME, 98, 95, 3.1 (and earlier) may fondly remember the infamous &quot;Blue Screen of Death&quot; -- that was sometimes caused by a stack overflow exception. This occurs when too much data is written to the stack, and the stack &quot;grows&quot; beyond its limits. Modern operating systems use better bounds-checking and error recovery to reduce the occurrence of stack overflows, and to maintain system stability after one has occurred.

== Push and Pop ==

The following lines of ASM code are basically equivalent:

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=20 cellpadding=10
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
push eax
&lt;/source&gt;
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
sub esp, 4
mov DWORD PTR SS:[esp], eax
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
pop eax
&lt;/source&gt;
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov eax, DWORD PTR SS:[esp]
add esp, 4
&lt;/source&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
 
but the single command actually performs much faster than the alternative. It can be visualized that the stack grows from right to left, and esp decreases as the stack grows in size.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Push
!Pop
|-
|[[Image:ReverseEngineeringPush.JPG]]
|[[Image:ReverseEngineeringPop.JPG]]
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

== ESP In Action ==
{{x86 Disassembly/Syntax|MASM}}

Let's say we want to quickly discard 3 items we pushed earlier onto the stack, without saving the values (in other words &quot;clean&quot; the stack). The following works:
{{-}}
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
pop eax
pop eax
pop eax
&lt;/source&gt;

However there is a faster method. We can simply perform some basic arithmetic on esp to make the pointer go &quot;above&quot; the data items, so they cannot be read anymore, and can be overwritten with the next round of '''push''' commands.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
add esp, 12  ; 12 is 3 DWORDs (4 bytes * 3)
&lt;/source&gt;

Likewise, if we want to reserve room on the stack for an item bigger than a DWORD, we can use a subtraction to artificially move esp forward. We can then access our reserved memory directly as a memory pointer, or we can access it indirectly as an offset value from esp itself.

Say we wanted to create an array of byte values on the stack, 100 items long. We want to store the pointer to the base of this array in '''edi'''. How do we do it? Here is an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
sub esp, 100  ; num of bytes in our array
mov edi, esp  ; copy address of 100 bytes area to edi
&lt;/source&gt;

To destroy that array, we simply write the instruction

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
add esp, 100
&lt;/source&gt;

== Reading Without Popping ==

To read values on the stack without popping them off the stack, '''esp''' can be used with an offset. For instance, to read the 3 DWORD values from the top of the stack into eax (but without using a pop instruction), we would use the instructions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov eax, DWORD PTR SS:[esp]
mov eax, DWORD PTR SS:[esp + 4]
mov eax, DWORD PTR SS:[esp + 8]
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember, since esp moves downward as the stack grows, data on the stack can be accessed with a positive offset. A negative offset should never be used because data &quot;above&quot; the stack cannot be counted on to stay the way you left it. The operation of reading from the stack without popping is often referred to as &quot;peeking&quot;, but since this isn't the official term for it this wikibook won't use it.

== Data Allocation ==

There are two areas in the computer memory where a program can store data. The first, the one that we have been talking about, is the stack. It is a linear LIFO buffer that allows fast allocations and deallocations, but has a limited size. The '''heap''' is typically a non-linear data storage area, typically implemented using linked lists, binary trees, or other more exotic methods. Heaps are slightly more difficult to interface with and to maintain than a stack, and allocations/deallocations are performed more slowly. However, heaps can grow as the data grows, and new heaps can be allocated when data quantities become too large. 

As we shall see, explicitly declared variables are allocated on the stack. Stack variables are finite in number, and have a definite size. Heap variables can be variable in number and in size. We will discuss these topics in more detail later.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jtwdog. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jtwdog~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <comment>/* Use of the Passive Voice */ I added this extra clarification to more properly explain the consequences of changing active to passive tone. While a change in tone would not cause an altered meaning of the clause, it will change how we perceive it.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Disclaimer:''' In everyday writing, the active voice is used to concisely and forcibly describe people's actions.  The passive voice also has important rhetoric uses in everyday writing.  It is more common in formal writing that tries to be less personal.  The terms &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive voice&quot; and their significance to good writing are explained in the article below.

==Voice in English Writing==

Languages have different levels of formality that vary with the purpose, the audience, and the situation. Generally, written English is more formal than spoken English because the person has more time to think about what to say. Formal writing uses fewer personal pronouns and less colloquial language, or slang.  Another important difference is the use of grammatical voice. 

&quot;Voice&quot; has two meanings in writing.  &quot;Voice&quot; can be defined as &quot;how the writer's personality and attitude toward the topic are revealed to the audience.&quot;  Voice, in this definition, is what makes one writer sound different from another.  &quot;Voice&quot; is also a grammatical term; for clarity, it may be referred to as &quot;grammatical voice.&quot;  There are two voices discussed in this section: the active voice and the passive voice.

==Active and Passive Voice Sentences==
Most English sentences are written with active, passive, or neuter verbs, such as &quot;to be&quot; verbs.  The active and passive voices are the two main voices in English, but some sentences may also be considered to be in the middle or mediopassive voice.  Voice is the relationship between the subject and the verb in a clause or the transfer of action.

*In the active voice, the subject performs the action.  The subject of an active-voice construction is known as an agent.  A clause with an active, transitive verb will be in the form of subject-verb-object. 
Example: The student '''finished''' the exercise.

*In the passive voice, the subject receives the action.  The subject of a passive-voice construction is known as a patient.  An active voice clause can be passivized, or recast in the passive voice (for example, to increase formality), by making the object of the active clause the subject of the passive clause.  &quot;The exercise&quot; is the object in the sentence above.  The verb will be &quot;was finished.&quot;  For a passive verb, the tense and subject-verb agreement are always shown through the auxiliary verb &quot;to be.&quot;  The main verb is always the past participle.  The subject of the active voice sentence can be included in a prepositional phrase with &quot;by.&quot;

Example: The exercise '''was finished''' by the student.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Active Voice !! Passive Voice
|-
| The teacher '''referred to''' &quot;voice&quot; as a grammatical term. || &quot;Voice&quot; '''was referred to''' as a grammatical term by the teacher. 
|-
| The man '''yelled at''' the waiter. || The waiter '''was yelled at''' by the man. 
|-
| Millions of people '''lived in''' the houses. || The houses '''were lived in''' by millions of people. 
|}

Intransitive verbs can be used in the passive voice when a prepositional phrase is included.

Intransitive verbs without prepositional phrases cannot be passivized.  There is no word to become the subject of the sentence.

Active voice: Millions of people lived.

Passive voice: ? was lived.

Linking verbs (such as being verbs) are intransitive verbs that can never be used in the passive voice.  They do not show action and are thus neither active nor passive.  They are called neuter verbs.

==Use of the Passive Voice==
Converting an active-voice clause to a passive-voice clause may not change technical meaning, but can be done for altered formality or emphasis as well as change the connotation of the text. Linguistic studies have found high percentages of passive verbs in formal writing.  The passive voice can emphasize an agent, a patient, or an adverb.  It can be used for narrative flow and continuity in conversations.

Emphasizing the agent: ''Hamlet'' was written by Shakespeare.

The passive voice emphasizes Shakespeare by putting his name at the end, the most emphatic part of a sentence.
 
Emphasizing the patient: Jamey was fascinated by Language Arts.

The passive-voice construction emphasizes Jamey more effectively than the active-voice equivalent &quot;Language Arts fascinated Jamey.&quot;

Emphasizing the adverb: That is strictly prohibited.

Because a passive verb consists of two words, an adverb becomes emphatic when placed between &quot;to be&quot; and the past participle.

The passive voice can be used to eliminate first- and second-pronouns in formal writing.

Active voice: I hope that....

Passive voice: It is hoped that....

In formal writing, the writer may want to alternate between sentences 
in the first person and passive sentences in which the pronoun is implied to prevent the monotony caused by starting too many sentences with &quot;I.&quot;

Research studies are described in the passive voice.  Research is intended to be objective, without the biases of the researchers conducting the experiments.  An experiment should be the same no matter who performs it.

Active voice: I collected samples from the subjects.

Passive voice: Samples were collected from the subjects.

A sentence in the imperative mood can be rewritten in the passive voice to make it more formal or less harsh.

Active voice: Do not smoke.

Passive voice: Smoking is prohibited.

Active voice: Avoid contractions in formal writing.

Passive voice: Contractions should be avoided in formal writing.

The examples above for first- and second-person pronouns make use of the institutional passive, which omits the agent.  In writing and speech, almost eighty-five percent of passive sentences are in the institutional passive.

== The Structural Difference ==
The difference between active and passive is in how many noun phrases in the sentence that are not introduced with the use of a preposition. 
Compare the following sentences:
   
                 I dropped the ball.   
                 The ball was dropped by me.                             

 
                 The man offered the butler a reward.
                 The Butler was offered a reward by the man.

* In the &lt;tt&gt;active voice&lt;/tt&gt;, the sentence has between two and three noun phrases that do not require a prepositional phrase. These are called '''the subject''', the '''direct object''' and the '''indirect object'''.
** I dropped the ball. (&quot;I&quot; is the subject. &quot;The ball&quot; is the direct object.)
** The man offered the butler a reward. (&quot;The man&quot; is the subject. &quot;The butler&quot; is the indirect object and &quot;a reward&quot; is the direct object.)
**The man offered a reward to the butler.  (&quot;The man&quot; is still the subject.  &quot;A reward&quot; is still the direct object, but &quot;the butler&quot; is now part of a prepositional phrase and is no longer an indirect object.)

* In the &lt;tt&gt;passive voice&lt;/tt&gt;, the sentence has one fewer noun phrase than the corresponding active. The subject is removed and can appear only in an optional prepositional phrase. The object is promoted to subject. For ditransitive verbs, the direct or indirect object can become the subject. 

** The ball was dropped by me. (&quot;The ball&quot; is now the subject. &quot;Me&quot; shows up in an optional &quot;by&quot;-phrase.)
** The Butler was offered a reward by the man. (&quot;The butler&quot; is now the subject. There is only one object: &quot;a reward.&quot;  &quot;The man&quot; shows up in an optional &quot;by&quot;-phrase.)
**A reward was offered to the butler by the man.  (&quot;A reward&quot; is now the subject.  &quot;The butler&quot; is not considered an indirect object because it is part of a prepositional phrase.  &quot;The man&quot; shows up in an optional &quot;by&quot;-phrase.)

Without a change in meaning, using the active or passive voice can emphasize different noun phrases in the examples above. By using the passive voice, the writer can take away emphasis from the perpetrator of the action and place it instead on the receiver of the action. In this way, focus is placed mostly on the action.

= Substitution and Interchange =

This page will use the notions of ''occurrence'' and ''subformula'' introduced at the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Syntax#Additional terminology|Additional terminology]] section of  [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Syntax|Formal Syntax]].  These notions have been little used if at all since then, so you might want to review them.

== Substitution ==

=== Tautological forms ===

We have introduced a number of tautologies, one example being

: (1) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This has the (informally written) form

: (2) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\psi \rightarrow (\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As it turns out, any formula matching this form is a tautology.  Thus, for example,

: (3) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R} \land \mathrm{S} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R} \land \mathrm{S})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is a tautology.  This process is general.  Take any tautology.  Find its most fully explicitly form by uniformly replacing distinct sentence letters with distinct Greek letters.  We can call this a ''tautological form'', which will not be a formula but rather a metalogical expression.  Any instance of this tautological form is a tautology.

=== Substitution instances ===

The preceding illustrated how we can generate new tautologies from old ones via tautological forms.  Here, we will show how to generate tautologies without resort to tautological forms.  To do this, we will define a substitution instance of a formula.  Any substitution instance of a tautology is also a tautology.

First, we define the simple substitution instance of a formula for a sentence letter.  Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be formulae and &lt;math&gt;\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be a sentence letter.  The ''simple substitution instance'' &lt;math&gt;\varphi[\pi / \psi]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the result of replacing ''every'' occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  A ''substitution instance of formulae for a sentence letters'' is the result of a chain of simple substitution instances.  In particular, a chain of zero simple substitutions instances starting from &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a substitution instance and indeed is just &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; itself.  Thus, any formula is a substitution instance of itself.

It turns out that if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology, then so is any simple substitution instance &lt;math&gt;\varphi[\pi / \psi]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  If we start with a tautology and generate a chain of simple substitution instances, then every formula in the chain is also a tautology.  Thus any (not necessarily simple) substitution instance of a tautology is also a tautology.

=== Substitution examples ===

Consider (1) again.  We substitute &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R} \land \mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for every occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1).  This gives us the following simple substitution instance of (1):

: (4) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R} \land \mathrm{S} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{R} \land \mathrm{S})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In this, we substitute &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  That gives us (3) as a simple substitution instance of (4).  Since (3) is the result of a chain of two simple substitution instances, it is a (non-simple) substitution instance of (1)  Since (1) is a tautology, so is (3).  We can express the chain of substitutions as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})[\mathrm{Q} / \mathrm{R} \land \mathrm{S}][\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Take another example, also starting from (1).  We want to obtain

: (5) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Our first attempt won't work.  First we substitute &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; obtaining

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Next we substitute &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; obtaining

: (6) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This is indeed a tautology, but it is not the one we wanted.  Let's try again.  In (1), we substitute &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; obtaining

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now substitute &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; obtaining

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, substituting &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; gets us the result we wanted, namely (5).  Since (1) is a tautology, so is (5).  We can express the chain of substitutions as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})[\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{R}][\mathrm{Q} / \mathrm{P}][\mathrm{R} / \mathrm{Q}]\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Simultaneous substitutions ===

We can compress a chain of simple substitutions into a single complex substitution.  Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, ... be formulae; let &lt;math&gt;\pi_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, ... be sentence letters.  We define a ''simultaneous substitution instance of formulas for sentence letters'' &lt;math&gt;\varphi[\pi_1 / \psi_1,\ \pi_2 / \psi_2,\ ...]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be the result of starting with &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and simultaneously replacing &lt;math&gt;\pi_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\psi_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\psi_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, ....  We can regenerate our examples.

The previously generated formula (3) is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})[\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}, \mathrm{Q} / \mathrm{R} \land \mathrm{S}]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, (5) is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})[\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{Q},\ \mathrm{Q} / \mathrm{P}]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Finally (6) is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})[\mathrm{Q} / \mathrm{P}]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


When we get to predicate logic, simultaneous substitution instances will not be available.  That is why we defined ''substitution instance'' by reference to a chain of simple substitution instances rather than as a simultaneous substitution instance.

== Interchange ==

=== Interchange of equivalent subformulae ===

We previously saw the following equivalence at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives#Miscellaneous|Properties of Sentential Connectives]]:

: (7) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

You then might expect the following equivalence:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot \lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This expectation is correct; the two formulae are equivalent.  Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be equivalent formulae.  Let &lt;math&gt;\chi_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be a formula in which &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; occurs as a subformula.  Finally, let &lt;math&gt;\chi_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be the result of replacing in &lt;math&gt;\chi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at least one (not necessarily all) occurrences of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\chi_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\chi_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent.  This replacement is called an ''interchange''.

For a second example, suppose we want to generate the equivalence

: (8) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \lnot (\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We note the following equivalence:

: (9) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot \lnot (\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

These two formulae can be confirmed to be equivalent either by truth table or, more easily, by substituting &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in both formulae of (7).

This substitution does indeed establish (9) as an equivalence.  We already noted that &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent if and only if &lt;math&gt;\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology.   Based on (7), we get the tautology

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \lnot \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Our substitution then yields

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R} \leftrightarrow \lnot \lnot (\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is also a tautology.  The corresponding equivalence is then (9).

Based on (9), we can now replace the consequent of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with its equivalent.  This generates the desired equivalence, namely (8).

Every formula equivalent to a tautology is also a tautology.  Thus an interchange of equivalent subformulae within a tautology results in a tautology.  For example, we can use the substitution instance of (7): 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

together with the tautology previously seen at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives#Conditionals|Properties of Sentential Connectives]]:

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \lnot \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

as a new tautology.

=== Interchange example ===

As an example, we will use the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility#Interdefinability of connectives|interdefinability of connectives]] to express

: (10) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

using only conditionals and negations.

Based on

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we get the substitution instance

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which in turn allows us to replace the appropriate subformula in (10) to get:

: (11) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; [[File:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

together with the appropriate substitution gives us

: (12) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})) \land ((\lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}) \rightarrow \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

as equivalent to (11).

Finally, applying 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

together with the appropriate substitution, yields our final result:

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}) \rightarrow \lnot ((\lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}) \rightarrow \mathrm{P}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Summary ==

This page has presented two claims.

* A substitution instance of a tautology is also a tautology.

* Given a formula, the result of interchanging a subformula with an equivalent is a formula equivalent to the given formula.

These claims are not trivial observations or the result of a simple truth table.  They are substantial claims that need proof.  Proofs are available in a number of standard metalogic textbooks, but are not presented here.</text>

[[w:Neuroscience|Neuroscience]] is a field that is devoted to the scientific study of the nervous system.
 
Such studies may include the structure, function, development, genetics, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and pathology of the nervous system. Traditionally it is seen as a branch of biological sciences. It can involve convergence of interest from many allied disciplines, including psychology, computer science, statistics, physics, and medicine. The scope of neuroscience has now broadened to include any systematic scientific experimental and theoretical investigation of the central and peripheral nervous system of biological organisms. The methodologies employed by neuroscientists have been enormously expanded, from biochemical and genetic analysis of dynamics of individual nerve cells and their molecular constituents to imaging gross representations of perceptual and motor tasks in the brain.
Neuroscience is at the frontier of investigation of the brain and mind. The study of the brain is becoming the cornerstone in understanding how we perceive and interact with the external world and, in particular, how human experience and human biology influence each other.

[[Image:Human brain NIH.jpg|right|200px|A human brain]]
The human '''''nervous system''''' (or neurological system) has been called by some the most integrated and complex system on earth. It is a massively complicated tangle of nerves, ganglia, and fluids, all playing massively important roles in the execution of normal, day to day activities that many of us take entirely for granted. Even such mundane tasks as typing on a keyboard require a massive coordinating effort on the part of the nervous system. Your eyes must see the screen, your brain must know what you want to type, and you must be able to move your fingers in a coordinated enough fashion to allow you to type with any speed at all. So, as you can see, just typing requires the use and integration of millions of small, vital parts to allow this relatively simple action to transpire.

The nervous system is basically made up of cells, just like all other living organisms. The cells of the brain can be separated into two main categories: '''''primary cells''''' and '''''support cells'''''. Primary cells receive stimuli, transfer stimuli, interpret stimuli, and decide upon an appropriate response. This is a laborious, energy consuming process, and primary cells require massive amounts of nourishment per day. As such, the nervous system absorbs 40% of the body's daily food requirements, making it the most energy consumptive system in the human body, in proportion to it's relatively small size. This being the case, support cells play the vital role of feeding the energy hungry primary cells, as well as anchoring them into place, building extra mechanisms for the transfer of stimuli, and destroying '''''necrotic''''' (dead) materials.

The most basic divisions of the nervous system are the '''''Central Nervous System''''' and the '''''Peripheral Nervous System'''''. These two divisions have a highly complementary relationship, as the PNS receives information from many parts of the environment, and the CNS is responsible for both interpreting the information and determining a response. The response is then referred back to the PNS, and passed along to '''''effectors''''', or organs that perform an action in response to a stimulus. If a stimulus/response sequence is particularly emotional or frightening, then it may be stored away by the CNS as a '''''memory''''', or a series of synaptic connections that, when activated, cause information to be 'played back' in the mind's eye.

==Central Nervous System==
The '''C'''entral '''N'''ervous '''S'''ystem, or '''''CNS''''', is the control and co-ordination section of the Nervous System comprised of the '''''brain''''', '''''brainstem''''' and '''''spinal cord'''''. It’s main functions are the reception of stimuli from the PNS, the integration  and interpretation of received ('''''afferent''''') stimuli, and the subsequent sending of ('''''efferent''''') stimuli to '''''effectors''''' (glands and muscles) around the body. The brain controls &quot;lower&quot;, unconscious activities such as heartbeat, respiration, and digestion - these are known as autonomic functions. The brain also controls &quot;higher&quot; order, conscious activities, such as thought, reasoning, and abstraction. The human brain is more capable of these higher order activities than any other species' brain, largely due to the effects of '''''cephalization'''''.

===Regions and Organization===

*[[/The Brain/]]
*[[/The Spinal Cord/]]

==Peripheral Nervous System==
The '''P'''eripheral '''N'''ervous '''S'''ystem, or '''''PNS''''', is the sensory reception and transferal section of the Nervous System, comprised of the 12 pairs of '''''cranial nerves''''', 31 pairs of '''''spinal nerves''''', and various other afferent and efferent nerves that both relay information from sensory organs to the brain, and then relay a response back to effector organs.

The PNS can be subdivided into several sections. The first two divisions are the '''''somatic''''' and '''''autonomic''''' divisions. The somatic division is responsible for conscious manipulation of skeletal muscles, excluding reflexes. It controls actions that that we consciously decide to perform, such as reaching for an object or kicking a ball. The autonomic division is responsible for muscle control that we are not necessarily aware of, and have no conscious control over, such as heart beat, breathing, blinking, digestion movements and the changes in diameter of the body's blood vessels. 

The autonomic division can be further subdivided into two more divisions, the '''''sympathetic''''' and '''''parasympathetic''''' divisions. The sympathetic division controls things like the '''''fight or flight''''' response to danger, and only kicks in when extreme danger is sensed. It is primarily influenced by certain hormones like '''''epinephrine''''' ('''''adrenaline''''') and '''''norepinephrine''''', which cause a spike in blood glucose and blood pressure. When the sympathetic division takes control, we feel a corresponding '''''adrenaline rush'''''. The parasympathetic division controls non-survival mechanisms like digestion. The parasympathetic division is in control most of the time, but when danger is sensed, blood is drained from the parasympathetic and sent to the muscles to allow us to either fight for our lives or run like mad. One division cannot work at the same time as the other, as you can tell when you run from a fright. During the time of fear, you don't realize that you may be hungry, cold, tired or thirsty, as these are mechanisms under the jurisdiction of the parasympathetic division.

===The Special Senses===
The '''''special senses''''' are the six senses that humans use in their major day-to-day activities. They are the most important senses to us, in terms of how many cells and how much energy is devoted to each.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cellular Neurobiology is the study of the brain from a cellular perspective; that is, a study of the properties of cells in the brain, and how cells interact and communicate. The interaction of these cells mediates identifiable functions of different systems in the brain, and the goal of the cellular perspective of neuroscience is to understand these interactions. Specific applications of cellular neuroscience include the mechanisms that produce the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.

== Cramming for a test == 
Cramming is the worst way to study, and you are unlikely to retain anything you read during cramming very far beyond the actual exam.  That being said, sometimes cramming is the only option for a time-constrained student, or one that has spent insufficient time with the material during the semester.  It can be also quite useful if you simply don't understand the material that well.

The following technique has been used by the author in many technical and mathematical classes.  Some parts may also be useful in other classes, but some/most parts will obviously not apply.

;Step 1: Go over every homework assignment that was given during the course of the class, even review the assignments you failed to complete.  You should complete EVERY problem up to the point where the remainder is &quot;busy work&quot;; where that point is is up to you. Repeat this step until you can figure out the right technique to solve a problem without getting bogged down in pondering.  The point here is NOT to memorize the homework problems, it is to ensure you can solve them without hesitation.  While most exam problems are far beyond the level of homework problems, most exam questions can be broken down into chunks that will resemble homework.  You need to be able to recognize the chunks and solve them quickly, or you will never finish.

;Step 2: Many professors will have previous exams on file in the library.  You should go through a similar process as you did in Step 1.  In this step, it is not out of the question for you to encounter problems were you just don't understand how the solution was achieved.  Fear not, and consult Steps 4 and 5.

;Step 3: Some kind of professors will even hand out suggested study questions prior to the exam.  This is a gift, as the professor could not supply you with a clearer hint as to what he/she expects you to know.  You should go over these in the same manner as Steps 1 and 2.

;Step 4: Many classes will have review sessions prior to the exam. (At the author's school, they were required to be held.)  This is an excellent opportunity to have questions about the more difficult problems answered.  If you still do not understand a professor's explanation for the solution to a problem (or if you don't think you could replicate it on the fly during an exam), simply copy the solution down verbatim and proceed to Step 5.

;Step 5: Many kind of professors will let students take notecards/sheets into the exam.  The intent of your professors is to let you write down long formulas ahead of time so you don't have to engage in rote memorization of several pages of nasty formulas.  (Naturally, you should go ahead and put these on your formula sheet.)  At this point, you have already learned all you are going to learn, your focus now is on passing the exam.  To that end, take the solutions to problems you didn't understand from Steps 1 to 3, use a scanner or copy machine to reduce them down to the smallest legible size, and simply staple or tape them to your &quot;formula&quot; sheet/card.  You would be shocked to realize how often those problem will appear on the exam, with only minor variations. If you are allowed a calculator on your test (only if it applies), go on to Step 6.

;Step 6: If you're using a standard scientific calculator, learn all the functions ahead of time. If your calculator runs on batteries, make sure they will last you through the exam. There's not much else to put here, since your calculator probably cannot be programmed. If you're using a graphing calculator, proceed to Step 7.

;Step 7: If you're using a graphing calculator, and your course becomes noticeably easier with it (a fact that can only be noticed if you're reasonable competent with your calculator), you should spend some time making/finding small programs to make your computing time shorter on the exam. With adequate practice, you should be able to let the calculator know your requirement in a very short period of time. In my engineering experience, the ratio of input time to calculator processing time should ideally be around 3:10, but ratios up to 1:2 are acceptable. Finding programs for your calculator should ideally be done ahead of time, but even if that is not possible, [[Google]] is your friend. There are also some major sites dedicated to popular calculators like the [[Ti-89]]. Make sure your programs work under strained conditions, as troubleshooting is not to be done on the exam. If your program doesn't work on the exam, do not waste more than three attempts on it; proceed, instead, to work out the problem with hand.</text>

It should not be confused with [[Cookbook:Chicken Tikka Masala|Chicken Tikka Masala]] (of which it is an ingredient). It is traditionally cooked on [[Cookbook:Skewer|skewers]] in a [[Cookbook:Tandoor Oven|tandoor]] and is usually boneless.

==Ingredients==
*675 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.5 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) skinless and boneless chicken breast diced into large cubes
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] seed oil (see Notes, tips and variations)
*50 [[Cookbook:mL|ml]] (2[[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fl oz]]) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*150 [[Cookbook:mL|ml]] (5[[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fl oz]]) natural [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] puree
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (coriander leaves)
*4 large cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], finely [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
*1-4 chopped fresh red [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillis]] (depending on strength of the Chillis and the desired strength of the marinade)
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsps]] [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsps]] [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] powder
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (use rock salt for best results)

==Procedure==
#Add all of the ingredients except the chicken to a non-metallic [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]] and mix well.
#Add the chicken and mix until fully coated.
#Ideally, the chicken should now be left in a refrigerator to [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] for at least 24 hours. It may not be safe to leave chicken which has previously been frozen for longer than 24 hours, but fresh chicken should be left to marinate for 48 hours for best results. If you do not wish to leave the chicken to marinate, simply continue to the next step.
#The chicken now needs to be cooked. For best results, place on skewers and cook in a [[Cookbook:Tandoor|tandoor]] or ceramic pot oven. The chicken can also be cooked on skewers under a medium [[Cookbook:Grilling|grill]] for 5-8 minutes on each side or barbecued (cooking times depend on the temperature of the barbecue). Always ensure the chicken is cooked throughout before serving. It should come apart easily when pressed down with the side of a fork.
#Serve with [[Cookbook:Naan|naan]], with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] or use in a [[Cookbook:Chicken Tikka Masala|Chicken Tikka Masala]].

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Mustard seed oil is considered unfit for human consumption in many parts of the world and is therefore not available. A poor alternative can be made by crackling]] 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] seeds in approximately 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] of very hot [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable]] or [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. Allow to cool then use in place of mustard seed oil.
*It is possible to make a tikka with almost any meat, the most commonly used other than chicken being [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] and [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]].
*Tikka can be served either as main meal or as an appetiser.
*Powdered or dried ingredients can be substituted for fresh, but at the expense of taste.
*Some people prefer to make tikka with meat on-the-bone for improved flavour.

'''Chicken tikka masala''' is a dish based on chunks of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]]-style roast chicken ([[Cookbook:Chicken Tikka|Chicken Tikka]]) cooked in a [[Cookbook:Tomato|Tomato]], [[Cookbook:Curry|Curry]] sauce, originating in Britain but intentionally recalling Indian dishes. There is no standard recipe for chicken tikka masala; a survey found that of 48 different recipes the only common ingredient was chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= BBC E-Cyclopedia | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/1285804.stm | title=Chicken tikka masala: Spice and easy does it|work=[http://bbc.co.uk bbc.co.uk] | accessdate=28 September | accessyear=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sauce usually includes tomato and either [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] or [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut cream]] and various spices.

==Ingredients==
*675 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.5 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) cooked [[Cookbook:Chicken Tikka|Chicken Tikka]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] seed oil (see '''Notes, tips and variations''' below)
*4 large cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], finely [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]]
*200 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (7 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]) [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], finely chopped (optional)
*1 tin (can) of plum [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], chopped
*1-4 chopped fresh green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillis]] (depending on strength of the Chillis and the desired strength of the sauce)
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (coriander leaves)
*50 [[Cookbook:mL|ml]] (4 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fl oz]]) single [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] malt [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] curry paste
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Tandoori masala|tandoori masala paste]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]

==Procedure==
#Heat the oil in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] (if available, otherwise a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]]).
#Add the garlic and onions (if using) and [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] until browned.
#Add the curry pastes and mix well, adding a little water or yogurt.
#Add the cooked chicken tikka and [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] for two minutes to heat through.
#Add the tomatoes, vinegar, tomato paste and chillies and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for five minutes. Add more water if required.
#Add the cream, garam masala and chopped cilantro and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for a few minutes.
#Garnish with fresh coriander and serve with [[Cookbook:Naan|Naan bread]], [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] coloured yellow with [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] [[Cookbook:Bahjis|bahjis]] and/or a glass of white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]].

==Notes, tips and variations==
*[[w:Mustard oil|Mustard seed oil]] is considered unfit for human consumption in many parts of the world and is therefore not available. A poor alternative can be made by ''crackling'' 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] seeds in approximately 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] of very hot [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable]] or [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't believe the information on nationality etc is needed and we shouldn't be asking people for personal details that are not covered by the [[Wikimedia:Privacy policy]]. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 00:56, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

The page says &quot;if you want to be formally recognised as an author, please sign below and add information&quot;.

What does &quot;formally&quot; mean here ?
* Does that mean that if I participated to the project, I can be recognised as an author ONLY if I provide all this information, or will not be recognised as an author at all ? In this case, is not that infringing my own rights as an author ? According to the GFDL, my participation should be recognised...
* Or does that mean I will be under another list of author (the minor anonymous ones ?)

I do not understand what &quot;formally&quot; is. Anthere

:The information is required if we want to preserve the copyright on this information and wish to legally enforce the copyright for any of this content.  Otherwise, this can only be considered public domain works and we might as well get rid of the copyright and license disclaimer, suggesting that all of the information is anonymous contributions.  The &quot;formal listing&quot; as an author is therefore required legally, and the privacy policy much therefore be amended to reflect this fact.

:BTW, this is not a violation of the privacy policy because first of all this information is voluntarily requested, not required for participation.  In addition, it goes beyond merely what is listed for your formal user account and adds information not found on either your user page (generally) or in your user record.

:Simply put, if you want to be included as an author of the Wikijunior Big Cats book, put your name in the list.  If you don't, take it out.  It is that simple.  In your case Anthere, your public information is plastered around Wikimedia projects simply because of your position on the board, and you have made some edits to this Wikibook as well.  We were trying to give credit where credit is due, and collecting public information we already knew about authors that are already listed in the history section of this Wikibook.  If you don't want that connection to any information, it would be advised to log out from your user account and perhaps log into an IP anonymizer as well (mentioned in the privacy policy).  If you don't want to be listed as an author, feel free to remove your name from the list.  I won't put it back.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:26, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

Now, sorry, but this is NOT the answer I am looking for. Robert, please try to see a little '''wider''' than just me. When I ask the question, I ask it '''for all editors''', not for ME. Afaik, I did not write anything on any wikijunior. So have no reason to be put there. However, I am interested in the whole notion of what you suggest. In short, you suggest that all wikimedia projects are public domain, unless authors give their real name, place of living and year of birth. If so, that means that basically the GFDL and us using it is plain crap. So, I would like a clarification of the implications of this. Myself and thousand of editors are participating under pseudonyms to several projects and we consider we do it under GFDL. If the new recommendation is to give all personal information OR participate anonymously, then I would like to know more about it. But I do not think what you are doing is correct. So please, explain why what has been considered crediting for more than 4 years would not be valid any more now. [[User:83.205.176.35|83.205.176.35]]

:This is more like the Emporer's New Clothes:  Nobody has take this issue seriously before hand.  Yes, I am suggesting that if you use a psuedonym and not your real name that you will be unable to enforce the GFDL, and in effect that the GFDL will become meaningless.  At least if you use a psuedonym with no connection to your real name and other identification information that marks you as a unique individual.  That makes the contributions anonymous and essentially in the public domain instead.  What I am asking for is that if you are interested in providing public information about yourself and claiming copyright privileges on your contributions, that you should do so and provide the necessary information that is required to make a formal copyright registration.  I'm also suggesting that the current MediaWiki software has a serious shortcomming right now because the page credits service is &quot;turned off&quot; for each page, and the only way to find out who actually made a contribution is to tediously go through each and every edit and mark down unique contributors by hand.  These features are in the software, but not available on Wikibooks at the moment due to a decision on the part of the developers presumably for performance reasons but the whole debate is IMHO uncertain and rather arbitrary.  I did try to explain that we are collecting this information on a voluntary basis, and I don't ever want that to change.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:49, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

==Is registration neccessary?==
I emailed [[m:juriwiki|juriwiki]] about whether copyright registration was necessary since I saw no reason to be attempting to do this. [[w:en:User:Michael Snow|Michael Snow]]'s reply is below (he gave me permission to add this here since he doesn't have an account on this wiki himself). [[User:Angela|Angela]] 17:09, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

: No, registration is not necessary. It's required in order to file suit for infringement, and registration in advance protects the ability to claim statutory damages and attorney's fees (actual damages are not affected).

:However, since Wikimedia doesn't generally own copyright to much of anything, it's really up to the contributors. I suppose if some author wants to pursue registration, they're welcome to do so, but it's of their own initiative and there's no need for us to assist or get involved in it. And other authors aren't required to participate in the process if they don't want to.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Notation =

== Place value ==
The place value notational system, uses values for each digit that are multiples of ten.

=== Whole numbers ===

For whole numbers, the digit on the right is the ones.  Moving to the left, the value of each place increases by multiplying ten: the tens place, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions, etc.

Examples

In 4932
* 2 is in the ones place.
* 3 is in the tens place.
* 9 is in the hundreds place.
* 4 is in the thousands place.

Each group of three digits is separated off by commas, and contains a ones, a tens and a hundreds place.  The group on the right has no additional name.  The next group to the left is the thousands group, and each place in that group ends with the word thousands.  The group to the left of thousands is millions. 

In 24,685,000
* There are zeros in the ones, tens, and hundreds places.
* 5 is in the thousands place.
* 8 is in the ten thousands place.
* 6 is in the hundred thousands place.
* 4 is in the millions place.
* 2 is in the ten millions place.

To the left of millions is billions, then trillions, and quadrillions.  (This is the usage in the USA and most English speaking countries.  Parts of Europe use a slightly different system for the names of the places larger than hundred millions.)

In 4,720,000,000,000
* There are zeros in the ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions, ten millions, hundred millions, and billions places.
* 2 is in the ten billions place.
* 7 is in the hundred billions place.
* 4 is in the trillions place.

=== Decimals ===
For indicating places smaller than one, a dot or decimal point is put to the right of the ones place.  Each place to the right is decreased by dividing by ten.  Assigning place values to the digits on the right of the decimal point starts next to the decimal point with tenths and moves to the right with each place value name.  The place on the right of the tenths is the hundredths, then thousandths, ten thousandths, etc.

Notice that each decimal place value name is similar to a whole number place name, except that these decimal names all end in '''ths'''.

Also notice that there is no place on the right of the decimal point that is similar to the ones place just to the left of the decimal point.  The ones place and the decimal point are the middle of this system.

Examples

In 0.5931
* 5 is in the tenths place.
* 9 is in the hundredths place.
* 3 is in the thousandths place.
* 1 is in the ten thousandths place.

Numbers with no whole number part are often written with a zero in the ones place.  This is done to make the decimal point easier to see.  The zero is not required, however.

In .000049
* There are zeros in the tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and ten thousandths places.
* 4 is in the hundred thousandths place.
* 9 is in the millionths place.

No commas are used to help determine the groups on the right of the decimal point.  This is because the first group has only 2 digits.

In 0.000000073
* There are zeros in the tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, hundred thousandths, millionths, and ten millionths places.
* 7 is in the hundred millionths place.
* 3 is in the billionths place.

To determine the place values for numbers with digits on both sides of the decimal point, start in the middle (at the decimal point) and work in both directions.

In 281.906
* 1 is in the ones place..
* 8 is in the tens place..
* 2 is in the hundreds place..
* 9 is in the tenths place..
* 0 is in the hundredths place..
* 6 is in the thousandths place..

In 58.0317
* 8 is in the ones place...
* 5 is in the tens place...
* 0 is in the tenths place...
* 3 is in the hundredths place...
* 1 is in the thousandths place...
* 7 is in the ten thousandths place...

== Word Names ==
Word names are used to write or say numbers.  

=== Whole Numbers ===

A three digit whole number is written with the hundreds digit spelled out, followed by the word '''hundred'''.  If the tens digit is from 2 through 9, the appropriate tens word is next.  These tens words end with '''ty''', such as twenty and ninety.  After the tens word, the ones digit is spelled out.  However, if the tens digit is one, it is combined with the ones digit in a '''teen''' word, such as thirteen, or a variant such as eleven and twelve.  If any of the digits is zero, nothing is written for it.

Examples

* 285 is written two hundred eighty five.
* The word name for 402 is four hundred two.
* The word name for 560 is five hundred sixty.
* The word name for 85 is eighty five.
* The word name for 417 is four hundred seventeen.
* The word name for 6 is six.
* The word name for 0 zero.


For larger whole numbers, the digits in each three digit group are written as they would be, if they were alone.  This is followed by the group name.  If an entire group is made up of zeros, nothing is written for it.

Examples

* 482,912 is written four hundred eighty two thousand, nine hundred twelve.
* The word name for 3,060,200 is three million, sixty thousand, two hundred.
* The word name for 14,700,000,000 is fourteen billion, seven hundred million..
* The word name for 811,001 is eight hundred eleven thousand, one..

=== Decimals ===

For decimal numbers, the digits to the right of the decimal point are written as if there were no decimal point.  This is followed by the place value name of the furthest right digit.  (These place values all end in '''ths'''.)

Examples

* 0.925 is written nine hundred twenty five thousandths.
* The word name for 0.30704 is thirty thousand, seven hundred four hundred-thousandths.
* The word name for 0.06 is six hundredths.
* The word name for 0.1 is one tenth.

=== Mixed Decimals ===

The word names for numbers with digits on both sides of the decimal point have four parts.
# Write the digits on the left of the decimal point, as a whole number.
# Write the word '''and''' to represent the decimal point.
# Write the digits on the right of the decimal point, as a whole number.
# Write the place value name of the furthest right digit.

The word '''and''' is only used to represent the decimal point; it is never used in the word name of a whole number.

Examples
.
* 4.9 is written four and nine tenths.
* The word name for 267.158 is two hundred sixty seven and one hundred fifty eight thousandths.
* The word name for 3,000,000.000004 is 3million and 4 millionths.
* The word name for 12.9067 is twelve and 9 thousand sixty seven ten-thousandths.
* The word name for  5609.11 is five thousand,six hundred nine and eleven hundredt.hs</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pictograms and ideograms from some five thousand years ago represent the earliest known forms of graphic design. Traditionally, graphic design's purpose through history was the communication of ideas and meaning through the use of graphic elements like typography, photography, and illustration. Strictly an artistic enterprise in spirit, it stands apart from more traditional arts like painting, printmaking, and sculpture because its ubiquitous role it plays in mass media and technology. These factors and their associated pressures have come to define the utilitity in various parts of this field.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following is a transcript of a chat between Cheryl C., Warner F., and Hyung R. on October 10, 2005 using TappedIn
Room: WarnerF_Ofc 

HyungR joined the room. 

HyungR: hey guys 

WarnerF: How old are your kids, again? 

CherylCh: 6 1/2 (Robin) and 3 1/2 (Harris) 

WarnerF: Sounds like a handful (even when they are behaving!) 

CherylCh: true 

HyungR: i just came back from trying to help my dad start a dead SUV 

CherylCh: fun 

HyungR: what a way to spend my day off 

CherylCh: is he in your neighborhood? 

WarnerF: I take it that you were unsuccessful? 

HyungR: he's about 30 minutes away 

WarnerF: what a pain 

HyungR: we need a new battery 

HyungR: Frankemstein needs a new heart 

HyungR: C, how was your trip 

HyungR: ? 

CherylCh: fun! 

CherylCh: good football 

WarnerF: a bad day  for the blue and orange, though! 

HyungR: great...at least someone is experiencing some good football...the bears stink 

WarnerF :-( 

HyungR: W, hope your class went well today 

WarnerF: the bears always stink (just like the cubs!) 

HyungR: Watch it there, Springfield 

WarnerF: It was OK... the kids didn't behave very well, but the principal got to see that I know how to handle a class. 

CherylCh: I didn't realize you were being observed! 

WarnerF: today and tomorrow both! 

WarnerF: They're all tired and cranky from Homecoming this weekend 

HyungR: i bet. 

CherylCh: ugh!  I have never heard of it 2 days in a row. 

WarnerF: At least it'll be over. 

HyungR: C, I think you're the only one not being observed... i was last Friday...it's high stakes up here 

CherylCh: tenure for 13 1/2 years should cover it until the spring at least 

HyungR sits in envy 

WarnerF: If you're non-tenured, they have to have been observed by october so that they can begin remediation if necessary 

CherylCh: That is true here also, but not 2x in one week! 

WarnerF: This evaluation doesn't really count, because I'm tenured, and off-cycle 

HyungR: I keep forgeting that you're tenured... 

WarnerF gloats and rubs it in 

HyungR: i'll never be tenured 

CherylCh: Are you in the same district but a new school? 

WarnerF: yeah 

CherylCh: So, why the observations?  Doesn't he have some non-tenured teachers to bother? 

WarnerF: I wanted to make sure that he knew he's always welcome in my classroom, that I'm not afraid to be observed, and that just become I'm tenured doesn't mean I'm taking the easy way out with my lessons 

CherylCh: very noble of you.  I approve. 

HyungR: I thought you were just sucking up...jk 

WarnerF: plus, there's a huge emphasis on literacy, and he thinks that the social studies teachers blow it off 

CherylCh: H-were you being factecious (spelled wrong?), or do you only teach part time? 

HyungR: I started a new position in Wilmette this year teaching 7th grade 

HyungR: i have to start the whole tenure process again 

CherylCh: 4 years or only 2? 

HyungR: 4 

CherylCh: ugh! 

HyungR: no kidding...but the school actually adopted a new system of evaluating teachers and the admin only comes in 2x a year 

HyungR: the other two are informally done my mentoring teachers 

WarnerF: in some ways, that's even more intimidating 

CherylCh: interesting yet annoying at the same time when you have already taught for a number of years 

CherylCh agrees with Warner 

HyungR: i only have to have the informal ones done this year since I'm not really a first year teacher...or at least that was a par tof the agreement 

HyungR: i agree with you 

HyungR: boith 

CherylCh: I posted the last tapped in meeting 

HyungR: C, thanks for posting 

CherylCh: The rest of the project looks good. 

WarnerF: I agree... 

WarnerF: I looked at it when I got home from work today. 

CherylCh: I made a number of document changes that Norma wanted done. 

HyungR: Are we ok with the project? 

HyungR: like what? 

WarnerF: I figured you two wouldn't mind if I edited loose commas, dangling modifiers, and inconsistent verb tenses. 

WarnerF: I didn't change any words though- that all sounded fine 

HyungR: Thank you

CherylCh: format of the table of contents now has each topic numbered like everyone elses. 

CherylCh thanks you also! 

WarnerF: It looked really good. Thanks for doing that! 

HyungR: Cool, thanks 

HyungR: to the both of you 

WarnerF: If someone gets a chance, could they take a look at mine? I can never spot my own mistakes. 

CherylCh: I changed some page names so they linked with the book, something Norma said we didn't do. 

CherylCh: The only things that still remain are... 

HyungR: W, I can read your stuff tom. 

WarnerF: Thanks, H 

CherylCh: the last topic called blending online and face to face instructors and learners.  Are we keeping it or deleting it?  I vote delete as it seems repetative. 

HyungR votes to delete and agrees with C 

WarnerF: Should we delete it, or just put a small blurb saying that it's repetative? 

CherylCh: Also, I didn't pull all of your resources off of your pages, but they need to come off and be added to the giant resource list at the end of the table of contents. 

HyungR: Or should we repeat the info 

CherylCh: W-I kind of like that idea.  I like how you did the work section.  If you are volunteering to do it, go for it.  If not, delete it. 

WarnerF: It should probably just go at the end to be consistent 

WarnerF: I'll take care of it. I think I can even reference one of those articles. 

HyungR: thanks w 

CherylCh applauds loudly 

HyungR cheers and whistles 

WarnerF: btw, thanks again for that article on pedagogy, C, it was great. 

CherylCh: For the references, I just copied and pasted into the big one.  I think 2 articles were already listed there anyway.  Then go back and delete them from your page. 

WarnerF: Should we each take care of our own, or do you want me to do that? 

HyungR: So the resources are not suppose to appear on the individual sites? 

WarnerF: right 

HyungR: thanks just needed to clarify 

WarnerF: even though I think it's more helpful to a reader doing it our way 

CherylCh: I am glad you enjoyed the programme.  I did mine.  Yes H.  It doesn't take long.  I did the main page already. 

CherylCh: I agree W.  But... 

HyungR: ok, I can do that right after the chat, unless wiki is down again 

CherylCh: If it were a paper book, the resources would all be at the end.  I had to rethink it myself. 

HyungR: There might be a short list of resources from me , here just wasn't too much on the topic 

WarnerF: true, but they would also be in chapter notes, as well as in a bibliography 

CherylCh: Wiki was very slow today.  I tried to get everything done during nap time andit was like a race against time. 

CherylCh: W-spoken like a true English teacher.  (Clearly I didn't know that!) 

WarnerF: Thanks (I think) 

WarnerF smiles 

HyungR: Good thing W is in our group 

WarnerF: thanks, H 

WarnerF blushes 

CherylCh: I did read your work today and didn't notice any glaring problems by the way. 

HyungR: me or W 

CherylCh: both but I read before 3:00. 

CherylCh: Did either of you update after that? 

WarnerF: No, other than the edits. 

HyungR: No, I was running around like a mad man today 

CherylCh: I changed someone's numbered work into bullets.  I hope you didn't mind. 

WarnerF: Bullets are good. Thanks. (It was probably mine) 

HyungR: No, thery were mine 

CherylCh: Technically they are teal squares. 

WarnerF: Oh, whoops. 

CherylCh: Do you prefer numbers? 

HyungR: thanks C 

HyungR: no not really 

HyungR: they were jsut easier to remember 

CherylCh: ok, so are we done with that project except for the quick thing Warner is going to add?  I will add that into the table of contents btw. 

HyungR: thanks 

HyungR: C 

WarnerF: Thanks....you read my mind I was going to ask if someone could do that! 

HyungR: I can put the chat in the discussion 

CherylCh: Final plans are as follows: 

CherylCh: H posts t.i. 

WarnerF: check 

CherylCh: W adds last topic 

WarnerF: check 

CherylCh: C adds to table of contents 

HyungR: double chech 

HyungR: k 

CherylCh: W&amp;H get rid of references/move to giant list 

WarnerF: check 

HyungR: double check 

CherylCh: H&amp;C post to moodle about final project discussion as W already did 

WarnerF: I apologize for the tone of that posting, btw, I was pretty frustrated 

CherylCh: Anything I missed? 

WarnerF: I think we've got it all. 

HyungR: W, me too C, no, sounds like a plan 

CherylCh: Ok, then I am off to finish that and grade 10 stories and go to bed! 

CherylCh: Night! 

HyungR: good night 

CherylCh left the room (signed off). 

WarnerF: see you at chat tomorrow! 

HyungR left the room (signed off).

The follwing is a transcript of a chat between the 3 of us on October 6, 2005 using TappedIn.

CherylCh: That was annoying. 

WarnerF: What was? 

HyungR joined the room. 

HyungR: Hey guys 

CherylCh: I couldn't get in the office. 

WarnerF: I hate it when that happens 

CherylCh: Did either of you look at Whickerbill or Camtasia?  Would either be useful for our wonderful project? 

WarnerF: I thought wickerbill might be useful, particurarly for Hyung's part 

CherylCh: Could you summarize wickerbill? 

HyungR: C, was it easy finding some disadvantages 

HyungR: ? 

CherylCh: They were more opinion than fact, I think. 

WarnerF: Do disadvantaves have to be supported by the research, or is common sense enough? 

WarnerF: Or is that a dumb question? 

CherylCh: I went common sense. 

HyungR: i figure common sense...there isn;t enough research 

HyungR: oh...i did post the last conversation 

WarnerF: Funny, I was about to say there usually isn't enough common sense 

HyungR: what is the last characteristic that we have to put together? 

WarnerF: I noticed under references that one of the sources I was going to try to pick up on campus 

WarnerF: was online, so I'll check that out 

WarnerF: and the article C sent seems really good on Pedagogy 

HyungR: could you foward that to me as well? 

WarnerF: It seems like the stuff that we have to read before Tuesday's chat should be applicable as well 

WarnerF: I can send it to you if you want. 

CherylCh: I think it is from some Australian journal and calls b.l. a programme.  Its a bit annoying. 

HyungR: thanks 

WarnerF: The spelling kept bothering me 

CherylCh: I couldn't acces the readings for this week. 

WarnerF: I haven't tried it yet- 

HyungR: do you guys ahve comlumbus day off? 

WarnerF: No 

CherylCh: No!: 

WarnerF: We get Yom Kippur off instead 

CherylCh: Yes I do, but I was trying to respond to Warner's no with shock! 

WarnerF: It's politically incorrect in Champaign 

CherylCh: What a ridiculous trade off... The founder of  North America vs. a small Jewish population celebrating and I'm Jewish!

WarnerF: Since it celebrates the destruction of indigenous peoples 

WarnerF: The actual trade-off is that we don't get Pulaski day off either, 

WarnerF: and instead take Good Friday 

CherylCh: We  have both! 

CherylCh: When do you get out of school? 

WarnerF: June 1 

HyungR: middle of June 

CherylCh: Reminder:  the midterm is due October 12. 

HyungR: no a/c either 

WarnerF: At what time? 

WarnerF: midnight&gt; 

WarnerF: ? 

CherylCh: June 1 is a week earlier than us. 

CherylCh: I'd go midnight. 

HyungR: iis that wed? 

WarnerF: yes 

CherylCh: H-You have no air??  In Wilmette? 

CherylCh: Are you on the wrong side of the tracks? 

HyungR: yep, only the 6th grade wing has a/c ...they are located below the superindendent's office 

HyungR smiles 

WarnerF: How about I try to finish my stuff by Sunday night? (with a goal of getting most of it done Saturday) 

CherylCh: Both of you, Sunday night at what time? 

WarnerF: If it's not convenient for you, C, we could meet monday night 

HyungR: i will also try to get done by sun 

HyungR: yeah, that's not a problem C 

CherylCh: I will be around Sunday night! 

WarnerF: I just need to be sure that I get my editing done by Tuesday, because Wed. is Kol Nidre 

HyungR: enjoy the weekend 

HyungR: We'll dfinately be done on sun 

WarnerF: C, would you prefer to meet MOnday? 

WarnerF: that way, if you're running late, or tired, you don't need to stress. 

HyungR: W and I can start on the editing 

CherylCh: Do you want to meet then or just review each other's work and then meet Monday?  That way if you are running late we should all be ok? 

WarnerF: I know I'll have lots of stuff to edit on Hyungs (j/k) 

CherylCh smiles 

WarnerF: How about we review each other's work, and then meet Monday... 

HyungR: soudns good 

CherylCh: ok what time Mon? 

HyungR: any time is ok for me 

WarnerF: We can do final edits Monday night and finish up after chat Tuesday, so that we're done 

CherylCh: sounds great 

HyungR: good 

WarnerF: Can we say 8? 

CherylCh: yes 

HyungR: yep 

CherylCh: Ok, see you then.  Thanks!  Go IU! 

WarnerF: Later! 

CherylCh left the room (signed off). 




The following is a transcript of a chat between Cheryl C., Warner F., and Hyung R. on Sunday, October 2 using TappedIn.

Room: WarnerF_Ofc 

HyungR joined the room. 

WarnerF: I did find one or two printed resources, and if I have a chance, I'll try to get over to campus to get ahold of them, but this week's pretty busy. 

CherylCh: The few I read I used. 

HyungR: Hey guys 

CherylCh: I didn't explore much else yet. 

WarnerF: I read what you've posted, and it looked pretty good to me 

CherylCh: I meant on blended learning but I used them only on sync. and async. 

HyungR: sorry I'm late...i had some brats burnin on the Goerge foreman grill 

WarnerF: you cook your students? 

CherylCh: It was nice enough to grill outside today! 
 
CherylCh: I don't understand why they want us to use the discussion forum in the wiki when you can't all &quot;meet&quot; there. 

HyungR: i just saw the discussion board on the wiki site... 

HyungR: C- i think you had a good idea to put the disadvantages as well as the advantages 

CherylCh: I didn't really want to... 

WarnerF: So we're evaluating the characteristics, as well as describing them? 

CherylCh: I kind of felt like the assignment was to explain the characteristics and give them a positive spin... 

CherylCh: but Tony said we should cover both sides of the story. 

HyungR: that was the messege 

HyungR: i think that placing one or two on each site is fine 

WarnerF: I guess that makes sense. It's pretty easy for the characteristic I did this week, except that there isn't much published to back up what I say. The only thing I saw related to business, and suggested tailoring material to fit cultural norms 

CherylCh: advantages and disadvantages, if I didn't explain that clearly 

HyungR: W i think that you're right.. our descriptions will usually have the advantages imbedded in them. 

CherylCh: The total needs to be around 1500 words, so if there are 7 topics, how many words should we think about for each? 

CherylCh: Or should we not think that way? 

HyungR: we only have to look up the majopr disadvantages 

HyungR: I just posted the offline and online portion without the disadvantages. 

CherylCh: same here 

CherylCh: I can delete the phases part and add disadvantages. 

WarnerF: Why not leave the phases in.... 

WarnerF: there's a good chance that anyone who reads this will skip to lists like that anyway? 

CherylCh: Either way is fine.  It was very random that I found them. 

HyungR: I thought they were fine...i vote to leave them in as well 

CherylCh: I don't think I &quot;named&quot; the page right either, but I will look at Tony's directions again.  Phases stay. 

WarnerF: I didn't &quot;name&quot; my section either, as far as I know...I just used the link from our list in the intro 

HyungR: same here 

HyungR: for our next step... 

CherylCh: I am not sure, but I think there is something else to configure.  I put it into the forum questions but I still don't totally understand. 

HyungR: should each of us go on to another char... 

CherylCh: yes? 

WarnerF: I have to say, it's a good thing we've only got one chapter, instead of the original two. I'd never get this done 

HyungR: or should we edit the ones we have? 

CherylCh: I think we have to get started on both.  We only have 10 days to finish the whole thing. 

WarnerF: Would it be helpful if we each take another characteristic, and edit someone else's previous posting? 

CherylCh: yes and no 

WarnerF: that way, we catch each other's mistakes, and can ask for clarification. 

CherylCh: I agree on that part... 

CherylCh: but I did not read anything about your topics so could we save the editing until we finish all the parts first? 

WarnerF: We could... 

WarnerF: But our readers won't necessarily have read anything on these topics either... 

CherylCh: true.  I see your point. 

WarnerF: so if we edit them without background knowledge, we'll be able to figure out what makes sense, and what doesn't 

HyungR: for the sake of time, perhaps we should each start on another topic... 

HyungR: that way we can tackle the changes collectively 

CherylCh: first choices? 

HyungR: then we can be on the same page with the changes and save time 

WarnerF: no preference. I'll talk about the work/learning one in addition to what ever char. you want me to do 

CherylCh: Didn't we can that one for some reason?  I have it crossed out on my list. 

WarnerF: We did- but I think we need to explain why we're not talking about it more 

CherylCh: oh, because it was work and not education 

WarnerF: exactly 

HyungR: should we notify norma and tony via email or will this discussion be okay 

HyungR: ? 

WarnerF: I think the discussion should be sufficient 

CherylCh: I think the copy paste from last week is fine. 

HyungR: ok 

CherylCh: Is self-pace and live, collaborative learning the same as sync./async.? 

CherylCh: Or is it specific to group work? 

HyungR: btw- i'll vounteer to post again this week.  I think the both of you have more on your schedules 

CherylCh: thanks! 


WarnerF: thanks, H 

HyungR: w-that's the same thing i noticed 

CherylCh: Isn't this the idea of blended learning in the first place? 

WarnerF: looking at the topics, I think maybe there are really only four categories? 

HyungR: sorry, i'm trying to get back to the wiki page and read our c's 

CherylCh: W-List them. 

WarnerF: sturctured and unstructered learning sounds a lot like off-the shelf vs. custom content 

CherylCh: sorry, haven't read anything on either 

WarnerF: I'm just going by the titles 

WarnerF: self-paced and live collaborative sounds like asynch/synch and blending online/f2f 

HyungR: should we just create a sub headings for some of the c's that sound alike 

CherylCh: I just skimmed your wiki and LOVE your last line... 

CherylCh: Unfortunately, there does not seem to be much research on the subject. 

WarnerF: I was going to make it sound better, but I ran out of patience.... 

HyungR: some sub headings, sorry 

CherylCh: S and U learning may be different than the content topic.  It sounds more student based to me.  I can take it if you want if you don't want to see anything until Friday. 

WarnerF: there ISN&quot;T much research 

WarnerF: Sounds OK to me. 

CherylCh: Go for the work topic, as there is plenty to read. 

WarnerF: C- did the article from Dewar explain what they meant by each of these things? 

WarnerF: maybe the reference other stuff we could use in our descriptions? 

HyungR: So i'll take the self paced topic, unless we got rid of that one 

CherylCh: let me skim... 

CherylCh: no... 

HyungR: i'll be right back guys 

CherylCh: it lists them and then goes on to define bl and discuss the interest in it. 

WarnerF: I'll read it myself, then, so that I've at least got one reference for everything. 

CherylCh: I would like to find the Singh article and see what his/her explanations are. 

WarnerF: if nothing else, we can critique the categories 

WarnerF: On the other hand, if go by singh, 

HyungR: should we set the next meeting time? Thursday? 

CherylCh: I just pulled it up and it describes the topics a bit... 

HyungR: which topic again? 

HyungR: sorry 

CherylCh: but it doesn't list them all... 

WarnerF: I was thinking the same thing. 

WarnerF: in reference to meeting time 

HyungR: that way we can edit over the weekend 

CherylCh: and it seems like a vs. sy is very much like self-paced, etc. 

CherylCh: Ok, I will do my best! 

WarnerF: Should we revise the intro, so that it explains that scholars disagree over the characteristics? 

HyungR: yeah that sounds good 

CherylCh: We still have 2 topics besides what we are covering, I think.  I like that idea! 

CherylCh: Did you make your proposal for the &quot;big&quot; project idea yet? 

WarnerF: Could we take the last two, and explain that they are similar to other topics, or are only different in slight ways? 

HyungR: ok, just to clarify...are all three of us researching the last characteristics? 

WarnerF: I haven't had a chance to think about the big one 

CherylCh: Well, yes, except no on picked teh hideously named &quot;pedagogical models&quot; section. 

WarnerF: I didn't see that one in our list 

HyungR: hmm...i don't see that one there either C 

WarnerF: I'm guessing there's a lot on that topic (relatively speaking) 

WarnerF: It's probably safe to say that it's based on a higher-order thinking 

WarnerF: constructivist approach 

CherylCh: It includes blending constructivism, behaviorism, and cognitivims (Driscoll, 2002) 

WarnerF: since it leaves most of the responsibility on the student 

CherylCh: ignore spelling errors 

WarnerF: I don't see the bahaviourist aspects 

WarnerF: although the other two make sense 

CherylCh: That topic isn't on our intro so we will need to add it if we want to (or have to) discuss it. 

WarnerF: I hate to say it, but it sounds too crucial to leave it out.... 

WarnerF :-( 

CherylCh: Ok, then what did we decide to do for Thursday? 

CherylCh: I think I am doing structured and unstructured learning.  Right? 

WarnerF: I don't think I'll have to work to hard on the work/learning, so I'll tackle the pedagogical models, and if I can't get it done, you guys can help me out? 

CherylCh: No way!!!! 

HyungR: i'm doing self paced etc. 

CherylCh smiles 

WarnerF laughs 

HyungR: fine...i would feel guilty if i didn;t 

HyungR smiles 

WarnerF: So we have them all covered? 

CherylCh: I guess so. 

HyungR: we decided that asynch and synch were in self paced? 

CherylCh: They sound quite similar based on the Singh article.http://www.centra.com/download/whitepapers/blendedlearning.pdf 

HyungR: ok thanks C 

WarnerF: let's use that as our reference, I'll make sure we mention it in the intro,... 

HyungR: i;kk add that in there 

WarnerF: and then we can reiterate it in those sections 

HyungR: sounds good 

WarnerF: On another topci.... 

WarnerF: topic 

WarnerF: Hyung and I worked on a project with the 1918 flu for a workshop this summer.... 

WarnerF: We're trying to figure out if we can incorporate it into the project for this semester.... 

WarnerF: if we did something interdisciplinary, would you be interested in adding a science component? 

WarnerF: then we all turn in one big, interdisciplinary, integrated course proposal at the end of the semester. 

CherylCh: Hmmm.  That would be interesting.  I had some other ideas, but let me think about it.  Is our proposal due Wednesday?  And can it change? 

HyungR: i had no idea it was due Wednesday 

CherylCh: I will ask in moodle it can change and if some form of a proposal is due Wed. 

HyungR: anyway...thursdy sounds good with me 

WarnerF: Thursday works for me. 8 pm? 

HyungR: yep 

HyungR: C? 

CherylCh: fine! 

WarnerF: On the final project, I was thinking that I could probably do some sort of reading strategy, as well as a writing...maybe an interactive quiz, or something? 

WarnerF: cool, so Thursday at 8. 

HyungR: yep 

HyungR: thanks for the chat 

CherylCh: I don't know how to do any of that.  But I'd be willing to try. 

HyungR: i have a 

HyungR: feeeling 

WarnerF: Me neither, but it's an idea that can be adjusted. 

HyungR: W is looking in my direction 

CherylCh: do you know what to do? 

HyungR: sorry the &lt;enter&gt; key was stuck 

WarnerF: For Social Studies, Hyung and I talked about a map that the kids could mark up, with the data they find... 

HyungR: not really, but i know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy 

CherylCh laughs 

WarnerF: If I could add a reading/writing part, that would give us the Language Arts, 

WarnerF: and with the data, possibly math... 

CherylCh: I could add the disease itself and how it affects the body and spreads 

HyungR: cool 

WarnerF: you took the words right out of my mouth, C! 

WarnerF: no comments, hyung... 

HyungR smiles 

CherylCh: Did you read that novel about the flu epidemic? 

WarnerF: which one? 

CherylCh: maybe called 1913? 

WarnerF: By John Barry? Yeah... 

WarnerF: It was great! 

CherylCh: That is pretty much my historical knowledge of the epidemic. 

WarnerF: Although I'm thinking of a non-fiction book, actually 

CherylCh: That would be good for the high-schoolers. 

HyungR: well, i still have to plan the week( getting observed) i'll talk to you guys on Thursday.  
 
WarnerF: I'll look for the one you're talking about. 

WarnerF: Cool. See you later Hyung. 

CherylCh: Good night guys! 

CherylCh left the room (signed off). 

WarnerF: Good night! 

HyungR left the room (signed off). 

10/2/05 C&amp;W-Let's meet in Warnerf's office in TappedIn @ 8pm.  The discussion feature will not allow us to hold the covnersation that we need to have tonight.

10/2/05 Tony says both.

10/1/05
'''W and H'''- Do you think we are to discuss only the strengths of the characteristics, or should we include weaknesses as well?  Let me know what you think.


The following is a transcript of a chat between Cheryl C., Warner F., and Hyung R. on Tuesday September 27, 2005 using TappedIn.

2005.09.27 18:39:53 Login 

Room: WarnerF_Ofc 

HyungR joined the room. 

CherylCh: ok I am here now 

HyungR: hey guys, 

WarnerF: hey 

WarnerF: Did I miss much in the chat? 

HyungR: sorry i had to get off ellum...my mac won't let me be on both 

HyungR: no comments on the mac, warner 

CherylCh: Only that we are supposed to post all of our discussions on the wiki pages instead of by email 

WarnerF: too tired to make fun of you 

HyungR: we should post all of our stuff in wiki 

WarnerF: oops 

HyungR: no prob 

WarnerF: So what's our next hurdle? 

HyungR: should we think about dividing up the research and then coming together before each of us posts? 

CherylCh: It seems like we need to work on the week 6 stuff and then add more to the intro. 

CherylCh: I was thinking the same thing. 

WarnerF: That works for me. 

HyungR: is that the multimedia stuff? 

CherylCh: that is week 6 separate from the midterm 

CherylCh: Warner, did you get my email yesterday? 

WarnerF: With your thoughts on the intro? 

CherylCh: W-yes 

WarnerF: then yes. I really liked the way your divided stuff up 

WarnerF: I thought if we took out my second paragraph, and put in what you had, we'd be in good shape 

HyungR: w, did u email my yahoo or school account? 

CherylCh: Um, I think you missed an email or else I didn't send it.  Will you check it now and see if I sent it? 

CherylCh: I sent all through uiuc. 

WarnerF: h- I sent it to yahoo 

WarnerF: I'll check UIUC right now 

CherylCh: I read an article that basically restated what you had already done was correct and my criteria was wrong. 

CherylCh: Interesting, but wrong according to Norma. 

HyungR: w, hmmm....i've been checking....i don't remember getting it 

CherylCh: I know the attachment is called warner intro. 

WarnerF: I see it. All of that sounds OK to me. Thanks for doing the reference-checking 

HyungR: hold on for just a sec guys...i'm checking my email accounts 

CherylCh: Should we divide the work by the 8 characteristics listed?  Let's give Hyung all the hard ones since he can't find the email. 

WarnerF: I think that's the best idea i've heard all day 

WarnerF smiles 

CherylCh: How is Africa? 

WarnerF: OK- it turns out that high schoolers know even less than middle schoolers 

CherylCh: Excellent. 

HyungR: C, i can still see what you're writing :) 

WarnerF: I'm doing a lot of read-alouds, 

CherylCh: Did you look at the Tire Tracks site?  I was looking at it today and it has a ton of resources.

WarnerF: I keep meaning to check it out. Right now, I'm still trying to stay a day ahead of the kids...I'm back to 12 hour days in the building, and then bringing work home. 

HyungR: ok, i have Cheryl's with no attachment and Warner's in my uiuc account 

CherylCh: ugh!  Are the kids ok at least? 

WarnerF: This time of year always hits me like a ton of bricks (you'd think I'd learn!) 

CherylCh: H-I will send it to you now, but you still get the hard parts. 

HyungR smiles 

WarnerF: mostly their OK. I've got one class full of VERY sophomoric sophomores 

CherylCh: What email address should I use?' 

HyungR: me or warner? 

CherylCh: you 

HyungR: uiuc, i guess . to keep everything in order 

HyungR: thanks C 

CherylCh: ok, but what is it?  I had you two nicknamed together but not separately 

WarnerF: tweedle dum and tweedle dee? 

HyungR: hyungro@uiuc.edu 

WarnerF: (I'm tweedle dee!) 

HyungR: do you see what i have to put up with? 

HyungR: C, are u sure u wnat to joing  up with us? jk 

WarnerF: I don't know about you two, but if I don't laugh my way through this course, I'll need to book myself a padded room 

CherylCh: I sent the email by the way. 

CherylCh: W-Are you in the accelerated program? 

HyungR: me too...C, i'll check now 

WarnerF: I would not have called that extra course fun 

CherylCh: There have to be easier courses for you to move up with, but I do feel like I have learned a lot of things I can actually apply. 

CherylCh: Are you both going to graduation in May? 

WarnerF: I'll probably be in town, unless it's the same weekend as a wedding that I'm in 

CherylCh: May 14, Mother's Day weekend. 

WarnerF: I'd like to go, and see everyone 

WarnerF: I'll be there 

ErikP joined the room. 

CherylCh: ok I am back.  I told you he's quick 

CherylCh: Who is our new friend? 

WarnerF: I'm impressed 

ErikP: I'm just trying to figure this space out. 

WarnerF: cool 

WarnerF: we're using it to put together a group project for a grad course we're taking 

ErikP: How do you set up an office? 

WarnerF: It's been awhile, but I think it's through the registration process 

CherylCh: hmmmm.  It has been a while.  The help desk is very helpful. 

ErikP: I need one for a discussion I'm hoping to host tomorrow afternoon. 

WarnerF: have you tried the help desk? they're usually pretty good 

ErikP: I'll ask the help desk.  Thanks. 

WarnerF: no problem. Sorry we couldn't be more help 

HyungR: hehe...C, what were you comments on the 2nd paragraph? 

CherylCh: I have to pull it up, hold please... 

WarnerF: I like the way your reworded it 

CherylCh: I just changed it from the business wording that Warner had to something much more generic. 

HyungR: yeah, good idea...W, does get a little technical sometimes :) 

WarnerF: I like the flow of it, though. plus it gives us more room to expand 

ErikP left the room. 

CherylCh: that was odd for someone just to pop in, don't you think? 

WarnerF: very strange 

HyungR: yep 

HyungR: wait, can he pop back in? 

WarnerF: We don't have a way to lock others out 

CherylCh: I think so, but he only sees what he is here for 

WarnerF: he figured out how to get an office though. He's online in his office. 

WarnerF: I say next time, he gets to bring the food 

CherylCh: I am glad we could help him.  :-) 

CherylCh: Maybe we should go to his office and ask how he set it up. 

WarnerF: It's a thought 

CherylCh: ok, can I work on synchronous and asynchronous communication methods? 

WarnerF: anyway... 

WarnerF: sure 

HyungR: sounds good 

CherylCh: any first choices for either of you? 

WarnerF: I think custom vs. off the shelf content could be interesting 

HyungR: which one is more efficient? 

CherylCh: yours Warner! 

WarnerF: we should all probably take two and work on the others together 

CherylCh: ok 

CherylCh: Hyung do you have a first choice? 

HyungR: no 

WarnerF: I'm wondering if we really need to talk about the learn and work one, though, since that probably applies to busines 

CherylCh: great point - Should we delete it from the intro? 

WarnerF: Maybe we should just mention that it exists but isn't a factor for K-12? 

CherylCh: good 

HyungR: sure. 

HyungR: there are only 4 topics then, tight? 

HyungR: right? 

WarnerF: I'll look into it briefly, so we can cite a source that backs us up on it 

CherylCh: by the way, we should be having these discussions in wiki &quot;discussions&quot; so they can see that we are actually working 

HyungR: cut an paste 

HyungR: ? 

HyungR: if you want I can cut an paste some of the transcript and post it onto the dicussion 

WarnerF: that would be great. 

CherylCh: ok 

HyungR: i'll have to do that tomorrow 

CherylCh: Remaining topics to either collaborate or divide: 

WarnerF: So, with the one point cut out, that leaves 3 for each of us, with one that we all do? 

CherylCh: I only count 7 now total 

CherylCh: 2 for each and one collaborative? 

WarnerF: I think we can do that. 

HyungR: ♣ 

HyungR: ♣ 

HyungR: ♣ 

HyungR: ♣ 

HyungR: ♣ 

WarnerF: ? 

CherylCh: What is that? 

CherylCh: a lucky 3-leaf clover? 

WarnerF: the four of clubs? 

HyungR: i tried to cut and paste 

HyungR: the bullet points from the intro 

WarnerF: I think you have to wait for the transcript to be e-mailed to you 

WarnerF: oh, i see 

CherylCh: good attempt 

HyungR: my bad 

WarnerF: The final thing is due on the 12th, right? 

HyungR: off and online learning 

CherylCh: yes.  That doesn't give us much time as far as I am concerned 

CherylCh: Is that your choice or are you listing them 

CherylCh: ? 

HyungR: ♣ 

HyungR: arrgghh 

WarnerF: We will be a bit crunched. Can we meet one evening next week ready with our first one? 

HyungR: i'm trying to list them 

WarnerF: Why don't we put the list on the wiki (it'll make them happy) and then just sign up for them there 

CherylCh: Either Sunday night or Thursday night next week? 

WarnerF: I personally don't have a preference about any of the others 

HyungR: W and C, which one do you have  again...i/'m trying to determine which one to reserach 

WarnerF: Either is good for me 

HyungR: ? 

WarnerF: I've got custom or off the shelf content 

CherylCh: Does the self-paced,etc go with sync/async?  I'm sync/async. 

CherylCh: I have no preference for the others either. 

WarnerF: hyung says he's having trouble typing on the white board at the moment 

WarnerF: (I think he cut himself with the scissors...all that cutting and pasting) 

HyungR: ok, finally...i have off and online learning 


HyungR: when are we meeting again 

WarnerF: If we could be ready to go with our first bits on Sunday night, 

HyungR: ? 

CherylCh: What is your first bit H? 

WarnerF: then we could have all of the next week on the second 

WarnerF: with several days to put the final touches in place 

HyungR: online and offline learning 

CherylCh: I like the timeline. 

HyungR: ok, but i have to go downtown on sat...getting rehap onmy ankel 

HyungR: ankle 

WarnerF: That's Ok... 

WarnerF: I'll only have sunday to work on it, 

CherylCh: Sunday after 8 sometime? 

WarnerF: but if I spend the afternoon, then I'll be ready by sunday night 

HyungR: sounds ok 

WarnerF: where do we meet? I've not really done the wiki chat thing 

HyungR: well, i'll see how the editing goes on the trascript, but should we saw Ti for now, WArnerF's office 

HyungR: ? 

CherylCh: If we go to the wiki and click on our chapter, there is a discussion board 

HyungR: ok 

HyungR: i'll post this chat there 

WarnerF: the discussion board works for me then, and if we don't like it, we can come back here, then cut and paste again 

CherylCh: Did we pick our second topic?  Or should we do that on Sunday night? 

HyungR: i thought there were 4 topics 

WarnerF: let's tackle that sunday night...we can keep our eyes open for related stuff as we search for the first one, then we can help each other out 

HyungR: ok sounds good 

CherylCh: fine with me.  what time on Sunday?  At 8, or later?  I prefer before 10. 

HyungR: 8 is good with me 

WarnerF: definitely before 10.... 

WarnerF: 8 should be good 

HyungR: alright, thanks guys...this group is a lot more relaxed than my previous ones 

CherylCh: ok, and if we aren't done, we are on our own timeline at this point so it is no big deal 

HyungR: ok good night...see you on sunday 

CherylCh: Mali or Ghana? 

WarnerF: I could go on with this all night 

WarnerF: Ghana, and the trading empires 

CherylCh: It is a good break. 

WarnerF: I think we'll do a semantic map 

CherylCh: Did you talk about the stools yet, or is that in Mali? 

CherylCh: Stools to sit on/ 

WarnerF: I'm not sure, but I'll look it up, since I have to cover them both 

CherylCh: It's not a real exciting curriculum.  Do you cover South Africa?  We read a book called &quot;Waiting for the Rain&quot; that details apartheid.  I can send you a copy and then 200 more if you like it.  We dropped it this year. 

CherylCh: Are you posting the intro into the wiki? 

WarnerF: I'll see if we've got it in the book room. We spend a pretty good chunk of time on South Africa 

WarnerF: I can if you want me to 

WarnerF: Do I need to reformat the references? 

CherylCh: Go for it.  The links you had originally?  Maybe, or maybe not until we post them in the reference section later?  I have no opinion either way. 

WarnerF: other than my own, that is? 

WarnerF: cool. I'll take care of it. 

WarnerF: I&quot;ll talk to you all on Sunday! Good night! 

CherylCh: &quot;See&quot; you Sunday.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Max and Steve: what started as a few changes turned into a significant re-write. I hope I maintained the integrity of the original. In general, I was trying to be direct, use the active voice and frame the section in terms of the definition of instructional design as a process. My thinking is that we can use that structure, analysis, delivery system, materials &amp; activities and evaluation, for the chapter. Perhaps it is my equivocation nature, but I shied away from assertions like &quot;fool proof&quot; or &quot;poor planning is &lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt; (emphasis mine) reason...

My fear is that all I have accomplished is prose butchery and lost focus. If so, we can reinstate a previous version or modify this one.

I just reviewed what I wrote last night. My transition from the second to the third para is weak. I'l work on it. - G

 Does this section fit? {It is important to determine your role as a K-12 teacher in the learning process. Should it be one that is primarily directive or facilitative? Also, decide the importance of interaction amongst the students. These questions may be answered differently depending on the grade level being taught. In any event, blended learning lends itself to learner-centered, teacher-guided (as opposed to teacher-directed), interactive, and student-collaborative learning.}</text>

[[image:Gmail-search.png|right]]
Searching mail is the greatest benefit of Gmail!  Using Google's search interface, it's quick and easy to find messages.

Take a peek at the two buttons to the left of the entry bar:  There's a button to &quot;Search Mail&quot; and a button to &quot;Search the Web.&quot;  This makes it easy to enter a phrase and hit the search mail button.  Then if nothing's found in your mail history, hit the search the web button and, well, search the web for the phrase.

'''Search Options'''

Searching Gmail, just like Google, can be very simple  or very sophisticated.

[[Category:Gmail]]


The &quot;Search the Web&quot; button has been removed.  
There is a petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/gmail001/ to bring it back.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''TeX''' is a language used to typeset documents, especially ones containing mathematics. It has both programming and mark-up features. In this book we will describe &quot;primitive TeX&quot;&amp;mdash;the basic engine for the macro languages [[w:TeX|plain TeX]], [[w:LaTeX|LaTeX]], [[w:ConTeXt|ConTeXt]], and so on. If you are new to TeX, then this is probably ''not'' what you want to read: you may be looking for [[LaTeX]], a macro package for TeX that makes it easier to produce standard documents.

TeX is [[w:Donald Knuth|Donald Knuth]]'s macro language, written to typeset documents. TeX can in principle be used for any kind of program (it is a ''[[w:Turing completeness|Turing complete]]'' programming language).

=== Other sources ===
The canonical source for learning the TeX language, both to write documents and to program, is the ''TeXbook'' by Donald Knuth. There's also a  comprehensive programmer's reference called ''[http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt/ TeX by topic]'' which the author has generously made available free at his website as well as [[/TeX for the Impatient/]].

==The Structure of TeX==
We describe the basic anatomy of TeX: the registers, the parameters, and other resource that affect the processing of a TeX source file.

===Basic Definitions===
;Badness : A measure of the quality of the spacing for a typeset line of text.
;baseline:
;hbox :
;overfull error : TeX couldn't produce a result that doesn't overfill a box, and has given up. There is usually a hyphenation or justification problem: moving the last word on the line to the next line would make the spaces in the line wider than the current limit; keeping the word on the line would make the spaces smaller than the current limit, so the word is left on the line, but with the minimum allowed space between words, and which makes the line go over the edge.
;underfull error : TeX couldn't produce a result that appropriately fills a box, and has given up. TeX cannot stretch the line wide enough to fit, without making the spacing bigger than its currently permitted maximum. The badness (0-10,000) indicates how severe this is.

===Boxes===
The concept of a ''box'' is fundamental to TeX. Boxes represent the content that make up a typeset page.  For example, letters, lines of text, paragraphs, mathematical formula and its composite symbols are all conceptually just boxes that TeX pastes together to build the page, which itself is also a box. Boxes are often composed of smaller boxes.

Each box has a number of properties that TeX uses to paste the boxes together using various algorithms. These are:
;baseline : This is a horizontal line that vertically divides the box.
;height  : The distance from the baseline to the top of the box.
;depth  : The distance from the baseline to the bottom of the box.
;width  : The horizontal length of the box.
;reference point  : The point where the baseline joins the left side of the box.

As an example, the letter 'a' is placed in a box so that is sits directly on the baseline; while letters such as 'p', 'g', or 'j' extend below the baseline. When TeX is building a line of ordinary text, all the baselines are aligned, and so a line of characters is positioned as one would expect. Font designers determine how to place each glyph within its respective box.

===Glue===
While boxes represent the contents of a page, ''glue'' represents the white space that fits in between boxes, and as TeX is building the page this glue can expand or contract to allow the contents to be positioned optimally. This glue is eventually 'set' after which it can no longer adjust--it's just fixed white space.

Many types of predefined glues exist to meet the different needs that can arise with typesetting.

===Modes===
At each point in the processing of a source file, TeX is in one of the following ''modes'':
*[[TeX/definition/modes/Vertical mode|Vertical mode]]
*[[TeX/definition/modes/Internal vertical mode|Internal vertical mode]]
*[[TeX/definition/modes/Horizontal mode|Horizontal mode]]
*[[TeX/definition/modes/Restricted horizontal mode|Restricted horizontal mode]]
*[[TeX/definition/modes/Math mode|Math mode]]
*[[TeX/definition/modes/Display math mode|Display math mode]]
How TeX interprets the source file depends on the current mode.

===Macros===

===Fonts===

===Math Fonts===

===Hooks===

==TeX Algorithms==
===Tokenization===

===Expanding Macros===

===Setting the Glue===

===Line Construction===

===Page Construction===

===The Construction of Mathematical Formulas===

===The Construction of Tables===

===Hyphenation===

===Output===

==TeX Keywords==
TeX has 25 ''keywords''. These words have no backslash before them, and they are not case-sensitive. TeX interprets each of these words as a keyword only in certain contexts.

==TeX Primitives==
Here we describe each of the 323 TeX primitive control sequences. Each entry gives a synopsis, description, and examples. The synopsis gives the proper syntactical context of the control sequence. For example,
&lt;pre&gt;
\pretolerance=&lt;integer&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
gives the syntax of one of TeX's integer parameters. In the source file, the &lt;integer&gt; needs to be replaced by an actual integer as described in the 'description' section of the entry [[TeX/pretolerance|\pretolerance]]. In general anything of the form &lt;...&gt;, where the ellipse is some descriptive word, needs to be replaced by something appropriate; the 'description' section will tell you what is allowable.

Sometimes part of the syntax is optional, this is indicated by placing it in between brackets, as in
&lt;pre&gt;
\ifmmode &lt;TeX code 1&gt; [\else &lt;TeX code 2&gt;] \fi
&lt;/pre&gt;
which gives the syntax of one of TeX's if-then-else control structures. The brackets here indicate that '\else &lt;TeX code 2&gt;' need not be included in actual use. In either case, the brackets should not be used in actual use.

This is a textbook in the United States (primarily federal) law of employment discrimination. It is designed primarily for undergraduate students who have an interest in the field, not for law school students who would require a more detailed analysis of the statutes and cases involved.

The text assumes a basic familiarity with such legal concepts as common law reasoning, the creation of statutes, the fundamentals of contract and tort, etc.

Kenneth Schneyer (a.k.a. kschneyer), Professor of Legal Studies at Johnson &amp; Wales University, began work on this wikibook on September 29, 2005.

To maintain consistency, contributors should name each new page &quot;EmplDiscr xxxxx&quot;, where &quot;xxxxx&quot; is the name of the new page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Employment discrimination has become one of the most prominent areas of modern litigation. Businesses are sued more often by their employees than by any other category of litigant -- more than by competitors, customers or regulators. The great majority of those lawsuits by employees involve the accusation of employment discrimination. The threat of employment discrimination lawsuits has changed the nature of the employment relationship and caused employers to implement safeguards, procedures and technicalities they would have never considered fifty years ago. Further, discrimination has entered the popular consciousness as a legal concept much more successfully than many older (and, in daily life, arguably more important) legal concepts or categories.
Employment discrimination is a representative case of how common law concepts can be revolutionized by single statutory enactments. While other laws influenced the development of employment discrimination, it is largely Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that began the sweeping changes in business and public attitude.

{{/Preamble}}
{{/Introduction}}
{{/A note to professionals}}

== A 'Persona' is Socially Savvy ==
A persona is a social mask. You create it out of your strengths and wear it in public. 
When you 'get to know' a stranger, what you reveal sends a message.
If you want to pursue a friendship, the conversation move toward what you have in common. If you dislike them you do not discuss commonalities with them.
This allows two people to avoid humiliation from social rejection. there was no rejection. just a lack of common interests.
Do not create a complex or fraudulent persona. 
You want to be consistent and comfortable in different situations. 
Your social mask will be awkward initially. Pay attention to the way people react to you. 
When you become familiar with your persona, you'll relax into the role. 
The top 'likeable' characteristics are cheer, calm, competence, cooperation and confidence. People do not want smart friends. They want kind and mellow friends. 

Words are huge and concrete to me. Words are neither huge nor concrete in actuality.
People use words as tools to accomplish a task. They tell outrageous stories for entertainment. The meaning is clear in the eyes of the speaker. The meaning cannot be found in the words. 
Most people do not think an untrue statement is a lie. They have a point. Fairy Tales are all lies in a story of profound truth. 
Society is a big picture. you lose friends by focusing on details. Make friends with an entire person. The good and the bad exist in everyone.  

Small talk is unimportant. 
You need a response when someone asks you about yourself.
Come up with a three sentence description that makes you sound superb. Be truthful and promote yourself shamelessly. Your interest is not acceptable to discuss in a social situation. 
Keep behind your persona around strangers. 
Talk about pastries and the weather while making eye contact. 
The eyes will let you know if someone can be trusted.
Sometimes they are honest, but not often. This does not means they are bad or untrustworthy. They don't care about the words.  

People are all different. People who like each other become more and more alike by spending time together. Don't rush or push people. 
We are very intense. This scares people. Be very gentle and calm and your focus will be welcome instead of intrusive.
Good Luck.
Practice, practice, practice.

== Positive things about being on the autistic spectrum ==
This is an extension of the [http://www.autismandcomputing.org.uk/marc2.en.html#looking Looking on the Bright Side] section of Marc's book.
* Being on the autistic spectrum means that any social skills you want to learn have to be learned manually rather than developing them naturally.  You may find however that some of these social skills aren't particularly constructive and in this case it is possible to learn better social skills than non-autistic people have available to them, especially when socialising with other people on the autistic spectrum.
* Being on the autistic spectrum means you are likely to have a different emotional range to most other people.  While this may occasionally cause you problems in some areas Autistic First Aiders, Doctors, Emergency workers and Managers have found this to be advantageous in certain situations as they are able to continue to make good decisions in situations where NT's have become incapable of functioning, or at best have highly impaired judgement.

== More distortions of the truth ==
This is an extension of the [http://www.autismandcomputing.org.uk/marc2.en.html#distortions Distortions of the Truth] section of Marc's book.
* &quot;Debate framing&quot; is a particularly nasty form of manipulation described in a book called &quot;Don't think of an Elephant&quot;. The idea is to change the context of a debate to put it in a light favourable to one side.  Some examples of this are:
** The premise, theme or synopsis of the book is that the attacks of 9/11 were promoted as an act of war by the Bush administration rather than a crime, and that in this context, justice, the rule of law and due process do not apply as they would if it were a crime, thereby giving the Bush administration an excuse to launch wars on those they wanted to.
** Due to the architecture of western society, the measure of a person's worth is typically how well they obey orders in school and in the workplace, despite any other qualities they may have.
** Some more really good examples can be found in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A_survival_guide_for_people_on_the_autistic_spectrum&amp;action=history history] of this document, where [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.15.133.159 certain individuals] keep [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A_survival_guide_for_people_on_the_autistic_spectrum&amp;diff=1156630&amp;oldid=1156616 rephrasing and distorting] the first example given above.

= Dealing with Bipolar Disorder =
* Bipolar Disorder is a mood disorder that can ruin the lives of even non-autistic people.
* Autistic spectrum people are much more likely than non-autists to have it.
* It is a progressive disorder with a genetic basis that is usually first triggered by traumatic experiences.  It may then progress from amplified mood swings that become wilder, to spontaneous mood swings which come closer and closer together.
* Stress and commitment usually makes the disorder progress.
* Like autism, it can have its creativity benefits.
* Like autism, there is no cure, and treatment has its health risks and occasionally makes things worse.
* Like autism, it is said that the best way to treat it is to understand it.
* Like autism, progress has been made in recent years that many practitioners have not caught up with yet.
* If you think that you might be bipolar, it is much better to address it sooner than later, because this disorder does not regress.
* This section does not constitute medical advice.  Not only are there medical and medicinal treatments but support groups, books and plenty of researched information on the web to help.

= Understanding the Western World =
NOTE:  This section is based on the works of [[w:John_Taylor_Gatto]], which in turn are based on documented history.  He writes very well on this subject and is well worth reading.  In particular I recommend visiting his website [http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/ JohnTaylorGatto.com], and googling for transcripts of the following of his speeches since they are not on that site.
== John Taylor Gatto google queries ==
* [[google:&quot;The+following+is+the+text+of+a+speech+by+John+Taylor+Gatto+accepting+the+New+York+City+Teacher+of+the+Year+Award+on+January+31,+1990.+It+is+reprinted+from+the+Iowa+State+Newsletter.&quot;]].
* [[google:&quot;The+Six+Lesson+Schoolteacher&quot;| Six Lesson Schoolteacher]].
* [[google:&quot;We+Need+Less+School+Not+More&quot;]].

== The Compulsory School System ==
* This section is a brief summary of the information JTG talks about, since the following sections build upon them.
* The first known public schools were created by the pre-Sumerian peoples to create more time &amp; general efficiency for adults so that they could partake in a larger society without overworking or becoming worn out. This extra time &amp; new interconnected social system allowed for more successful engineering, weapon construction &amp; war waging.  
* The compulsory school system has largely evolved from ideas to build a society that were first articulated 2400 years ago in &quot;Plato's Republic&quot;.
* Plato's Republic reasons that to make a society work best, peoples family and community links need to be broken so that society becomes their family and their community.
* Furthermore, it reasons that people need to specialise even in certain undesirable professions that are necessary for a society to work.
* These basic concepts were finally implemented in such a way that they actually worked by the Prussian monarchy, and adopted in the US in the 1850's.
* The way that the concepts are currently implemented are as follows:
** Make school compulsory.  This has the effect of demonstrating to the child and the parents that the state is a more powerful influence in the child's life than the parent.
** Divide children by age and ability so that no lasting friendships form.
** Occupy the child's time with boring things with little meaning for the first few years so that the child doesn't develop an interest in learning, or loses whatever interest they have.  Above all, make the easy look hard.
** Make it difficult for children to question authority.  Make them raise hands to ask a question.  All decisions are final.
** Make children compete amongst themselves for marks and for the teachers favour.
** Since the children with the highest marks have a demonstrated ability to do as they are told, they are permitted to advance into higher learning.
** The people that higher learning churns out are indoctrinated into professions that have their own checks and balances to make sure that practitioners don't stray too far out of government control.
* The desired and produced effect of this is that the school system churns out children who are workforce, citizenship and consumer ready, not because they know how to work, but because they are predictable, willing to obey orders, loathe to question and don't have the life skills to escape the situation.

== The Implications for Autistic People ==

{{/Developing Social Learning Skills}}
{{/Survival Strategies}}
{{/Suggestions for Autistic Spectrum community building}}

== Random Notes ==
* This section is where I often dump thoughts I believe could aid in the development of this guide.  They are not well thought out.
=== Cracking the social skills and connection problems ===
* This problem is much, much deeper than it at first looks.
* You will not get a substantial break from people by explaining the problem.
* You will not get substantial information from people unless you get truthful answers from well thought out questions.
* With the rise of the internet and technology, aspie traits are proving useful to people and because of that, accommodations are often made for odd behaviour which may lead many autistic spectrum people to believe that things are getting better, which they are not, or that they don't have a social skills problem at all.
* The creative nature of autism does not actually improve peoples lives in the way that some autistic spectrum people believe.  People still have to work the same amount of time as they did hundreds of years ago in circumstances that are just as stressful and demeaning, whether it's doing a job manually or with machines that multiply productivity and people usually still have to pay to receive most of the things that autistic people contribute to society.
* The impression people seem to have of autistic people in successful careers is one of wealth and success who are just as much players in the pecking order as anybody else.
* The impression people seem to have of autistic people who aren't, is that of someone who is mentally ill and that of being a dead weight to society.

=== Autists vs non-autists ===
* Autistic people can &quot;connect&quot; if they have common interests.  Outside of that, the communication problems can be just as difficult as between autists and non-autists.
* It is possible for autists and non-autists to &quot;connect&quot; as long as both parties can compensate for each others communication weaknesses.
* The work required by both parties to get to this point can be enough of a mind bender to make it difficult for a person to be able to communicate with their own kind if they make habits of the communication techniques that make this possible.
* Non-autistic people tend to learn by example and memorise by rote repetition.
* Autistic people learn by being able to find accurate visualised representations of the lesson, and gain faith in those visualisations by seeing them work in action.
* Non-autistic people tend to get all aspects of social interaction 50-99% right all the time.
* Autistic people can get aspects 100% right or 200% wrong, yet rarely, if ever will an autistic person be able to achieve 50% of all of them.
* Non-autistic people seem to make a game of judging each other by how close they get to 100% (see section on confidence).  This may be at least part of the reason that it is difficult to get explanations out of non-autistic people.  It can be seen as an attempt to cheat the game.
=== Random, as yet unstructured thoughts ===
* It is necessary to let some negative emotions &quot;radiate&quot;.  If you don't permit yourself to do this sometimes, things can reach a boiling point and explode inappropriately.
* Nice Guy Syndrome:  XXX
* Although autistic people seem to be incapable of reading the emotions of others, the emotions they express are VERY readable by others.  The confusion others have in reading those emotions are in the fact that the emotions often don't make sense.  This is true in reverse too.
* Fear and aggression are emotions that are communicated across species, and between autistic and non autistic people.  They are &quot;reliable emotions&quot;.
* The relationships between sociopaths and autists, and sociopaths and non-autistics are likely to be worth exploring.
=== Oddities ===
* Suicide was once a crime in many parts of the world.
* Assisting suicide is still a crime in many parts of the world.
* Driving a person to suicide has never been a crime legally.
* Why do people respect peoples graves more than their lives?
* Why do scientists ask &quot;are we alone&quot; when human communication has such barriers?
* In science fiction stories, why does it virtually always become very clear very quickly whether the aliens are friendly or not?

=== JWM ===

I found out that I was an aspie at the age of 30 and although the initial experience was enjoyable because it explains a lot that has happened in life, it has not made much difference to my quality of life since people would still treat me as less important despite the effort I made to contribute positively to other peoples lives.

My first reaction was &quot;OK, now you know you have to explain things to me verbally and literally.  Get it?  Good.&quot;  This simply doesn't work in the real world.  I then tried a succession of new strategies that were designed to force some sort of communication with the people around me.  This only succeeded in upping the ante invested in the problem.  The main strategy I had going was to find my less than useful habits and one by one expunge them from my system in favour of something new.  In retrospect, this was &quot;regression&quot; and I think it was a good way to deal with the issues in the long run.

I finally decided to solve the problem once and for all by facing my communication issues head on.  I planned to do this by bypassing the people around me who all seemed to be rather crazy and by going to pubs at the end of the week to try to develop my social skills with &quot;fresh blood&quot;, but found that with each new hard learnt skill the problem just kept getting deeper and deeper.  Furthermore, I found that with each mistake, more and more people would avoid me, and people would have a much lower tolerance for bad social skills.

At this point, I rethought the strategy and decided to seek information from the web.  Realising that there was plenty of information about autism from a non-autistic perspective, I went looking for information that autistic spectrum people could use, finding nothing but a handful of advertisements for books, and to Marc Segars Survival Guide.

His book contains such detailed and useful information that it astounds me that a person could learn what he did in 23 years, let alone my 35, and I despair to learn that he has died.  Yet I found that his approach triggered memories of my childhood and how I had developed certain thought processes that had helped me to learn and survive family, school and work life, albeit badly.

After much research and study, even with the limited resources available, I began to realise that the non-autistic thought processes are far more complex than people make them out to be and there is in fact a great yawning gap in human knowledge about it.  Yet there is a great deal of consistency in it too.

So, armed with some basic factoids, much of which had been gleaned from reading between the lines of non-autistic peoples comments about autistic spectrum people, I set about figuring out exactly what it is that non-autistic people are doing.  My new strategy included watching the social interaction in drama and in reality TV.  This was a much more fruitful strategy.  By Big Brother Australia 2006, I was successfully predicting the outcome of every interaction.  The sections on &quot;self confidence&quot; are the culmination of this.

People say that it wasn't an accident that killed Marc Segar at all and that he committed suicide.  I have no trouble believing that this may be true.  His entire passion in life must have been in hammering his way through this concrete mountain that separates non-autistic people from autistic spectrum people.  When he &quot;got there&quot; he must have been exasperated at the disinterest and negative reactions he received from those he was writing for.

In many ways this book is as much for my benefit as anybody elses.  The lessons I've learned in life are too hard to learn and too easy to forget.

Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Bile_duct|Bile Duct]] section for more information. Some papers report jointly on bile duct and gall bladder cancers.


==Overview==
*Incidence: 1.1 per 100,000 in U.S. with 5,000 annual cases reported via SEER
*Surgery primary treatment, but only minority resectable
*Reports generaly limited to single institution experience


*'''SEER 1973-03''' [http://astro2005.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2074.pdf ASTRO Abstract] ''Conditional Survival of Gallbladder Adenocarcinoma Treated with Radiotherapy: Analysis from the SEER Database'' ('''2005 Fuller''' CD, 2005 ASTRO, Abstract #2074)
**850 histologically confirmed GB cases, who received RT as part of treatment. 128 local disease, 469 regional disease, 237 distant disease
**5-year OS: 6%; conditional survival at 5-years 60-70%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This is the first attempt, in the absence of well-designed clinical trials, to define population survival rates for patients with gallbladder carcinomas who have received radiation therapy as a component of their management. This dataset represents the largest pooled data for gallbladder carcinoma, and is markedly larger than any given institutional series.  Consequently, while imperfect, this data represents a useful estimate for patients with considerable post-diagnosis survival. Although the disease-free survival outcomes for patients with gallbladder adenocarcinoma treated with radiotherapy remain low, for those patient surviving even 1 year post-diagnosis, conditional survival estimates increase rapidly.&quot;

*'''MSKCC 1990-2001''' PMID 14534886 -- ''Patterns of initial disease recurrence after resection of gallbladder carcinoma and hilar cholangiocarcinoma: implications for adjuvant therapeutic strategies.'' (Jarnagin WR, Cancer. 2003 Oct 15;98(8):1689-700.)
**Retrospective. 80 GB and 76 hilar CCA reviewed
**Recurrence: 66% GB vs. 68% CCA at 2 years; median time to recurrence GB 11.5 months vs. CCA 20.3 months (p=0.007)
**Site of recurrence: isolated locoregional GB 15% vs. 59% CCA; distant (with or without concomitant locoregional) GB 85% vs. 41% CCA. Site of recurrence no apparent impact on survival
**Conclusion: &quot;After resection, recurrent GBCA is much more likely than recurrent HCCA to involve a distant site. GBCA is also associated with a much shorter time to recurrence and a shorter survival period after recurrence. The results demonstrated significant differences in the clinical behavior of these tumors and suggested that an adjuvant therapeutic strategy targeting locoregional disease, such as radiotherapy, is unlikely to have a significant impact in the overall management of GBCA. Conversely, there is at least some rationale for such an approach in patients with HCCA based on the pattern of initial recurrence.&quot;

==RT alone / Palliation==
*'''Duke''', 2005 - PMID 15990005 &amp;mdash; &quot;Adjuvant external-beam radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy after resection of primary gallbladder carcinoma: a 23-year experience.&quot; Willett CG et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Jul 15;62(4):1030-4.
**22 pts treated with surgery + RT + concurrent 5-FU (in 18). 
**Median f/u 1.7 yrs. The 5-year OS, DFS, metastases-free survival, and LRC were 37%, 33%, 36%, and 59%, respectively. Median survival was 1.9 years.

*PMID 2472186 Houry S, Br J Surg. 1989 May;76(5):448-50.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This experience is the largest published and suggests that radiotherapy may increase survival after no resection or palliative resection of gallbladder carcinoma.&quot;

*PMID 5268194 Vaittinen E, Ann Chir Gynaecol Fenn Suppl. 1970;168:1-81.
**No abstract
**Palliative resection, survival improved with EBRT 13 months vs. surgery only 8 months (p&lt;0.1)

==Adjuvant RT==
*'''SEER database; 2007''' (1992-2002) PMID 17516546 -- &quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy is associated with improved survival for gallbladder carcinoma with regional metastatic disease.&quot; (Mojica P, J Surg Oncol. 2007 Jul 1;96(1):8-13.)
**SEER review. 3,187 cases (35% Stage I, 36% Stage II, 6% Stage III, 21% Stage IV). Adjuvant RT given in 17%
**Outcome: median OS RT 14 months vs. no RT 8 months (SS); survival benefit only if regional spread or liver infiltration
**Conclusion: adjuvant RT improves survival with locally advanced GB cancer

*'''Santiago Chile; 2005''' (1991-02) [http://astro2005.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2094.pdf ASTRO Abstract] &quot;Post-Operative Adjuvant Radiochemotherapy in the Treatment of Gallbladder Cancer.&quot; (Baeza MR, ASTRO 2005, Abstract 2094)
**Retrospective. 49 patients with completely resected GB, treated adjuvantly with RT (WA + boost or boost only) + chemotherapy (5-FU or Gemcitabine)
**5-year OS: 52%; treatment well tolerated
**Conclusion: &quot;Adjuvant radiochemotherapy is a safe and useful treatment for gallbladder cancer after a macroscopically complete resection. The results achieved of 52% survival at 5 years in patients who have had a complete macroscopic resection, compares favorably with the survival reported after surgery alone for those patients.&quot;

*'''1994''' PMID 7536333 Mahe M, Radiother Oncol. 1994 Dec;33(3):204-8.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;From this experience it appears that ERT in gall-bladder carcinoma is well tolerated, can obtain local control and prolonged survival after complete resection and good palliation in non-resectable tumors.&quot;


'''''Prediction Model for ChemoRT Benefit'''''
*'''Oregon; 2011''' PMID 22067404 -- &quot;A Nomogram for Predicting the Benefit of Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Resected Gallbladder Cancer.&quot; (Wang SJ, Lemieux A, Kalpathy-Cramer J, Ord CB, Walker GV, Fuller CD, Kim JS, Thomas CR. A Nomogram for Predicting the Benefit of Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Resected Gallbladder Cancer. J Clin Onc, 2011, 29(35):4627-4632, http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2010.33.8020)
**Nomogram [http://skynet.ohsu.edu/nomograms/gallbladder]
**SEER database 4180 patients from 1988-2003. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model developed. Concordance index from boostrap modeling 0.71
**Conclusion: In absence of large randomized data, regression model can be used for individualized predictions of survival benefit from adjuvant RT

==Adjuvant Chemo==
*'''Japan''' (1986-1992)
**Randomized. 508 patients (pancreas n=173, cholangio n=139, &lt;u&gt;gallbladder&lt;/u&gt; n=140, ampulla n=56), s/p surgery. Stage II-IV. Arm 1) adjuvant chemo with mitomycin C + 5-FU x2 courses, followed by 5-FU until recurrence vs. Arm 2) observation
**'''2002''' PMID 12365016 -- &quot;Is postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy useful for gallbladder carcinoma? A phase III multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial in patients with resected pancreaticobiliary carcinoma.&quot; (Takada T, Cancer. 2002 Oct 15;95(8):1685-95.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS chemo 26% vs. observation 14% (SS); DSS 20% vs. 12% (SS)
***Conclusion: There may be benefit for systemic chemotherapy


==Stage IV==
*'''Tsukuba Japan 1976-90''' PMID 1853615 -- ''Resection combined with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for stage IV (TNM) gallbladder carcinoma.'' ('''1991 Todoroki''' T, World J Surg. 1991 May-Jun;15(3):357-66.)
**86 pts with Stage IV. 30% resection, 50% palliative surgery, 20% no surgery
**27 resected pts: 9 surgery alone, 17 IORT (20-30 Gy) +/- PORT (mean 36.4 Gy), 1 PORT
**3-year OS: 10% resection + IORT, 0% surgery alone


==Review==
*PMID 10430298 Houry S, Hepatogastroenterology. 1999 May-Jun;46(27):1578-84.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The results published encourage further trials in well defined populations. Radiotherapy seems to be a safe procedure, morbidity is minimal, and a slight effect on survival is observed after curative or palliative surgical procedures.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

I've moved some books into this book, namely:

* Cognitive Neuroscience
* Neuroanatomy
* Neurodegenerative disease
* Neurobiology

There are some pros and cons of consolidating all this &quot;neuroscience&quot; into one book, namely:

'''Pros'''
* Modern neuroscience is highly interdisciplinary.  Hence the wikibooks content should be interdisciplinary.
* The &quot;neuroscience&quot; book will get higher statistical ratings (i.e. we'll be listed higher in the &quot;ordering of books by number of edits&quot;)

'''Cons'''
* The names will be that bit longer (e.g. Neuroscience/Cognitive Neuroscience/Memory/The Role of the Hippocampus instead of Cognitive Neuroscience/Memory/The Role of the Hippocampus )

Let me know your thoughts on these issues.  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 12:10 GMT 30 Sept 2005

: I've started a discussion on this issue over in the [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Scope_of_the_Neuroscience_book|Staff Lounge]].  Thanks,  [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]]. 13:26, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">* [[w:sleep|WikiPedia article on Sleep]]

[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;309/5744/2228 Massimini et al 2005] stimulated sleeping (NREM) volunteers with [[w:TMS|TMS]] whilst recording with EEG and found that the brain failed to communicate this injected current.  Their conlusion is that cortical effective connectivity fails during sleep and that this could explain the loss of consciousness during sleep.  Some theories of consciousness (e.g. Guilio Tononi, the head of Massimini's lab) postulate that communication between different regions of cortex might be one sign of consciousness.

Aaron et al (2005) have demonstrated that the brains of mice lacking a protein found on most cortical neurons, the so-called [[Neuroscience/Nogo|Nogo]] receptor, can adapt to the loss of sight in one eye long after the brains of normal mice have lost this ability. The findings represent a dramatic demonstration that this type of neural plasticity, which normally is restricted to a critical period early in life, can be extended well into adulthood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is this thing you call a &quot;Neuroscience WikiBook&quot;?==

The Neuroscience Wikibook is also a [[w:Wiki|wiki]] which means that anyone can edit it.  This is considered a Good Idea&amp;trade; because every reader effectively becomes an editor so the content matures and improves over time.  As more people read and edit, the content becomes more accurate, more up-to-date and more balanced.

===It's a Wiki!===

You can fully edit this book.  Please feel free to remove mistakes, flesh out existing pages or even to start entire new pages.  If you've never used a Wiki before then take a look at [[Help:Contents|the Help:Contents page]] to get started and [[meta:MediaWiki_User's_Guide|the MediaWiki users' guide]] for more detailed information.  Also have a look at the [[Neuroscience/To_Do|To Do]] page.

==OK... sell it to me... why should I spend my time contributing?==

* It's fun showing off how damn clever you are.

* It's a pleasure to contribute to a wiki because it's a collaborative process.  What does that mean?  Well... you add a little bit and then you come back the next day to find that someone has added a little bit more and so on.  Remember those [[w:Garden_cress|cress]]-growing kits kids used to get before Play Stations were developed?  Contributing to a wiki is a little like growing [[w:Garden_cress|cress]]... you lay the seeds, let it grow a bit, then take some for your sandwhich, then let it grow some more (OK, crap analagy but you get the idea).  You get to participate in and nurture a growing document.

* As a researcher or student, you'll spend a lot of your time doing your own independent research.  Before you do your next bit of research, take a look at this book to see if we already have some answers to your questions.  If not, start a new page and use it to make your research notes on (you were gonna make notes anyway, right?).  Now you're killing two birds with one stone: not only are you doing yourself a favour by taking organised notes but you're also setting the foundations for a full-fleshed-out page that will help others.  Don't worry... you don't have to leave the page in a pristine condition... just do what you can and others will add to it later.

* You get to feel like you're doing something useful with those hours spent in front of the computer!

==Yes, I want to contribute!  How do I get started?==

There are no concrete regulations but the following could be considered &quot;best practice&quot;:

# Register at WikiBooks (click the &quot;register&quot; link at the top right).  This is free and they wont spam you.  Registering will mean that your edits will be signed with your username.
# If you haven't done so yet then read up on how to edit WikiBooks [[Help:Contents|on this help page]] and [[meta:MediaWiki_User's_Guide|this users' guide for more detailed information]].
# Add your name to the list of [[Neuroscience/Contributors|contributors]].
# Before contributing, make sure the book doesn't already contain the information you're planning to write about.
# Have a quick look over the formatting guide below...

==Formatting Guide==

===The Neuroscience wikibook and WikiPedia===

Before editing or writing an article, check to see if [[w:|Wikipedia]] has an article on what you're about to write about.  If it does then your job is to integrate the Wikipedia content into the Neuroscience wikibook.   First, link from the Neuroscience wikibook to [[w:|Wikipedia]] (this is easy using [[w:Interwiki links|interwiki links]], you just write a link like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Interesting Wikipedia page|Interesting Wikipedia page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  Then, if appropriate, link back from [[w:|Wikipedia]] to the Neuroscience wikibook.  Useful [[w:|Wikipedia]] categories include:
* [[w:Category:Neuroscience|Neuroscience]]

It's very important that we don't try to duplicate what's already on Wikipedia.  The Neuroscience wikibook is focussed on the more in-depth aspects of Neuroscience.  For example, WikiPedia has some excellent articles on memory but doesn't even begin to tell you how to research memory.  The Neuroscience wikibook should be based firmly on research: ideally, every statment would be backed up by a citation.

If you have found (or if you have added) a Neuroscience wikibook page that contains content that isn't covered in Wikipedia then it may be appropriate to start a Wikipedia stub article containing a brief, &quot;encyclopaedic&quot; introduction to the subject and then add a link to the Neuroscience wikibook page.

===Tone===

One of the fears with a collaborative book effort is that it loses any sense of &quot;voice&quot;.  Here are a few guidelines for this.

* Be direct.  Don't be afraid to give it to the reader straight.  
* Use a natural tone. Pretend you are explaining the topic to your best friend.
* Try your hardest to put across a neutral point of view (NPOV).
* Try to back up every statement you make with a citation.

===Style===

* Use the present tense.
* Use the active voice.

===Personal opinions and experiences===

The main narrative of this book should be impartial.  But don't shy away from expressing your own opinion.  Just make sure it's perfectly clear to the reader which sections are impartial and which bits are personal opinions.  For example, you might want to put your opinions or brief case studies in [[:Category:Box templates|Side Note Boxes]].

===Registered trade mark===

Whenever you mention a copyrighted [[w:Registered_trade_mark|trade mark]] then you should put an &amp;reg; by the name and add a footnote to say to whom the trade mark is registered. The code to insert this symbol is:

===When to use WikiBooks===

For some reason, wikibooks seems to be fastest in the morning (GMT).  It slows down considerably as the evening wears on.  Hopefully things will get better as the MediaWiki Foundation get more funding.

==I want to do more than just edit... I want to start new pages and modify the structure of the book... what do I need to know?==

===Page naming conventions===

See the [[:Wikibooks:Naming_policy|WikiBooks Naming Policy]] for more info.  Our naming policy runs like this:

 Neuroscience/Chapter Name/Module Page

e.g.

 Neuroscience/Cognitive Neuroscience

====Chapter names====

 Chapter name (examples of pages they contain)

 Preface (contributers, how you can help, how to naviate this book)
 Introduction (basics of neuroscience)
 Cognitive Neuroscience
 Cellular Neurobiology 	
 Developmental Neurobiology 	
 Neuroanatomy 	
 Cognitive Neuroscience 	
 Learning and Memory
 Computational Neurobiology 	
 Neurodegenerative Disease 	
 Sleep

===Structure of the book===

The Neuroscience wikibook has a hierachical structure.  The naming is hierachical and we also make good use of the [[w:Categorization|MediaWiki categorization]] system to provide a hierachical structure (see below for more information on the Neuroscience WikiBook's categorization implementation).

(''This will soon change... we'll soon be using a hierarchical naming convention'')

===Headers===

Please put a link to one of our page header templates at the top of each new page created.  Just put one of these at the top of your new page:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{neuroscience:header}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

===Categories===

The MediaWiki Category feature is a powerful way to... well.. categorise pages!  There are several great things about this feature:

* Category indexes are generated automatically
* Each page can be in as many categories as you want.
* Categories allow the wiki to become more &quot;booklike&quot; whilst inheriting all the coolness that databases and hyperlinking provide.

Please put the correct category at the bottom of each page:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==Promoting Neuroscience WikiBook==

We are actively looking for new contibutors to the Neuroscience WikiBook.  If we can get enough contibutors this book could be THE definitive Neuroscience resource. 

Before you promote the Neuroscience wikibook check out the [[Neuroscience/Preface/Promotion Tracking|Neuroscience Promotion Tracking Page]] to ensure someone else has not very recently publicised it where you were going to.  1 per month per forum should be plenty of promotion :-)!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Biscuit Jointer==
A biscuit jointer machines a groove of fixed depth &amp; width into a piece of lumber.  The grooves are of set standard sizes.  An oval &quot;biscuit&quot; of pressed beech is placed into the groove.  This biscuit expands when exposed to a water-based glue, thus strengthening the joint.  In some cases biscuit jointing provides a stronger joint than traditional dowel joints.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thiebaut de Schotten et al. (2005) produced &quot;temporary&quot; neglect in human patients by brief electrical inactivation of the cortex of the parietal lobe.  This finding gives strong support to the idea that neglect results from the disruption of a widespread cortical network that involves neuronal cell bodies in large areas of cortex, including the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and possibly the occipital lobe.

Ablation of large areas of the gray matter of the parietal cortex in the monkey, leaving the underlying white matter intact, does not result in neglect.  However, neglect can be produced by cutting through the white matter, with only minimal damage to the gray matter ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=9313646&amp;dopt=Abstract Gaffan &amp; Hornak 1997]).

Transection of the fornix results in a temporal lobe amnesia.  A much more severe and dense amnesia than that produced by fornix transection is seen when other subcortical pathways, in addition to the fornix, are cut ([http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/external_ref?link_type=MED&amp;access_num=11115655 Gaffan 2001]). In naturally occurring lesions in the human brain these other pathways are damaged only in conjunction with the medial temporal cortex itself. Dense amnesia can be produced in monkeys experimentally by a surgical procedure that destroys the subcortical white matter pathways while leaving intact the medial temporal cortical areas (namely the hippocampus, the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal gyrus ([http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/external_ref?link_type=MED&amp;access_num=11115655 Gaffan 2001])). The crucial pathways that are interrupted in dense amnesia are thought to be the ascending axon projections from the basal forebrain and brainstem that pass through the anterior medial temporal lobe on their way to widespread cortical targets ([http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/external_ref?link_type=MED&amp;access_num=11115656 Easton &amp; Gaffan 2001] and [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/external_ref?link_type=MED&amp;access_num=12050084 Easton et al 2002]  ).

      <comment>/* Constant Acceleration */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Kinematics ==
Kinematics is the study of the motion of a body, but not the ways the motion is produced. To study a ball's motion through a parabolic path is kinematics. Studying how the ball was thrown in the first place is mechanics. Kinematics is one of the most useful parts of physics, and it has wide range of applications. In fact, a lot of dynamics uses kinematical relations.

When we consider the speed of a body, we do not discuss the direction. A ball thrown up with a speed of 20 m/s is equivalent to a ball thrown in any other direction with the same speed. However, these motions are vastly different and gravity will act differently on the ball. So a complete discussion of the motion of a body depends on the direction as well as the speed. Together we get a vector quantity that is called '''velocity''', and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\vec v &lt;/math&gt;.


''then, explain their equivalents: velocity and displacement (use diagrams), and show they are vector quantities (provide example in 1 dimension).''

== Constant Acceleration ==
''Explain constant acceleration and why we simplify problems by assuming it is constant, and show how to solve some problems involving motion with a constant acceleration''

An object under constant acceleration in 1 dimension has its kinematic quantities governed by the SUVAT equations. S is displacement, U is starting velocity, V is final velocity, A is acceleration, and T is time. Knowing three of these quantities allows the other two to be found. The equations are as follows:

&lt;math&gt;v = u + at&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s = ut + \frac{1} {2} a{t}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s = vt - \frac{1} {2} a{t}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{u + v} {2} t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{v}^{2} = {u}^{2} + 2as&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a particle dropped from a ledge 2 m high accelerating under gravity has &lt;math&gt;u = 0 {\text{ ms}}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a = -9.8 {\text{ ms}}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;s = 2 \text{ m}&lt;/math&gt;. If you wanted to find the time it takes to fall, you would substitute these values into &lt;math&gt;s = ut + \frac{1} {2} a{t}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and solve for t.

== The Relationship Between Kinematic Quantities ==

''show (t,x) and (t,v) graphs and emphasise memorizing features of each graph:''

''(i) the area under a (t,v) graph represents displacement,''

''(ii) the gradient of a (t, x) graph represents velocity,''

''(iii) the gradient of a (t,v) graph represents acceleration;''


== Deriving Kinematic Quantities Using Calculus ==
We have seen how the (x,t) graph shows the position x at any moment t. This means that the position x is a function of the time t.

===Position===
As motion happens to happen in time, the position of a moving point is a function of time. The motion of a point moving along the x-axis may be described by the position x(t) as a function of the time (moment) t. A point moving with constant speed in the positive direction may be described by:
:&lt;math&gt; x(t) = 1+3t&lt;/math&gt;.
From this eqation we learn:
:&lt;math&gt; x(0) = 1+3\times 0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
which means that the motion started at time t = 0 in the point x = 1.
At the moment t=1, the point has reached the point x = 4, as we can see by calculating:
:&lt;math&gt; x(1) = 1+3\times 1 = 4&lt;/math&gt;.
At the moment t=2, the point has reached the point x = 7: 
:&lt;math&gt; x(2) = 1+3\times 2 = 7&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that during the first unit of time: from t = 0 to t = 1, the point has moved from x = 1 to x = 4, hence advanced 3 units in distance; during the second unit of time, from t = 1 to t = 2, it moved from x = 4 to x = 7, again advancing 3 units. It seems to advance 3 units in distance every unit of time, meaning it moves with constant velocity of 3.

===Velocity===
If the point moves with constant speed ''t'', this speed may be calculated from the time it took to move a certain distance from one position to another. If, as in the example above it took 1 time unit to move a distance 3, i.e. from x = 1 to x = 4, the velocity must be v = 3/1 = 3. We could calculate this velocity from the fact that it took 2 units of time to move a distance 6, namely from x = 1 to x = 7, hence v = 6/2 = 3.

In general we calculate the velocity of a motion with constant speed by looking at the time interval from t = t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to t = t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in which the point has moved from  has travelled from x = x(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to d = x(t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), of as the quotiet of the travelled distance and the time it took:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac {\mathrm{travelled\; distance}}{\mathrm{required\;time}} = \frac{x(t_2)-x(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

We verify that in the above example the speed is indeed constant 3, by calculating for an arbitrary time interval the speed v:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{x(t_2)-x(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}=\frac{(1+3t_2)-(1+3t_1)}{t_2-t_1}=\frac{3t_2-3t_1}{t_2-t_1}=\frac{3(t_2-t_1)}{t_2-t_1} = 3&lt;/math&gt;.

For a motion with constant speed v the equation of motion is:
:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x(0) + vt&lt;/math&gt;.

In non-general the motion will not be with constant velocity. Let us take an example with:
:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = 1 + 3t + 2t^2&lt;/math&gt;.

It starts at t = 0 in x(0) = 1. At the moment t = 1 it reaches x(1) = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. The average speed during this time interval, or on this traject is:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v} = \frac{x(1)-x(0)}{1-0} =\frac{6-1}1 = 5&lt;/math&gt;.

But during the final time unit:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{v} = \frac{x(2)-x(1)}{2-1} =\frac{(1+6+8)-(1+3+2)}1 = 9&lt;/math&gt;.

The speed has increased. The speed is also a function v(t) of the time. But what would be the (instantaneous) velocity v(t) at the moment t  We may calculate this velocity by taking a (very) small time interval from t to t + h. Then the average speed during this interval is approximately equal to the velocity at the moment t. We get the exact value of the velocity by letting the time interval shrink to zero and taking the limit, which is not just the derivative of the position x(t):

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x(t+h)-x(t)}{h} = \frac{d}{dt} x(t)&lt;/math&gt;.








''here is where the original author can put his or her work back in to the page!''

''just remember to keep it simple though, perhaps no need to explain it using first principles. Just a simple explanation of how to go from one to another (displacement, velocity, acceleration) and back again by differentiation or integration''

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Hymn is a stylized poem or from the Greek a paeon, which, traditionally is sung in either in unison or parts, by a group or a congregation, in praise to a God or to a deity.  The book of Psalms, in the Old Testament of the Hebrew and Christian texts, is an early example of the stylized poem, which was incorporated for group usage by the body of beleivers in both Christianity and Judaism. The hymn form of music has evolved over the intervening centuries to incorporate, other stylizations such as plainsong, other scriptural passages set in rythmical and tonal systems, such as canticles and metrical latin hymnody. Late additions to the hymn's historical development incorporate elements in &quot;gospel&quot; hymns from prevailing popular music genres, in order to maintain contact with the leading edge of the developments of other forms of music.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Needs to Be Done ==

This page was made for the physics section, hence is physics orientated. As an open request, I would like some one to make the page more &quot;mathematical&quot;. Thanks a lot.

== Different approach ==
I noticed that the author has started with a vector approach. Instead of simply listing formulas, perhaps we could describe the derivations as well. Then we could show how the scalar forms of the formulas described in the OCR specifications are just special cases of the more general framework.

== Moved ==
Not sure if this is quite the right place for this, as it seems to complex for the M1 module. [[User:Aleksev|Aleksev]] 11:48, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

== Far too difficult! ==

I teach the M1 course and this approach is totally inappropriate!

A simple derivation based upon the definition of acceleration and using the fact that the distance is the area under a v-t graph will be sufficient. But for M1 it is the use , not the derivation, that is the most important.

The use of vectors, vector intergration etc is well above the level required for M1</text>

Time has come for Black to make an important strategic choice.

:He may keep on developing his forces by playing [[/5...Nc6/]].
:He can choose to strengthen his pawn structure and to reinforce his control of the center with [[/5...e6/]].
:He can also start to take the control of the queen-side with [[/5...a6/]].
:He may decide to put a deadly bishop in g7 and play [[/5...g6/]].

These are the four main variations. Another more aggressive option is [[/5...e5/]], less popular than the previous moves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition of prey-predator systems ==

Prey-predator systems are a well known biological example of excitable media. This example is based upon an article  (see references) about plankton and fish dynamics. The dynamics are given as a PDE system. The purpose of this example is to observe pattern formation and other dynamic properties of prey-predator systems using both finite difference equations and cellular automata.

=== PDE describing prey-predator systems ===

We define the prey-predator system using the a system of general reaction-diffusion differential equations.

:&lt;math&gt; u_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D_u \nabla^2 u(\mathbf{r},t) + f(u,v) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D_v \nabla^2 v(\mathbf{r},t) + g(u,v) &lt;/math&gt;

The first equation describes the prey population &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; and the seccond equation describes the predator population &lt;math&gt;v(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;. Nonlinear functions &lt;math&gt;f(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; describe local prey-predator dynamics, without them the system is decomposed into two separate diffusion equations.

We are interested in prey-predator dynamics of aquatic systems, where phytoplankton (small plants, food producers) is the prey and zooplankton (small animals) is the predator. Since we observe only slowly moving plankton the diffusion coefficient &lt;math&gt;D_u=D_v=D&lt;/math&gt; depends mainly on marine turbulence. The two nonlinear functions describing prey-predator dynamics are

:&lt;math&gt; f(u,v) = P(u) - E(u,v) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g(u,v) = \kappa E(u,v) -\mu v \, &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(u)&lt;/math&gt; describes local growth and mortality of the prey, &lt;math&gt;E(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; describes the predation, &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is food utilization and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mortality rate of the predator. The selection of functions &lt;math&gt;P(u)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and parameters &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; depends on the observed population. Here a simple example is used, for a detailed description of the equations see the references.

:&lt;math&gt; u_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D \nabla^2 u(\mathbf{r},t) + \frac{\alpha}{b}u(b-u) - \gamma\frac{u}{u+H}v &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_t(\mathbf{r},t) = D \nabla^2 v(\mathbf{r},t) + \kappa\gamma\frac{u}{u+H}v - \mu v &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the maximal growth rate of the prey, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the carrying capacity of the prey population, and H is the half-saturation abundance of prey.

=== Algebraic analysis ===

The first step is to introduce dimensionless variables

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{u}=\frac{u}{b} \quad \tilde{v}=\frac{v\gamma}{b\alpha} \quad \tilde{t}=\alpha{t} \quad \tilde{\mathbf{r}}=\mathbf{r} \left( \frac{\alpha}{D} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

and the new dimensionless parameters are

:&lt;math&gt;h=\frac{H}{b} \quad m=\frac{\mu}{\alpha} \quad k=\frac{\kappa\gamma}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

the PDE system with only dimensionless quantities is (tildes are omitted)

:&lt;math&gt; u_t = \nabla^2 u + u(1-u) - \frac{u}{u+h}v &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_t = \nabla^2 v + k\frac{u}{u+h}v - mv &lt;/math&gt;

=== Local Dynamics ===

[[Image:cellular automata plankton local cycle.png|thumb|300px|right|Local dynamics cycle (starting in (u*,v*))]]

The local dynamics of the system are defined by the nonlinear reaction part of equations

:&lt;math&gt; u_t = u(1-u) - \frac{u}{u+h}v  \qquad  v_t = v + k\frac{u}{u+h}v - mv &lt;/math&gt;

We first observe stationary conditions &lt;math&gt; u_t = v_t = 0 \, &lt;/math&gt; There are three stationary states &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;
* total extinction &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; is a sedal point for &lt;math&gt;k,m,h&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
* predator extinction &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt; is a sedal point if &lt;math&gt;(u_*,v_*)&lt;/math&gt; is in the biologically meaningful region &lt;math&gt;u,v\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and a stable point otherwise
* and coexistence &lt;math&gt;(u_*,v_*)&lt;/math&gt; can be a sedal or stationary point
:&lt;math&gt; u_* = \frac{rh}{1-r}  \quad r=m/k \quad v_* = (1-u_*)(h+u_*)  &lt;/math&gt;

Although the reaction dynamics depend on three parameters &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the most important. If 

:&lt;math&gt; h &lt; \frac{1-r}{r} &lt;/math&gt;

than the population is in a biologically meaningful region &lt;math&gt;u_*,v_*\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. If

:&lt;math&gt; h &lt; \frac{1-r}{1+r} &lt;/math&gt;

than there is a stable limit cycle surrounding the steady state. There is a figure of such a cycle where the path begins near from the stationary point &lt;math&gt;(u_*,v_*+\Delta{v})&lt;/math&gt; and the parameters are &lt;math&gt;k=0.2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r=0.3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h=0.4&lt;/math&gt;.

== Numerical simulation using finite difference equations ==

A direct approach to simulate prey-predator dynamics in the plankton example is to [[Cellular_Automata/Excitable_media|discretize the reaction-diffusion differential equation]], and to solve it numerically. The dynamics is first observed in an one dimensional space and than on two dimensions. In both cases using a zero-flux boundary &lt;math&gt;\nabla u=\nabla v=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The PDE discretization method used is [[Cellular_Automata/Excitable_media#Discretization of differential equations using the FTCS method|FTCS]], which is the simplest. It is capable of producing complex behavior we would like to observe, but it has stability and convergence problems discussed below.

=== One dimension ===

The simulation is first performed in an one dimensional space of &lt;math&gt;4000&lt;/math&gt; elements. The discretization parameters are

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta x = 1 \quad \Delta t = 0.2 \quad d=0.2 &lt;/math&gt;

The prey-predator system parameters are

:&lt;math&gt; D=1 \quad k=2.0 \quad r=0.4 \quad h=0.3 &lt;/math&gt;

For initial conditions the uniform stationary point &lt;math&gt;(u_*,v_*)&lt;/math&gt; is used

:&lt;math&gt; u(x,0) = u_* \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v(x,0) = v_* + \epsilon x + \delta \, &lt;/math&gt;

a gradual increase of predator population from the left to the right is added to ignite the spatial dynamics, the parameters are

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon=10^{-6} \quad \delta=-1.5 \cdot 10^{-3} &lt;/math&gt;

There are two figures showing the system at times 0, 640, 2600. At a certain point in time and space the species distribution becomes chaotic. The chaotic part shows a fast growth.

[[Image:cellular automata plankton 1D t0640.png|thumb|350px|left|Spatial distributions of populations in the 1D case at time t=640]]
[[Image:cellular automata plankton 1D t2640.png|thumb|350px|left|Spatial distributions of populations in the 1D case at time t=2640]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left&quot;/&gt;

The system is not converging by decreasing the time difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta{t}\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt;. The source of the problem can be seen by observing the local dynamics of &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; inside the chaotic region &lt;math&gt;x=1500&lt;/math&gt; from time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t=640&lt;/math&gt; using two different time differences &lt;math&gt;\Delta{t}=0.20&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta{t}=0.02&lt;/math&gt;. With decreasing the time difference the influence of diffusion grows over the influence of local dynamics. On the above figure the effect would be seen as a slower spreading of the chaotic region.

[[Image:cellular automata plankton uv cycle dt020.png|thumb|350px|left|Local dynamics (u(t),v(t)) observed at x=1500 t=0-640 with Δt=0.20]]
[[Image:cellular automata plankton uv cycle dt002.png|thumb|350px|left|Local dynamics (u(t),v(t)) observed at x=1500 t=0-640 with Δt=0.02]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left&quot;/&gt;

=== Two dimensions ===

The simulation is than performed in an two dimensional space of &lt;math&gt;576 \times 384&lt;/math&gt; elements. The discretization parameters are

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta x = \Delta y = 2 \quad \Delta t = 0.5 \quad d=0.125 &lt;/math&gt;

The prey-predator system parameters are

:&lt;math&gt; D=1 \quad k=2.0 \quad r=0.4 \quad h=0.3 &lt;/math&gt;

For initial conditions the uniform stationary point &lt;math&gt;(u_*,v_*)&lt;/math&gt; is used

:&lt;math&gt; u(x,0) = u_* + \epsilon_1(x-0.1y-144).*(x-0.1y-432) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v(x,0) = v_* + \epsilon_2(x-450) - \epsilon_3(y-150) \, &lt;/math&gt;

a gradual increase of predator population is added to ignite the spatial dynamics, the parameters are

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_1=2\cdot10^{-7} \quad \epsilon_2=3\cdot10^{-5} \quad \epsilon_3=1.2\cdot10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt;

2D dynamics are observed on time points &lt;math&gt;t=\{0,100,150,200,300,400,1000\}&lt;/math&gt;. Spiral patterns can be seen arising from the initial gradient, at the end patterns brake and the system ends in chaos.

[[Image:cellular automata plankton 2D t0400.jpg|thumb|left|t=400]]
[[Image:cellular automata plankton 2D t1000.jpg|thumb|left|t=1000]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left&quot;/&gt;

Another problem arises because the [[Cellular_Automata/Excitable_media#Discretization of differential equations using the FTCS method|FTCS]] method is not unconditionally stable. Some results may become negative, and the functions describing local dynamics diverge very fast in the negative quadrants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Medium in painting is very important, as each one will act very different from each other.  The focus of this page is based on watercolours.  Of course clean up and tinting can be done with water not thinner, as with oils.  The base or binder is called gum arabic and mixes with the pigment to create watercolour.  It can be used from a dry cake with water or from small tubes.  If mixed with a lot of water it can become very light and make a sort of stain on the paper.  It can also be used thicker and will sit more on top of the paper with a flatter look that does not let the paper show through, more like a gouache or acrylic look.  Because of this versatility watercolour can have many different looks or styles, though it is difficult to cover with layers like oils or acrylics.  We are creating an art site to educate the public in many areas of the arts, from art history to technique.  Take a look: [http://www.ezmuseum.com Impressionism]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well,it's good to see that the inclusion of creationism and I suppose, Intelligent Design, and their inclusion did not hve to be legislated or decided by a court. I was wondering who exactly would be qualified to write a neutral position entry? I'll be back!!!!


Scientific Theory

Creationism, although it may be true, is NOT a scientific theory by any meaning of the word. As such I don't think it belongs in a science class and, more perticularly, in a science text book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">U.S. Federal law provides that &quot;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.&quot;  47 U.S.C. §230(c)(1), and that &quot;[n]o cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.&quot; id. § 230(e)(3)).

Congress created this immunity in order to limit the impact on the Internet of federal or state regulation imposed either through statute or through the application of common law causes of action.  47 U.S.C. § 230(a)(4) (the Internet and other interactive computer services “have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation”; id. § 230(b)(2) (“[i]t is the policy of the United States” to minimize Internet regulation).     

As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found in the seminal case interpreting Section 230, &quot;[b]y its plain language, § 230 creates a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service&quot; ''Zeran v. America Online, Inc.'', [[w:Court Citation|129 F.3d 327]], 330 (4th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 937 (1998).

Courts across the country have upheld Section 230 immunity and its policy of regulatory forbearance in a variety of factual contexts.  
*''Batzel v. Smith'', 333 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2003) (website operator immune for distributing email sent to listserv); 
*''Ben Ezra, Weinstein &amp; Co. v. America Online'', 206 F.3d 980, 984-985 (10th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 824 (2000) (no liability for posting of incorrect stock information); 
*''Blumenthal v. Drudge'', 982 F. Supp. 44, 49-53 (D.D.C. 1998) (AOL has Section 230 immunity from liability for content of independent contractor’s news reports, despite agreement with contractor allowing AOL to modify or remove such content).
*''Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc.'', 339 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2003) (Internet dating service provider was entitled to Section 230 immunity from liability stemming from third party’s submission of false profile); 
*''Doe v. America Online'', 783 So.2d 1010, 1013-1017 (Fl. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S.Ct. 208 (2000) (&quot;Doe&quot;) (§ 230 immunizes America Online (“AOL”) for negligence); 
*''Gentry v. eBAY, Inc.'', 99 Cal.App.4th at 830 (2002) (&quot;Gentry&quot;) (eBay is entitled to § 230 immunity, which protects against liability under Civil Code § 1739.7).
*''[http://login.findlaw.com/scripts/callaw?dest=ca/caapp4th/87/684.html Kathleen R. v. City of Livermore]'', 87 Cal.App.4th 684 at 692 (2001) (&quot;Kathleen&quot;) (library not liable for providing computers allowing access to pornography); 
*''Marczeski v. Law'', 122 F.Supp.2d 315, 327 (D. Conn. 2000) (individual who created private “chat room” was ICS provider entitled to immunity); 
*''Schneider v. Amazon.com, Inc.'', 31 P.3d 37, 39 (Wash.Ct.App. 2001) (&quot;Schneider&quot;) (online bookseller providing forum for others to submit book reviews is “interactive computer service” provider (“ICS provider”));  

Section 230 is not limited to defamation lawsuits, or even to tort actions.  It extends to claims of negligence. 
*See ''Doe'' above;
*See ''Schneider'' above (negligent misrepresentation and interference with business expectancy); 
*It extends to state causes of action for violating a statute that forbids dealers in autographed sports items from misrepresenting those items as authentically autographed.  See ''Gentry'' above. 
*It extends to unfair competition laws. ''Stoner v. eBay, Inc.', 2000 WL 1705637, (Cal.Super.2000) (unpublished) (claiming eBay violated Calif. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 17200 for auctions of bootleg and other unauthorized ‘infringing’ sound recordings).  
*It protects a library from being held liable for misuse of public funds, nuisance, and premises liability for providing computers allowing access to pornography.  See ''Kathleen'' above  
*It extends to contract claims.  
**''Jane Doe One v. Oliver'', 755 A.2d 1000, 1003-1004 (Conn. Super. Ct. 2000) (applying § 230 to dismiss breach of contract action against AOL, as well claims such as negligence, breaching a mandated public policy, intentional nuisance, and emotional distress).
**''Morrison v. America Online, Inc.'', 153 F.Supp.2d 930, 934 (N.D. Ind. 2001) (rejecting attempt to evade § 230 immunity by claiming to be third-party beneficiary of AOL’s member agreement with chat-room users);

I see you use old development stages codes. Instead writing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:25%.png]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; we write &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage short|25%|Sep, 30 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; now - it's less likely to make a mistake.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Copyright Act sets out four factors for courts to look at (17 U.S.C. § 107):

1. The purpose and character of the use. Transformative uses are favored over mere copying. Non-commercial uses are also more likely fair..

2. The nature of the copyrighted work. Is the original factual in nature or fiction? Published or unpublished? Creative and unpublished works get more protection under copyright, while using factual material is more often fair use.

3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used. Copying nearly all of a work, or copying its &quot;heart&quot; is less likely to be fair.

4. The effect on the market or potential market. This factor is often held to be the most important in the analysis, and it applies even if the original is given away for free. If you use the copied work in a way that substitutes for the original in the market, it's unlikely to be a fair use; uses that serve a different audience or purpose are more likely fair. Linking to the original may also help to diminish the substitution effect. Note that criticism or parody that has the side effect of reducing a market may be fair because of its transformative character. In other words, if your criticism of a product is so powerful that people stop buying the product, that doesn't count as having an &quot;effect on the market for the work&quot; under copyright law.

Works produced by the US government, or any federal government agency or person acting in a government capacity, are in the public domain. So are the texts of legal cases and statutes from state or federal government. Private contractors working for the government, however, can transfer copyrights to the US government.

In any number based test such as math or physics the answers are normally completely right or completely wrong. This is also true for any multiple choice or true/false test. The following are some tips to make sure you arrive at the correct answer.

==Understand what is being asked==
Read the problem and try to spot the the information that they are giving you.  Mark any such information.  Then read the problem again and try to identify the unknown.  Once you have this information, finding ''how to solve'' the problem should be easy.  Many students try to figure out how to solve the problem before they have a clear idea of what the problem is requesting.  After you have this clear, proceed on to solving the problem.

==Use the units==
If you are working in item that uses units, you can quickly use the formula with only the units to see if the formula can give you a sensible result.  For example, an acceleration item in a physics test in which you are given the final speed, the initial speed, and the time, and you have to find the acceleration. The formula for acceleration is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a} = {\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u} \over \mathbf{t}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Using only the units we get:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a} = {{\mathbf{m} \over \mathbf{s}} - {\mathbf{m} \over \mathbf{s}}\over \mathbf{s}} =  { {\mathbf{m} \over \mathbf{s}}\over \mathbf{s}} = {\mathbf{m} \over \mathbf{s}^2} 
&lt;/math&gt;
The unit m/s&amp;sup2; sounds reasonable for acceleration.  So we can feel confident that we have the correct formula.  This is an overly simple example, since this technique gets more useful in more complex problems.  This technique is also useful in tests in which the formulas are provided, but it's not clearly stated the purpose of each formula.  Finally, make sure you make any conversions.  It's not possible to add m/s with km/h.  Such small mistakes can be very misleading.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==

===Pastry===

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240ml) boiling [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* ½ cup (120g) [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* 1 cup (120g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ⅛ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
 
===Filling===

* 1 cup (240g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ⅓ cup (80g) [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* ⅓ teaspoon salt
* 1 egg
* 2 cups (480ml) scalded [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract

==Procedure==

===Pastry===
# Heat water and shortening in [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] until it boils up well.
# Add all at once flour sifted with salt and stir vigorously. 
# Remove from heat as soon as mixed. 
# Cool, and mix in unbeaten eggs, one at a time.
# Add baking powder; mix.
# Drop by spoonfuls 1½ inches (4cm) apart on greased tin, shaping into circular form with spoon but keeping mixture higher in center. 
# Bake about 30 minutes in hot oven. 
# Cut with sharp knife near base to admit filling.

===Filling===
# Mix dry ingredients (sugar, cornstarch and salt).
# Add slightly beaten egg.
# Stir into this gradually the scalded milk. 
# Cook about 15 minutes in [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]], stirring constantly until thickened. 
# Cool slightly and add vanilla extract and whisk vigorously for creaminess.

==Tips and variations==
* Sweetened whipped [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] may be used instead of this filling.
* Rather than cutting the pastries open, spoon the filling into a [[Cookbook:Pastry Bag|pastry bag]], then inject it from the bottom.
* Dust with powdered sugar or drizzle with semi-sweet chocolate

{{recipe}}

'''Meringue''' is sweetened, whipped [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]]. There are three basic types:

* '''French meringue''', or common meringue, is a simple mixture of egg whites and sugar, sometimes with the addition of confectioner's sugar. It is uncooked but may be browned lightly after being applied to a dish, as in [[Cookbook:Lemon Meringue Pie|''lemon meringue pie'']].

* '''Swiss meringue''', is a mixture of egg white and sugar which is beaten over a [[Cookbook:Bain-marie|bain-marie]] which increases the volume and stabilizes it.

* '''Italian meringue''', is prepared by beating hot sugar syrup into beaten egg white.

''Soft meringue'', which is used on ''lemon meringue pie'' and [[Cookbook:Queen of Puddings|''queen of puddings'']], for example, has less sugar than ''hard meringue''.  ''Soft meringue'' may contain equal parts of sugar and egg white by weight, whereas ''hard meringue'' may contain up to two parts sugar to one part egg white by weight. 

Sometimes a small amount of flour is added to meringue in order to give it extra stability. These are sometimes called ''sponges'' but are more like meringue than cake. See recipe for ''Marly sponge'' below.

==Italian Meringue==
[[File:Italy - birthday cake with candles 1.jpg|thumb|Italian meringue taet]]
===Ingredients===
* 4 oz. (125 ml) water
* 8 oz. (250 g) egg whites
* 1 lb. (500 g) sugar

===Preparation===
#In a saucepan, dissolve the sugar in the water and bring to a boil.
#Boil the syrup until it reaches 243ºF (117ºC).
#While the syrup is boiling, beat the egg whites to soft peaks.
#While beating, pour the syrup into the egg whites in a steady stream.
# Continue beating until the meringue is completely cool and forms firm peaks.

=Baked Meringues=
* The following meringues are used in a variety of recipes, with cream, pastry cream or butter-cream fillings. See links below for recipes.
==Crisp Baked Meringues==
* French meringue OR Swiss meringue, as needed
# Using a pastry bag, pipe the meringue into the desired shapes on parchment paper or a silicone mat.
# Bake at 200º to 225ºF (100ºC) until crisp but not browned - 1 to 3 hours depending on the size.
# Cool before peeling off the parchment paper.

==Almond Meringue==
===Ingredients===
* 4 oz (120 g) egg whites
* 4 oz. (120 g) caster sugar
* 4 oz. (120 g) powdered almonds
===Preparation===
# Beat the egg whites to soft peaks.
# Add the sugar, a little at a time, and continue beating to firm peaks.
# Fold in the powdered almonds carefully, being careful not to deflate the egg whites.
#Line a baking sheet with  parchment paper.
# Draw circles of the desired diameter on the paper using a pair of compasses or a dinner plate.
# Fill a pastry bag with the meringue and starting in the centre, pipe a spiral of meringue toward the outer edge to form a flat disc about ½ inch thick.
# Bake at 325ºF (160ºC) until hard and dry ca. 25 minutes.
# Allow to cool before peeling off the paper.

==Hazelnut Meringue==
===Ingredients===
* 1 lb. (500 g) egg whites

* 1 lb. (500 g) confectioners' sugar
* 1 lb. (500 g) blanched hazelnuts, finely chopped

===Preparation===
# Beat the egg whites to soft peaks.
# Add the caster sugr, little by little, and beat to form stiff peaks.
# Mix the confectioners' sugar with the nuts.
# Fold into the meringue carefully, trying not to deflate the egg whites.
# Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and with a pencil draw circles of the desired diameter using a plate or cake tin.
# Using a pastry bag with a ½-inch plain tube attachment, pipe a spiral, starting at the centre of the circles, working outward toward the edge forming a disc about ½ inch thick.
# Bake at 250ºF (120ºC) until crisp and very lightly browned, 1½ to 2 hours.

==Marly Sponge==
'''Meringue stabilized with flour'''
===Ingredients===
* 5 oz. (150 g) powdered almonds
* 2¼ oz. (70 g) cake flour
* 8 oz. (250 g) sugar
* 8 oz (250 g) egg whites
* 5 oz. (150 g) sugar
===Preparation===
# Mix the almonds, flour and first quantity of sugar with a wire whisk.
# Beat the egg whites to soft peaks.
# Add the second quantity of sugar, little by little, and beat to firm peaks.
# Fold the almond mixture into the egg whites.
#Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and draw circles of the required diameter on the paper.
#Using a pastry bag, pipe spirals of meringue into the circles.
#Bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 12 to 15 minutes.

=Soft Boiled Meringues=

===Ingredients===

For Meringue
*5 parts egg white to 4 parts sugar (by weight);
*Pinch of salt.
(eg for 6 persons, 100g egg white and 80g sugar, pinch of salt)

For Boiling:
3 parts water to 2 parts milk
(eg for 6 persons, 3/4 l. water to 1/2 l. milk).

===Preparation===

#Beat all meringue ingredients together to soft peaks.
#Boil the water with the milk.
#Drop the mixture in, in spoonfuls; the measures given above by example should give 18 small meringues.
#Simmer for about 4 minutes then scoop out and dry on kitchen paper rolls.
#Serve with custard, beaten fresh cream, chocolate sauce, hazelnuts etc. to liking.

'''Meringues''' are crunchy confections made from whipped egg whites and sugar. In Germany and Austria (but not in France) they are called ''Baiser'' (from French kiss). Served with whipped cream, they are a traditional dessert in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. See our [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]] page for similar uses of whipped egg whites.

==Ingredients==
* whites of 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (250ml) [[Cookbook:Superfine Sugar|superfine sugar]] [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]]. Ideal is a mixture of 50% superfine and 50% powdered sugar.
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract, if desired

==Procedure==
 
# Beat whites of eggs until stiff and dry.
# Add lemon juice
# Gradually add sugar and continue beating until mixture holds shape and is very shiny. Test if the sugar is wholly solved and no grains remain (this can take longer or shorter depending on the sugar used).
# Add vanilla. 
# Drop by spoonfuls on unglazed paper
# Bake in slow oven 80 to 90 minutes, depending on size. Use very low heat, meringues should rather dry than bake and should be dry and only very slightly colored, when finished.
# Let cool, before serving
# In the original Swiss recipe, two meringues per serving are filled with sweetened whipped [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], but the cream is often supplemented with [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]] or other fresh fruits and [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|vanilla ice cream]]

== Tips and Variations ==

# The tiniest bit of egg yolk or fat prevents the egg white to get stiff
# Meringues are more decorative if shaped with a pastry bag
# Another method of baking is, to preheat the oven and bake the meringues 2-3 minutes at moderately hot temperature, then turn down the oven completely and keep it shut for 8 hours.
# Meringues do not turn out very well, if the air is very humid (due to climate or due to steam from other cooking)

----
Personally, I'm skeptical about the need for baking powder in meringue.  I wonder if it's just there because the recipe was written by a baking powder company, or if it actually helps.  If someone would care to try it without the powder, I'd be interested to hear how it turns out.--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 21:27, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

:Oh my goodness! I'm sorry to say that the baking powder does not help in the least.  I usually make my meringues just with egg whites and caster sugar, usually add some vanilla extract for flavour, and maybe food-dye for some different colours (you can be really creative with shapes too!).  The one down side of the recipe I usually follow is that I can end up with some clear sugary goo (sugar syrup really) on the edges of my meringues where they touch the baking paper. I've heard that corn starch can 'help', or rather that some people use a little of that, as well as other things like baking powder and cream of tartar. I just thought I would give the baking powder a try in my current batch - DISASTER.  You should be able to pipe meringue to create swirls, nests, flowers, dinosours - whatever you like.  With the baking powder your left with un-pipeable slop, no wonder this recipe says &quot;drop by spoonfuls&quot;. 

THIS IS A REALLY POOR RECIPE. It did puff up a lot in the oven, but was just way below par, even the translations of ingredients from cups to mls is off, a cup is 250ml, making 1¼C = 312.5ml, not 300ml as listed in the recipe. The recipe also lists 'granulated sugar' among the ingredients - I would take this to mean standard white sugar, which would make meringue a bit harder to pull off than what is listed in most recipes, caster sugar. This is what I found in the wikipedia article about sugar:

'':::&quot;Granulated sugar comes in various crystal sizes — for home and industrial use — depending on the application:

:::Coarse-grained sugars, such as sanding sugar (nibbed sugar or sugar nibs) find favor for decorating cookies (biscuits) and other desserts. 
Normal granulated sugars for table use: typically they have a grain size about 0.5 mm across 
Finer grades result from selectively sieving the granulated sugar 
caster sugar (0.35 mm), commonly used in baking 
superfine sugar, also called baker's sugar, berry sugar, or bar sugar — favored for sweetening drinks or for preparing meringue&quot;''

Also the part of the recipe that states:
'':::&quot;Remove any soft part from center of meringues and return to oven to dry out after turning off heat. &quot;''
also suggests that the recipe is faulty, as you should not need to remove any part of the meringue (and thus ruin its presentation) if made correctly.

I vote that this recipe be scrapped in favour of a basic caster sugar and egg whites recipe. [[User:Tinkstar1985|Tink]] 08:55, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Microsoft C Compiler ==

Here is a simple function in C:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int MyFunction(int x, int y)
 {
 	return (x * 2) + (y * 3);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
 
Using cl.exe, we are going to generate 3 separate listings for MyFunction, one with CDECL, one with FASTCALL, and one with STDCALL calling conventions. On the commandline, there are several switches that you can use to force the compiler to change the default:

*&lt;code&gt;/Gd&lt;/code&gt; : The default calling convention is CDECL
*&lt;code&gt;/Gr&lt;/code&gt; : The default calling convention is FASTCALL
*&lt;code&gt;/Gz&lt;/code&gt; : The default calling convention is STDCALL

Using these commandline options, here are the listings:

=== CDECL ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int MyFunction(int x, int y)
 {
 	return (x * 2) + (y * 3);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
 
becomes:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 PUBLIC	_MyFunction
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _x$ = 8						; size = 4
 _y$ = 12						; size = 4
 _MyFunction	PROC NEAR
 ; Line 4
 	push	ebp
 	mov	ebp, esp
 ; Line 5
 	mov	eax, _y$[ebp]
 	imul	eax, 3
 	mov	ecx, _x$[ebp]
 	lea	eax, [eax+ecx*2]
 ; Line 6 
 	pop	ebp
 	ret	0
 _MyFunction	ENDP
 _TEXT	ENDS
 END
&lt;/source&gt;
 
On entry of a function, ESP points to the return address pushed on the stack by the &lt;tt&gt;call&lt;/tt&gt; instruction (that is, previous contents of EIP). Any argument in stack of higher address than entry ESP is pushed by caller before the call is made; in this example, the first argument is at offset +4 from ESP (EIP is 4 bytes wide), plus 4 more bytes once the EBP is pushed on the stack. Thus, at line 5, ESP points to the saved frame pointer EBP, and arguments are located at addresses ESP+8 (x) and ESP+12 (y).

For CDECL, caller pushes arguments into stack in a right to left order. Because ret 0 is used, it must be the caller who cleans up the stack.

As a point of interest, notice how '''lea''' is used in this function to simultaneously perform the multiplication (ecx * 2), and the addition of that quantity to eax. Unintuitive instructions like this will be explored further in the chapter on [[x86 Disassembly/Code Obfuscation|unintuitive instructions]].

=== FASTCALL ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int MyFunction(int x, int y)
 {
 	return (x * 2) + (y * 3);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
 
becomes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 PUBLIC	@MyFunction@8
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _y$ = -8						; size = 4
 _x$ = -4						; size = 4
 @MyFunction@8 PROC NEAR
 ; _x$ = ecx
 ; _y$ = edx
 ; Line 4
 	push	ebp
 	mov	ebp, esp
 	sub	esp, 8
 	mov	_y$[ebp], edx
 	mov	_x$[ebp], ecx
 ; Line 5
 	mov	eax, _y$[ebp]
 	imul	eax, 3
 	mov	ecx, _x$[ebp]
 	lea	eax, [eax+ecx*2]
 ; Line 6
 	mov	esp, ebp
 	pop	ebp
 	ret	0
 @MyFunction@8 ENDP
 _TEXT	ENDS
 END
&lt;/source&gt;

This function was compiled with optimizations turned off. Here we see arguments are first saved in stack then fetched from stack, rather than be used directly. This is because the compiler wants a consistent way to use all arguments via stack access, not only one compiler does like that.

There is no argument is accessed with positive offset to entry SP, it seems caller doesn’t pushed in them, thus it can use ret 0. Let’s do further investigation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int FastTest(int x, int y, int z, int a, int b, int c)
 {
     return x * y * z * a * b * c;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

and the corresponding listing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 PUBLIC	@FastTest@24
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _y$ = -8						; size = 4
 _x$ = -4						; size = 4
 _z$ = 8						; size = 4
 _a$ = 12						; size = 4
 _b$ = 16						; size = 4
 _c$ = 20						; size = 4
 @FastTest@24 PROC NEAR
 ; _x$ = ecx
 ; _y$ = edx
 ; Line 2
 	push	ebp
 	mov	ebp, esp
 	sub	esp, 8
 	mov	_y$[ebp], edx
 	mov	_x$[ebp], ecx
 ; Line 3
 	mov	eax, _x$[ebp]
 	imul	eax, DWORD PTR _y$[ebp]
 	imul	eax, DWORD PTR _z$[ebp]
 	imul	eax, DWORD PTR _a$[ebp]
 	imul	eax, DWORD PTR _b$[ebp]
 	imul	eax, DWORD PTR _c$[ebp]
 ; Line 4
 	mov	esp, ebp
 	pop	ebp
 	ret	16					; 00000010H
&lt;/source&gt;
 	
Now we have 6 arguments, four are pushed in by caller from right to left, and last two are passed again in cx/dx, and processed the same way as previous example. Stack cleanup is done by ret 16, which corresponding to 4 arguments pushed before call executed.

For FASTCALL, compiler will try to pass arguments in registers, if not enough caller will pushed them into stack still in an order from right to left. Stack cleanup is done by callee. It is called FASTCALL because if arguments can be passed in registers (for 64bit CPU the maximum number is 6), no stack push/clean up is needed.

The name-decoration scheme of the function: @MyFunction@n, here n is stack size needed for all arguments.

=== STDCALL ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int MyFunction(int x, int y)
 {
 	return (x * 2) + (y * 3);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
 
becomes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 PUBLIC	_MyFunction@8
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _x$ = 8						; size = 4
 _y$ = 12						; size = 4
 _MyFunction@8 PROC NEAR
 ; Line 4
 	push	ebp
 	mov	ebp, esp
 ; Line 5
 	mov	eax, _y$[ebp]
 	imul	eax, 3
 	mov	ecx, _x$[ebp]
 	lea	eax, [eax+ecx*2]
 ; Line 6
 	pop	ebp
 	ret	8
 _MyFunction@8 ENDP
 _TEXT	ENDS
 END
&lt;/source&gt;
 
The STDCALL listing has only one difference than the CDECL listing that it uses &quot;ret 8&quot; for self clean up of stack. Lets do an example with more parameters:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int STDCALLTest(int x, int y, int z, int a, int b, int c)
 {
 	return x * y * z * a * b * c;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's take a look at how this function gets translated into assembly by cl.exe:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 PUBLIC	_STDCALLTest@24
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _x$ = 8						; size = 4
 _y$ = 12						; size = 4
 _z$ = 16						; size = 4
 _a$ = 20						; size = 4
 _b$ = 24						; size = 4
 _c$ = 28						; size = 4
 _STDCALLTest@24 PROC NEAR
 ; Line 2
 	push	ebp
 	mov	ebp, esp
 ; Line 3
 	mov	eax, _x$[ebp]
 	imul	eax, DWORD PTR _y$[ebp]

&lt;/source&gt;

Yes the only difference between STDCALL and CDECL is that the former does stack clean up in callee, the later in caller. This saves a little bit in X86 due to its &quot;ret n&quot;.

== GNU C Compiler ==

We will be using 2 example C functions to demonstrate how GCC implements calling conventions: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int MyFunction1(int x, int y)
 {
 	return (x * 2) + (y * 3);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int MyFunction2(int x, int y, int z, int a, int b, int c)
 {
 	return x * y * (z + 1) * (a + 2) * (b + 3) * (c + 4);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

GCC does not have commandline arguments to force the default calling convention to change from CDECL (for C), so they will be manually defined in the text with the directives: __cdecl, __fastcall, and __stdcall.

=== CDECL ===

The first function (MyFunction1) provides the following assembly listing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 _MyFunction1:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	movl	8(%ebp), %eax
 	leal	(%eax,%eax), %ecx
 	movl	12(%ebp), %edx
 	movl	%edx, %eax
 	addl	%eax, %eax
 	addl	%edx, %eax
 	leal	(%eax,%ecx), %eax
 	popl	%ebp
 	ret
&lt;/source&gt;

First of all, we can see the name-decoration is the same as in cl.exe. We can also see that the ret instruction doesn't have an argument, so the calling function is cleaning the stack. However, since GCC doesn't provide us with the variable names in the listing, we have to deduce which parameters are which. After the stack frame is set up, the first instruction of the function is &quot;movl 8(%ebp), %eax&quot;. One we remember (or learn for the first time) that GAS instructions have the general form:

 instruction src, dest

We realize that the value at offset +8 from ebp (the last parameter pushed on the stack) is moved into eax. The leal instruction is a little more difficult to decipher, especially if we don't have any experience with GAS instructions. The form &quot;leal(reg1,reg2), dest&quot; adds the values in the parenthesis together, and stores the value in ''dest''. Translated into Intel syntax, we get the instruction:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 lea ecx, [eax + eax]
&lt;/source&gt;

Which is clearly the same as a multiplication by 2. The first value accessed must then have been the last value passed, which would seem to indicate that values are passed right-to-left here. To prove this, we will look at the next section of the listing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 movl	12(%ebp), %edx
 movl	%edx, %eax
 addl	%eax, %eax
 addl	%edx, %eax
 leal	(%eax,%ecx), %eax
&lt;/source&gt;

the value at offset +12 from ebp is moved into edx. edx is then moved into eax. eax is then added to itselt (eax * 2), and then is added back to edx (edx + eax). remember though that eax = 2 * edx, so the result is edx * 3. This then is clearly the y parameter, which is furthest on the stack, and was therefore the first pushed. CDECL then on GCC is implemented by passing arguments on the stack in right-to-left order, same as cl.exe. 

=== FASTCALL ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 .globl @MyFunction1@8
 	.def	@MyFunction1@8;	.scl	2;	.type	32;	.endef
 @MyFunction1@8:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	subl	$8, %esp
 	movl	%ecx, -4(%ebp)
 	movl	%edx, -8(%ebp)
 	movl	-4(%ebp), %eax
 	leal	(%eax,%eax), %ecx
 	movl	-8(%ebp), %edx
 	movl	%edx, %eax
 	addl	%eax, %eax
 	addl	%edx, %eax
 	leal	(%eax,%ecx), %eax
 	leave
 	ret
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice first that the same name decoration is used as in cl.exe. The astute observer will already have realized that GCC uses the same trick as cl.exe, of moving the fastcall arguments from their registers (ecx and edx again) onto a negative offset on the stack. Again, optimizations are turned off. ecx is moved into the first position (-4) and edx is moved into the second position (-8). Like the CDECL example above, the value at -4 is doubled, and the value at -8 is tripled. Therefore, -4 (ecx) is x, and -8 (edx) is y. It would seem from this listing then that values are passed left-to-right, although we will need to take a look at the larger, MyFunction2 example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 .globl @MyFunction2@24
 	.def	@MyFunction2@24;	.scl	2;	.type	32;	.endef
 @MyFunction2@24:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	subl	$8, %esp
 	movl	%ecx, -4(%ebp)
 	movl	%edx, -8(%ebp)
 	movl	-4(%ebp), %eax
 	imull	-8(%ebp), %eax
 	movl	8(%ebp), %edx
 	incl	%edx
 	imull	%edx, %eax
 	movl	12(%ebp), %edx
 	addl	$2, %edx
 	imull	%edx, %eax
 	movl	16(%ebp), %edx
 	addl	$3, %edx
 	imull	%edx, %eax
 	movl	20(%ebp), %edx
 	addl	$4, %edx
 	imull	%edx, %eax
 	leave
 	ret	$16
&lt;/source&gt;

By following the fact that in MyFunction2, successive parameters are added to increasing constants, we can deduce the positions of each parameter. -4 is still x, and -8 is still y. +8 gets incremented by 1 (z), +12 gets increased by 2 (a). +16 gets increased by 3 (b), and +20 gets increased by 4 (c). Let's list these values then:

 z = [ebp + 8]
 a = [ebp + 12]
 b = [ebp + 16]
 c = [ebp + 20]

c is the furthest down, and therefore was the first pushed. z is the highest to the top, and was therefore the last pushed. Arguments are therefore pushed in right-to-left order, just like cl.exe.

=== STDCALL ===

Let's compare then the implementation of MyFunction1 in GCC:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 .globl _MyFunction1@8
 	.def	_MyFunction1@8;	.scl	2;	.type	32;	.endef
 _MyFunction1@8:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	movl	8(%ebp), %eax
 	leal	(%eax,%eax), %ecx
 	movl	12(%ebp), %edx
 	movl	%edx, %eax
 	addl	%eax, %eax
 	addl	%edx, %eax
 	leal	(%eax,%ecx), %eax
 	popl	%ebp
 	ret	$8
&lt;/source&gt;

The name decoration is the same as in cl.exe, so STDCALL functions (and CDECL and FASTCALL for that matter) can be assembled with either compiler, and linked with either linker, it seems. The stack frame is set up, then the value at [ebp + 8] is doubled. After that, the value at [ebp + 12] is tripled. Therefore, +8 is x, and +12 is y. Again, these values are pushed in right-to-left order. This function also cleans its own stack with the &quot;ret 8&quot; instruction.

Looking at a bigger example: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 .globl _MyFunction2@24
 	.def	_MyFunction2@24;	.scl	2;	.type	32;	.endef
 _MyFunction2@24:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	movl	8(%ebp), %eax
 	imull	12(%ebp), %eax
 	movl	16(%ebp), %edx
 	incl	%edx
 	imull	%edx, %eax
 	movl	20(%ebp), %edx
 	addl	$2, %edx
 	imull	%edx, %eax
 	movl	24(%ebp), %edx
 	addl	$3, %edx
 	imull	%edx, %eax
 	movl	28(%ebp), %edx
 	addl	$4, %edx
 	imull	%edx, %eax
 	popl	%ebp
 	ret	$24
&lt;/source&gt;

We can see here that values at +8 and +12 from ebp are still x and y, respectively. The value at +16 is incremented by 1, the value at +20 is incremented by 2, etc all the way to the value at +28. We can therefore create the following table:

 x = [ebp + 8]
 y = [ebp + 12]
 z = [ebp + 16]
 a = [ebp + 20]
 b = [ebp + 24]
 c = [ebp + 28]

With c being pushed first, and x being pushed last. Therefore, these parameters are also pushed in right-to-left order. This function then also cleans 24 bytes off the stack with the &quot;ret 24&quot; instruction.

== Example: C Calling Conventions ==

{{TextBox|1=

Identify the calling convention of the following C function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int MyFunction(int a, int b)
 {
    return a + b;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The function is written in C, and has no other specifiers, so it is CDECL by default.}}

== Example: Named Assembly Function ==

{{TextBox|1=

Identify the calling convention of the function '''MyFunction''':

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 :_MyFunction@12
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 ...
 pop ebp
 ret 12
&lt;/source&gt;

The function includes the decorated name of an STDCALL function, and cleans up its own stack. It is therefore an STDCALL function.}}

== Example: Unnamed Assembly Function ==

{{TextBox|1=

This code snippet is the entire body of an unnamed assembly function. Identify the calling convention of this function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 add eax, edx
 pop ebp
 ret
&lt;/source&gt;

The function sets up a stack frame, so we know the compiler hasnt done anything &quot;funny&quot; to it. It accesses registers which arent initialized yet, in the edx and eax registers. It is therefore a FASTCALL function.}}

== Example: Another Unnamed Assembly Function ==

{{TextBox|1=
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp 
 mov ebp, esp
 mov eax, [ebp + 8]
 pop ebp
 ret 16
&lt;/source&gt;

The function has a standard stack frame, and the ''ret'' instruction has a parameter to clean its own stack. Also, it accesses a parameter from the stack. It is therefore an STDCALL function.}}

== Example: Name Mangling ==

{{TextBox|1=

What can we tell about the following function call?

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov ecx, x
 push eax
 mov eax, ss:[ebp - 4]
 push eax
 mov al, ss:[ebp - 3]
 call @__Load?$Container__XXXY_?Fcii
&lt;/source&gt;

Two things should get our attention immediately. The first is that before the function call, a value is stored into ecx. Also, the function name itself is heavily mangled. This example must use the C++ THISCALL convention. Inside the mangled name of the function, we can pick out two english words, &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Container&quot;. Without knowing the specifics of this name mangling scheme, it is not possible to determine which word is the function name, and which word is the class name.

We can pick out two 32-bit variables being passed to the function, and a single 8-bit variable. The first is located in '''eax''', the second is originally located on the stack from offset -4 from '''ebp''', and the third is located at '''ebp''' offset -3. In C++, these would likely correspond to two '''int''' variables, and a single '''char''' variable. Notice at the end of the mangled function name are three lower-case characters &quot;cii&quot;. We can't know for certain, but it appears these three letters correspond to the three parameters (char, int, int). We do not know from this whether the function returns a value or not, so we will assume the function returns '''void'''.

Assuming that &quot;Load&quot; is the function name and &quot;Container&quot; is the class name (it could just as easily be the other way around), here is our function definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Container
{
  void Load(char, int, int);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==BASIC==
Here is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language wikipedia entry].

Be warned before reading this page, that some language features here are only applicable for certain BASIC flavors.
===Type===
 
BASIC is a full procedural language or object oriented depending on the BASIC you are using.
BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code

===Execution Entry Point===

Modern BASICS are usually integrated into a visual, event-driven environment; in such applications, there is no program entry point in the developer's view.  In the case of a command-line REALbasic program, there is a Run event of the ConsoleApplication class which is invoked when the program begins, and which receives command-line arguments as an array of strings.

===General Syntax===

BASIC syntax uses very little special punctuation, beyond those common to algebra and most other languages, such as &quot;+&quot; for addition.  The equal sign (&quot;=&quot;) is used for both assignment and equality testing, which raises no ambiguity since (unlike C) an assignment statement may not be used as part of another expression.  Parentheses are used for grouping terms, as in algebra, as well as for indexing into arrays.  A period (or dot) is used for accessing object properties or methods.  Square brackets, curly braces, and other odd punctuation are not used.

Code blocks are delimited by statements; for example, an &quot;if&quot; block begins with an &quot;if&quot; statement and ends with &quot;end if&quot;.  Statements are separated by line breaks, though a statement that needs to span multiple lines can do so via a special line continuation character (&quot; _&quot;, space followed by an underscore) and several statements can be kept in one line by using the colon (&quot;:&quot;) character, although this is usually not considered to be a good programming practice.

Here's a typical example of BASIC code:

  Dim i As Integer
  Dim s As String
  for i = 1 to 4
    s = s + &quot;spam, &quot;
  next
  MsgBox s + &quot;baked beans, and spam!&quot;

===Comments===

Both VisualBasic and REALbasic use a single apostrophe to denote a comment, which continues to the end of the line.  The old REM statement may also be used, though it is no longer in fashion.  REALbasic may also use C++-style &quot;//&quot; comments.  BASIC supports no block comment mechanism, though the IDE may support quickly commenting or uncommenting blocks of code.  Example:

  meaning = 6*7   ' This is a comment
  REM So's this, but nobody writes comments this way anymore.
  // This comment will work only in REALbasic.
  &lt;nowiki&gt;‘‘‘&lt;/nowiki&gt; In VB.NET, three apostrophes mean an XML comment.

===Variable Declarations===
REALbasic is a strongly-typed language; Visual Basic is more loosely typed, an untyped variable would be automatically typed as Variant-typed (VB 6 and lower) or Object-typed (VB .NET), both of them means the variable can switch types depending on the content of the variable, simulating an untyped variable. In VB.NET, there is an option to force the declaration of type. Local variables are declared using a Dim statement:

  Dim i As Integer

Variable may be given initial value at declaration time. Although not for VB6.

  Dim transplant As String = &quot;liver&quot;

Multiple variables may be declared on a single line, and they may be given initial values at declaration time, as shown here:

  Dim x As Integer, xstr As String

Note that an important difference exists between REALbasic and VisualBasic when two variables are declared with only one type:

  Dim a, b As Double

In REALbasic and VB.NET, both a and b would be variables of type Double.  In VB 6, b would be a Double, but a would be a Variant (essentially, an untyped variable).

Note that in the case of an object declaration, there is a further shortcut for initializing the variable to a new object instance:

  Dim d1 as New Date        ' this...
  Dim d2 as Date = New Date ' does the same as this, except this is not allowed in VB6

Variables may also be declared as properties of classes, windows, or modules.  These use the same syntax, or are edited directly by the IDE.

===Method Declaration/Implementation===

Methods are defined by a Function or Sub keyword.  Here is an example.

  Function Factorial( num As Integer ) As Integer
    Dim out As Integer = 1
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 2 to Num
      out = out * i
    Next i
    Return out
  End Function

===Scope===
REALbasic uses block scoping within a method; that is, a Dim statement within (for example) an If block makes a variable that goes out of scope at the end of that block.  Local variables declared at the top of a method go out of scope at the end of the method.  All variables declared within a method are inaccessible outside that method, and with the exception of static variables, use stack storage.

Properties of classes, modules, and windows are stored on the heap.  Module properties may be private (accessible only within the module), public (accessible from anywhere by using the module name as a prefix), or global (accessible from anywhere with no prefix).  Class properties may be private (accessible only within that class), protected (accessible within that class or its subclasses), or public (accessible from anywhere via an object reference).  Windows are really just classes, and have the same scoping rules.

===Conditional Statements===
BASIC supports If/ElseIf/Else blocks:

 If fullness &lt; 10 Then
   result = &quot;Bring me more food!&quot;
 ElseIf fullness = 10 Then
   result = &quot;I couldn't eat another bite.&quot;
 Else
   Explode
 End If

There is also a single-line format useful for quick tests:

 If not haveShrubbery Then Say &quot;Ni&quot;

For larger blocks of tests, a Select Case may be used:

 Select Case healthStage
 Case 0
   x = &quot;I'm not quite dead yet&quot;
 Case 1
   x = &quot;I'm feeling better&quot;
 Case 2
   x = &quot;Think I'll go for a walk now&quot;
 Else
   x = &quot;I feel happy...&quot;
 End Select

===Looping Statements===
BASIC sports a variety of looping constructs, including For/Next, Do/Loop, and While/Wend.  The For statement may use either a numerical counter, or may iterate over the elements of an array using For Each.

 For i = 1 To 100
   i = i + 1
 Next i

 For Each knight in Knights
   results.Append knight.Name + &quot; says Ni!&quot;
 Next

===Output Statements===
Most BASIC applications are visual (GUI) applications, and have no standard output.  However, if one just needs to display a short message, the MsgBox statement may be used:

  MsgBox &quot;Hello world!&quot;

For debugging purposes, in REALbasic, you could also use System.DebugLog, which sends its argument to the standard debugging console for the platform you're on. In VB6, you can use Debug.Print to print a statement on the Immediate Window. In VB.NET, you can use the Debug object for various debugging options.

===Containers===
BASIC includes supports for arrays, which may be passed as arguments, returned from functions, assigned to variables, and so on.  There is also a Collection class, and in REALbasic, a Dictionary class which holds arbitrary key/value pairs.

In cases where none of these built-in containers are suitable, one can easily define a custom container class using whatever internal storage is most appropriate.
===Algorithms===
Arrays of most primitive datatypes (e.g. numbers and strings) can be sorted (in VB.NET and REALbasic) or shuffled (REALbasic), as in this example:

 Function Choose5( cards() as String ) as String()
   ' shuffle the given cards, choose 5 at random,
   ' and return them in sorted order
   cards.Shuffle
   Dim out() as String
   For i As Integer = 1 to 5
     out.Append cards(i)
   Next
   out.Sort
   return out
 End Function

The Dictionary class (in REALbasic) provides a built-in implementation of a resizable hash table.  Other algorithms may of course be written by the user as needed.

===Garbage collection===
BASIC uses reference counting rather than garbage collection.  When there are no more references to an object or string, its memory is automatically (and immediately) released.

===Physical Structure===
Visual Basic projects are made up of a variety of files, most of them plain text.  REALbasic projects are usually stored in a single-file, proprietary binary format, though it is also possible to store project items externally, in either binary or XML format.

===Tips===
Don't confuse Visual Basic with REALbasic and with classic BASIC (represented largely by Microsoft QuickBasic and QBASIC).  They have common roots and similar syntax, but rather different semantics.  REALbasic's semantics are closer to Java or VB.NET than to Visual Basic, which is more procedural than object-oriented.

A '''gill''' (pronounced: {{IPA|dʒil}}) is a unit of liquid measure equal to one fourth of a standard British [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] which is 5 fluid ounces or about ⅔ of an American cup. The Oxford English Dictionary adds that in many districts a gill is a half-pint, a quarter-pint being called a ''jack''.</text>

A '''pinch''' is a very informal unit, equal to the amount of powder that can comfortably be held between the thumb and forefinger.  It is roughly equal to 1/8 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]].

If this were accurate, which it's not, the metric equivalent would be 0.625 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]. Call it 1/2 mL or 2/3 mL if you like.</text>

Although the spelling of &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;أنا &lt;/font&gt;('ana) indicates a long&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ا &lt;/font&gt;(aa) sound. It is always pronounced ('ana), The use of (anaa) has a special usage (particularly found in the reciting of sacred religious texts (i.e. the Quran). So just say ('a-na).
That's the Arabic word for &quot;I&quot;. &quot;I&quot; and&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; أنا &lt;/font&gt;are the singular, first person, nominative pronoun.

Adding the suffix&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ـِي&lt;/font&gt; (ee) to a word to say it's yours.
&lt;br&gt;

an example:

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;كتاب --&gt; كتابي&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
kitaabun--&gt;kitaabee&lt;br&gt;
ki-taa-bun  --&gt;  ki-taa-bee&lt;br&gt;
a book--&gt;my book
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It does not matter if it was:
kitaabun or kitaabin or kitaaban  
meaning &quot;a book&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
All become  kitaabee.&lt;br&gt;
kitaabun--&gt;kitaabee&lt;br&gt;
kitaaban--&gt;kitaabee&lt;br&gt;
kitaabin--&gt;kitaabee&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This makes it much simpler grammatically to say something is yours than to say something is his, or hers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vegetarian?==
I don't think that recipies with eggs in them are vegetarian.  I have removed the vegetarian label for that reason. [[User:69.165.27.107]]

:Yes they are. You confuse [[Cookbook:Vegetarian|vegetarian]] with [[Cookbook:Vegan|vegan]]. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:52, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

:That's right, most of us vegetarians do eat eggs, but not chicken meat. [[User:69.87.194.147|69.87.194.147]] 14:00, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

==Sour milk==

Where can sour milk be found in America?

Some people add a few tablespoons of vinegar to milk to get the effect - I used cultured buttermilk, and it turned out wonderfully. This is a really good recipe, by the way!

==Notes / Ideas==
*this recipe is almost identical to my Vegan recipe except
** there are no eggs
** the milk is soy/rice/oat/nut milk
** the white sugar can be substituted with maple syrup for many good reasons 
** the recipe also works with 1/4 tsp. baking soda and 1/4 tsp. baking powder

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;مَن&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(man)&lt;br&gt;
Don't pronounce it like the English word &quot;man&quot;.&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; من &lt;/font&gt;(man) has a shorter vowel sound, the &quot;a&quot; sound doesn't last as long. Do not confuse this word with the word (min) in Arabic. (min) generally means &quot;from&quot;, while (man) means &quot;who&quot;.  This word goes before someone's name, or a nominative preposition or a noun. It's function is exactly the same as &quot;who&quot; in question sentences.

Examples&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
من هو؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;man huwa&lt;br&gt;
man-hu-wa&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
من أنت؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;man ant(a/i)
man-ant&lt;br&gt;
Who are you?&lt;br&gt;
Only when talking to one person.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;man ''dh''ahab(a)?&lt;br&gt;

Who went?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
من ذهب الى الـمدرسة؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;man ''dh''ahaba ila al_madrasah(-ti)?&lt;br&gt;
man-''dh''a-ha-ba-i-lal-mad-ra-sah&lt;br&gt;
Who went to school?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;man Muslim(un)&lt;br&gt;
man-mus-lim&lt;br&gt;
Who is a Muslim?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ء   OR أ &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This type of hamza can start a question. It works in the same way as &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; هل &lt;/font&gt; (hal). It goes before a statement to make it a question. It makes the sound (a). Make sure that you don't pronounce it so it rhymes with &quot;bay&quot;, it rhymes with &quot;la&quot;. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
أليس كذلك؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a laysa ka''dh''aalik?&lt;br&gt;
a-lay-sa-ka-''dh''aa-lik&lt;br&gt;
Isn't it?  /  Isn't it like that?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
أرئيت؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a ra'ayt?&lt;br&gt;
a-ra-ayt&lt;br&gt;
Have you seen?&lt;br&gt;

==The difference between&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; هل&lt;/font&gt; (hal) and&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ء/أ&lt;/font&gt; (-hamza-)==

*When asking about something happening now&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ء/أ &lt;/font&gt;is used.
The sentence &quot;Are you cooking something?&quot; would be translated with a&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ء/أ &lt;/font&gt;(hamza) at the beginning.

*When asking about something to happen in the future, or regularly&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; هل &lt;/font&gt;is used.
The sentence &quot;Do you cook?&quot; or &quot;Will you cook?&quot; must be translated with&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; هل &lt;/font&gt;(hal).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;أين&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

So you want to ask where something is in Arabic. Well it is nearly impossible without knowing the Arabic word for &quot;where&quot;. Now the Arabic word for &quot;where&quot; is أين (ay-na) only in questions.
&lt;br&gt;
For example, أين (ay-na) cannot be used for the following sentences.
He ate where he slept.
This is because (ay-na) makes a sentence automatically a question. So if where in the previous sentence &quot;where&quot; was translated as أين (ay-na). It would be interpreted as:
He ate. Where did he sleep?
&lt;br&gt;
So take this as a lesson, Some Arabic words only share one use of an opposite English word. And an Arabic word never completely equals an English word in meaning, usage, notions, etc.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
أين هو؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ayna huwa&lt;br&gt;
ay-na--hu-wa&lt;br&gt;
Where is he?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
أين هو يا ترى؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ayna huwa yaa tura&lt;br&gt;
ay-na--hu-wa--yaa--tu-ra&lt;br&gt;
where the hell is he?&lt;br&gt;
Notice that in the translation &quot;the hell&quot; was used. This is the most easily understandable translation. In the Arabic sentence there is no word for hell in it. So it cannot be considered impolite to say.

Hey. Welcome to Wikibooks. 
I like what you've done so far at [[PlayStation Portable]].  May I suggest moving the pages to the [[PSP Programming]] namespace? For example:
*[[PSP Programming/Basic Concepts]]
**[[PSP Programming/A Brief History]]
**etc..

It's not a big deal at all, but it would be consistent with the other [[Console Game Programming|console programming books]]. Cya round! &amp;mdash;[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 05:02, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

:A textbook on the neuroscience and philosophy of consciousness that can compete with the best hard-copy textbooks on the subject.
: Really impressive. Look at these schemas! Many images (all have proper licenses), well-formed text, lots of information - I think it's worth becoming Book of the Month. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 23:24, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:This Wikibook is a good example of a somewhat tough subject that has been organized and fleshed out with few &quot;red links&quot; anywhere.  While perhaps it could be improved with further editing and more content, it does a good job with what is there.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:25, 8 October 2005 (UTC)
:I don't like it. There's a plenty of very short (three-four sentences) chapters. It's not well-formated - text look rather ugly. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 23:24, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

**AFP is rarely positive in cholangiocarcinoma but in 35-75% of hepatomas
**Presence of MIB-1 and AgNOR, and lack of CD44 (esp. CD44v6) appears correlated with LN mets and tumor progression

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These results indicate that activated AKT in BDC cells is associated with radioresistance and suggest that pharmacological or genetic modulation of AKT activity may have important therapeutic implications in BDC patients treated with radiation.&quot;

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Assessment of mean Ki-67 antigen expression, as measured by MIB-1 staining, in samples of hilar bile duct carcinoma appeared to be an important indicator of clinical behavior. However, there were no significant correlations between clinicopathological factors or stent patency and p53 immunoreactivity.&quot;

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our results suggest that (a) alteration of the Smad4 gene is a major factor in the development of ampullary cancer and (b) PTEN, Smad4 and DCC genes are altered infrequently in EHBD cancers.&quot;

**K-ras, p53, and APC genes were mutated in 9.6%, 32.7%, and 0% of EHBD cancers, respectively

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The results of the current study suggest that a lack of expression of CD44, especially CD44v6, is correlated with lymph node metastases and poor prognosis, and may be a prognostic factor for patients with EHBD/ampullary carcinoma.&quot;

1. Answer:
 print &quot;Input a line of text: &quot;;
 $text = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
 print &quot;\n&quot;;
 print &quot;You entered: $text\n&quot;;
2. Answer:
 my @lines;

 }
 $&quot; = &quot;|&quot;;
 print &quot;@lines\n&quot;;

What is &lt;code&gt;chomp&lt;/code&gt; there for? Try running the program without it.

3. Answer:
 my $line1 = readline STDIN;
 my $line2 = readline STDIN;
 my $line3 = readline STDIN;
 chomp($line1, $line2, $line3);
 print(&quot;| $line1 | $line2 | $line3 |\n&quot;);

==Input from the command-line==

Answer:
 foreach (@ARGV) {
   print &quot;$_\n&quot;;
 }

==Input from a text file==

Answer:
 open my $file, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo.txt&quot;;
 my @lines;
 foreach (&lt;$file&gt;) {
   chomp($_);
   push(@lines, $_);
 }
 $&quot; = &quot;|&quot;;

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

'''Microwave Chocolate Pudding''' is a pudding made with sugar, milk, unsweetened cocoa powder and thickened with cornstarch. It is prepared in a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]]. 

==Ingredients==
===Dry ingredients===
* 1/3 cup (80g) granulated sugar or &quot;Splenda&quot; (R) sugar substitute
* 1/4 cup (60g) unsweetened cocoa powder
* 3 Tbsp corn starch
* 1/8 tsp salt
===Wet ingredients===
* 2 cups (480ml) of whole, 2%, 1%, or skim milk. Soy milk may also be used.
* 1 tsp of vanilla extract or imitation vanilla

==Procedure==
# In a 1-qt microwave-safe bowl, but '''''NOT''''' a metal one, mix the dry ingredients--the sugar, the unsweeetened cocoa powder, the corn starch, and the salt.
# Add the cold milk and mix well with a small wire whisk or an electric mixer until all the cocoa lumps have dissolved.
# Microwave in the bowl, on high (100%) power, for 3 minutes. Stir well.
# Microwave, again on high power, for an additional 4 to 6 minutes, stirring after each minute of cooking.
# Remove the bowl from the microwave oven and stir in the vanilla.
# Pour the result into 4 small custard cups and chill before serving.

==Notes, tips and variations==

A microwave-safe lid--'''''NOT''''' metal--can be placed, slightly ajar, on the bowl while the pudding is cooking. This will prevent the pudding from splattering all over the microwave.

==Warnings==

* Keep a close watch on the pudding during the actual cooking, as it can easily boil over.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thanks to whoever corrected my grammer and spelling etc as well as making the page look prety.  Looks alot better now, any ideas what scales or theory should go on this bit now?


This page could use an introduction, like : what is a scale? Thanks! --kenden 3:09 30/05/2006


Something I would like to see is an explanation as to why it is important to learn to play scales and how knowing them contributes to playing. -- MoonBrain 29/03/2009

==Replacing old template diagrams==

Hello Poo face. I've been replacing the older style tab with a &quot;scale manual&quot; exercise type of image. If you wish to revert back to the earlier style, please do. All the images I've placed in Wikimedia Commons under the public domain license; so feel free to use them for any purpose you see fit. They can be found under the categories: Chords on guitar or Scales on guitar

== Scales Up The Neck ==

It would be nice to see diagrams showing how to play each given scale up the whole neck. Often you will see the different boxes of the pentatonic scales so that people can learn how to play using the whole length of the neck. However I haven't seen anything like this for the major or minor scales. As I understand it, modes can be learned using boxes of the major scales similar to the boxes we learn about the pentatonic scale. e.g. We often see the major scale box starting at the root (say G), and go up two frets on the sixth string, then two more on the sixth string for the fist three notes (so that you understand the box I'm talking about). Now start the same scale but start on A say. Wouldn't that be an A Dorian or something? But it is also the G but starting out different. And do that starting from the B, then C, and so on up the neck. Then people get to see how to play the scale up the neck, but if I'm right, also shows them how the different modes relate to the scale. My knowledge of modes isn't so hot, so I would defer to someone with better knowledge.

== Editing and capitalization ==

I'm using Donald Jay Grout's &quot;A History Of Western Music&quot; (1962 UK First Edition) as a guide for correct terminology amd presentation. So &quot;major-minor&quot; system rather than &quot;Major-Minor&quot; system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==FORTRAN==
Here is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran wikipedia entry].
The following briefly describes [[Fortran77]].  Fortran 77 was a refinement of Fortran 66 and Fortran IV, but added some desirable new features.  Most notably &lt;code&gt;CHARACTER&lt;/code&gt;types.

===Type===
Fortran is a full procedural language.
===Execution Entry Point===
The main entry point to a program is at a &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; statement.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       PROGRAM XYZ
&lt;/source&gt;
===General Syntax===
Fortran was designed with punch card in mind, hence the actual Fortran code start on the 7th character offset.  Characters are prefix by 6 characters. Characters 1 to 5 indicate a label, character 6 indicates a line continuation.

For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
12345 PROGRAM 
     +HLO WLD
67890 PRINT *,
     +'HELLO WORLD'
99999 END
&lt;/source&gt;

N.B. inserting an extra character at the wrong place may cause unexpected behaviour. c.f. [[wikiquote:Special:Search=C._A._R._Hoare]] regarding the [[w:Mariner_program#Mariners_1_and_2|Mariner space rocket]].

A &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;END&gt; statement are optional in this example.

Note also:
# The characters from postion 76 onward are ignored.  So be careful when you insert a character into a long line.  (IBM FORT/VS compiler used to insert line numbers in this column for some odd reason)
# The space character is ignored, except in quotes, most notably these two lines are interpreted the same, hence the suspicion relating to the Mariner crash.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       DO 19,I=1,99
       DO19I=1,99
&lt;/source&gt;
===Comments===
A 'C', '*' and sometimes a 'c' character in the first column indicates a comment.
For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
* This is a hello world program
12345 PROGRAM 
     +HLO WLD
C Output Hello World
67890 PRINT *,
     +'HELLO WORLD'
c all done, I'm out of here...
99999 END
&lt;/source&gt;

===Variable Declarations===
In [[Fortran]] the type of a variable is implicitly defined by the first letter of the variable name.  Variables beginning with the letters '''I''' through '''N''' were automatically considered to be [[integer]]s, while '''A''' through '''H''' and '''O''' through '''Z''' were considered to be [[real number]]s.

This behavior can be modified with an IMPLICIT INTEGER declaration (setting the letter range of integers) or an explicit declaration of a variable giving its type.

Hence &quot;GOD is REAL (unless declared INTEGER).&quot; 

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
      PROGRAM EG DEC
* Net line is not needed as this would be IMPLICIT INTEGER
      INTEGER I,J,K
* long INTEGERs
      INTEGER II*8,JJ*8,KK*8
* define some arrays
      INTEGER M(2),N(3),O(4)
* Some array initialisations
      INTEGER MM(2)/1,2/,NNN(3)/1,2,3/,OOOO(4)/1,2,3,4/
* Some REAL initialisations
      REAL R/1.0/,S/2.0/,T/3.0/
* Some DOUBLE PRECISION (long) initialisations
      REAL*8 RR/1.0D/
      DOUBLE PRECISION SS/2.0D/
      END
&lt;/source&gt;

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
[[Fortran]] has several kind of &lt;CODE&gt;FUNCTIONS/SUBROUTINES&lt;/CODE&gt;.
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt; 
       PROGRAM P
         PRINT *,'The cube of 2 is',CUBE(2.0)
         PRINT *,'The square of 2 is',SQUARE(2.0)
       END

       FUNCTION CUBE(X)
* FILSQ is an inline Function returning the square of a value
         FILSQ(X)=X*X
         CUBE=FILSQ(X)*X
       RETURN
         ENTRY SQUARE(X)
         CUBE=FILSQ(X)
       END
&lt;/source&gt;
Produces:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 The cube of 2 is  8.
 The square of 2 is  4.
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that in the output the first character is normally a blank character.  By inserting other characters in the first column you can force the printer to do form feeds, and perform other interesting behaviors.

===Scope===
The scope of variable was strictly limited to the current PROGRAM/SUBROUTINE or DATA BLOCK.  DATA BLOCK can be shared between PROGRAM/SUBROUTINEs, allowed the programmer to extend the scope of a variable.

===Conditional Statements===
&lt;Describe the conditional statements in text and present.&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
* A one liner
       IF(1 .EQ. 2)PRINT *,'Dreaming'
* A block structured
       IF(1 .EQ. 1)THEN
         PRINT *,'A distinct possibility'
       ELIF(2 .EQ. 2)THEN
         PRINT *,'Too late'
       ELSE
         PRINT *,'Way too late'
       ENDIF
*
&lt;/source&gt;
Conditional statements also include GOTO statements.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       I=3
       GOTO(111,112,113,114)I
         PRINT *,'I was not found'
       GOTO 119
111    CONTINUE
         print *,'I was 1'
       GOTO 119
112    CONTINUE
         print *,'I was 2'
       GOTO 119
113    CONTINUE
         print *,'I was 3'
       GOTO 119
114    CONTINUE
         print *,'I was 4'
       GOTO 119
119    CONTINUE        
&lt;/source&gt;
FORTRAN also has a 3 way condition.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       I=1
       IF(I)121,122,123 
121    CONTINUE
         print *,'I is less then zero'
       GOTO 129
122    CONTINUE
         print *,'I is zero'
       GOTO 129
123    CONTINUE
         print *,'I is greater then zero'
       GOTO 129
129    CONTINUE
&lt;/source&gt;

===Looping Statements===
'''''FORTRAN 77''''' ''' &gt; DO / WHILE LOOP'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       A = 1
       DO WHILE (A .LT. 10)
          PRINT *, 'COUNTING: ', A
          A = A + 1
       END DO
&lt;/source&gt;
In older FORTRANS labels and GOTOs would be used to the same effect.
For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       INTEGER A
       IF(.NOT.(A .LT. 10))GO TO 139
         PRINT *,'COUNTING: ',A
         A = A + 1
* A convention is to terminate the label number with a 9
*   in cases where the GOTO breaks out of a loop.
139    CONTINUE
&lt;/source&gt;

===Output Statements===
Example one  hello world:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       PRINT *,'Hello World'
&lt;/source&gt;
Or:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       WRITE (*,*)'Hello World'
&lt;/source&gt;
Or (The stand output channel is 6):
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       WRITE (6,*)'Hello World'
&lt;/source&gt;
Or:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       WRITE (6,'( A)')'Hello World'
&lt;/source&gt;
Or:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       WRITE (UNIT=6,FMT='( A)')'Hello World'
&lt;/source&gt;
Or:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       WRITE (UNIT=6,FMT=141)'Hello World'
141    FORMAT(A)
&lt;/source&gt;
Fortran includes OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE and PRINT statements.  The READ and WRITE commands could access recored in a file by record number, hence Fortran contains a semblence of random file access.  Unfortunately on File IO the size of a &quot;word&quot; is implementation dependent, and ranges from 6 bits on CDC, 8bits on IBM and 32 bits on VAXVMS.

===Containers===
FORTRAN 77 has no structure or class definition.  The closest example was the COMMON statement.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       CHARACTER NAME*16, ADDRESS*64
       FLOAT BALANCE*4
       COMMOM /CSTREC/NAME,ADDRESS,BALANCE
&lt;/source&gt;
An EQUIVALENCE statement allows such COMMON block statement be be overlayed, and allow direct assignment.  But this is problematic.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
       CHARACTER ALLREC*(16+64+4)
       EQUIVALENCE(ALLREC,CUSREC)
&lt;/source&gt;
An EQUIVALENCE also have a similar effect as the union from Algol68 (and then C) language union statement.  The net effect is two variables ALLREC,CUSREC share the same location in memory.

===Algorithms===
Access to other languages was only available if the language supported FORTRANs SUBROUTINE calling conventions (Not all FORTRANs used the stack!).  And the actual conventions varied from machine to machine.

===Garbage collection===
Garbage collection is not part of the language, but has been implemented separately using datablock.  In Fortran the memory at program startup was all that would be available to the program until it terminated.  (The exception would be if the compiler supported recursion with local variables, but this was not always the case.)
===Physical Structure===
The &lt;code&gt;external&lt;/CODE&gt; scoping rules of Fortran is similar to the scoping found in the C programming language.  However Fortran 77 does not have a standard &lt;CODE&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/CODE&gt; statement.
* DATABLOCK EXTNM1
* EXTERNAL EXTNM2
* PROGRAM EXTNM3
* FUNCTION EXTNM3
* ENTRY EXTNM4
* SUBROUTINE EXTNM5
* DATA BLOCK
* COMMON EXTNM6

===Tips===
*Arrays are indexed starting with 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Being polite is important. It is rather simple to be polite in Arabic. Just learn some of these and use them, at the right time. And remember a few golden rules.
#If you refuse a gift, an Arab will insist that you take it (This insisting and refusing can go on for up to a minute, between Arabs). So if an Arab offers you meat, and you are a vegetarian, either eat it or have a good excuse (medical excuses are often acceptable).


&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
أهلا
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ahlan&lt;br&gt;
ah-lan&lt;br&gt;
Hello &lt;br&gt;
It means more than hello, but its usage is very similar to hello.


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
[[Media:السلام_عليكم.ogg|*]]السلام عليكم
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;al_salaamu `alaykum&lt;br&gt;
as-sa-laa-mu-`a-lay-kum&lt;br&gt;
Peace be upon you.&lt;br&gt;
This is a very common greeting, although its usage is approved religiously. It is very common among Muslims; even muslims who understand no Arabic attempt to say it, whenever greeting someone. It's always better to say this greeting.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
[[Media:مع_السلامة.ogg|*]]مع السلامة
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ma`a al_salaamah(-ti)&lt;br&gt;
ma-`as-sa-laa-mah&lt;br&gt;
with peace&lt;br&gt;
Only said when leaving someone. If you said this when you just met someone, it would seem awkward.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
الله يسلمك
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;allahu salmik(a/i)&lt;br&gt;
aL-laa-hu-sal-mik&lt;br&gt;
(May) God keep you in peace.&lt;br&gt;
Often a reply to مع السلامة (ma`a alsalaamah).&lt;br&gt;


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
أهلا وسهلا
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ahlan wa sahlan&lt;br&gt;
ah-lan-wa-sah-lan&lt;br&gt;
Usage: Expressing great happiness at seeing someone.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
وداعا
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;wa-daa-`an&lt;br&gt;
bye&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
شكرا
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shukran&lt;br&gt;
shuk-ran&lt;br&gt;
thanks

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
شكرا لك
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shukran&lt;br&gt;
shuk-ran-lak(a/i)&lt;br&gt;
thank you

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
شكرا جزيلا
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;shukran jazeelan&lt;br&gt;
shuk-ran-ja-zee-lan&lt;br&gt;
thanks a lot &lt;br&gt;
Note this is not the sarcastic usage in Arabic.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
من فضلك
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;min faDlik(a/i)&lt;br&gt;
min-faD-lik&lt;br&gt;
please

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
أرجوك
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;arjook(a/i)&lt;br&gt;
ar-jook&lt;br&gt;
I'm begging you.


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
تفضل
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;tafaDDal&lt;br&gt;
ta-faD-Dal&lt;br&gt;
Please help yourself (when speaking to a man).

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;tafaDDalee&lt;br&gt;
ta-faD-Da-lee&lt;br&gt;
Please help yourself (when speaking to a woman).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
تفضلوا
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;tafaDDaloo&lt;br&gt;
ta-faD-Da-loo&lt;br&gt;
Same as above but when talking to a group, as long as the group is not all female.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
كيف حالك
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;kayfa Haaluk&lt;br&gt;
kay-fa-Haa-luk&lt;br&gt;
How are you doing?
You must know this saying, every Arab asks every other Arab of the same gender and his son this question.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
بـخيـر
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;bi''kh''air&lt;br&gt;
bi-khair&lt;br&gt;
fine&lt;br&gt;
Only used when answering &quot;How are you doing?&quot;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
الـحمد لله
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;al_Hamdu lillaah&lt;br&gt;
al-Ham-du-lil-Laah&lt;br&gt;
Thank God.&lt;br&gt;
Of course its meaning is not that simple.&lt;br&gt;
Often used to answer &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&quot;كيف حالك؟ &quot;&lt;/font&gt;, and said when good news is heard (like a relative passed their final exam).&lt;br&gt;
Literally it means: Praise be to God, that is, when answering the above questions with al-Ham-du-lil-Laah, you're praising God for the goodness received.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
مرحبا
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MarHabaan&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Hello&quot;, when talking to anyone 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Phrases==


==Vocabulary==
Words are useful. You need to know many words to have useful skills in the Arabic language. The best way is to use a program that drills you in vocabulary. Paper flashcards are overhyped, they are only good for memorizing a small number of words. You need to learn a large number of words. If you are going to use a program to memorize vocabulary, it has to implement the Leitner system or do something similar, or else it will be a waste of time. Computer program such as VTrain and Pauker are good for this. I have many Arabic Pauker  vocabulary lists. Spending an hour three times a week memorizing and reviewing vocabulary with one of these programs will ensure progress. 

There are a few things that must be known when learning a word. 
*Correct pronunciation: if your Arabic pronunciation is not perfect, you absolutely need to hear the word pronounced properly when memorizing it.
*Always connect the unknown word to its meaning.
**You must have the Arabic word on one side and something that will inform you of what it means.
**If the non-Arabic side does not inform you of what the Arabic word means, it will only confuse you.
**If you can try to connect the word directly to its meaning. Pictures usually help. For example the Arabic word for dog can easily be memorized by saying the word and picturing a dog in your head, or hearing the sound of a dog in your head. 
The English word is there only to make the Arabic word's meaning clear. It is not there so that whenever you hear ''kalb'' you automatically translate it to &quot;dog&quot;. At first that will be what you do: hear an Arabic word and think of an English translation. This method is okay if you completely understand the English word. This is not okay for words where the English word has a bunch of meanings that the Arabic word doesn't have. Remember, you must connect the Arabic word to its meaning not necessarily to an English word.

It is impossible to memorize a word, when you cannot figure out the meaning. I have had this problem with poorly designed flashcards. Here is an example:

to commit
&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;
إلتزم
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wasn't able to memorize this word, because I could not figure out which of the English meanings the Arabic word meant. I decided later using Arabic grammar and knowledge of related words that it means what &quot;to commit to something&quot; means  and does not mean what &quot;to commit something&quot; means.

Poorly designed flashcards will slow you down. I plan to fix up my deck of Pauker Arabic flashcards, in order to prevent such problems.

While memorizing flashcards, include example sentences to illustrate the meaning.  This will help you progress rapidly in the language, and make you more fluent (because you would have exposed yourself to how sentences are formed).

==Sentence building==

What would be really helpful is a book of Arabic phrases with translations into English, and organized well, to drill oneself in, and gain the most Arabic fluency in the least amount of time. Thank god, WikiBooks exists, a book on exactly that, could easily be started.

The problem with traditional methods of learning language is you always have to construct a sentence out of words, and break sentences apart into words. Such a process is more like disecting a language than actually using it. What is needed is many phrases, catagorized properly learning one after the other causing the learner to subconciously understand the patterns. After that, explanation of sentence building can be added.

==Verb Conjugation==
If you wish to be able to speak Arabic (such as on news broadcasts, or debates), you must be completely unconciously familiar with what is right and what is wrong when it comes to verb conjugation. How does one do this you might ask.

First find a source of Arabic verbs conjugated in all forms. 

Such as the 201 Arabic verbs book (the copy that I had had typos). The book 201 Arabic verbs uses complex grammatical terminology, and doesn't provide explanation, no transliteration, and no audio. The good thing about this book is that it shows the verbs conjugated with all the  ''Ha-ra-kaat'' which is crucial in order to conjugate a verb properly. There are silent alifs at the ends of verbs when conjugated, which are not indicated in the book.

What you need to drill yourself in Arabic verb conjugation, orally. The top row, first say the pronoun and then the verb conjugated, with a word after it. Preferrably using each one in a sentence.

Ex.:
ana fa`altu shay'an, anta fa`alta shay'an
I did something, you (guy) did something

Then say it without a word conjugated, so that you automatically drop the extra vowels when you are supposed to. I am not sure if the dropping of those vowels is completely neccessary at the end of a sentence; sometimes they are pronounced. 

ana fa`alt(u), anta fa`alt(a)

Then go to the next row, and do the same thing.


With the third row (the subjunctive mood). Precede the verb conjugation with &lt;font size=&quot;+2&gt; لن &lt;/font&gt;(lan) (translation: will not/won't) or&lt;font size=&quot;+2&gt; أن &lt;/font&gt; (an), because this row shows how the verb is conjugated with these (as well as others).For Example:

ana lan af`ala shay'an, anta lan taf`ala shay'an

ana lan af`al, anta lan taf`al

The next row (the jussive mood) is used for verbs after&lt;font size=&quot;+2&gt; لم &lt;/font&gt;(lam) (translation:had not). So say it like this:

ana lam af`al shay'an, anta lam taf`al shay'an
ana lam af`al, anta lam taf`al


Then do the imperative. With the imperative you may add &lt;font size=&quot;+2&gt; يا &lt;/font&gt; (yaa)+ the group you are addressing, to make the connection between each form clear, like this:

if`al yaa walad, if`alee yaa bint, if`aluu yaa jamaa`ah, if`alaa yaa shakhSayn

You better know what walad (boy), bint (girl), and jamaa`ah (group) mean.


You can later on, once you have gone through every type of verb conjugation, start to drill yourself in the passive. The passive is the opposite of the active. 
Example in English:
Active: I killed something.
Passive: It was killed.

In Arabic the passive is only used when the speaker does not know, or does not wish to tell who did the action. It is when the doer of the action is not indicated.

The following is not correct in Arabic.
''It was written by me.''
The ''by me'' part, coming after, wouldn't exist in Arabic. Instead the following sentence would be used:
''I wrote it.'' Through all these spoken conjugation excercises, you will understand all proper Arabic well. And after memorizing a bunch of similar phrases (to learn different structures), a massive amount of vocabulary, and watching tv, you will be able to begin speaking Arabic fluently.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To ensure the best physical voice:

Do not smoke:  It is known that smoking leads to lung or throat cancer. Primary and secondhand smoke that is breathed in passes by the vocal cords causing significant irritation and swelling of the vocal cords. This will permanently change voice quality, nature, and capabilities.

Do not abuse or misuse your voice: Your voice is not indestructible. In every day communication, be sure to avoid habitual yelling, screaming, or cheering. Try not to talk loudly in locations with significant background noise or noisy environments. Be aware of your background noise—when it becomes noisy, significant increases in voice volume occur naturally, causing harm to your voice. If you feel like your throat is dry, tired, or your voice is becoming hoarse, stop talking.

To reduce or minimize voice abuse or misuse use non-vocal or visual cues to attract attention, especially with children. Obtain a vocal amplification system if you routinely need to use a “loud” voice especially in an outdoor setting. Try not to speak in an unnatural pitch. Adopting an extremely low pitch or high pitch can cause an injury to the vocal cords with subsequent hoarseness and a variety of problems.

Minimize throat clearing: Clearing your throat can be compared to slapping or slamming the vocal cords together. Consequently, excessive throat clearing can cause vocal cord injury and subsequent hoarseness. An alternative to voice clearing is taking a small sip of water or simply swallowing to clear the secretions from the throat and alleviate the need for throat clearing or coughing. The most common reason for excessive throat clearing is an unrecognized medical condition causing one to clear their throat too much. Common causes of chronic throat clearing include gastroesophageal reflux, laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, sinus and/or allergic disease.

Moderate voice use when sick: Reduce your vocal demands as much as possible when your voice is hoarse due to excessive use or an upper respiratory infection (cold). Singers should exhibit extra caution if one’s speaking voice is hoarse because permanent and serious injury to the vocal cords are more likely when the vocal cords are swollen or irritated. It is important to “listen to what your voice is telling you.”

If, for some reason, your voice does get hoarse, DO NOT SING UNTIL YOU ARE BETTER! Try to avoid talking too. Drink lots of water, preferably room temperature--as cold water tends to &quot;freeze&quot; the vocal cords, lessening your ability to sing--with lemon in it, to cut through phlegm in your throat. Also you may want to try drinking hot tea with lemon or honey; this usually has the same effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] is an open-source, cross-platform development environment developed by IBM in Java and designed around the concepts of plugins and extensions.  This fundamental architecture allows any number of additions to the core application to be integrated throughout the entire environment.  Some of the major complaints about Java applications are that their user interfaces are slow and neither look nor feel like other native apps.  IBM, as part of the Eclipse project, addressed this complaint by developing SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit) as an alternative to both Swing and AWT.  SWT is more closely related to AWT in that it is designed around the concept of native widgets.  However, there are two major design differences.  The first is that AWT was designed for the lowest common denominator, which means that there are a large number of widgets missing from the framework that many people expect in a modern user interface (trees, tables, etc).  Secondly, SWT is designed on a principal that native resources (like colors and fonts) can not be efficiently handled by the standard Java GC mechanism, and thus requires that these resources be managed in a more traditional claim-and-dispose manner.  The end result is that Eclipse's user interface is generally accepted as being much faster than traditional Java user interfaces.

[http://objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WOL/Home WOLips] is a set of open-source Eclipse plugins that are designed to make the development, debugging, and deployment of WebObjects applications easier.  Because it is built on top of the Eclipse platform, all the standard productivity-enhancing features of Eclipse are available -- extensive code completion, context-aware refactoring, incremental compiling, hot code replacement, local and remote revisioning, and many other capabilities that make Eclipse the leading development environment for Java.  Additionally, WOLips provides many extensions to the core platform, including plugins for:

* Building, Launching, Debugging, and Deploying WO Applications and Frameworks
* A syntax-colored HTML and CSS editor with code completion based on the Eclipse Web Tools Project
* A form-based .API file editor
* A .WOD file editor with syntax coloring, code completion, and error-checking (based on component bindings, API files, class path, and HTML template definitions)
* Incremental compilers for .xcode, .xcodeproj, and PB.project files for backwards compatibility with Apple WO tools (like EOModeler and WOBuilder)
* WO Application, WO Component, and WO Framework wizards
* .. and much more

      <text xml:space="preserve">Across the spectrum of human culture, from the Chinese opera soloist to the Muslim mu`aziin to the European choirboy, the singer's body is the instrument; and control of the instrument is the foundation of technique.

==Buttocks==
Contraction of the gluteal muscles is often said to help to counteract the tightened stomach muscles required for full use of the diaphragm. It can also prevent cases of bowback posture, a spinal contortion usually inade of singers trying to gain control over their full vital capacity, at the cost of their posture.

Another school of thought says that tightening the gluteal muscles is degenerative of good and full tone production. In this way of thinking, with the tightening of the gluteals comes a rigidity in the abdominal floor muscles and this precludes the so-called diaphragmatic muscles from being free to move which lessens the depth of tone and causes the diaphragmatic breathing to be limited to frontal movement whereas with a release of the gluteals, that movement can extend downwards into the pelvic cage (causing the butt to expand slightly) and backwards into the lower back (expanding the lower ribs and back). This method is more in keeping with Alexander Technique (a system of ergonomic body use that aids in vocal production).

==Palate - Overview==
&quot;Raising the soft palate&quot; (the squishy part of the roof of your mouth toward the back) creates a more resonant mouth and opens up the nasopharyngeal space for air to pass over the palate which is an important aspect of singing with your full natural range with no vocal breaks. There are two schools of thought on this (or maybe more). One is that the palate should be released, not so much forced up as high as possible until more skill and co-ordination have been attained. The second school favours a more lifted soft palate ideal.

===To release the soft palate (it will release up)===
Think of arching the eyebrows up, sometimes called 'bright eyes'. This can help activate the muscles responsible for a lifted palate, which are not recruited in daily activity. Another way is to imagine you are slowly inhaling to smell a yummy rose and want to get as much yummy roseness in your nose as possible.

==Nose==
The nasopharynx must be open (this is the connection between your throat and your nose and lies in back of your uvula and goes upwards into your head). If your nose is closed off as if you are swimming and don't want water to go up your nose, then your range will be somewhat limited on the upper end and you may use your throat muscles to aid your singing which can be a very big strain on the actual vocal cords.

In your mouth alone there are about a hundred things a pettifogger could come up with to tell you, but let's just stick to the more important ones. Your tongue should not have a groove in the middle but be rounded and resting gently against the bottom teeth (not pulled back from the teeth). A grooved tongue puts undue pressure downwards onto the larynx and prevents the cords from freely functioning and sometimes can cause flatness. You want your jaw to be loose and free to open and close as needed and not locked into a position, be it open or closed. If it is not, your tongue will become more active and this can put undue pressure on your larynx and prevent your cords form freely functioning.

A little tip to tell if you are on pitch is to cup your ear and listen to the note. It makes the sound resound in your ear enabling you to tell if you are on the same pitch.

==Diaphragm==
Often singing is taught by saying that the singer must have their stomach muscles in action so that they can &quot;sing from your diaphragm&quot;. They are further instructed that they must always sing from down low; that they will damage their throat and larynx and such if they try to force sing from the top.

However, this is confusing and ambiguous to many people and it is difficult to explain to someone how to &quot;sing from their diaphragm&quot;. An alternative way to achieve this is to put into play good and tension-free posture with an emphasis on body ergonomics, the breathing will naturally come from the &quot;diaphragm&quot; (this is slang for meaning that the lower abdominal muscles and body are involved in the breathing). With &quot;diaphragmatic support&quot; comes a greater depth of tone, less inclination to have the singing unduly centered in the throat, a more even sounding voice, and a reduction or elimination in vocal breaks/cracks.

==Ribs==
It's usually easiest to begin with your arms and hands at your side. Your ribs are actually quite important. They really have to be free and somewhat controlled in their contraction as you sing, otherwise you will sound breathy and your range will not be as high. However, this is beyond the scope of the skills of the lay person and it's best to pursue this with a vocal instructor.

==Stance==
Locking your knees is an absolute NO! If you do this, you can block air circulation and cause yourself to pass out. Believe me, this has happened a couple times in a few of my choirs. Locked knees can also cause pelvic tightness which, as we have discussed in the aptly-named &quot;Butt&quot; section, goes against what we want. Standing with your feet about shoulder width will also help you because it provides you with a better base, and if you are nervous on risers you are less likely to fall. Proper alignment can also help the breathing to be more full-bodied and tone to be fuller. One way this is taught sometimes is to put most of the weight onto the balls of your feet without lifting the heels from the floor. This helps again with posture and not locking the knees. A second way is to imagine your feet and sinking down, barefoot, in some thick pond mud. This may re-balance your body a bit and you may feel a sway as this happens.

Just as a human in peril can shout even when contorted, powerful and expressive singing is possible from almost any body position.  The fundamentals of vocal performance are, however, generally easiest to master when the body is in what many trained vocalists refer to as a 'neutral' posture -- a state of relaxed readiness to support the whole-body effort of producing the best sound possible.

The commonest posture advice given to beginning voice students is to 'straighten the back' in order to be able to take deep breaths in and control their vocalized exhalation. Practice in front of a mirror is frequently advised, but not truly necessary. The eventual goal is for the singer to unconsciously adjust his or her posture to suit the demands of song, whatever external body position might be required.

The human spine has a natural curvature to it, with a concave lumbar and a convex thorax. Almost every human adult spine is warped from the theoretical ideal in some regard or another, a few to the extent that the condition interferes with good health and good singing. Even the best innate spinal curvature is, however, subject to numerous misalignments that result from imbalances amongst the various muscular pulls that hold the spine upright.

Despite the apparent simplicity of simply standing erect without hunching, leaning, tensing, or over-arching one's spine, a few moments' calm reflection whilst erect usually enables even seasoned professionals with years of singing experience to sense points of unevenness or over-tension. These disparities arise quite naturally in the body with changing states of mind, and are an important and ordinary part of unspoken human language. Eliminating them altogether is as daunting a challenge as standing truly immobile without rigidity; though feasible and sometimes desirable, it can also produce flat and lifeless song. The goals when starting out are less ambitious: Seek to know what your body is doing, and then begin exerting some intention over those active parts of your personal carriage that were heretofore unconscious.

One deceptively simple exercise in attaining what singers call a neutral posture is to imagine the spine lengthening as one stands.  Refrain, as much as you can manage, from consciously trying to change your posture. If you can safely maintain your balance, it may even benefit you to stand with your eyes closed. Simply visualize your spine lengthening, as though your body were suspended from the top of your head instead of being supported from below. Fantastical self-suggestions that exceed the strict bounds of reality are often surprisingly helpful; try to feel your feet rooting to the ground or floor, your hips resting firm like the base of a great mountain, your head brushed by cool moist clouds high above. Taken further, this can become almost a mystical exercise in itself; a number of Asian calisthenic meditations employ similar methods. All considerations of spirituality aside, it is technically beneficial towards developing mindfulness of one's own stance.

Chains increase in length over time due to wear on the pins and bushings.  Continuing to use a chain that is beyond a reasonable length can not only cause the chain to &quot;skip&quot; when pedalling under pressure but will also wear out the rest of your drivetrain as the teeth on the cassette/freewheel and chainrings try to match the length of the chain.  If you catch a chain before it is too worn you can dramatically increase the life of the rest of your drivetrain.

To check the length of your chain there are two methods.   

The ruler method requires only a ruler and is more accurate. Line up a rivet with the zero mark on a standard ruler.  Next, you look for the closest rivet to the 12&quot; (304.8mm) mark.  On a new chain the rivet will line up exactly, if the rivet is 1/8&quot; (3.175mm) or more past the 12&quot; (304.8mm) mark, the chain needs to be replaced.

If you have access to a tool (e.g. Park CC-2), you can put the pins of the tool into the chain and rotate a dial to obtain a reading indicating the length of your chain. A reading of under 0.5% means the chain is okay, and over 0.5% means the chain needs to be replaced.  

If, when you replace your chain, it skips under pressure, this is an indicator that other parts of your drivetrain need to be replaced too.  
First of all replace the block (freewheel or cassette), if that does not cure the problem you may need to replace the chainrings.

If there doesn't seem to be any wear be sure that your derailleur is in the correct position. If you still have problems with the chain riding up and skipping, see this walk through:

==Extrahepatic bile ducts==
===Current staging===
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
For the 7th Edition staging, there are now separate staging classifications for perihilar (proximal) and distal bile duct tumors

&lt;big&gt;'''Perihilar Bile Ducts'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;br&gt;
''Primary Tumor:''
*Tis - carcinoma in situ
*T1 - confined to the bile duct, with extension up to the muscle layer or fibrous tissue
*T2
**T2a - invades beyond the wall of the bile duct to surrounding adipose tissue
**T2b - invades adjacent hepatic parencyma
*T3 - invades unilateral branches of the portal vein or hepatic artery
*T4 - invades main portal vein or its braches bilaterally; common hepatic artery; second-order biliary radicals bilaterally; or unilateral second-order biliary radicals with contralateral portal vein or hepatic artery involvement

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no
*N1 - regional lymph node metastasis (along the cystic duct, common bile duct, hepatic artery, and portal vein)
*N2 - metastasis to periaortic, pericaval, superior mesenteric artery, and/or celiac artery lymph nodes

''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - no
*M1 - yes

''Stage Grouping:''
*I - T1 N0
*II - T2a-b N0
*IIIA - T3 N0
*IIIB - T1-3 N1
*IVA - T4 N0-1
*IVB - N2 or M1


&lt;big&gt;'''Distal Bile Duct'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;br&gt;
''Primary Tumor:''
*Tis - carcinoma in situ
*T1 - confined to the bile duct
*T2 - invades beyond the wall of the bile duct
*T3 - invades the gallbladder, pancreas, duodenum, or other adjacent organs without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery
*T4 - involves the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no
*N1 - regional lymph node metastasis

''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - no
*M1 - yes

''Stage Grouping:''
*IA - T1 N0
*IB - T2 N0
*IIA - T3 N0
*IIB - T1-3 N1
*III - T4
*IV - M1

''Prognostic factors'' : serum CEA, CA19.9

''Changes from 6th Edition:''
*Now separate staging classifications for perihilar and distal extrahepatic bile duct tumors

===Previous editions===
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;
For the 6th edition - all extrahepatic bile duct tumors (perihilar or distal) are included in one classification

''Primary Tumor:''

'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
Note: New staging category beginning with the 7th edition.  In prior editions, staging for intrahepatic bile ducts was grouped in with [[Radiation Oncology/Liver#Staging|Liver staging]].

''Primary tumor:''
*Tis - carcinoma in situ (intraductal tumor)
*T1 - solitary tumor without vascular invasion
*T2
**T2a - solitary tumor with vascular invasion
**T2b - multiple tumors, with or without vascular invasion

Curative surgery (negative margins) is the only treatment modality shown to improve overall survival, and should be the first line therapy in operable patients. Unfortunately, only ~50% present with resectable disease, and only ~50% of these have negative margins. As a result, 5-year overall survival is around 30%.

==Primary Surgical Treatment==

**'''1977-2001''' PMID 15793863 -- ''Prognostic analysis of surgical treatment of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma: two decades of experience at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.'' ('''2005 Jan''' YY, World J Gastroenterol. 2005 Mar 28;11(12):1779-84.)
***Retrospective. 608 patients with bile duct CA, 373 patients with peripheral CCA (second order or more intrahepatic branches). Treatment 50% hepatectomy (36% curative resection), 28% choledochotomy with T-tube, 22% laparotomy with biopsy; median follow-up 7.2 months
***Multivariate risk factors: mucobilia, tumor type, stage, type of operation, chemotherapy
***Overall survival: 1-year 31%, 5-year 4% 
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Favorable overall survival of PCC patients undergoing surgical treatment depends on early tumor stage, presence of mucobilia, papillary tumor type, hepatic resection, and post-operative chemotherapy&quot;

**'''1977-2000''' PMID 15041513 -- ''Influence of age on surgical treatment of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2004 Yeh''' CN, Am J Surg. 2004 Apr;187(4):559-63.)
***Retrospective. 23 patients &lt;40 years old compared with 284 patients &gt;40 years old
***Younger patients less mucobilia, less papillary, more advanced stage. Clinical presentation, PE similar, CEA, CA19-9, hepatolithiasis similar. Post-op adjuvant RT and CT more with older patients
***2-year OS: 0% in younger vs. 15% in older patients (p&lt;0.001)
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Younger patients with PCC had a significantly worse survival rate than older patients with PCC. Hepatectomy is rational and may benefit younger patients with PCC.&quot;

**Retrospective. 282 patients, 151 (54%) underwent resection
**5-year OS: 32.5%, tumor histology and LN mets independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In cases of extrahepatic bile duct cancer, resection should be considered and efforts should be made to obtain a tumor-free margin. An aggressive surgical approach will give some survival benefit to the patients with even advanced disease. Long-term follow up is needed before declaring &quot;a cure,&quot; because late recurrence after 5 years is detected not infrequently. Adjuvant therapy, local and systemic, needs to be further developed.&quot;

*'''Ulsan Korea''' PMID 16096407 --''The Number of Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Extrahepatic Bile Duct Carcinoma as a Prognostic Factor.'' ('''2005 Hong''' SM, Am J Surg Pathol. 2005 Sep;29(9):1177-1183.)
**Retrospective. 209 patients
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The patients with 5 or more metastatic lymph nodes had significantly worse survival than those with 4 or less metastatic lymph nodes.&quot; 

*'''Shanghai China 1997-2002''' PMID 16083598 -- ''[Analysis of the relation between surgery and prognosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma] - [Article in Chinese]'' ('''2005 Yi''' B, Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2005 Jul 1;43(13):842-5.)
**Retrospective. 198 patients treated, 61% resected, 30% radical resection. 
**Significant predictors of outcome: occupation, preop maximum total bilirubin, operative procedure and postop adjuvant radiation
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Operative procedure was the most important prognosic factor of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, radical resection still was the primary measure to cure and long term survival. For irresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma, the effect of ERBD or EMBE could not be considered to be worse than that of open operative treatment.&quot;

*'''Mayo 1979-97''' PMID 15136352 -- ''Major hepatic resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma: analysis of 46 patients.'' ('''2004 Rea''' DJ, Arch Surg. 2004 May;139(5):514-23; discussion 523-5.)
**Retrospective. 46 patients treated with major hepatic resection; R0 in 80%
**Actual 5-year OS: 26%
**Tumor recurrence predominantly local and regional
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The actual 5-year survival rate of 26% justifies major partial hepatectomy, bile duct resection, and regional lymphadenectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. The high frequency of local and regional recurrence warrants investigation of adjuvant therapy.&quot;

*'''MSKCC 1990-2001''' PMID 14534886 -- ''Patterns of initial disease recurrence after resection of gallbladder carcinoma and hilar cholangiocarcinoma: implications for adjuvant therapeutic strategies.'' ('''Jarnagin''' WR, Cancer. 2003 Oct 15;98(8):1689-700.)
**Retrospective. 80 GB and 76 hilar CCA reviewed
**Recurrence: 66% GB vs. 68% CCA at 2 years; median time to recurrence GB 11.5 months vs. CCA 20.3 months (p=0.007)
**Site of recurrence: isolated locoregional GB 15% vs. 59% CCA; distal (with or without concomitant locoregional) GB 85% vs. 41% CCA. Site of recurrence no apparent impact on survival
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;After resection, recurrent GBCA is much more likely than recurrent HCCA to involve a distant site. GBCA is also associated with a much shorter time to recurrence and a shorter survival period after recurrence. The results demonstrated significant differences in the clinical behavior of these tumors and suggested that an adjuvant therapeutic strategy targeting locoregional disease, such as radiotherapy, is unlikely to have a significant impact in the overall management of GBCA. Conversely, there is at least some rationale for such an approach in patients with HCCA based on the pattern of initial recurrence.&quot;

*'''MSKCC 1991-2000''' PMID 11573044 -- ''Staging, resectability, and outcome in 225 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2001 Jarnagin''' WR, Ann Surg. 2001 Oct;234(4):507-17; discussion 517-9.)
**Prospective. 225 patients, 36% underwent resection (28% negative margins)
**Pre-operative stagins system developed
**All 9 actual 5-year survivors had negative margins and concomitant hepatic resection
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;By taking full account of local tumor extent, the proposed staging system for hilar cholangiocarcinoma accurately predicts resectability, the likelihood of metastatic disease, and survival. Complete resection remains the only therapy that offers the possibility of long-term survival, and hepatic resection is a critical component of the surgical approach.&quot;

*'''Hopkins''' PMID 10982602 -- ''Surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma: the Johns Hopkins approach.'' ('''2000 Lillemoe''' KD,  J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg. 2000;7(2):115-21.)
**Retrospective. 109 patients
**Median survival (5-year OS): 19 months (11%)

*'''Barcelona 1989-99''' PMID 11084070 -- ''Changing strategies in diagnosis and management of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2000 Figueras''' J, Liver Transpl. 2000 Nov;6(6):786-94.)
**Retrospective. 76 patients, 37% surgery (resection or liver transplant)
**Mean survival: surgery 35 months vs. palliation 6 months. Liver transplant &gt; resection
**No benefit to chemoradiation over RT (as reported by Anderson 2004)

*'''Nagoya Japan 1977-97''' PMID 10982608 -- ''Aggressive preoperative management and extended surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma: Nagoya experience.'' ('''2000 Nimura''' Y, J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg. 2000;7(2):155-62)
**Retrospective. 177 patients, 61% curative resection
**5-year OS: curative hepatectomy 26%, bile duct resection 16%. If LN+ 14%.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Curative resection after aggressive preoperative management is recommended as a reasonable surgical approach to hilar cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

*'''MSKCC''' PMID 9742921 -- ''Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma: patterns of spread, the importance of hepatic resection for curative operation, and a presurgical clinical staging system.'' ('''1998 Burke''' EC, Ann Surg. 1998 Sep;228(3):385-94.)
**90 patients, 30 (33%) resected, 25 (28%) negative SM. 60 (67%) unresectable (of these, mets 52%, locally advanced 28%)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In half the patients, unresectability is mainly the result of intraabdominal metastases. Presurgical imaging predicts unresectability based on local extension but is poor for assessing nodal metastases. In one third of patients, disease can be resected for cure with a long median survival. Curative resection depends on negative margins, and hepatic resection is necessary to achieve this.&quot;

*'''Hanover Germany 1971-95''' PMID 8988723 -- ''What constitutes long-term survival after surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma?'' ('''1997 Klempnauer''' J, Cancer 1997; 79:26-34.)
**Retrospective. 339 patients, 49% resected (54% including liver transplant)
**32 patients survived &gt;5 years, prognostic factors low stage, negative LNs, and no residual tumor
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Radical resection offers the best possibility of prolonged survival with a good quality of life for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

*'''Rotterdam''' PMID 8049311 -- ''Proximal cholangiocarcinoma: a multidisciplinary approach.'' ('''1994 van der Hul''' RL, Eur J Surg. 1994 Apr;160(4):213-8.)
**Retrospective. 66 pts with proximal cholangiocarcinoma, 24% resected, 56% stented. 42% received RT
**Median survival: resection 35.8 months vs. conservative Rx 10.8 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;A multidisciplinary approach is necessary and the tumour should be resected if possible.&quot;

**Retrospective. 6 Institutions. 158 patients, 53% resected, 8.4% post-op deaths
**5-year OS: 20%, 3/12 doing well 10+ years out
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;It is clear that cancer of the main hepatic duct junction has become a curable disease. The operation is a valid procedure that can be widely practiced by competent surgeons.&quot;

*'''Italy''' PMID 7684913 -- ''Palliative treatment of extrahepatic bile ducts tumors.'' ('''1993 Cucchiara''' G, J Surg Oncol Suppl. 1993;3:154-7)
**Retrospective. 111 patients, 6% no treatment, 29% biliary drainage, 65% surgical exploration (22% radical surgery, remaining 43% palliative surgery)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Although EHBD tumor treatment results are generally poor, surgical exploration should be performed in all patients with acceptable surgical risk, and without evidence of disseminated disease.&quot;

**1-year OS: 68% resection vs. 31% palliation (p&lt;0.001)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The results of this study show that resection of extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas, particularly in an upper-third localization, often is associated with worthwhile long-term survival.&quot;

**Prospective local excision vs. partial liver excision. 27 patients with hilar CA
**Median survival: 29 months, no difference in type of surgery

*'''Hopkins''' PMID 2174191 -- ''Cholangiocarcinoma'' ('''1990 Yeo''' CJ, Surg Clin North Am 1990; 70:1429-47.)
**As many as half of all patients explored with curative intent will have a successful resection.
**The role of radiotherapy in the management of cholangiocarcinoma is uncertain. Our results, like those of many other retrospective analyses, suggest that radiotherapy prolongs survival after curative resection as well as after palliative stenting.

*'''Meta-analysis''' PMID 2204130 -- ''Research into the results of resection of hilar bile duct cancer.'' ('''1990 Boerma''' EJ, Surgery. 1990 Sep;108(3):572-80.)
**Meta-analysis. 581 patients reviewed, 499 since 1980.
**Operative mortality: overall 12%, perihilar 8%, major liver resections 15%
**5-year OS: overall 13%, perihilar 7%, major liver resections 17%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Despite the best treatments available, present-day resection modalities are usually still not radical. Extension of resection in the retrohilar and hepatoduodenal direction might further improve the long-term surgical results.&quot;

*'''Vanderbilt''' PMID 2420244 -- ''An aggressive surgical approach to bile duct cancer.'' ('''1986 Adkins''' RB, Am Surg. 1986 Mar;52(3):134-9.)
**55 patients (1957-1985), 38% upper, 15% middle, 18% lower third

**Resectability rate for bile duct tumor is currently 25 per cent. Resection is more frequently possible for tumor of the distal bile duct
**5-year OS: proximal bile duct is anecdotal, distal bile duct is up to 30 per cent

*'''UCSF''' PMID 4049246 -- ''Carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts: results of an aggressive surgical approach'' ('''1985 Langer''' JC, Surgery 1985; 98:752-9.)
**Retrospective, 90 patients (1969-1984)
**Resection 30% (22% proximal, 40% middle, 57% distal)
**RT used with resection and for palliation. Responses were observed, but the complication of radiation duodenitis has limited the dose.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;An aggressive approach to resection of bile duct tumors is possible with a low operative mortality rate and offers the best opportunity for cure as well as good palliation. Internal bypass is preferable to chronic intubation. The role of radiation therapy in this disease is still not clear.&quot;

==Liver Transplantation==
*'''Mayo''' 
**'''1993-2004''' PMID 16135931 -- ''Liver transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoradiation is more effective than resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2005 Rea''' DJ, Ann Surg. 2005 Sep;242(3):451-8; discussion 458-61.)
***Prospective. 71 patients on protocol (neoadjuvant RT, chemosensitization, orthotopic liver transplant), 38 patients underwent liver transplant. Compared with conventional resection 54 patients explored, 26 patients resected.
***5-year OS: liver transplant 82% vs. resection 21% (p=0.02)
***Recurrenct: liver transplant 13% vs. resection 27% 
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Liver transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoradiation achieved better survival with less recurrence than conventional resection and should be considered as an alternative to resection for patients with localized, node-negative hilar CCA.&quot;

**'''1993-2003''' PMID 15192792 -- ''Liver transplantation for unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2004 Heimbach''' JK, Semin Liver Dis. 2004 May;24(2):201-7.)
***Prospective. 56 patients, Stage I/II perihilar CCA, treated with neoadjuvant EBRT + BT + 5-FU/capecitabine, followed by liver transplant
***4 died and 4 progression of disease prior to completion. 48 staged, 28 underwent transplant
***5-year actuarial survival: 54% for all patients, 64% for staged patients, 82% for transplant
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with liver transplantation achieves excellent results for patients with localized, regional lymph node negative, hilar cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

**Case report. No abstract.

*'''Nebraska''' PMID 12243499 -- ''Radiochemotherapy and transplantation allow long-term survival for nonresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2002 Sudan''' D, Am J Transplant. 2002 Sep;2(8):774-9.)
**Prospective. 11 patients treated with 60 Gy BT + 5-FU, followed by transplantation
**5/11 (45%) alive without recurrence with median follow-up 7.5 years (2.8-14.5)
**6/11 (55%) died; 2 recurrence, 3 sepsis, 1 transplant rejection
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Cholangiocarcinoma should not be considered an absolute exclusion criteria for orthotopic liver transplantation. Long-term, tumor-free survival was achieved in 45% of the transplanted patients. Complications of biliary catheter placement for brachytherapy were associated with poor outcome.&quot;

***Retrospective. 61 patients, 38% resection +/- transplant, 62% palliative surgery/biopsy
***All patients had RT (median dose 49.5 Gy), 50% received chemo (5-FU/Leucovorin/IFNalpha or taxol)
***Median survival (5-year OS): 20 months (24%)
***Only predictor of survival was complete resection
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Combined modality therapy that includes complete surgical resection with or without transplantation can be curative in the majority of patients with biliary duct carcinoma. Further study is needed to better define the roles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

**'''1981-96''' PMID 9783781 -- ''Treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumors) with hepatic resection or transplantation.'' ('''1998 Iwatsuki''' S, J Am Coll Surg. 1998 Oct;187(4):358-64.)
***Retrospective. 72 patients (34 hepatic resection, 38 resection)
***5-year OS: resection 9% vs. transplantation 25%
***Prognostic factors: Stage 0-II, LN-, SM- (5-year OS 73%)
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Satisfactory longterm survivals can be obtained by curative surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma either with hepatic resection or liver transplantation. Redefining pTNM stage III and IV-A is proposed to better define prognosis.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nice write-up Brim! Of course, now I have to go back and make sure I (mostly) conform to this. I do have a question about the chronological order - I find it generally easier to cite the most recent studies first, since they tend to be &quot;more&quot; relevant. That way, I don't have to wade through lot of potentially obsolete studies, and it's easy to see at a glance how current the material is. Any thoughts on that? [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 19:29, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

:As it stands, some of these &quot;standards&quot; are really a suggestion, or a call to make the wiki have a uniform look.  Some of the standards should be taken as law, such as do not plagiarize, and others, such as providing references, are pretty much common sense.  As for the formatting of the article entries, I think that's more flexible, and it should be open to debate.  As I stated, it's just a guide to one suggested format.  I think it's important for certain elements to be present in a logical format, but the format itself isn't as important.  At this time, I think we should strive for a somewhat consistent look, in that the entries don't look startlingly different from one another, but we need not have all entries look exactly the same.  This wiki is still maturing and finding its identity.  Over time, we may all agree to adopt a certain look, but right now I think it's a little early to do that, since it might change at some point in the future.  If you have any ideas for how we should do the formatting, I'd love to hear it.  Right now we have really only 4 regular contributors and a few others who contribute occasionally.  I'd like to hear from them about what they think too.
:As for the order of the studies, I think listing them in chronologic order within sections makes more sense.  The development of radiation oncology happens in stages, with one type of treatment being compared against another treatment, and then against another, and so on.  Findings from one study influence the design of future studies.  Therefore, I think it makes the most logical sense to present data in chronologic order.  It's the way that all textbooks, journal articles, reviews, and protocols discuss the trials.  
:I understand the convenience of having the most recent article at the beginning, however.  We did adopt that for the listing of all the RTOG studies, since I agree that in that case, we're usually searching for more recent RTOG studies and it's easier to have those on the top.  But in the case of other sections in this book, I still think that it makes most sense to order the studies chronologically by date.  I realize that this approach requires us to use a little bit more effort to see the most current studies, but again, I think this works much better than trying to learn radiation oncology backwards from the most current era to the past.  In general it shouldn't be that difficult to locate a desired article.  The only problem I see is for very large topics (like prostate) where we have tons of information.  One thing that might help would be to have a section at the top titled &quot;Current standard of care&quot; where the way we treat currently is listed with a list of the studies that defined that standard of care.  I'm not sure if this would really help though.  Any ideas?  &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 23:19, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

::I agree with having a &quot;Current standard of care&quot; section, or even a page. I slowly started to develop that in prostate (summarizing the info underneath section headings), since I found myself drowning in information. It was brought home to me now as I am doing some work on cholangioCA. It's a rare CA, without that much literature, and yet ... there is a lot of info. For now, I have a section that I called &quot;Treatment Overview&quot; and I am mulling how to highlight the defining studies, as opposed to the bibliography I put there so far. It could work to have one (short) form page for each CA, which would give an overview of the disease. Epidemiology-Work Up-Staging-Pathology-Treatment Overview, without citing any studies, just saying something like: low risk disease RT dose xx fields yy, no chemo; high risk disease RT dose aa fields bb, chemo cc. And then a separate page for Treatment, having as you suggest the current treatment repeated with supporting seminal studies on top, followed by whatever random assortment of other studies gets put in. 
::As for chronology, it definitely makes sense in a textbook. Or in a paper Intro introducing a given topic. But I guess it depends on what the ultimate goal of this wikibook is. Is it a textbook to learn a topic &quot;from scratch&quot;? Or is it more a reference compilation? If more a textbook, then chronologic order makes sense. If more a reference, then I would lean toward reverse chronology, to more easily look up &quot;what's new&quot;, assuming some underlying knowledge of the subject. I think I have been treating this more as a reference book to quickly look up/review current state of a given subject [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 17:10, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
::I think it may be worthwhile to associate a page with each cancer that would be &quot;Stuff to absolutely know for boards&quot;; not having started my residency training, I don't have a sense of whether this would be all that different from the &quot;Current Standard of Care&quot; section, but the advantage would be that you could easily link all these &quot;study&quot; pages into a comprehensive syllabus. [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 15:18, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

:::I envision its goal being both a textbook and a compilation of papers.  Ultimately, it should provide as much information as a textbook.  However, because ease of use is a prime goal of this project, I don't think the wiki should become full of prose like a textbook.  I'd like for it to offer all of the important information on a topic, such as background, epidemiology, and all the treatment information.  It should even include pictures, such as the design of radiation portals.  We don't have any pictures like that now, but I hope that one day it will be comprehensive enough to include all that.  The sky's the limit.  As the project grows more complex, as it is already doing, there will be the problem of having too much information, and how to organize the information and keep it easy to use.  My goal is to keep it easy to use, so it can be used as a reference.  That's how it will primarily be used, I imagine.  In a sense, that's really what print textbooks are for radiation oncology.  Textbooks aren't good at ''teaching'' radiation oncology; that's what residencies are for, and no textbook that I've seen does a good job of being an instruction manual for how to be a radiation oncologist.  So this wiki shouldn't aspire to that task.  Rather, what textbooks are good at is for putting into perspective the history of the trials that led up to way we treat patients.  They give a historical overview, and they provide references to the data and the papers.  So that's what I think this wiki should be.  An interested person should be able to come here to this wiki, read up on a topic (for example: head &amp; neck cancers), and be able to understand the evolution of the trials, how standard radiation came to be replaced by hyperfractionation and then chemo/RT; what other methods (e.g. radiosensitizers) have been tried, etc.  The wiki should be organized so that it answers simple and meaningful questions: is chemo/RT better than RT alone?  Is chemo+hyperfractionation better than chemo+standard RT? and so on. 
&lt;p&gt;
:::Someday the wiki is bound to become crowded with information.  At that point, and we're starting to reach it now in some chapters, I think it would be wise to organize the information into levels of increasing complexity.  For example, a section on hormonal therapy for prostate cancer might list a few of the most important trials and give a brief overview of their findings, and then you click on a hyperlink for a particular study to view details.  Sort of like what we have for the page of RTOG trials for prostate cancer.  For crowded sections with lots of trials listed, it can be difficult to skim and read the section, so it might make sense to list only the important or landmark studies on the top-level page and then have a hyperlink to something like &quot;See other studies...&quot; which brings you to a page with some of the other studies.
&lt;p&gt;
:::I think your idea of having a section of &quot;Stuff to know for boards&quot; is a brilliant idea.  Most residency programs have collections of board exam recall questions, and we could implement those into a section on the boards, broken down into major topics or questions that are often asked on the boards, and providing links to the studies. &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 00:50, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

Welcome to the Discussion page for the Mac OS X Tiger Wikibook! 

This book is designed for users with users with moderate computer experience. This book is mainly for home users, or clientside use on large networks. Write about stuff you want this person to know. It's the same audience as books like &quot;The Missing Manual&quot; or &quot;Mac OS X Tiger for Dummies&quot;.

Once you get into large(r) network administration, the Terminal, AppleScript, etc., you should put it into the [[Mac OS X Tiger/Advanced Concepts|Advanced Concepts]] section.

=To-Do List For This Wikibook=
The following work needs to be done first:
#Setting Up Accounts - Needs coverage of basic account management
#Networking your Mac - Needs coverage of basic networking setup/maintenance
#Printing and Faxing - Needs coverage of basic printer setup/use
#Appendix B - Needs lots of content

=To-Do List for This Page=


=Discussion=
Use this section to discuss the above guidelines.

===Review of work so far===
The book has to pick a target audience. Right now, it might be &quot;new Mac users&quot;, or &quot;new Computer users&quot;, or even &quot;users New to Max OS X Tiger&quot;. It explains a bunch of elements, then says ''If you're familiar with computers, you're familiar with the concept of a dialog box''. That depends on the user level. Since the guidelines state ''users with little to moderate computer experience'', we shouldn't assume that they are familiar. Lots of users just click ok until they go away. :(

The graphic of OS X retail box isn't there, although there is an imagebox for it.

Finally, a comment on tone. While I think it's important tone be kept light, it should also be focused. (eg, in Intro to Desktop, ''If you ever feel tempted to slide the Mac desktop out of your monitor and eat it, you're forgiven.'' I think the sentence would be better as &quot;If you think the Mac desktop looks good enough to eat, your not alone&quot;. Rather than in the intro, it might be better placed as a caption or in a sidebar).
Don't get me wrong, I don't think humour/jokes aren't a good learning approach, but you are setting the tone in the intro, and that should be casual. Just MHO.

I inserted your idea to the Intro to Desktop page a few minutes ago, with only one minor typographical change (“your” → “you're”). [[User:SupremeUmanu|SupremeUmanu]] ([[User talk:SupremeUmanu|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SupremeUmanu|contribs]]) 22:23, 9 June 2014 (UTC)

=Windows vs. Mac Past 'Bias'=
-History Module Page
After reading this 'book.' I noticed the language was very protective and positive about mac and negative towards microsoft. The point i am trying to make is this 'book' needs more neutral language. 

As for the windows 'book' I am sure the windows articles may be the same way. As i intend to read them as well. I will note if it seems that there articles seem to bias the history of the company.

== Mac OS X books ==

Hi all,

The [[Mac OS X Tiger Server]] has been nominated for deletion. A contributor merged its content into this book and suggested their edit histories be merged.

It was pointed out that these two books had different intended scopes and suggested that contributors be asked.

Suggestions of trimming the book name(s) to remove the version were also raised.

Please contribute to this discussion at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#Mac OS X Tiger Server]]. Thanks, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:57, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

:Result was merge. [[Mac OS X Tiger/Open Directory]] is now orphaned and needs to be merged or speedy deletion tagged. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:57, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

==Orphaned pages==
The following pages are orphaned and not linked to by this book.  Please link to them, merge them into existing content and label them with {{tlx|now merged|destination page}}, or if the are no longer needed mark them with {{tlx|delete|reasoning}}.

== Use of Appropriate Tense ==

Which tense should I use for writing this book? I understand that Mac OS X Tiger is now five (soon to be six, once OS X Yosemite is released) major versions out of date. Should I write using past tense, possibly mentioning features in perspective with later versions of Mac OS X, or write in present tense and pretend that later software wasn't released yet?

* 8 or more 1/4&quot; (0.75cm) slices of fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] root
* 1/2 tsp black [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] (decaf black tea is acceptable)

== Procedure ==
# Bring 2 quarts (about 2L) of water to boil in 3-4 quart pot. 
# Add cloves and boil for 1 minute. 
# Add peppercorns, cinnamon, cardamom pods and ginger.
# Cover and simmer gently for at least 30 minutes. (For best flavor, cover tightly and simmer over low heat for 2 to 3 hours!) 
# Remove from heat and add tea.
# Let cool. 
# Strain ingredients from the finished tea. 

When ready to drink, sweeten to taste with [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]]. Add [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] or dairy [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]].

This tea can be stored.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|File system}}
A common feature in Unix-like filesystems is that all files appear in one file hierarchy. The filesystem storing the base of the hierarchy is referred to as the root filesystem. '''/''', the directory containing all other directories, is itself is called the root directory. Other filesystems are mounted on directories under '''/''' which make these filesystems look like directories in the root filesystem. For example, a CD-ROM containing files might be mounted at '''/mnt/cdrom'''. In this example '''/mnt/cdrom''' is called a mountpoint. Access to devices is supplied by another filesystem mounted at '''/dev'''. Here files representing physical, and virtual devices can be accessed. Filesystems themselves are represented as files in '''/dev''' such as '''/dev/cdrom''' and can be mounted to directories in the root filesystem such as '''/mnt/cdrom'''. Each disk or storage medium may contain one or more filesystems, each of which contains files which can contain data. Some disks are also used for '''swap''', which supplies a temporary storage space for data in memory, when memory is full. Though &quot;swap&quot; resides on a disk, it is not actually a filesystem.

{{TODO|todonote=Explain the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/tt&gt; file. Provide a scenario where we add an external disk drive to the file. Explain better how to use the '''mount''' and '''umount''' commands.}}
{{TODO|todonote=Add description of LUKS for Linux -- this is the standard way to encrypt disks under Linux now.  The Gentoo and Ubuntu wikis have good instructions for those specific distros.}}

== List of Filesystem Types ==
The choice of Unix-like system influences the choice of filesystem. There are two kinds of filesystems:
* ''Filesystems with full Unix support'' can hold all types of Unix files, including normal files, directories, named pipes, symbolic links, and device nodes. They also support the entire Unix user and group permission model. This makes these filesystems good for mounting on '''/''', and also '''/home''', '''/tmp''', '''/usr''', '''/var''', and other such filesystems if those are separate partitions.
* ''Non-Unix filesystems'' were intended for non-Unix operating systems or to exchange files between different filesystems. Sometimes, the permission on every file on the filesystems must be the same, and only normal files and directories are allowed.

=== Filesystems with full Unix support ===
* ''Unix File System'' ('''ufs'''/'''ffs''') is the filesystem of '''*BSD''' and several commercial Unix variants. UFS is the on-disk layout, while FFS is some kernel optimizations for UFS in *BSD. There are several incompatible extensions to UFS, including the UFS2 of FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Mac OS X. Therefore, UFS is good for the root filesystem, but not good for trading files between different Unix-like operating systems that implement UFS incompatibly.
* ''Linux Second Extended Filesystem'' ('''ext2''', '''ext3''' or  '''ext4''') was inspired by ufs/ffs, and is similar. ext2 is the main filesystem implementation for '''Linux''', and can be used as the root filesystem. Unlike ufs/ffs, ext2 always has the same on-disk layout, and can be shared between different Linux systems, and other systems that understand ext2. Note that '''ext3''' is really the same as ext2, but with journaling enabled and supports Hashed B trees which speed up lookups in larger directorys. Linux also provides other filesystems that you might use instead of ext2.
* '''reiserfs''' is an alternative to ext2 on '''Linux'''. Reiserfs is a fast journaled filesystem written by Hans Reiser.
* '''jfs''' is a high performance journaled filesystem written by IBM originally for IBM AIX, and then ported to Linux by the same.
* '''xfs''' is a high performance journaled filesystem written by SGI. Originally written for SGI's Irix operating system this fs has been ported to Linux using a shim layer converting Linux VFS and locking semantics to Irix semantics.
* ''HFS+'' ('''hfsplus''') is the main filesystem implementation for '''Mac OS X''', and can be used as the root filesystem. Like ext2, HFS+ always has the same on-disk layout, and can be shared between different Mac systems. HFS+ supports both Unix and Mac file attributes. HFS+ has binary trees, which make it faster than ffs and ext2 sometimes.

=== Foreign Filesystems ===
* '''iso9660''' is a common filesystem for CD-ROMs. Most Unix-like systems can read it.
* '''UDF''' is a common filesystem for DVDs. Some newer Unix-like systems can read and write it.
* '''msdos''' (FAT) is the filesystem from MS-DOS, FreeDOS, ReactOS, and Microsoft Windows. Normally you can have normal files and directories, but not special files, symbolic links, nor Unix file permissions. Because nearly every Unix-like system (including Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X) and DOS/Windows understand it, the msdos filesystem is often used to trade files between computers or on computers which boot multiple operating systems.
* '''ntfs''' is a newer filesystem from Microsoft Windows NT. Some Linux kernels can read them.

== Disk Partitioning ==
If the disk is not partitioned, it can be used for one filesystem, or entirely as swap space.
* On Linux, IDE/ATA disks are called /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, /dev/hdc...
* On Linux, SCSI disks are called /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc...
* On *BSD, IDE/ATA disks are called /dev/wd0c, /dev/wd1c, /dev/wd2c...
** On FreeBSD, IDE/ATA disks are called /dev/ad0c, /dev/ad1c, /dev/ad2c...
* On *BSD, SCSI disks are called /dev/sd0c, /dev/sd1c, /dev/sd2c...
* On *BSD, compact disks (CDs) are called /dev/cd0c, /dev/cd1c...
* On Mac OS X, disks are called /dev/disk0, /dev/disk1, /dev/disk2...
* NetBSD/OpenBSD disk images are /dev/svnd0c, /dev/svnd1c, /dev/svnd2c...

Partioning the disk allows for multiple filesystems and swap spaces.
* On Linux, hda is partitioned into /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2, /dev/hda3, /dev/hda4...
* On *BSD, wd0 is partitioned into /dev/wd0a, /dev/wd0b, /dev/wd0c, /dev/wd0d...
* On Mac OS X, disk0 is partitioned into /dev/disk0s1, /dev/disk0s2, /dev/disk0s3...

In addition, *BSD has some extra rules:
* Partition 'c' (/dev/wd0c) must be the entire disk.
* If a *BSD operating system boots on the disk, then partition 'a' must be root ('''/''') and 'b' must be swap. (If there is no OS on the disk, then 'a' can be used for any filesystem).

The chapter [[../Partitioning Disks/]] describes the formats in more detail and how to edit the partition maps.

== Mounting Filesystems and Activating Swap ==
The commands one uses are:
* '''mount''' to mount filesystems
* '''umount''' to unmount filesystems
* '''swapctl''', '''swapon''', '''swapoff'''

=== Simple mounting ===
Suppose /dev/hdb is a device (for example, a CD drive) and /mnt/cdrom is the place to mount. Then the mount command is:
 mount /dev/hdb /mnt/cdrom

There are more mount options so look for mount somewhere in [[Guide to UNIX/Commands]].

=== Mounting with fstab ===
The /etc/fstab file helps you mount.
# Create an /etc/fstab entry for /dev/hdb.
# Run this command
 mount /dev/hdb

=== Unmounting ===
It is called '''umount''', not '''unmount'''...
 umount /dev/hdb

=== Mounts by Users ===
The ''user mounts'' are mounting and unmounting of filesystems by users other than the superuser. Unfortunately, the different Unix variants have different approaches to this task. (An alternative is to configure &quot;sudo&quot; to allow users to become root when mounting and unmounting.) Here are some ways that root can permit user mounts:
* Linux allows the user to perform mounts permitted through the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/tt&gt; file. Each line with the mount option &quot;user&quot; describes a permitted mount. For example, &lt;tt&gt;'''mount /dev/cdrom'''&lt;/tt&gt; by a non-root user will mount &lt;tt&gt;/dev/cdrom&lt;/tt&gt; using the mount point and options shows in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/tt&gt;, but only if &quot;user&quot; is listed as a mount option.
* Many popular BSD-family operating systems allow the user to mount any device which the user can already read and write. The user can pick any mount point which the user owns. A sysctl value must be changed by the root user in order to do this on most of them. 
** In OpenBSD, kern.usermount must be set to 1. 
** In NetBSD, vfs.generic.usermount must be set to 1. 
** In FreeBSD, PcBSD, and DragonflyBSD, vfs.usermount must be set to 1.

=== Union Mounts ===
Normally, filesystems are mounted on empty directories. If the directory was not empty, its files are hidden until the filesystem is unmounted. The ''union mount'' allows these files to show through. Each existing file from the directory only shows if there is no file in the same place on the mounted filesystem. All new files are made on the mounted filesystem. ''Note that union mounts are strange and might not work well on your system.''

Some operating systems provide a '''mount(8)''' option '''-o union''' for this. In this example, a non-partitioned SCSI disk sd0 will be mounted on '''/etc''' (which is not normally a mount point). Any existing '''/etc''' files that we have that are not also on '''sd0''' will still be available.
 # mount -o union /dev/sd0c /etc

== Disk Images ==
A filesystem can be stored on a file on another filesystem. Such files are called '''disk images''' and they have several applications:
* Use '''dd''' to copy data from a device node to a normal file to preserve the content of a small disk, for example a floppy disk.
* Some programs let you make iso9660 disk images before burning them to CD. One might want to mount your disk image read-only to examine it before the burn. One can also move such images to a computer with a CD burner, or offer the image for download so others may burn it.
* If you have no free space for new partitions on your disk, but some partition has free space, then you can create a disk image if you need a new filesystem. Sometimes this helps in the creation of encrypted filesystems.

This guide only describes raw disk images, which contain only the filesystem. There are other formats (such as the Mac OS X NDIF format) but these must be converted or handled specially.

=== Mounting Disk Images on NetBSD and OpenBSD ===
Normally, NetBSD and OpenBSD only allow mounting of filesystems stored on devices. Thus five steps are involved:
# Associate the disk image with a svnd device.
# Mount the svnd device.
# Use the disk image.
# Unmount the svnd device.
# Disassociate the disk image from the device.

Association and dissociation are handled by the ''vnconfig(8)'' command. In this example, '''/the/disk/image''' will be associated with '''/dev/svnd0c'''. This particular disk image has a disklabel with a filesystem on partition 'a', which we mount on '''/mnt'''. If there was no disklabel, we would instead mount partition 'c'.
 # vnconfig -c /dev/svnd0c /the/disk/image
 # mount /dev/svnd0a /mnt
 ...
 # umount /dev/svnd0a
 # vnconfig -u /dev/svnd0c

=== Mounting Disk Images on FreeBSD 5 ===
In FreeBSD 5, one uses '''mdconfig(8)''' with a '''vnode''' backed storage.

=== Mounting Disk Images on Linux ===
The '''mount(8)''' option '''-o loop''' can be used to mount disk images instead of devices.
 # mount -o loop /the/disk/image /mnt
 ...
 # umount /mnt

Some Linux kernels can mount a '''cloop''' (compressed loop), which is a compressed disk image. Such an image must be mounted read-only. One first prepares the image and then compresses it how? Then one mounts it how? The Knoppix livecd uses a cloop to fit more programs to the CD.

=== Creating Disk Images ===
Creating a new, empty disk image involves two steps before you mount it and start using it:
# Use '''dd(1)''' to make a new file of zeros with the correct size.
# Format the disk image with partitions and filesystems.

Here is an example. We use '''dd''' and an unlimited supply of zeros, '''/dev/zero''', to create a 1440 kilobyte disk image (1440 blocks of 1024 bytes). Then we use '''mkfs.ext3(8)''' to create an unpartitioned ext3 filesystem. Note that '''mkfs.ext3''' does no mounting, so it cares not if it formats a device or a disk image. (FIXME is this correct?)
 $ dd bs=1024 count=1440 if=/dev/zero of=example
 $ mkfs.ext3 example

The *BSD '''newfs(8)''' and '''newfs_msdos(8)''' utilities insist on formatting devices only. This is solved with '''vnconfig(8)'''. If we wanted to partition the disk image, we would also have made a disklabel. One can ignore the imaginary disk geometry.
 $ dd bs=1024 count=1440 if=/dev/zero of=example
 $ sudo vnconfig -c /dev/svnd0c example
 $ sudo newfs /dev/rsvnd0c
 ...
 $ sudo vnconfig -u /dev/svnd0c

In fact, on *BSD it is a good idea to always have a disklabel, especially if when creating an ffs filesystem, so that the filesystem will be correctly listed in the label, and the letter will be different from 'c'.
 $ dd bs=1024 count=1440 if=/dev/zero of=example
 $ sudo vnconfig -c /dev/svnd0c example
 $ sudo disklabel -E svnd0

   c:          2880             0  unused      0     0      # Cyl     0 -    28*
 &gt; q
 Write new label?: [y]
 $ sudo newfs /dev/rsvnd0a
 ...
 $ sudo vnconfig -u /dev/svnd0c

== Encrypted Filesystems ==
=== Encrypted Filesystems on OpenBSD ===
Because OpenBSD has integrated crypto, one would expect that there is a way to have an encrypted filesystem. OpenBSD only provides Blowfish encryption for disk images. This is possible with the '''-k''' flag to '''vnconfig(8)''', used with '''-c'''.

In this example, we will mount the encrypted disk image called '''/secrets''', which contains a single partion letter 'a':
 # vnconfig -ck /dev/svnd0c /secrets
 Encryption key:
 # mount /dev/svnd0a
 ...
 # umount /dev/svnd0a
 # vnconfig -u /dev/svnd0c

Note that if you entered the wrong encryption key, vnconfig will still succeed. The mount will fail because the disklabel and filesystem header are not readable. In this case, you must vnconfig -u and then vnconfig -ck with the correct key. Make sure to use the correct key when initially formatting a new disk image.

To have an entire encrypted disk partition, create a normal unencrypted disk image, mount it, then fill the partition with one large file to serve as the disk image.

=== Encrypted Filesystems on Linux ===
Some Linux kernel configurations let you use '''losetup''' to encrypt disk images. Think of lo(opback) setup, not of lose tup.

Unless this book gets three votes I will stop renominateing it I promise. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 18:27, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
:I don't think many wikibookians are able to add something to this book. Is it good choice? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 23:13, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

===[[Cookbook]]===

Votes:
#[[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 06:13, 6 October 2005 (UTC) I think that the Cookbook needs a serious looking at, as it is there are many recipes and ingredients which do not fit in with the rest of the book, massive categorization gaps exist and such.  If we can get a few people to just run over the whole thing a couple times it could flesh out much nicer in only a little time.
#[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:45, 24 October 2005 (UTC) - I'm going to add my vote here because this is a neat resource and with just a little bit of effort to do some minor cleanup it would be a good candidate for Book of the Month.  This is also something that Wikibooks has had some signficant success in trying to organize that is otherwise out of place elsewhere in the Wikimedia realm of projects.
#[[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 14:34, 30 October 2005 (UTC)This book needs some tidying up, so outside help could be put to good use.

Comments:

I think it's a good nomination: subject is common, scope of the book is well-defined. It only needs cleanup of discussion page to provide newcomers with well-organised information how to contribute. Maybe there should be separate page describing book organisation, templates etc.? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 23:13, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

: Please see [[Cookbook:Policy]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:55, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

This book is not at all needy, and thus should not be chosen. This book is probably the most active in fact. Excepting books with really obscure subject matter, '''''any''''' other book would be a better choice. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:51, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

===[[Algebra]]===

Votes:
#[[User:Catcher.in.the.rye.and.all|Catcher.in.the.rye.and.all]] 19:44, 12 October 2005 (UTC) The book is maybe halfway done. A collaboration might give it a little more oompf, a little more completeness.
#[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 20:23, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
#[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:54, 30 October 2005 (UTC) This book needs work, and we all should know the subject matter. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:54, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

Comments:
Maybe this book has too much content to be nominated for this. I don't think so...and anyway what needs to be added is much more abstract and complex than what is there, and therefore far more work to add. [[User:Catcher.in.the.rye.and.all|Catcher.in.the.rye.and.all]] 19:44, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
: I think algebra is too specific topic and it would be hard to attract many contributors. Anyway, it's quite a mature book. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 23:13, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

'''Algebra wins - votes are 3 to 3 but Albebra was created in 2003 and Cookbook was created in 2004.''' --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 10:40, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Soybean|Soybean]]

'''Textured vegetable protein''', also known as '''textured soy protein,''' is a [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] substitute made from defatted soy flour, a by-product of making [[Cookbook:Oil|soybean oil]].  It is quick to cook, high in protein, and low in fat.

Textured vegetable protein comes as small dry chunks or flakes when bought in bulk. It has little flavor of its own and needs to be rehydrated and flavored (both can be accomplished in the same step), then added to cooking.

Textured vegetable protein is a versatile substance, different forms allowing it to take on the texture of whatever meat it is substituting for. Using textured vegetable protein, one can make [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]] or [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] versions of popular dishes like [[Cookbook:Chili|chili]], [[Cookbook:Sloppy Joe|sloppy joe]]s, [[Cookbook:Taco|taco]]s, [[Cookbook:Hamburger|burger]]s, et cetera.

Textured vegetable protein can be found in natural food stores and large supermarkets, usually in the bulk section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The code ==
Code is the string of symbols interpreted by a computer in order to execute a given objective.  As with natural languages, code is the result of all the conventions and rules that govern a language. It is what permits implementation of projects in a standard, compilable way.  Correctly written code is used to create projects that serve as intermediaries for natural language in order to express meanings and ideas.  This, theoretically and actually, allows a computer program to solve any explicitly-defined problem.

;'''undefined behavior'''
It is also important to note that the language standard leaves some items undefined. In this the C++ language is not alone, but it is at times most vexing to the newcomer, since results may appear inconsistent, especially for the unaware. Of course this becomes most evident when doing cross platform developing requiring the use of different compilers, since the undefined behavior is left to the choices made by each compiler implementor.

{{NOTE|We will try to provide the relevant information as the information is presented, take notice that when we do so we often point you to the documentation of the compiler you are using or note the behavior in the compilers more commonly used.}}

=== Programming ===
The task of programming, while not easy in its execution, is actually fairly simple in its goals.  A programmer will envision, or be tasked with, a specific goal.  Goals are usually provided in the form of &quot;I want a program that will perform...''fill in the blank''...&quot;  The job of the programmer then is to come up with a &quot;working model&quot; (a model that may consist of one or more [[w:Algorithm|algorithms]]).  That &quot;working model&quot; is sort of an idea of ''how'' a program will accomplish the goal set out for it.  It gives a programmer an idea of what to write in order to turn the idea into a working program.

Once the programmer has an idea of the structure their program will need to take in order to accomplish the goal, they set about actually writing the program itself, using the selected ''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages|programming language(s)]] keywords'', ''functions'' and ''syntax''. The code that they write is what actually implements the program, or causes it to perform the necessary task, and for that reason, it is sometimes called &quot;implementation code&quot;.

=== What is a program? ===
To restate the definition, a program is just a sequence of instructions, written in some form of programming language, that tells a computer what to do, and generally how to do it.  Everything that a typical user does on a computer is handled and controlled by programs.  Programs can contain anything from instructions to solve math problems or send emails, to how to behave when a character is shot in a video game. The computer will follow the instructions of a program one line at a time from the start to the end.

==== Types of programs ====
There are all kinds of different programs used today, for all types of purposes. All programs are written with some form of programming language and C++ can be used for in any type of application.  Examples of different types of programs, (also called software), include:

{{TODO|Correct the examples to indicate real life application of the C++ language, if possible with projects that users can examine the source code.}}

;''Operating Systems'': An operating system is responsible for making sure that everything on a computer works the way that it should.  It is especially concerned with making certain that your computer's &quot;hardware&quot;, (i.e. disk drives, video card and sound card, and etc.) interfaces properly with other programs you have on your computer. Microsoft Windows and Linux are examples of PC operating systems.

;''Office Programs'': This is a general category for a collection of programs that allow you to compose, view, print or otherwise display different kinds of documents. Often such &quot;suites&quot; come with a word processor for composing letters or reports, a spreadsheet application and a slide-show creator of some kind among other things.  Popular examples of Office Suites are Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org 

;''Web Browsers &amp; Email Clients'': A web-browser is a program that allows you to type in an Internet address and then displays that page for you.  An email client is a program that allows you to send, receive and compose email messages outside of a web-browser. Often email clients have some capability as a web-browser as well, and some web-browsers have integrated email clients. Well-known web-browsers are Internet Explorer and Firefox, and Email Clients include Microsoft Outlook and Thunderbird. Most are programmed using C++, you can access some as Open-source projects, for instance (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/) will help you download and compile Firefox.

;''Audio/Video Software'': These types of software include media players, sound recording software, burning/ripping software, DVD players, etc. Many applications such as Windows Media Player, a popular media player programmed by Microsoft, are examples of audio/video software.

;''Computer Games'': There are countless software titles that are either games or designed to assist with playing games. The category is so wide that it would be impossible to get in to a detailed discussion of all the different kinds of game software without creating a different book! Gaming is one of the most popular activities to engage in on a computer.

;''Development Software'': Development software is software used specifically for programming.  It includes software for composing programs in a computer language (sometimes as simple as a text editor like Notepad), for checking to make sure that code is stable and correct (called a debugger), and for compiling that source code into executable programs that can be run later (these are called compilers). Oftentimes, these three separate programs are combined in to one bigger program called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are all kinds of IDEs for every programming language imaginable. A popular C++ IDE for Windows and Linux is the [http://www.codeblocks.org/ Code::Blocks] IDE ([http://www.codeblocks.org/features.shtml Free and Open Source]). The one type of software that you will learn the most about in this book is Development Software.

==== Types of instructions ====
As mentioned already, programs are written in many different languages, and for every language, the words and statements used to tell the computer to execute specific commands are different. No matter what words and statements are used though, just about every programming language will include statements that will accomplish the following:

;''Input'': Input is the act of getting information from a keyboard or mouse, or sometimes another program.

;''Output'': Output is the opposite of input; it gives information to the computer monitor or another device or program. 

;''Math''/''Algorithm'': All computer processors (the brain of the computer), have the ability to perform basic mathematical computation, and every programming language has some way of telling it to do so. 

;''Testing'': Testing involves telling the computer to check for a certain condition and to do something when that condition is true or false. Conditionals are one of the most important concepts in programming, and all languages have some method of testing conditions. 

;''Repetition'': Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation. 

Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it. Every program you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of functions that look more or less like these. Thus, one way to describe programming is the process of breaking a large, complex task up into smaller and smaller subtasks until eventually the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these simple functions.

==== Program execution ====
Execution starts on '''''[[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions#main|main function]]''''', the ''entry point'' of any (standard-compliant) C++ program. We will cover it when we introduce '''''[[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions|functions]]'''''.

''Execution control'' or simply ''control'', means the process and the location of execution of a program, this has a direct link to '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms#Procedural programming|procedural programming]]'''''. You will note the mention of ''control'' as we proceed, as it is necessary concept to explain the order of execution of code and its interpretation by the computer.

==== Core vs Standard Library ====
The Core Library consists of the fundamental building blocks of the language itself. Made up of the basic statements that the C++ compiler inherently understands. This includes basic looping constructs such as the if..else, do..while, and for.. statements. The ability to create and modify variables, declare and call functions, and perform basic arithmetic. The Core Library does not include I/O functionality.

The [[w:C++ Standard Library|Standard Library]] is a set of modules that add extended functionality to the language through the use of library or header files. Features such as Input/Output routines, advanced mathematics, and memory allocation functions fall under this heading. All C++ compilers are responsible for providing a Standard Library of functions as outlined by the [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/ ANSI/ISO C++ guidelines]. Deeper understanding about each module will be provided on the [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library|Standard C Library]], [[C++ Programming/Code/IO|Standard input/output streams library]] and [[C++ Programming/STL|Standard Template Library (STL)]] sections of this book.

{{TODO|Complete, create section for C++11 extension module if required (at the time of this writing no C++11 is present on the book content, however some minor mentions are noted. Probably create a subpage C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Standard Library move this section there (transwiki here) and make each module children of that page to benefit navigation.)}}

==== Program organization ====
How the instructions of a program are written out and stored is generally not a concept determined by a programming language. Punch cards used to be in common use, however under most modern operating systems the instructions are commonly saved as plain text files that can be edited with any text editor. These files are the source of the instructions that make up a program and so are sometimes referred to as '''source files''' but a more exclusive definition is '''source code'''.

When referring to '''source code''' or just '''source''', you are considering only the files that contain code, the actual text that makes up the functions (actions) for computer to execute. By referring to '''source files''' you are extending the idea to not only the files with the instructions that make up the program but all the raw files resources that together can '''build''' the program. The [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/File Organization|File Organization Section]] will cover the different files used in C++ programming and best practices on handling them.

=== Keywords and identifiers ===
{{TODO|Complete Keywords,Specifier,Modifier, directives }}
''[[w:identifiers|Identifiers]]'' are names given to variables, functions, objects, etc. to refer to them in the program. C++ identifiers must start with a letter or an underscore character &quot;&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, possibly followed by a series of letters, underscores or digits. None of the C++ programming language keywords can be used as identifiers. Identifiers with successive underscores are reserved for use in the header files or by the compiler for special purpose, e.g. name mangling.

Some keywords exists to directly control the compiler's behavior, these keywords are very powerful and must be used with care, they may make a huge difference on the program's compile time and running speed. In the C++ Standard, these keywords are called '''''Specifiers'''''. 

Special considerations must be given when creating your own identifiers, this will be covered in [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions/Naming Identifiers|Code Style Conventions Section]]. 

{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords}}

; Source code
Source code is the halfway point between human language and machine code. As mentioned before, it can be read by people to an extent, but it can also be parsed (converted) into machine code by a computer. The machine code, represented by a series of 1's and 0's, is the only code that the computer can directly understand and act on.

In a small program, you might have as little as a few dozen lines of code at the most, whereas in larger programs, this number might stretch into the thousands or even millions. For this reason, it is sometimes more practical to split large amounts of code across many files.  This makes it easier to read, as you can do it bit by bit, and it also reduces compile time of each source file. It takes much less time to compile a lot of small source files than it does to compile a single massive source file.

Managing size is not the only reason to split code, though. Often, especially when a piece of software is being developed by a large team, source code is split. Instead of one massive file, the program is divided into separate files, and each individual file contains the code to perform one particular set of tasks for the overall program. This creates a condition known as ''Modularity''. Modularity is a quality that allows source code to be changed, added to, or removed a piece at a time. This has the advantage of allowing many people to work on separate aspects of the same program, thereby allowing it to move faster and more smoothly. Source code for a large project should always be written with modularity in mind. Even when working with small or medium sized projects, it is good to get in the habit of writing code with ease of editing and use in mind.
 
C++ source code is [[w:Case sensitivity|case sensitive]]. This means that it distinguishes between lowercase and capital letters, so that it sees the words &quot;hello,&quot; &quot;Hello,&quot; and &quot;HeLlO&quot; as being totally different things.  This is important to remember and understand, it will be discussed further in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions|Coding style conventions Section]].

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Arabic words are either masculine or feminine.
For example:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; رجل &lt;/font&gt;(ra-jul) which means man is masculine.&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;
امرأة &lt;/font&gt;(im-ra-ah) which means woman is feminine.
These two examples are very logical.
But just like many other languages, everyday objects have their own gender as well. For example the word for ear, must be either masculine or feminine.
&lt;br&gt;
The most common way to tell a masculine word from a feminine word is the&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ة &lt;/font&gt;(taa' mar-boo-Tah). If a word ends in a&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ة &lt;/font&gt;(h/t) then it is most likely feminine. To make a masculine word feminine usually a&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ة &lt;/font&gt;(h/t) is added to the end of the word.
&lt;br&gt;
For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
كلب
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;kalb&lt;br&gt;
kalb&lt;br&gt;
dog
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
كلبة
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;kalba/kalbah&lt;br&gt;
kal-ba&lt;br&gt;
female dog, she-dog
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


In Arabic nouns, as well as adjectives, have to agree in gender, as well as number.
&lt;br&gt;
For example:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
الولد كبـيـر
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;al_waladu kabeer(un)&lt;br&gt;
al-wa-la-du-ka-beer&lt;br&gt;
The boy is big
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
البنت كبيـرة
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;al_bint kabeerah(-tun)&lt;br&gt;
al-bint-ka-bee-rah&lt;br&gt;
The girl is big.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Did you notice that we called the girl &quot;big&quot; with كبيرة (ka-bee-rah) while when we want to say the boy is big we said كبير(ka-beer). This is generally how it works for singular nouns.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
الولد صغير
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;al_waladu Sa''gh''eer(un)&lt;br&gt;
al-wa-la-du-Sa-''gh''eer&lt;br&gt;
The boy is small
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
البنت صغيرة
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;al_bintu Sa''gh''eerah(-tun)&lt;br&gt;
al-bin-tu-Sa-''gh''ee-rah&lt;br&gt;
The girl is small.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;
الولد قصير والبنت طويلة
&lt;!--unsure if it is طويل OR طويلة --&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;al_waladu qaSeer wa al_bintu Taweelah(-tun)&lt;br&gt;
al-wa-la-du--qa-Seer--wal-bin-tu--Ta-wee-lah&lt;br&gt;
The boy is short, and the girl is tall.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms are so widespread that typically a Windows or Mac software vendor will provide a binary. In contrast, several packages for Unix-like systems are only available as sources. If they are available as binaries, they are usually only available for a few popular distros, or statically linked for a few popular kernels, and possibly for a different processor than what you run.

The best way to get many packages, especially free software packages, is to get them from your Unix-like system vendor. Vendors port the packages to their distros and build binary packages.
* [[Linux For Newbies]] has instructions for using '''apt-get''' on [[Linux For Newbies#Debian|Debian]] and '''rpm''' on [[Linux For Newbies#Red Hat|Red Hat]].

=== Handling packages ===
* '''rpm'''
* '''apt-get'''
* '''pkg_add''', '''pkg_delete''', '''pkg_info'''
* '''pkgadd''','''pkginfo''','''pkgrm''' for Solaris

=== Querying packages ===
On rpm-based systems, to find out which package owns the command '''foo''' (where '''foo''' is a standalone executable), use the command:
 $ '''rpm -q -f foo'''

To add a package on linux based system use
 $ '''rpm -i foo'''

To remove package on linux based system user
 $ '''rpm -e foo'''

rpm command has other options user man pages to find out more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Arabic a word can represent either one of something (singular), two of something (dual), or many of something (Arabic plural, three or more).

This page is about how words go from being singular to plural in Arabic.

==Regular Feminine Plural==

A feminine noun is usually made plural by adding ات (alif then taa', pronounced -aat), to the end of the word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مغامرة&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;mu''gh''aamarah (pausal form)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ٌمغامرة&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;mu''gh''aamaratun (nominative)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ًمغامرة&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;mu''gh''aamaratan (accusative)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ٍمغامرة&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;mu''gh''aamaratin (genitive or preceded by a preposition)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

All of these mean &quot;adventure&quot; and all become:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مغامرات&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;mu''gh''aamaraat&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Regular Masculine Plural==

A masculine noun is usually made plural by adding at the end of the word ون (waw then nuun, pronounced -uun) for the nominative case, and ين (ya' then nuun, pronounced -iin) for other cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مسلم    ---&gt;     مسلمين&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Muslim ---&gt; muslimiin (pausal form)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مسلمٌ    ---&gt;     مسلمون&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;muslimun ---&gt; muslimuun (nominative)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مسلمً ----&gt;  مسلمين&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;musliman ---&gt; muslimiin (accusative)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مسلم ٍ  ----&gt;  مسلمين &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;muslimin ---&gt; muslimiin (genitive or preceded by a preposition)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

All of these mean &quot;muslim(s)&quot;; note that the last two forms have the same plural.

==Non-regular==

'''Frosting''' and '''icing''' are both sugar-based toppings used primarily for pastries and cakes.

Frosting is generally thick and creamy due to a high [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] content (usually from [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]) whereas icing is more often thin and made up mostly of sugar. When icing dries it becomes hard to the touch while frosting stays somewhat moist for a considerable time after being applied. Frosting is most often used on [[Cookbook:Cake|cakes]] while icing is more often found on [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]] or [[Cookbook:Muffin|muffins]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A chain wear indicator tells you how worn the chain on a bicycle is. As is often believed, chains do not stretch, but rather the rollers become worn. There are various types of chain wear indicators, but they all function by being inserted into the gaps of the chain to determine the amount of chain wear. (If you don't have a chain wear indicator, a ruler can be used.) These devices check to see when 1/16th of an inch of wear has occurred across 12 full links. In general, if the chain is NOT worn out yet, the indicator will not fit in the chain.

After the tires and break pads (which wear out by design), and brake and shifting cables, the part of a bike that needs the most attention is the chain.  Because of that and because a chain wear indicator is so easy to use, it should be in the intermediate tool kit, not the advanced tool kit.

If you ride with a stretched chain you will prematurely wear out your chainrings and/or rear cogs (which cost a lot more than a chain).  If you let it really go, it can slip.  This will of course happen when you are putting a lot of force on the pedals or hitting a bump, and can easily cause a crash.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although technically the [[w:four color theorem|four color theorem]] has been proven, for some – professionals and amateurs alike – attempting to discover a more elegant solution to the Four Color Theorem is an engrossing pastime. In theory nothing more than a pencil, some paper, and some thought should be required. 

==Tips==
* It is easier to work with graphs than maps. Maps are equivalent to their duals, which are planar graphs. Each region corresponds to a vertex and borders between regions correspond to edges. Borders without length are disregarded.
* On the other hand, working with cubic maps, we can switch prove a 3-coloring of the edges, which is equivalent to a 4-coloring of the areas.
* It is assumed that it will be easier to prove the Four Color Theorem for fully-triangulated planar graphs. A planar graph which is not fully-triangulated (i.e. it is missing some edges) can easily be made fully-triangulated by adding some edges. Then, after a 4-coloring is found, those additional edges can be removed. However, if you are attempting to solve the Four Color Theorem as a route to solving [[w:Complexity_classes_P_and_NP|P = NP]], note that it is the finding of a 3-coloring of a [possibly non-fully-triangulated] graph – or proving that such a 3-coloring does not exist – that is hard.
* The dual of a fully-triangulated planar graph is a cubic planar graph. Cubic means that every vertex has 3 edges. However, not every cubic planar graph has a [[w:Hamiltonian path|Hamiltonian cycle]] – if it did, it would prove the Four Color Theorem. For examples of cubic planar graphs without a hamiltonian see: Tutte's counter-example with 46 vertices and 60 edges; Kozyrev and Grinberg's counter-example with 44 vertices; and Lederberg's or Barnette and Bosák's counter-example with 38 vertices.
* We can prove that we need not discuss graphs with a connectivity lower than 4. According to Tutte, planar graphs with a connectivity of 4 or higher have a Hamiltonian cycle (of the nodes regarding the graph, or of the areas regarding the map). A Hamiltonian cycle provides us with a trivial way to impose a linear order on our nodes (or areas).

==Mis-steps==

Here are some of the common pitfalls for the beginner:

* Not every graph can be generated by starting with a triangle and adding 1 vertex and 3 edges i.e. keeping the graph fully triangulated as each vertex is added. The smallest graph with minimum degree 4 has 6 vertices. The smallest graph with minimum degree 5 has 12 vertices. 

* To generate *every* graph, work it the other way around : in every graph you may eliminate a node by contracting two neighboring nodes in to a single node along their connecting edge. Inversely, we can create every graph by expanding a node into two neighboring ones.

==Ideas==

The Four Color Theorem is equivalent to finding a Bi-[[w:Bipartite graph|BiPartite]] solution. In other words it is sufficient to separate the vertexes into just 2 sets – if each set is itself BiPartite. This is actually a simplification because it is clear what makes a graph BiPartite: no odd cycles. If the graph can be decomposed into 2 subgraphs such that each subgraph has only even cycles or no cycles, a solution has been found.

The Four Color Theorem can be equivalent to finding a solution to an equation or a set of equations and may be easier to work with in matrix form.

The simplest equation is of the form (A-B)(A-C)... != 0 where A,B,C,... represent the colors of the vertexes. If 2 vertexes are adjacent, then their values are subtracted. It thus becomes a 'satisfiability problem' in that values for A,B,C... must be found that 'satisfy' the inequality. If two adjacent vertexes have the same color, then their difference is 0 and the entire equation yields 0. Inequalities are not easy to solve using matrix.

To prove an equation representing a 4-coloring or an equivalent assertion, we might have to find a (matrix) equation describing planarity, our main premise.

==Minimum Counter Example to the Four Color Theorem==

The Four Color Theorem (4CT) essentially says that &quot;the vertices of a planar graph may be colored with no more than four different colors.&quot;  

A graph is a set of points (called vertices) which are connected in pairs by rays called edges.  
In a complete graph, all pairs are connected by an edge.
In a planar graph only those pairs whose edges do not cross or intersect are connected.
A complete planar graph is one which has exactly &lt;math&gt;3\cdot n-6&lt;/math&gt; edges.  [&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of vertices]
Vertices that are connected by an edge are called adjacent vertices  
Vertices that are not connected are called disjoint vertices.

The 4CT implies that adjacent vertices cannot have the same color; and that four colors are sufficient to meet this condition.

HYPOTHESIS:  If the 4CT is true for all fully triangulated planar graphs (FTPG), then it is true for all planar graphs.

Therefore, it is necessary only to prove the 4CT for FTPG's!

The degree of a vertex is the number of vertices with which it shares an edge.

It is generally agreed that every vertex in a 5-chroma planar graph must have degree &lt;math&gt; \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;.
[A 5-chroma planar graph is a graph that cannot be properly colored with less than five colors.  
In a &quot;properly&quot; colored graph, no two adjacent vertices will have the same color.]

If the 4CT is false, then there must be 5-chroma planar graphs. If such graphs exist, it  should be possible to remove vertices and edges from such a graph until the smallest possible 5-chroma graph remains. This is a lot of work, so someone else has already done this for us. This &quot;smallest possible&quot; graph is called a &quot;minimal counter-example to the Four Color Theorem&quot;; more conveniently, MCE/4CT.

One way of proving the 4CT to be true is to prove that every graph thought to be an MCE/4CT is really not! 

An MCE/4CT is by definition is a 5-chroma simple loopless planar graph and by choice, a FTPG.
If any vertex is removed from a true MCE/4CT, then a 4-colorable graph will always result.

A proposed MCE/4CT is not a true MCE/4CT if it can be shown that there is a least one smaller 
graph; i.e., one with fewer vertices, that is also 5-chroma.   

This is a difficult task, but it is not complex. Complex in the sense that there are many configurations to analyze. It is necessary to analyze only one configuration.  This is the subgraph of the MCE/4CT which consists of a vertex of degree = 5 and its 5 neighboring vertices.  Every MCE/4CT has at least one such vertex. Figure 1 below is a typical subgraph of a fully triangulated planar graph (FTPG)

              1-----2
              |\   /|
              | \ / |
              5--0--3
               \ | /
                \|/
                 4
             Figure 1
               
where the central vertex v_0 has degree = 5. '''Every vertex with degree = 5 in a FTPG will''' '''have exactly the same local graph.'''  

For convenience let graph G be a proposed MCE/4CT.  Then Chi(G) = 5; i.e., G is 5-chroma. If  v_0 is removed as in Figure 2, 
 
              1-----2
              |     |
              |     |
              5     3
               \   /
                \ /
                 4
             Figure 2

then Chi(G-v) must always be &lt;5!  [(G-v) is the subgraph of G that remains after vertex v_0 has been removed.] 

HYPOTHESIS: There is only one vertex coloring pattern for Figure 2 that will allow Chi(G-v) to equal 4 and at the same time insure that Chi(G) is always greater than 4 when
v_0 is restored. The pattern is C1-C2-C3-C4-C3.  Figure 2 must have a 4-coloring. This is necessary if (G-v) is 4-colorable and G is not 4-colorable. A 3-coloring of Figure 2 would not require G to be 5-chroma.     

Figure 3, shows a typical 4-coloring of the vertices of the graph in Figure 2.  

              R     G
              1-----2
              |     |
              |     |
            B 5     3 B
               \   /
                \ /
                 4
                 Y
             Figure 3

Usually, Figure 3 can be 3-colored   But in this case,''the configuration of (G-v) is such ''that a normal 3-coloring is not possible''!

None of the configurations of(G-v) are known.  It is possible that they are also &quot;unknowable&quot;?  Yet is essential that we acknowledge that they may exist!

'''Here's a new approach!'''

Because G is a FTPG, its dual is a cubic planar graph (CPG); i.e., C_g. If G is not 4-C, then C_g ''cannot be bridgeless''!

Now consider graph (G-v). It is not fully triangulated.  But it can be fully triangulated by the addition of two edges.  A typical triangulation is shown in Figure 4.  

              1-------2
              |\     /|
              | \   / |
              |  \ /  | 
              5---4---3                
            
             Figure 4.  


Now graph (G-v) is fully triangulated and its dual is a cubic planar graph; i.e., graph C_v.

The a priori presumption is that C_v is bridgeless, and that C_G is not bridgeless!.


If you want to disprove the existence of a minimal counter example, you may also concentrate on the &quot;minimal&quot; part. If counter examples exist, there has to be a minimal one. Now if we can prove that every supposed minimal counter example can be used to construct a smaller counter example, we disprove the existence of counter examples at all.

==Four Color Theorem for Maximal Planar Graphs [MPG]==      
The 4CT for MPGs is a sub theorem for the 4CT for all planar graphs. It simply states that all MPG's are 4-colorable.

The advantage of MPGs is that certain statements can be made about their structure; i.e., the way that they are drawn on the page.

One convenient way to draw a MPG is to start with a single vertex (V). V is drawn surrounded by 5 or more adjacent vertices. These neighbors of V form a closed ring called a
&quot;cycle&quot; graph. This ring is in turn surrounded by a second cycle formed by some or all of the neighbors of the vertices in the first ring. A third closed ring encloses the second ring, etc. This continues until all vertices have been used. The final ring will have only three vertices.  
  
Only if the graph is maximal, will it be certain that all of the rings are closed.  

The concentric ring configuration is a concept that is not easy to prove! 

The main problem with this ring configuration is not that rings may not be closed, but that rings may be short-circuited, in which case there's not a single &quot;next&quot; ring, but multiple next *rings*. If there is no single outermost ring, contraction to a single node doesn't work and there's no necessity for a single final color.

HYPOTHESIS: The colors of each ring are determined by the colors of the next external ring.

HYPOTHESIS.  It requires 4 colors in one ring to force 4 colors on the next internal ring.

For any ring in a MPG there must be four coloring of MPG in which the external ring is 3-colorable. Otherwise the MPG can be used to construct counterexample to 4CT. Just join the nodes of the external ring to another new node. 

If these hypotheses are true, then the 4CT for MPGs is true.

Rationale: The outermost ring can have only three colors.  
Therefore, none of the rings can have more than three colors!

The Canon XL H1 Records to HDV, the high-defition version of the popular DV codec used in many cameras, including the H1's predecessors the Canon XL 1s and XL 2.  HDV is a very well engineered codec and allows for optimal HD compression to tape.  Although high quality, the HDV compression codec is in fact compressing the video and disregarding some of the pixels that the XL H1's CCDs are picking up.  However, the XLH1 does have an exciting option that none of the other prosumer HD cameras have: a pre-compression HD SDI output.  This allows for the exact same signal that is being sent to the HDV codec for compression to be outputted to an HD SDI device through a BNC cable on the side of the camera.  Though this feature is designed for use in studio environments where the HD SDI signal can be sent to a video deck such as a DVCproHD or HDCAM deck for full-resolution, uncompressed recording it can also be sent to a computer via an HD SDI video card such as those offered by AJA and Blackmagic and then recorded completely digitally onto a hard drive for editing or higher quality compression.

In a studio the HD SDI output and Genlock input would be highly useful.  However, for movie making and general recording the HDV tape option is very high quality and much more compact that working with a large video deck or computer system in the field.

All the previous constructions we considered had one thing in common. The constructions were ended after a final number of steps.
When one recalls that mathematicians actually used a ruler and compass in order to execute the constructions, this requirement seems to be in place. However, when we remove this requirement we can construct new interesting geometric shapes. In this chapter we will introduce two of them. Note that these shapes are not part of Euclidian geometry and were considered only years after its development.

== Cantor Set ==

For a full overview of Cantor set [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set see the article] at wikipedia on which this section is based.
The '''Cantor set''' was introduced by German mathematician Georg Cantor.

The Cantor set is defined by repeatedly removing the middle thirds of line segments. One starts by removing the middle third from the unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1], leaving [0,&amp;nbsp;1/3] &amp;cup; [2/3,&amp;nbsp;1]. Next, the &quot;middle thirds&quot; of all of the remaining intervals are removed. This process is continued for ever. The Cantor set consists of all points in the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] that are not removed at any step in this infinite process.

=== What's in the Cantor set? ===

Since the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed.  This total is the geometric series

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{9} + \frac{4}{27} + \frac{8}{81} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{3}}\right) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

So that the proportion left is  1 &amp;ndash; 1 = 0.  Alternatively, it can be observed that each step leaves 2/3 of the length in the previous stage, so that the amount remaining is 2/3 &amp;times; 2/3 &amp;times; 2/3 &amp;times; ..., an infinite product which equals 0 in the limit.

From the calculation, it may seem surprising that there would be anything left &amp;mdash; after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the &quot;middle third&quot; of each interval involved removing open sets (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (1/3,&amp;nbsp;2/3) from the original interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] leaves behind the points 1/3 and 2/3. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining.  So we know for certain that the Cantor set is not empty.  

=== The Cantor set is a fractal ===

The Cantor set is the prototype of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal fractal]. It is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similar self-similar], because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 1/3 and translated.

== Koch curve ==

For a full overview of Koch curve [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_curve see the article] at wikipedia on which this section is based.

The '''Koch curve''' is a one of the earliest [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal fractal]  curves to have been described. It was published during 1904 by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.  The better known '''Koch snowflake''' (or '''Koch star''') is the same as the curve, except it starts with an equilateral triangle instead of a line segment. &lt;br/&gt;[[image:Geom koch 01.png|387px]]&lt;br/&gt;

One can imagine that it was created by starting with a line segment, then recursively altering each line segment as follows:

# divide the line segment into three segments of equal length.
# draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment from step one as its base.
# remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle from step 2.

After doing this once the result should be a shape similar to the Star of David.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom koch 02.png|387px]]&lt;br/&gt;

The Koch curve is in the limit approached as the above steps are followed over and over again.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom koch 03.png|387px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom koch 04.png|387px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Geom koch 05.png|387px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[image:Geom koch 06.png|387px]]&lt;br/&gt;

The Koch curve has infinite length because each time the steps above are performed on each line segment of the figure its length increases by one third.  The length at step n will therefore be (4/3)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.

The area of the Koch snowflake is 8/5 that of the initial triangle, so an infinite perimeter encloses a finite area.

In this chapter, we will discuss the Pythagorean theorem. It is used the find the side lengths of right triangles. It says:
::''In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side of a right triangle opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (i.e. the two sides other than the hypotenuse).''
This means that if &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; is a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse, c, squared eqauls the sum of a squared plus b squared. Or:
: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Here's an example:

In a right-angled triangle, a=5cm and b=12cm, so what is c?

: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{ 5^2 + 12^2 }\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{ 25 + 144 }\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{ 169 }\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c = 13 \,&lt;/math&gt;

If c is '''not larger''' than a or b, your answer is incorrect. There may be a number of reasons that your answer is incorrect. The first is that you have calculated the sums wrong, the second is that the triangle you are trying to find the hypotenuse of is not a right angled triangle or the third is you have mixed up the measurements.  There may be more finer points to having a wrong answer but the three stated are the most common

In this chapter, we will show how to  construct a triangle from three segments. The construction is based on [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI22.html Book I, proposition 22] 

== The construction ==
Given three line segments &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt; we build a triangle whose sides equal the segments.

# [[../Copying a line segment|Copy the line]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}&lt;/math &gt; to point '''A'''.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:GEOM constr triangle 01a.png|225px]]&lt;br/&gt; If you have forgotten how to do this, follow the instructions in the previous section. Your construction should look like the grey lines in the picture below. Call the new line &lt;math&gt;\overline{AG}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:GEOM constr triangle 01b.png|225px]]&lt;br/&gt;It's a good idea to erase your construction lines now, so all that's left are the four line segments shown below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:GEOM constr triangle 01c.png|225px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
# [[../Copying a line segment|Copy the line]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt; to point '''B'''&lt;br/&gt;[[File:GEOM constr triangle 02a.png|225 px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your construction should look like the grey lines in the picture below. Call the new line &lt;math&gt;\overline{BH}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[image:GEOM constr triangle 02b.png|300 px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
#[[../Our tools: Ruler and compass# how to draw a circle?|Draw the circle]] &lt;math&gt;\circ A,\overline{AG}&lt;/math&gt;, whose center is '''A''' and radius is  &lt;math&gt;\overline{AG}&lt;/math&gt;.
#[[../Our tools: Ruler and compass# how to draw a circle?|Draw the circle]] &lt;math&gt;\circ B,\overline{BH} &lt;/math&gt;, whose center is '''B''' and radius is  &lt;math&gt;\overline{BH}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let '''J''' be an intersection point of &lt;math&gt;\circ A,\overline{AG} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\circ B,\overline{BH} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:GEOM constr triangle 03 first.png|300 px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
# [[../Our_tools: Ruler and compass# how to draw a line?| Draw a line]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{AJ}&lt;/math&gt;.
# [[../Our_tools: Ruler and compass# how to draw a line?| Draw a line]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{BJ}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:GEOM constr triangle 03.png|300px]]

== Claim == 
The sides of the triangle &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABJ&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Proof ==
# The segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is a side of the triangle and equal to itself.
# The segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{AJ}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\overline{AG}&lt;/math&gt; because they are both radii of circle&lt;math&gt;\circ A,\overline{AG}&lt;/math&gt;. And because it was copied, &lt;math&gt;\overline{AG}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;\overline{AJ}&lt;/math&gt; is also equal to &lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}&lt;/math&gt;
# The segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{BJ}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\overline{BH}&lt;/math&gt; because they are both radii of circle&lt;math&gt;\circ B,\overline{BH}&lt;/math&gt;. And because it was copied, &lt;math&gt;\overline{BH}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;\overline{BJ}&lt;/math&gt; is also equal to &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt;
# Hence the sides of the triangle &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABJ&lt;/math&gt; are equal to &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Testing the procedure ==
# [[../Our tools: Ruler and compass# how to draw a line?|Draw a line]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; of some length.
# [[../Copying a line segment|Copy the line]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; to an arbitrary point '''C''' and get &lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Draw a line &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt; such that it length is three times the length of &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;. (We didn't specify how to construct such a segment and we give it as an exercise. Use chapter [[../Copying a line segment|Copy the line]] as a guide for the solution.
# Construct a triangle from &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{CD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Why you couldn't construct the triangle in the test? ==
The reason we couldn’t build the triangle in the test is that the circles we constructed did not intersect.
One cannot use any three segment to construct a triangle. The length of the segments must obey a condition called “The triangle inequality”.
The triangle inequality states that any of the segments should be shorter that the sum of the length of the other two segments.
If one of the segments is longer the circles do not intersect.
If one segment equals to the sum of the other two, we get a line instead of a triangle.

Therefore, the construction is correct but one should condition the segments on which it can be applied.
Note that the original construction was conditioned by Euclid, hence there is no error in the construction or in its proof.

*&lt;math&gt;\csc(x)=  \frac{1}{\sin x}&lt;/math&gt;

==Pythagorean Identities==
*&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x =1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;1+\tan^2(x)=  \sec^2 x \ &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;1+\cot^2(x)=  \csc^2 x \ &lt;/math&gt;

==Double Angle Identities==
*&lt;math&gt;\sin(2 x)=  2\sin x \cos x \ &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\cos(2 x)=  \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x \ &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\tan(2x) = \frac{2 \tan (x)} {1 - \tan^2(x)} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x) = {1 + \cos(2x) \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x) = {1 - \cos(2x) \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;

==Angle Sum Identities==
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \left(x+y\right)=\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \left(x-y\right)=\sin x \cos y - \cos x \sin y&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \left(x+y\right)=\cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \left(x-y\right)=\cos x \cos y + \sin x \sin y&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin x+\sin y=2\sin \left( \frac{x+y}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{x-y}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin x-\sin y=2\cos \left( \frac{x+y}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{x-y}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos x+\cos y=2\cos \left( \frac{x+y}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{x-y}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos x-\cos y=-2\sin \left( \frac{x+y}{2} \right)\sin \left( \frac{x-y}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan x+\tan y=\frac{\sin \left( x+y\right) }{\cos x\cos y}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan x-\tan y=\frac{\sin \left( x-y\right) }{\cos x\cos y}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cot x+\cot y=\frac{\sin \left( x+y\right) }{\sin x\sin y}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cot x-\cot y=\frac{-\sin \left( x-y\right) }{\sin x\sin y}&lt;/math&gt;

==Product-to-sum identities==

      <text xml:space="preserve">More than a decade after the Rio Summit in 1992, the challenge of moving economic development forwards, without compromising the availability of resources for future generations and at the same time protecting the environment  and cultural heritage has become more urgent than ever. 

Appearing on the scene with the publication of Limits to Growth, it was not until the 1987 Brundtland Report, produced by the World Commission on Environment and Development, that '''sustainable development''' entered the political arena. The idea was to identify a “pathway” through which people could create sustainable policies and practices rather than to develop a blueprint for action.

Ever since, the concept of sustainable development (SD) has managed to “stay alive” and has actually created much dispute and discussion. Since its emergence, SD has been widely embraced by government bodies and other influential organizations around the world, yet the actual behaviour of institutions that have claimed devotion to sustainability has been much criticized.

Sustainable development and sustainability have been used differently, but there is no evident consistency of difference. There has been much debate about whether and how the usages have differed or should differ, but these debates are unresolved. There is not even much agreement on which term is broader, or which carries more undesirable baggage. Here, the two terms are synonymous. 

One of the drawbacks of SD as a concept has been the lack of agreement on its definition and guiding principles, although this is probably also a reason why the term has lasted for a long time and has become so widely accepted and debated. However one may choose to define it, '''sustainability stands as a critique'''; it is a challenge to prevailing assumptions, institutions and practices. 

It relates to the basic non-viability of current development trends and practices and, therefore, it implies a need for significant change. Sustainability is indeed a challenge to conventional thinking. It requires the capacity to adapt to constantly changing conditions, as well as the flexibility to work with uncertainty, and with differences in local conditions and in public expectations shaped by culture, values and experience. Above all, it is participatory, ensuring that local communities and individuals have substantive input into designing and implementing development programs and projects.

Sustainability is more than setting up a system of compatible relations among biophysical, social, and economic aspects. It is also a matter of culture and governance. How relations are built with each other, what habits of thought and behaviour we establish and how we go about making decisions are central to sustainability.

It implies considering both the present and future, the incorporation of economic, environmental and social considerations into planning and management, the recognition that our institutions must evolve so that they can deal with the linkages and complexity of the world, the combination of technical and local knowledge systems, and to seek to change underlying values, beliefs and attitudes.

===Transclusion by [[BSD]]===
This page is not a real bookshelf, as it contains no Wikibooks. Instead, it contains external links. I wanted some external links for [[BSD]], which is a submodule of [[Guide to UNIX]], so I transcluded this page. [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 15:14, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

Merge is complete. [[BSD bookshelf]] redirects to [[Guide to UNIX/BSD]]. Its talk page is now at [[Talk:Guide to UNIX/BSD]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:36, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

==ISBN numbers==
I noticed that the OpenBSD 3.8 set is ISBN 0-9731791-6-3 and that wiki makes ISBN hyperlinks. This particular ISBN link seems useless, though. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:36, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

What are hyraxes?

==[[User:Hdavis|Hdavis]] 15:48, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

Small, odd looking, squat little animals that live on rock formations and which are distantly related to the horse and hippopotamus.  They are classed in Class Mammalia, Order Hyracoidea.

&quot;The head looks disproportionately large compared to the body, and the ears look very large.&quot;

I think that &quot;disproportionately&quot; should be changed to looks bigger, or something like that.

John B. Here:  The legs are unusually long and skinny, the neck is unusually long and skinny.  In fact the head looks rather small for a cat that size.  The photo being used does not show off this distinguishing characteristic...that's like a picture of a skunk that doesn't show the white stripe down the back....  I'll have to check and see if I can find a suitable picture of our serval ''Streaker'' to upload.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 17:34, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:Right now our photo sources are either wikipedians' zoo snapshots, U.S. National Fish and Wildlife photos, or from the very very few people who put their safari photos under a free license.  It kinda limits the quality of our illustrations.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 18:04, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

::Yes, you have to remember John that if you upload a file, it can be used by anyone else for basically anything. Just be aware of that. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:16, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:::I am not only aware of that, but educating people is one of the primary reasons I take animal photos.  I won't have any sleepless nights over it.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 20:15, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I do not like this page, it seems sort of repetitive and I am not sure why the focus is on Zen, a particular sect of Buddhism instead of Buddhism in general, and like a quick paragraph long (or more) explanation of the 4 noble truths, or something like that.  It just seems like a misprepresentation or something.  I will try to come back to it myself if noone else does in a couple days, I am sorta busy at the moment

-bob

I'm not sure how to join in the discussion, I'm new to this so pardon any mistakes on my part. I have to agree with Bob on this one. Not only is the text very thin, it also strikes me as rather unrepresentative of Zen Buddhism itself. &quot;Focus on nature and children&quot;? Apart from the fact that the writer has quite obviously missed the point of zen teachings, I find it hard to believe any zen practitioner would subscribe to the ideas presented in the text. Also, shouldn't the different schools of thought be explained? The koans, the importance of zazen, the historical roots of the tradition? The inherent incommunicability of zen? In my opinion this text does not measure up to Wikipedia standards and should be deleted outright.

-Tom

This page seems more like a reference to stoicism than to Zen Buddhism.  I certainly don't see much about Zen philosophy here that would not overlap with stoicism.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Canada is a federal, parliamentary democracy. Canada began life as a British colony, and its parliamentary democracy is based on the model of the United Kingdom. Both countries share a constitutional monarchy and responsible government, in which the powers of the executive are given to the party (or coalition) that has the confidence of the elected house of the legislature. Many other aspects of Canada's public law derive from the United Kingdom.

However, Canada departed from Britain from the outset by being a federal union in which legislative power is divided between a central parliament and provincial legislatures. The division of powers was set out in the British North America Act, now known as the Constitution Act, 1867. Since each level of government's power was limited by the other, the courts reviewed legislation to determine whether it was constitutional, a role they have never played in the United Kingdom.  

In 1982, Canada's constitution was fundamentally reformed by adding a judicially-enforced Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the &quot;Charter&quot;), a guarantee of the rights of Canada's indigenous peoples, and a constitutional amending formula. The Charter has led to important changes to Canada's law and society, as well as to an ongoing debate about the relative role of judges and politicians in determining how Canadians should be governed. 

== What is the Constitution of Canada? ==

Canada's constitution defines itself, or at least it tries to. Section 52 (2) of the Constitution Act, 1982 says:

  The Constitution of Canada includes
  (a) the Canada Act, 1982, including this Act;
  (b) the Acts and orders referred to in the schedule; and
  (c) any amendment to any Act or order referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).

The Canada Act is a reference to the statute of the UK Parliament that ended the British role in amending Canada's constitution. The Constitution Act, 1982 was appended to the Canada Act, and for practical purposes they are the same. Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982 is the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Part II sets out the Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada. Part III is entitled Equalization and Regional Disparities and provides for a non-justiciable commitment to regional equalization. Parts IV and IV.1 provide for constitutional conferences. More importantly, Part V provides a Procedure for Amending the Constitution of Canada. Part VI amended the Constitution Act, 1867, Canada's original constitution. Part VII is General.

The Schedule referred to in paragraph (b) lists 30 historical documents that fill out Canada's written constitution. By far the most important is the first, the Constitution Act, 1867, which continues to be the primary source for the division of sovereignty between the federal and provincial governments. There have been some minor amendments since 1982, but the two major attempts at constitutional change, the Meech Lake Accord and the Charlottetown Accord, resulted in failure. 

For most purposes, therefore, Canada's written constitution consists of the two documents, the Constitution Act, 1867 and the Constitution Act, 1982. However, as section 52 (2) recognizes by the use of the word &quot;includes,&quot; Canada's constitution is not all written. Both the Constitution Act, 1867 and the Constitution Act, 1982 are written against a background of principles inherited from the United Kingdom and not set out explicitly in the text. Some of these unwritten elements are enforceable in court, and others are constitutional conventions, derived from tradition and enforced by the political system.

An example of an unwritten constitutional concept is the office of the prime minister.  While the prime minister of  is the most powerful official in the Canadian government, the Canadian written constitution hardly mentions the existence of a prime minister.  No law says how the prime minister is chosen or what powers he or she exercise. These matters are governed by constitutional convention.

The Supreme Court of Canada summed up the &quot;unwritten constitution&quot; this way:
:The Constitution is more than a written text. It embraces the entire global system of rules and principles which govern the exercise of constitutional authority. A superficial reading of selected provisions of the written constitutional enactment, without more, may be misleading. It is necessary to make a more profound investigation of the underlying principles animating the whole of the Constitution, including the principles of federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law, and respect for minorities. (Re: Secession of Quebec [1998] 2 SCR 217 headnote)

== Federalism ==
Canadian federalism means that the sovereignty of Canada is divided between two levels, or &quot;orders&quot; of government: federal and provincial.  Each province has its own government, and the constitution gives the federal government certain powers and each provincial government certain powers.  The division of powers is listed in [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html#distribution Sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867].  Section 91 lists the powers of the federal government, while section 92 lists the powers of the provincial governments.  

The most important &quot;unwritten&quot; constitutional principle relating to federalism is that Canada has full sovereignty, that is,  Canada can exercise all of the powers of an independent country.  All of Canada's sovereignty can theoretically be exercised by either the federal or provincial governments; there is nothing that one or the other government cannot do.  Another unwritten constitutional principle is that it is up to Canada's courts to decide which government has the power to do what, when the rules are unclear.

== Democracy ==
Reading the &lt;i&gt;Constitution Act, 1867&lt;/i&gt;, the most important Constitutional document until 1982, the impression one would get is that Canada is not a democracy, but a colony ruled directly by a Governor appointed by the Queen of England.  An elected legislature exists, but all of the laws of the legislature must be approved by the Governor and most executive decisions are made by the Governor and his or her Council.

This is because one of the most important constitutional rules of Canada is unwritten.  It is called Responsible Government.  The important aspects of responsible government are:
*  The Governor must appoint his or her Council (aka. &quot;Council of Ministers&quot; or &quot;Cabinet&quot;) from the political party with the most support in the legislature
*  The Governor must choose the leader of the political party with the most support in the legislature as Prime Minister 
*  The Governor must act &quot;on the advice of the Prime Minister&quot; (i.e., the Governor must do whatever the Prime Minister says) or &quot;on the advice of Council&quot; (i.e., the Governor must do as instructed by Cabinet).

Therefore, whichever party wins the election gets the most seats in the legislature.  Their party leader becomes  Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister tells the Governor who to appoint to the Cabinet, and then the Cabinet tells the Governor how to run the country.  In this way, the Governor's position becomes completely ceremonial; sovereignty, which is technically exercised by the Queen through her Governor, is in fact exercised through elected officials.

Responsible government applies equally to provincial governments.  Each province has a ceremonial Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Queen, who acts &quot;on the advice&quot; of the Premier (the provincial equivalent of the Prime Minister) and the provincial Cabinet.

== Constitutionalism and the rule of law ==
Constitutionalism means that the Constitution is supreme.  Statutes passed by legislatures may not violate the constitution; any part of a statute that violates the constitution is null.  The government is not free to disobey the constitutional rules when it suits them, be they written or unwritten.   

The rule of law is a fundamental principle, not only of Canadian constitutional law, but of Canadian life.  The stereotype of Canadians as straight-laced people who want everything done &quot;by the book&quot; suggests how seriously the country takes the rule of law.  The Rule of Law principle is that the government may not act arbitrarily, but must act only according to the authority given them by the law.  The law must, in turn, be valid according to the following criteria:

# It must be validly approved (i.e., passed according to the rules of the legislature and given &quot;Royal Assent&quot; by the Governor)
# It must be consistent with the constitution 
# It must be possible to obey  (this usually means that it cannot conflict with another law,  it must be made public, it cannot be retroactive, etc., although judges sometimes make exceptions to these rules)

== Respect for Minorities ==
This constitutional principle has existed since the beginning of the Canadian legal system, although this has not always led to minorities being respected in practice.  Nowadays, it is a principle that guides courts in interpreting things such as Aboriginal treaties and the place of French speakers in Canada.

== The Royal Prerogative ==
The royal prerogative are the powers given to the crown by the common law. These powers are unique to the crown and have no equivalent power to any one else. In modern times, the royal prerogative has fallen into disuse. The courts have held that there is no longer the prerogative power to legislate or administer justice, and there remains little of this power left. The prerogative exists primarily as a convention and is generally accepted as no longer being enforced by the courts.

The &lt;i&gt;Constitution Act, 1867&lt;/i&gt; was not meant to be a complete constitution for an independent country.  In 1867, the territory of what is now Canada was broken up into several provinces of the British Empire.  The &lt;i&gt;Constitution Act, 1867&lt;/i&gt; was simply a statute passed by the British Parliament to federate several of its provinces.  The relations between the Empire and its Canadian colonies would remain the same:  the Empire would still run Canada's foreign affairs, sign and ratify treaties on its behalf, and declare war in its name.

When Canada became an independent country, the powers that the British Empire exercised on Canada's behalf fell to the federal government.  However, they were not powers that the Canadian Parliament (legislature) inhereited.  Rather, they were powers that the Governor-General inherited.  As stated above, the powers of the Governor-General are in fact exercised by the Prime Minister.  Therefore, decisions on how to run Canada's foreign affairs, to sign and ratify treaties, and declare war are not decisions that the Parliament of Canada make.  Rather, they are made directly by the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

== Constitution Act, 1867 ==
The ''Constitution Act, 1867'' was the product of negotiations between the top officials of four British colonies in North America:  Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.  They were discussing ways to deal with several common problems:  the huge expenses of building rail and canal projects, worsening relations with the United States, and the unworkable political systems that made the colonies hard to govern.  In the end, the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick agreed on a plan to create a federation of four provinces (by dividing the former province of Canada into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec).   They proposed legislation to the Imperial Parliament in London, which passed it.  On July 1, 1867, the &lt;i&gt;British North America Act&lt;/i&gt; came into effect, creating a new British colony, &quot;the Dominion of Canada&quot; (s.3).

The highlights of the &lt;i&gt;British North America Act&lt;/i&gt; (a.k.a. &quot;the BNA Act&quot;) were:

#  A federal system: powers would be shared between a new federal government and a government in each province (s.91 and 92);
#  The federal government would have vast powers in the Canada's most crucial financial and economic areas (currency, all forms of taxation, the debt, banks, interest, the building of interprovincial railways and canals) as well as other areas of &quot;national&quot; concern, such as aboriginals and their lands, and criminal law (s. 91)
# The provincial governments would generally have powers over local matters and areas that affected the common people: property rights, licenses, hospitals, cities, courts, government land; (s. 92)
# The capital of the new country would be Ottawa, on the Quebec-Ontario border; (s.16)
# The federal government would have a House of Commons: an elected legislature with representation from the provinces roughly equal to the size of their population; (s.37-40)
# The federal government would also have a Senate, with 24 representatives each from Ontario and Quebec and 12 representatives each from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the members of which would be chosen by the Governor (in fact, by the Prime Minister of Canada); (s. 21-36)
# The provincial governments would each have one elected legislative assembly; Quebec would also have an appointed Legislative Council; (s.69, 71, 88)
# The federal government could set up a general court of appeal for Canada and other courts for the &quot;better administration of the laws of Canada&quot;, and appoint the judges; (s. 101)
# While the provinces were in charge of courts, the Governor (i.e., Prime Minister of Canada) had the power to appoint the judges to the most important provincial courts. (s.96)

I disagree with the recent change to the representation of the pronunciation of Unilingua &quot;a&quot;.

The previous page had &quot;a in English 'rah!'&quot; which corresponds to /A/ in SAMPA for General American, and /A:/ in British Received Pronunciation.  The revision shows &quot;a in English 'talk'&quot; which is a much lower vowel, /O/ in General American and /O:/ in RP, and comes closer to the pure O sound in Spanish &quot;no&quot; than to A.

In my dialect of American English (Southern California mixed with Great Lakes), there is a clear distinction between &quot;a&quot; in &quot;father&quot; and &quot;aw&quot; in &quot;awful&quot;.  The recent change specifies the latter as the general Unilingua A, but this is not usually perceived as a &quot;pure&quot; or general-purpose A sound.

Remember that as an auxiliary language, Unilingua is subject to many different interpretations of its vowel sounds, and to a lesser extent its consonants.  The page itself points out that &quot;r&quot; and &quot;j&quot; will have varying pronunciations depending on the origin of speakers.

I believe it is best to specify vowels that will hold up as distinct when a variety of regional accents is applied to them.  That means replacing &quot;talk&quot; with &quot;father&quot; or some other comparatively &quot;neutral A&quot; word on the Unilingua page.

To a much lesser extent, I am also concerned about the change from &quot;u in Spanish 'tu'&quot; to &quot;u in English 'flu'&quot;, since there are some English speakers who pre-yodify the vowel in &quot;flu&quot; so it sounds like &quot;flyoo.&quot;  However, I also understand the potential for confusion between Spanish &quot;tu&quot; and French &quot;tu&quot;; the latter is definitely not a generalized U sound!  Perhaps English speakers who already pre-yodify U will have to adjust their pronunciation to accommodate Unilingua pre- and post-yodification (I have to do something similar to cope with a minimal-pair distinction between words like cin &quot;picture&quot; and ciyn &quot;mark&quot;).

== Lots of inconsistencies. ==

===You guys should re-read carefully your entire book.===
I've found some inconsistencies in your book. Things that just don't
match, or disprove previously said statements. Some phrases and expressions you
present here are merely word by word translation of their English counterparts.
The greeting (cu baka) is probably influenced by the Russian &quot;Zdravstvuite&quot;
(which virtually means the same as Unilinguian &quot;cu baka&quot; - be healthy). Same goes
for some other inherently cultural expressions. Word &quot;mir&quot; in Russian means world,
just like in Unilingua, and some words that derive from ber resemble Russian
words with similar meanings.
===The slogan on your main page (Glojo mir ebdayo zey yacana dayen) is also wrong.===
Language according to your word families is ''dad''. Why do you use ''dayen''?
I didn't find a word that anyway cognates with it, though it looks similar to ''daer''.
Is it meant to be noun derived from daer in instrumental case? Why not ''dadey'' (dad+ey)?
To complicate things even further, in some languages adjectives should be inflected
with same grammatical case as the noun they describe, is it so in Unilingua?
''You should specify that.''
I'm not sure if preposition ''zey'' (through, across) is appropriate in this specific
expression, although it seems to be an instrumental preposition. Neither am I sure about
its necessity (you've got cases, why use preposition?). I'd say your slogan should sound:
''Glojo mir ebdayo yacana dadey'' (or yacanaey dadey).
In language with cases it is a good idea to present a table of prepositions sorted
by cases. This way you may know what is the correct perposition to use in every grammatical case.
===You need to make it all more consistent.===
Revise it and rethink it. Rethink the idea of
dropping original graphemes that English lacks (I know what pain can it be to write it,
but one may produce keyboard layout for it, or a script that would reformat the yodification).
All the yodification you use may be misleading, and may complicate the fresh students of
this language. It has created complications for me. And I speak fluently three languages:
Russian, Hebrew and English. They are of different linguistic groups, scripts,
morphosintactic typology and have only a very small common vocabulary (mostly of somewhat
religious words like halleluia and amen, and technical terms that derive from Latin).
Even for me, with my knowledge of such diverse languages it was difficult to get used to
the fact that things written like yoy, uy etc, are a single phoneme. As more phonemes have
corresponding graphemes so better.

===Now, guys you may curse me and spit on me for the critics I write, but...===
Believe me I write it to help and not to annoy. I see the original author's idea as  the idea of the language of thought.
It won't be a language of thought if its spoken version is merely translation of words of
some other language. It should use its own grammar and logics of expressions.
Greeting word could be anything depending on your culture. In many cultures the word
or expression used like that looses with time its original meaning. You should think about it carefully.
The greeting could be some word that would mean ''glad to initiate conversation''. In Unilingua
it could be a combined in to a single word that has f, j, and d consonants (I guess).
I want  Unilingua to stay logical language.

===P.S.===
Are there any other sources on-line except this one for this language?
Did you know that there is NO wikipedia article about Unilingua and Noubar Agapoff?!

{{navigation|Book=Topology
|current=Connectedness
|previous=Separation Axioms
|next=Path Connectedness}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Motivation==
{{TOC right}}
To best describe what is a [[w:Connected_space|connected space]], we shall describe first what is a disconnected space. 
A disconnected space is a space that can be separated into two disjoint groups, or more formally:

A space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''disconnected''' [[w:iff|iff]] a pair of [[w:Disjoint_sets|disjoint]], non-empty ''open'' subsets &lt;math&gt;X_1, X_2&lt;/math&gt; exists, such that &lt;math&gt; X = X_1 \cup X_2&lt;/math&gt;.

A space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that is not disconnected is said to be a [[w:Connected_space|connected space]].

===Examples===
#A closed interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is connected. To show this, suppose that it was disconnected. Then there are two nonempty disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; whose union is &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be the the set equal to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and which does not contain &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;s=\sup X&lt;/math&gt;. Since X does not contain b, s must be within the interval [a,b] and thus must be within either X or &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\setminus X&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an open set &lt;math&gt;(s-\varepsilon,s+\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is not within &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\setminus X&lt;/math&gt;, which is also open, and there is an open set &lt;math&gt;(s-\varepsilon,s+\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\setminus X&lt;/math&gt;. Either case implies that &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is not the supremum. 
#The topological space &lt;math&gt;X = (0,1)\setminus\{{\frac{1}{2} } \}&lt;/math&gt; is disconnected: &lt;math&gt;A = (0,\frac{1}{2} ), B = (\frac{1}{2}, 1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A picture to illustrate:&lt;br /&gt;[[Image:Disconnected-segment.png|The logo for this Wiki]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, the definition of a connected space is quite intuitive; when the space cannot be separated into (at least) two distinct subspaces.

==Definitions==

Definition 1.1

A subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''clopen''' if it is both closed and open.

Definition 1.2

A topological space X is said to be totally disconnected if every subset of X having more than one point is disconnected under the subspace topology

==Theorems about connectedness==
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are homeomorphic spaces and if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is connected, then &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is also connected.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Proof''':&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be connected, and let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a homeomorphism. Assume that &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is disconnected. Then there exists two nonempty disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_2&lt;/math&gt; whose union is &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(Y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(Y_2)&lt;/math&gt; are open. As &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is surjective, they are nonempty and they are disjoint since &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_2&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(Y_1) \cup f^{-1}(Y_2)=f^{-1}(Y)=X&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the fact that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is connected. Thus, &lt;math&gt;Y=f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is connected.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note: this shows that connectedness is a topological property.&lt;/small&gt;

If two connected sets have a nonempty intersection, then their union is connected.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Proof''':&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be two non-disjoint, connected sets. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be non-empty open sets such that &lt;math&gt;X\cup Y=A\cup B&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a_0\in A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; Without loss of generality, assume &lt;math&gt;a_0\in X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; 

As &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is connected, &lt;math&gt;a\in X\forall a\in A&lt;/math&gt; ...(1).&lt;br /&gt; 

As &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, &lt;math&gt;\exists b\in B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;b\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; 

Hence, similarly, &lt;math&gt;b\in Y\forall b\in B&lt;/math&gt; ...(2)&lt;br /&gt; Now, consider &lt;math&gt;c\in A\cap B&lt;/math&gt;. From (1) and (2), &lt;math&gt;c\in X\cap Y&lt;/math&gt;, and hence &lt;math&gt;X\cap Y\neq\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary, &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is connected.

If two topological spaces are connected, then their product space is also connected.''&lt;br /&gt;

'''Proof:'''&lt;br /&gt; Let X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be two connected spaces. Suppose that there are two nonempty open disjoint sets A and B whose union is X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If for every x∈X, {x}×X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is either completely within A or within B, then π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(A) and π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(B) are also open, and are thus disjoint and nonempty, whose union is X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, contradicting the fact that X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is connected. Thus, there is an x∈X such that {x}×X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains elements of both A and B. Then π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(A∩{(x,y)}) and π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(B∩{(x,y)}), where y is any element of X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are nonempty disjoint sets whose union is X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and which are are a union of open sets in {(x,y)} (by the definition of product topology), and are thus open. This implies that X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is disconnected, a contradiction. Thus, X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is connected.

==Exercises==
#Show that a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is disconnected if and only if it has clopen sets other than &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (Hint: Why is &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; clopen?)
#Prove that if &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous and surjective (not necessarily homeomorphic), and if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is connected, then &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is connected.
#Prove the '''Intermediate Value Theorem''': if &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, then for any &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;c\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(c)=y&lt;/math&gt;.
#Prove that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is not homeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; (hint: removing a single point from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; makes it disconnected).
#Prove that an uncountable set given the countable complement topology is connected (this space is what mathematicians call 'hyperconnected')
#a)Prove that the discrete topology on a set X is totally disconnected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Does the converse of a) hold (Hint: Even if the subspace topology on a subset of X is the discrete topology, this need not imply that the set has the discrete topology)

Neurophysiology historically began with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvani Luigi Galvani] in 1791 when he published the monograph &quot;De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius&quot; (Commentary on the Effect of Electricity on Muscular Motion).  This monograph suggested an inherent electricity exists within the living tissue. 

The study of nervous system electrophysiology can occur at many different levels including:  1) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography Electroencephalography (EEG)] 2) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_field_potentials Local Field Potentials] 3) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_ensemble neuron populations] and 4) the electrical activity

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Definition==
{{TOC right}}
A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''path connected''' if for any two points &lt;math&gt;x_0, x_1\in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f:[0,1]\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(0)=x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(1)=x_1&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
#All convex sets in a vector space are connected because one could just use the segment connecting them, which is &lt;math&gt;f(t)=t\vec{a}+(1-t)\vec{b}&lt;/math&gt;.
#The unit square defined by the vertices &lt;math&gt;[0,0], [1,0], [0,1], [1,1]&lt;/math&gt; is path connected.  Given two points &lt;math&gt;(a_0, b_0), (a_1,b_1)\in [0,1]\times[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; the points are connected by the function &lt;math&gt;f(t)=[(1-t)a_0+ta_1,(1-t)b_0+tb_1]&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The preceding example works in any convex space (it is in fact almost the definition of a convex space).

==Adjoining Paths==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space and let &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Consider two continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f_1,f_2:[0,1]\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_1(0)=a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_1(1)=b=f_2(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2(1)=c&lt;/math&gt;. Then the function defined by

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} f_1(2x) &amp; \text{if } x \in [0,\frac{1}{2}]\\ f_2(2x-1) &amp; \text{if } x \in [\frac{1}{2},1]\\  \end{array} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

Is a continuous path from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, a path from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and a path from &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; can be adjoined together to form a path from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Relation to Connectedness==

Each path connected space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is also connected. This can be seen as follows:

Assume that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not connected. Then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the disjoint union of two open sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\in B&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a path &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;f:[0,1]\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function with &lt;math&gt;f(0)=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(1)=b&lt;/math&gt;. But then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint open sets in &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, covering the unit interval. This contradicts the fact that the unit interval is connected.

==Exercises==
#Prove that the set &lt;math&gt;A=\{(x,f(x))|x\in\mathbb{R}\}\subset\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0 &amp; \text{if } x \leq 0\\ \sin(\frac{1}{x}) &amp; \text{if } x &gt; 0\\  \end{array} \right.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; is connected but not path connected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===A white object on a white object===

In Old Masters paintings, a white plate is quite distinct from the tablecloth on which it rests. Obviously, the eye perceives very clear and distinct differences between the two. But what are they? Painting a white object resting on a white object is an extreme exercise to train your eye to see the myriad colors that reflect off white objects.

&lt;div style=&quot;width: 66%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16pt;&quot;&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/span&gt;

I'm Romke van der Meulen ([[User talk:Redge|Talk]]), a long time contributor and short time operator of wiki´s.

I have a lot of wiki user pages, so I don't update them all very regularly. To see the latest version, check my [http://wiki.redge.nl/index.php?title=User:Redge homepage].

I'm also a archivist at [http://www.memory-alpha.org Memory Alpha], the Star trek wiki, and a big cheese at the [http://www.memory-alpha.org/nl/index.php/Hoofdpagina MA Dutch edition]. We need followers to contribute to our knowledge pool and worship us. If you are Dutch, check it out. If you are not, check it out anyway. It rocks! I also founded [http://pagan.wikicities.com WikiPagan], which goes out to all you pagans out there. Drop in any time!

If at any point while reading this text you feel like giving up, don't! I'm far to interesting.

I live in the Netherlands, and in my free time I mainly concern myself with Philosophy, Science, Religion, Esoterism and the Occult,  SF and Fantasy Literature. Since I've descovered Wiki's I have shunned daylight and commited my very essence to creating and perfecting articles.

I believe in alien abduction, mass conspiracies and the number [[wikipedia:47_(number)|47]].

I like to think of myself as a Renaissance man, schooled in science, culture and philosofy. Today's society demands of this generation to specialise in one subject and never explore anything else again, lest it be a small hobby. I could go on at this subject for hours, but let's not go there.

I'm 19. I study AI (that's Artificial Intelligence for everyone who hasn't watched that appaling movie) at the Rijks Universiteit Groningen. One day, I will be the worlds greatest writer, architect, physisist, chemist, mathematician, philosofer, componer, rocketscientist, psychologist, surgeon, etc..

I listen to the voices in my head.

The idea behind the trigonometric substitution is quite simple: to replace expressions involving square roots with expressions that involve standard trigonometric functions, but ''no square roots''.  Integrals involving trigonometric functions are often easier to solve than integrals involving square roots.

Let us demonstrate this idea in practice.  Consider the expression &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Probably the most basic trigonometric identity is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin^2(\theta)+\cos^2(\theta)=1&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary angle &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\theta&lt;/math&gt;. If we replace &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt; in this expression by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, with the help of this trigonometric identity we see
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-x^2}=\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}=\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}=\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that we could write &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\theta=\arcsin(x)&lt;/math&gt; since we replaced &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin^2(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

We would like to mention that technically one should write the
absolute value of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, in other words
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle|\cos(\theta)|&lt;/math&gt; as our final answer since
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sqrt{A^2}=|A|&lt;/math&gt; for all possible &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle A&lt;/math&gt;.  But as
long as we are careful about the domain of all possible &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt; and how
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is used in the final computation, omitting the absolute value signs does not constitute a problem.  However, we cannot directly interchange the simple expression
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; with the complicated
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; wherever it may appear, we must remember when integrating by substitution we need to take the derivative into account.  That is we need to remember that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle dx=\cos(\theta)\,d\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and to get a integral that only involves &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\theta&lt;/math&gt; we need to also replace &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle dx&lt;/math&gt; by something in terms of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle d\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, if we see an
integral of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\int\sqrt{1-x^2}dx&lt;/math&gt;
we can rewrite it as
:&lt;math&gt;\int\cos(\theta) \cos\theta\,d\theta=\int\cos^2 \theta \,d\theta.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice in the expression on the left that the first &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt; comes from replacing the &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos\theta\,d\theta&lt;/math&gt; comes from substituting for the &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle dx&lt;/math&gt;.  

Since &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos^2(\theta)=\tfrac{1}{2}(1+\cos(2\theta))&lt;/math&gt; our original integral reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}\int d\theta +\tfrac{1}{2}\int\cos(2\theta)d\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

These last two integrals are easily handled.  For the first integral we get
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}\int\,d\theta=\tfrac{1}{2}\theta&lt;/math&gt;

For the second integral we do a substitution, namely &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle u=2\theta&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle du=2d\theta&lt;/math&gt;) to get:

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}\int\cos(2\theta)d\theta=\tfrac{1}{2}\int\cos u\,\tfrac{1}{2}du=\tfrac{1}{4}\sin u=\tfrac{1}{4}\sin(2\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Finally we see that: 
:&lt;math&gt;\int\cos^2 \theta \,d\theta=\tfrac{1}{2}\theta + \tfrac{1}{4}\sin(2\theta)=\tfrac{1}{2}\theta + \tfrac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

However, this is in terms of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\theta&lt;/math&gt; and not in terms of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt;, so we must substitute back in order to rewrite the answer in terms of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt;.

That is we worked out that: 
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta)=x\qquad \cos(\theta)=\sqrt{1-x^2}\qquad \text{and }\theta=\arcsin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

So we arrive at our final answer
:&lt;math&gt;\int\sqrt{1-x^2}dx=\tfrac{1}{2}\arcsin(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}x\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

As you can see, even for a fairly harmless looking integral this technique can involve quite a lot of calculation.  Often it is helpful to see if a simpler method will suffice before turning to trigonometric substitution.  On the other hand, frequently in the case of integrands involving square roots, this is the most tractable way to solve the problem.  We begin with giving some rules of thumb to help you decide which trigonometric substitutions might be helpful.

If the integrand contains a single factor of one of the forms &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2-x^2} \mbox{ or } \sqrt{a^2+x^2} \mbox{ or } \sqrt{x^2-a^2}&lt;/math&gt; we can try a trigonometric substitution.

*If the integrand contains &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;x = a \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt; and use the [[Calculus/Table_of_Trigonometry|identity]] &lt;math&gt;1-\sin^2 \theta = \cos^2 \theta.&lt;/math&gt;
*If the integrand contains &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+x^2}&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;x = a \tan \theta&lt;/math&gt; and use the identity &lt;math&gt;1+\tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta.&lt;/math&gt;
*If the integrand contains &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2-a^2}&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;x = a \sec \theta&lt;/math&gt; and use the identity &lt;math&gt;\sec^2 \theta-1 = \tan^2 \theta.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sine substitution===
[[Image:Trig_Sub_Triangle_1.png|frame|right|273px|This substitution is easily derived from a triangle, using the [[w:Pythagorean_Theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]].]]

If the integrand contains a piece of the form  &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{a^2-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; we use the substitution

:&lt;math&gt;x=a\sin \theta \quad dx=a \cos \theta d\theta&lt;/math&gt;

This will transform the integrand to a trigonometric function. If the new integrand can't be integrated on sight then the tan-half-angle substitution described below will generally transform it into a more tractable algebraic integrand.

E.g., if the integrand is &amp;radic;(1-''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int_0^1 \sqrt{1-x^2} dx 
&amp; = &amp; \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1-\sin^2 \theta} \cos \theta \, d\theta \\
&amp; = &amp; \int_0^{\pi/2}  \cos^2 \theta \, d\theta \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\pi/2}  1+ \cos 2\theta \, d\theta \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{\pi}{4} 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the integrand is &amp;radic;(1+x)/&amp;radic;(1-x), we can rewrite it as

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1+x}{1-x}} = \sqrt{\frac{1+x}{1+x}\frac{1+x}{1-x}}
=\frac{1+x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Then we can make the substitution

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int_0^a \frac{1+x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx
&amp; = &amp; \int_0^\alpha \frac{1+\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \cos \theta \, d\theta
&amp; 0 &lt;a &lt; 1 \\
&amp; = &amp; \int_0^\alpha 1+ \sin \theta \, d\theta &amp; \alpha = \sin^{-1} a \\
&amp; = &amp; \alpha + \left[ - \cos \theta \right]_0^\alpha &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; \alpha + 1 - \cos \alpha &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; 1+ \sin^{-1} a - \sqrt{1-a^2} &amp; \\  
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Tangent substitution===
[[Image:Trig_Sub_Triangle_2.png|frame|right|273px|This substitution is easily derived from a triangle, using the [[w:Pythagorean_Theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]].]]

When the integrand contains a piece of the form
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
we use the substitution
:&lt;math&gt; x = a \tan \theta \quad \sqrt{x^2+a^2} = a \sec \theta \quad 
dx = a \sec^2 \theta d\theta &lt;/math&gt;

E.g., if the integrand is (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;-3/2&lt;/sup&gt;
then on making this substitution we find

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int_0^z \left( x^2+a^2 \right)^{-\frac{3}{2}}dx &amp; = &amp; 
a^{-2} \int_0^\alpha \cos \theta \, d\theta &amp; z&gt;0 \\
&amp; = &amp; a^{-2} \left[ \sin \theta \right]_0^\alpha &amp; \alpha = \tan^{-1} (z/a) \\
&amp; = &amp; a^{-2} \sin \alpha &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; a^{-2} \frac{z/a}{\sqrt{1+z^2/a^2}} 
&amp; = \frac{1}{a^2} \frac{z}{\sqrt{a^2+z^2}} \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the integral is

:&lt;math&gt;I= \int_0^z \sqrt{x^2+a^2} \quad z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

then on making this substitution we find

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
I &amp; = &amp; a^2 \int_0^\alpha \sec^3 \theta \, d\theta 
&amp; &amp; &amp; \alpha = \tan^{-1} (z/a) \\
&amp; = &amp; a^2 \int_0^\alpha \sec \theta \, d\tan \theta &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; a^2 [ \sec \theta \tan \theta ]_0^\alpha &amp; - &amp; 
a^2 \int_0^\alpha \sec \theta \tan^2 \theta \, d\theta &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; a^2 \sec \alpha \tan \alpha &amp; - 
&amp; a^2 \int_0^\alpha \sec^3 \theta \, d\theta &amp; +
a^2 \int_0^\alpha \sec \theta \, d\theta \\
&amp; = &amp; a^2 \sec \alpha \tan \alpha &amp; -
&amp; I &amp; + a^2 \int_0^\alpha \sec \theta \, d\theta \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

After integrating by parts, and using trigonometric identities, we've ended up with an expression involving the original integral. In cases like this we must now rearrange the equation so that the original integral is on one side only

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
I &amp; =  &amp; \frac{1}{2}a^2 \sec \alpha \tan \alpha &amp; 
+ &amp; \frac{1}{2}a^2 \int_0^\alpha \sec \theta \, d\theta \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}a^2 \sec \alpha \tan \alpha &amp; 
+ &amp;  \frac{1}{2}a^2 \left[ \ln \left( \sec \theta 
+ \tan \theta \right) \right]_0^\alpha \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}a^2 \sec \alpha \tan \alpha &amp; 
+ &amp;  \frac{1}{2}a^2 \ln \left( \sec \alpha  + \tan \alpha \right) \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}a^2 \left( \sqrt{1+\frac{z^2}{a^2}} \right) \frac{z}{a} &amp; 
+ &amp; \frac{1}{2}a^2 \ln \left( \sqrt{1+\frac{z^2}{a^2}}+\frac{z}{a} \right) \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}z\sqrt{z^2+a^2} &amp; 
+ &amp; \frac{1}{2}a^2 \ln \left(\frac{z}{a} + \sqrt{1+\frac{z^2}{a^2}} \right) \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

As we would expect from the integrand, this is approximately ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 for large ''z''.

In some cases it is possible to do trigonometric substitution in cases when there is no &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\ \ \ }&lt;/math&gt; appearing in the integral.  

'''Example'''
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x^2+1}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator of this function is equal to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle(\sqrt{1+x^2})^2&lt;/math&gt;.  This suggests that we try to substitute &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=\tan u\,&lt;/math&gt; and use the identity &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1 + \tan^2 u =\sec^2 u\,&lt;/math&gt;.  With this substitution, we obtain that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle dx= \sec^2 u\, du&lt;/math&gt; and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x^2+1}\,dx=\int\frac{1}{\tan^2 u+1} \sec^2 u\,du&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=\int\frac{1}{\sec^2 u} \sec^2 u\,du&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\int\,du&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=u + c&lt;/math&gt;
Using the initial substitution
&lt;math&gt;u=\arctan x&lt;/math&gt;
gives 

:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x^2+1}\,dx = \arctan x + C&lt;/math&gt;

===Secant substitution===
[[Image:Trig_Sub_Triangle_3.png|frame|right|273px|This substitution is easily derived from a triangle, using the [[w:Pythagorean_Theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]].]]

If the integrand contains a factor of the form  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sqrt{x^2-a^2}&lt;/math&gt; we use the substitution

:&lt;math&gt;x = a \sec \theta \quad dx = a \sec \theta \tan \theta d\theta \quad
\sqrt{x^2-a^2} = a \tan \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 1 ====
Find &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\int_1^z \frac{\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}dx.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int_1^z \frac{\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x}dx &amp; = &amp; 
\int_1^\alpha \frac{\tan \theta }{\sec \theta }\sec \theta \tan \theta \,d\theta &amp; z&gt;1 \\
&amp; =  &amp; \int_0^\alpha \tan^2 \theta \, d\theta &amp; \alpha = \sec^{-1} z \\
&amp; = &amp; \left[ \tan \theta  -\theta \right]_0^\alpha &amp; 
\tan \alpha = \sqrt{\sec^2 \alpha -1} \\
&amp; =&amp; \tan \alpha  -\alpha &amp; \tan \alpha = \sqrt{z^2-1} \\
&amp; =&amp; \sqrt{z^2-1} - \sec^{-1} z &amp; \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 2 ====
Find &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\int_1^z \frac{\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x^2} dx.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int_1^z \frac{\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x^2}dx &amp; = &amp; 
\int_1^\alpha \frac{\tan \theta}{\sec^2 \theta}\sec \theta \tan \theta \, d\theta &amp;
z&gt;1 \\
&amp; =  &amp; \int_0^\alpha \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\cos \theta} d\theta &amp; 
\alpha = \sec^{-1} z \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We can now integrate by parts

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int_1^z \frac{\sqrt{x^2-1}}{x^2}dx &amp; = &amp; 
-\left[ \tan \theta \cos \theta \right]_0^\alpha 
+ \int_0^\alpha \sec \theta \, d\theta \\ 
&amp; = &amp; -\sin \alpha  +\left[ \ln (\sec \theta + \tan \theta ) \right]_0^\alpha \\
&amp; = &amp; \ln (\sec \alpha + \tan \alpha ) - \sin \alpha \\
&amp; = &amp; \ln (z+ \sqrt{z^2-1} ) - \frac{\sqrt{z^2-1}}{z}\\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Introduction==
This section deals with the wave nature of vibrations constrained to one dimension.  Examples of this type of wave motion are found in objects such a pipes and tubes with a small diameter (no transverse motion of fluid) or in a string stretched on a musical instrument.

Stretched strings can be used to produce sound (e.g. music instruments like guitars).
The stretched string constitutes a mechanical system that will be studied in this chapter. Later, the characteristics of this system will be used to help to understand by analogies acoustical systems.

== What is a wave equation? ==
There are various types of waves (i.e. electromagnetic, mechanical, etc.) that act all around us. It is important to use wave equations to describe the time-space behavior of the variables of interest in such waves. Wave equations solve the fundamental equations of motion in a way that eliminates all variables but one. Waves can propagate longitudinal or parallel to the propagation direction or perpendicular (transverse) to the direction of propagation. To visualize the motion of such waves click [http://www.kettering.edu/~drussell/Demos/waves/wavemotion.html here] (Acoustics animations provided by Dr. Dan Russell,Kettering University)

== One dimensional Case ==
Assumptions :

- the string is uniform in size and density

- stiffness of string is negligible for small deformations

- effects of gravity neglected

- no dissipative forces like frictions

- string deforms in a plane

- motion of the string can be described by using one single spatial coordinate


Spatial representation of the string in vibration:

[[Image:1Dwave graph1.png|300px]]

The following is the free-body diagram of a string in motion in a spatial coordinate system:

[[Image:string dwg.jpg]]

From the diagram above, it can be observed that the tensions in each side of the string will be the same as follows:

[[Image:equations1.jpg]]

Using Taylor series to expand we obtain:

[[Image:equations2.jpg]]

== Characterization of the mechanical system ==
A one dimensional wave can be described by the following equation (called the wave equation):


&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \right)=\left( \frac{1}{c^2} \right)\left( \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


where,


&lt;math&gt;y(x,t)= f(\xi)+g(\eta)\,&lt;/math&gt; is a solution,


With  &lt;math&gt;\xi=ct-x\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta=ct+x\,&lt;/math&gt; 

This is the D'Alambert solution, for more information see: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Time-Domain_Solutions]

Another way to solve this equation is the Method of separation of variables. This is useful for modal analysis. This assumes the solution is of the form: 

&lt;math&gt; y(x,t)= f(x)g(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; 


The result is the same as above, but in a form that is more convenient for modal analysis.

For more information on this approach see:
Eric W. Weisstein et al. &quot;Separation of Variables.&quot; From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SeparationofVariables.html]


Please see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Boundary_Conditions_and_Forced_Vibrations Wave Properties] for information on variable c, along with other important properties.

Example with the function &lt;math&gt;f(\xi)&lt;/math&gt; :

Blended learning within early childhood education is an interesting   concept; ''how can a student who lacks the ability to read and write be part of a virtual community?''
 
While many of the children at the primary level lack the ability to read, incorporating technology enhanced learning is still a reality. Teachers can enhance an existing curriculum, improve communication with the school community and devise forums which reinforce &amp; enrich the early childhood education. Even though adaptations must occur in order for e-learning to be successful with young children, primary students &quot;should not be excluded from the virtual learning world simply because of their age and developmental levels&quot; (Scott; 2003).

When the topic of blended learning arises people often think of students meeting within a classroom setting and then continue the learning experience online in the comfort of their home. However within primary classrooms, blended learning can be more comparable to technology integration; serving the class environment as a teaching aide. Since many primary classrooms now have a technology center which can include anywhere from one to half a dozen computers e-learning is becoming a reality. While this is not the true definition of blended learning, this type of face-to-face instruction followed by independent activities based on individual student needs is the building blocks for higher level blended learning. 


'''Blended Education: Application Examples'''

''Curriculum''

An overview of the primary classroom sees children learning to read, beginning to add, and exploring numerous topics for the first time. Most classrooms are brimming with children, lacking an aide and overloaded with information. By investigating each subject within a primary classroom, teachers can envision how blended learning can be a real part of early childhood education. 

Incorporation of technology into the primary classroom can be as a simple as bringing the students to a website which better illustrates a story explored in class. For example, if a class reads &quot;Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?&quot; written by Bill Martin, Jr. to further extend upon the story a primary teacher may set a website such as Animal Vocabulary on a computer in the technology center. 

Language arts within a primary classroom can be enhanced with a learning community such as The Monster Exchange. This website has the children collaborating with children all over the United States and beyond to work on descriptive writing. Children draw a picture of a monster and write a description of the creature in class, the teacher inputs the picture and description into the website. Classrooms connect with another class, read one anothers' descriptions, and then try to recreate the original monster. Pictures are set up side by side in the Monster Gallery for comparison. Children can access the monster website at home and work collaborately with their families.

A primary teacher knows all too well that purchasing enough math manipulatives for the whole class can be quite expensive and often not a reality for every school. Technology and blended learning offer a solution. If an educator works with his/her class on a lesson about patterns, he/she can direct students to practice the lesson on Virtual Library of Math Manipulatives. To begin this lesson the teacher would explore patterns in numerous ways using varying sets of manipulatives to illustrate patterns; however when it comes to having a set of coins or buttons for each student this might not be a feasible. Solution: if a teacher uses this website within a lab setting in which all the students are using a computer, children can play with patterns independently, make mistakes, ask questions and the best part no buttons, coins or colored bears to clean up.

Often time history is neglected because the basic skills often take top priority in the primary classroom. Using e-learning is a great way to further explore topics such as history. One very interactive website explores George Washington. During the month a February a 3rd grade teacher, for example, can set this website up as a favorite within her computer center. Each child can be required to view the site and make a comment in the notebook next to the computer. Those comments can later be shared as a class.  

Since science resources are so abundant online, we can look at blended learning from a different angle. A second grade class designed this Space Website. After learning about space in class, the children worked within groups to develop a virtual learning area made for children in primary grades. The students and teacher took what they knew, blended it into technology and now other students can benefit. 

''Communication''

Blended communication could be the most successful form for the new generation of parents. Quite often information relayed to a primary student quite often does not make it to the ears of a parent. Besides traditional classroom visits, parent/teacher conferences and telephone calls, many teachers of all students are realizing that reaching parents through emails, websites and discussion boards are more fruitful in contacting parents. Designing an online community where teachers can post and explain information about their teaching methods can help clarify classroom procedures. With the same regard, parents can ask questions, review announcements, and become an active part of the classroom through a virtual environment. Searching within Yahoo groups, numerous groups can be discovered which join parents and education groups. “Some schools are exploring the use of video conferencing and 'streamed' (stored for viewing at home) videos to promote parent understanding and involvement in student learning&quot; (Starr, 2005). 

This blended communication is even opening up a place for parent input to class learning. Teachers can design questions through online questionnaires from places like SurveyKey. Educators can ask parents about issues with in the class, specific needs and concerns. As parents respond, a teacher can make adjusts and improvements. Once again this is extremely important within younger students, as they often have a difficult time expressing experiences which they may have in class. 

''Reinforcement &amp; Enrichment''

Teachers at every level grapple with the difficulty of addressing the needs of each child within a classroom, however this challenge is extremely prevalent within the early childhood classroom as students are exploring the building blocks of education. This challenge can be aided with blended learning. 

Studies have been surfacing for years that foreign language instruction should begin at the elementary level instead of postponing that learning until high school, however due to budgetary concerns, foreign language classes seem like a frill (Walker, 2004). By teaching another language to young children, we give them the greatest chance to fully absorb a second language. If an elementary school does not offer a foreign language classes, teachers and parents can still expose primary students to another language through technology. From simple websites which vocalize the French Alphabet to websites which allow the students to progress through activities to learn Spanish.

Within primary grades a child many times needs extra practice. The web has the amazing ability to give kids extra help in a way different from group classroom instruction, maybe in a form in which a child learns better. For example, if a teacher has introduced new letter sounds and she/he notices a student is struggling, the student can either use the computer center to practice or a Phonics website address can be send home for parents to use as practice. 

'''Adaptations for Blended Learning in Early Childhood Education'''

One major concern for young children on the Internet is safety. While students within upper grades understand the seriousness of broadcasting their personal information, often younger students are ignorant to that fact. In order to protect the identity of students, it is recommended that students work as a group. Since group work is quite prevalent within a primary classroom, it is very realistic that young children work as a group within a virtual learning environment, collaborating on answers to contribute. Students can work as a face-to-face group in the classroom, develop an answer and post the response within their virtual environment. Working as a group also alleviates the need to post responses using full names, pictures and other personal information, instead the children post as, for example, ''The Green Group''.

The design of a virtual community needs to be adapted for the younger set.  Since the literacy development varies greatly within grades K-2, sites should use pictures and common shapes to navigate through the information. As streaming video and digital voice technologies improve and are becoming more common site participation becomes more user friendly for those with limited reading skills. Responses within an online learning environment need to be configured with developmental needs in mind. Answers may need to be multiple choice or give the contributor the ability to &quot;draw&quot; an answer.

Sites which are made specifically for online classes such as Moodle or other course management systems are not appropriate for the early childhood environment because &quot;younger students may not have the study skills, reading abilities and self-discipline to fare well without a class to go to&quot;(Russo, 2001). That does not mean they need to be excluded from the virtual community, we just need to think of these years as their preparation for becoming part of a '''Brave New World''' of teaching.</text>

'''Starting Out With Blended Learning'''

As students become more confident of their technology skills in grades 3-6, and access to technology at home increases, the opportunities for blended learning experiences broaden.  Web-based resources can provide more indepth information on academic topics, support slow learners, and enrich high achievers.  Communication between home and school can be vastly improved by utilizing the web to improve the learning experience.

One simple way to begin using technology with students in 3rd through 6th grade is through an asynchronous communication such as the use of e-mail. There are numerous ways in which e-mail can be helpful in the classroom setting. Using e-mail as part of a blended learning experience can enhance a face-to-face discussion and allow students to further explore their learning. Many students already have a home e-mail account which they use to communicate with their friends or family, and by the age of 10, students are mature enough to learn how to use email.  Teachers can make themselves available to students and parents through email, to answer questions on specific topics and to discuss classroom topics.  Students can stay in touch with the teacher if they are absent.  

Another popular use of e-mail is keypals, in which students are matched up with students from other schools and participate in an exchange of information and ideas.  Keypals help the students see themselves as part of worldwide learning community, and learn about other cultures and ways of life.  Another use of email is to adopt a grandparent.  More and more senior citizens are becoming technology savvy, and would love to exchange information with students.  There are some safety measures that teachers need to set forth if adopting a grandparent.  Full student names, addresses, and phone numbers should not be given out at any time.  This is to ensure the safety of the students in today's world.

Instant Message (IM) is a synchronous form of communication that can be started in the middle grades.  IM allows instantaneous feedback from teachers or students.  Students can ask questions of other students or the teacher about an assignment or participate in a discussion with a teacher or classmate about concepts or topics being covered in class.  IM does have some drawbacks.  Students can send inappropriate messages or pictures to other students or teachers, so it is important that students are instructed on acceptable use.  Restricted accounts, which many parents use for their children, might block the use of instant messaging.

'''Improving Home-School Communication'''

Getting parents involved in their child's education is key to academic success.  Teachers can publish web pages linked to the school website to provide a multitude of information for parents.  Teachers can provide a weekly agenda of what's going on in class, they can provide detail of homework assignments, permission slips for field trips, and much more, to be available to parents trying to stay on top of their child's education.  Many teachers use blogs for this purpose, which might be a simpler way to get information online immediately.  Teachers can also link to websites that enhance or expand on topics covered in class.

There is no doubt that technology can improve parent-teacher communication.  Through the use of Edline or classroom websites, parents can stay more involved in what their student is doing in the class and also how they are doing in the class.  If a parent can quickly view what their child has to do or see an area where they need assistance, it can make for easy communication with the teacher about what needs to be done.  For success to be evident, there must be good communication between the parents and the teachers.  --Nick Hartz  

'''Curriculum Connections'''

Many online activities are available for 3rd through 6th grade students that provide extra practice on classroom topics, or expand and enrich learning.  Teachers can link to these sites so they are available to students outside of school.  Across the curriculum the web offers resources that engage students in the learning process, and will actually make them want to spend additional time outside of school on learning.

It is important when planning a blended learning lesson within the primary grades to focus on a unit of study, then intertwine it with technology. The educators at San Diego State University have designed a tool to aide teachers in their preparation.

For teachers looking to integrate science experimentation into their middle grades' curriculum, a wonderful interactive site is [http://pbskids.org/zoom/games/kitchenchemistry/index.html Zoom Kitchen Chemistry].  Here, students can conduct virtual experiments to learn about real-life chemical reactions, or find out about real science experiments they can do at home with items found in their own kitchens.  This site is wonderful for extending classroom learning using technology.  If the class is studying space and the solar system, an excellent resource for young astronomers is [http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/ Star Child].  Here students can find information about space topics, utilize simulations and a glossary of space terms.

One method of blended learning in math is to have students practice their math facts online.  This provides the opportunity for students to spend extra time practicing if needed.  At [http://oswego.org/ocsd-web/games/mathmagician/maths1.html Math Magician] students can have fun interactively while working on math facts, all operations, and two levels are available, so more advanced students can progress at their own pace through more challenging material.  If the teachers seeks ways of using manipulatives to teach math, a wonderful site that utilizes java applets so students can have a hands-on experience is [http://nlvm.usu.edu/en/nav/vlibrary.html The National Library of Virtual Manipulatives].

A great source for students to work on their reading skills is [http://www.readingmatrix.com/directory/pages/ The Reading Matrix].  There are numerous reading activities ranging from vocabulary, comprehension, to proofreading, and short stories.  Many of these sites provide an online quiz for the students to take.  Teachers can find good sites on this page by looking at the ratings that it has received.

Students can have a blast at [http://www.nationalgeographic.com/kids/ National Geographic for Kids].  Students will spend hours going through the website which contains, quizzes, games, cartoons, and excellent information.  This site is great for any social studies buff, or anyone that wants to have fun while doing research on the web.  This site will have students talking about social studies for the entire quarter. 

Everyone wants to create their own music that they can listen to.  The website [http://www.creatingmusic.com Creating Music] (which requires Java) allows students to create their own musical sketch pad and then listen to what they have designed.  Students can learn about beat, tempo, and rhythm while enjoying being the composer of music. This is a great site for elementary students to learn about music and to get them interested without having to pick up a single instrument.  

'''Virtual Field Trips'''
Field trips are a large part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher would love to take her students places to which a bus trip is not an option. Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class. Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect a on a trip and share experiences with future classes. For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the [http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/9305/frame.html State Capital], each year the website gets remodeled, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.  

'''Video Conferencing''' 

How about a field trip without even leaving the room?  With the creation of video conferencing this is made possible to all students and teachers to further enhance their students learning and enthusiasm.  Students love to take field trips and they love to go on the computer, now teachers can have the best of both worlds.  Here are some sites that encompass a virtual field trip.

[http://www.adventuresci.com/fieldtrip/distance/Adventure Science Center] is a great site for science educators who want to have their students learn first hand about the human body, space, dinosaurs, and eyes.  For this field trip a fee of $150.00 is required for a 45-minute tour.  This might not be feasible for schools who are on a very small budget.  They do provide a 25 minute project for about $100.00.  

Ever want to receive video feeds from underwater?  [http://www.arii.org/Main/Main1.htm The Aquatic Research Interactive Site] does just that.  Science teachers can have students watch video streams from underwater for numeous topics.  This site has been designed for teachers and students to better understand concepts below the Earth's surface.  Not a science teacher?  Math, history, and physics teachers can also benefit from this site as well.  There is one major drawback to this site, the fee.  A whopping $195.00 fee for the use of the video clips are required.

Teacher's Pet?  That might be what students will be talking about after a trip to [http://www.bronxzoo.com/bz-education/distancelearning/ The Bronx Zoo].  This two way interactive site is designed for the elementary students to learn more about an animal's behavior.  How about having a lion in your class?  This site allows a class to have them and you don't have to worry about students with allergies or a student being attacked.  This site is sure to have your students talking for a long while. This fieldtrip is $125.00 for a maximum for 35 students.

'''Conclusion:'''
Can blended learning work in grades 3-6?  That depends on the teacher, tech support, students, and administration.  Lisa Abate understands that a blended learning classroom will require more work.  She mentioned that she spent a lot of her time &quot;troublehooting studet problems (such as lost passwords).&quot; (Abate, 2004)  Essentially, doesn't education come down to &quot;are students learning?&quot;  If students log on to a website long after they are finished woith their assignment to further enrich their studies have teachers accomplished their goals?  Is the time worth the satisfaction a student gets by learning more than have to?  In Lisa's beta test of her math classroom she found that students were spending more time than needed on specific activities. (Abate, 2004) This is a teacher's dream come true, students spending more time than is required on assignments.</text>

== Blended Learning Grades 7 - 8 ==

As students mature and can handle learning without constant teacher attention, online applications may become more effective for teaching some curriculum. After teachers and students feel comfortable with e-mail and webpage design, they can dig further into the realm of blended learning by accessing some excellent websites. All of these sites are designed to help the learner better understand a topic. These are just a few good examples of websites; there are numerous other sites available.

'''[http://www.aaamath.com/mea.html Triple A Math]''' 
This site is great for K-8 math teachers because of its content. Students can read the explanation of each measurement, play some challenge games, and some interactive practices. Students will have endless hours of fun checking out this site.

'''[http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/exhibit/interactives/spain/launchWin.htm Seattle Art Museum]''' (Science, Social Studies)  
This site is for the &quot;explorer&quot; learner. Students can learn about navigation techniques used in the Age of Exploration. The site includes a video clip of how to use an octant. This was very cool to see in addition to learning about the navigation used today.

'''[http://www.handsontheland.org/home.cfm Hands On the Land]'''
Imagine collecting water samples, monitoring the ground ozone levels, and more on this environmental website. The site provides interaction with other schools, students, and the forest preserve as students are engaged while learning about the environment. There are even lesson plans for teachers to further enhance the students learning.

'''[http://www.biopoint.com/online_gallery/Welcome.html BioPoint]'''
This is an online site for teacher created webquests. They are listed by grade level and have everything you need to deliver a unit.

'''[http://www.barkingspiderspoetry.com/ Barking Spiders Poetry]'''
Barking Spiders is a site devoted to poems for children. Students can design their own poems online by filling in the blanks. There are mazes that can be completed and poems to be read.

'''[http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/educators/index.html]'''
The Smithsonian is known world-wide for its magnificent collections.  Since not every class can take a trip to these free museums, the Smithsonian has made it easy for every class to access the collections and activities to go with them online.  Teachers can search for lessons by state standard quickly and easily.  Teachers can also check out resources that can be sent to their classrooms.

'''Social Science'''
Some teachers are more comfortable with enhancing their class through projects. A sample of one would be a project developed by Kate Purl at Urbana Middle School. The year was ended with a seventh grade project on Africa. Each student had to research an area of Africa, learning specifics about the area such as flora and fauna. The information they found was then added to a website. Once all the areas of Africa were added, the adventure began. As teams, the students had to traverse the African continent. The information that the students provided was combined into a webquest that was a toss up between &quot;Where in the World is Carmen San Diego?&quot; and &quot;The Oregon Trail.&quot; Decisions made as you traveled the trail could lead to success or failure as an African explorer. The site is still available at: [http://www.usd116.org/ums/africaweb/index.html Africa:  Choose Your Own Adventure].

Other successful online adventures for Middle School students might be [http://www.usd116.org/ums/projects/AncientCiv/ Virtual Ancient Civilizations] which is a work in progress: 

'''Numerous Subjects'''
[http://quizhub.com/quiz/quizhub.cfm Quiz Hub.] What can't you do at this site? The site is loaded with news quizzes, online maps, chess games, concentration games and much more. Your students will never want to leave the site. This will have them engaged for hours upon hours. There is even an art area where you can design whatever you want. This was my favorite link!!

'''Benefits for Students'''
Research shows that students who are involved in online learning during the middle school years are more likely to keep their academic grades higher than those who are not exposed to online learning (Belanger, 2005).  Additionally, the attendance rate of students using computers is higher along with the ability of students to do well in group situations and within project-based instruction.
Blended learning is also research based in that it pulls from research done by Piaget, Vygotsky, Bloom Keller and Gery.  Using online education for middle schools students is a viable way of enhancing the curriculum by providing live events such as online homework help.  This could come from the teacher, or it could be from other students in a cooperative learning environment.
Blended learning also gives the students a chance to move at their own pace.  What one student may be able to learn quickly another may need more time to digest and understand.  In blended learning, students moves at their own pace and they have the availability of a teacher when questions arise.
There is also a collaborative element to blended learning.  If a student does not understand part of an assignment, there are other students available to ask questions.  Students can use a chat room, IM or e-mail to work together to complete a project.
Along with the curriculum, testing can also take place online.  This would allow students to take assessments when they feel they are ready.  It would also allow for quick feedback from those assessments so that students know where they stand with respect to their grade.
Lastly, when students use the web for learning there is a wealth of materials available to them at the click of a mouse.  Dictionaries, encyclopedias and research are just some of the information that students can access during their learning experience.
These five ingredients to blended learning are important for the students to have the best possible educational experience.  It allows them to remain anonymous so that their mistakes are not broadcast throughout the classroom, giving them self confidence.  It is a way to allow students to take control of their own learning experience. 

'''The Down Side'''
As with every advance in technology, blended learning can have it's faults also. While online courses have been available for several years to the post secondary student, use of online technology is generally thought of as an enhancement for the secondary schools. Schools are using computers more than ever before with an increase from 60% in 1993 to 84% in 2001 and home use of computers growing during the same time from 25% of students to 66% (NCES, pg 1). Schools might use computers more if computers were available in each classroom. Many schools don't have that luxury and, instead, must move students to a central computer lab to make use of the technology available. This creates more work for teachers and takes away from instructional time.
Most will also admit that it is the teacher, and her comfort with technology, that affects how well that technology is presented in the classroom.  In his book, “Oversold and Underused,” Larry Cuban states that computers are not successful because teachers who use computers for instruction do so infrequently and unimaginatively (Harvard University Press, 2001).

'''Taking Technology Further'''
Some students, for various reasons, need to work at their own pace. While distance learning got it's start at the post secondary level, it is slowly gaining momentum at the middle and high school level. Students who are gifted, challenged or have health reasons and do not do well in a traditional learning environment now have the opportunity to complete their education online. Several schools are now in operation that offer aid to these students. Some worth looking at are:

'''Teacher Controlled Blended Learning'''
As with any level of  education, there are some teachers who prefer to have control over what their students are doing online. Instead of accessing one of the above websites or a WebQuest, these teachers choose to develop their own curriculum for their students.  This curriculum needs to be well thought out before anything is ever put online. New South Wales Department of Education and Training has some guiding questions that teachers should ask themselves before they begin to design a web-enhanced course.  They first suggest that you know WHY you are trying to place information online for your students.  Once you are sure that what you are looking for is not already online, then it is time to understand the goals that you have for you students regarding the online content: Do you want them to learn to work independently?  Or do you want to free up your time to work with those students who need the extra help?
The other suggestions include teaching your students slowly, showing them step by step what you expect from them.  However, the ultimate suggestion was that if a teacher were to be interested in providing web-enhanced learning for their class, they should have had the experience of online learning themselves (NSWDE, 2005).</text>

Today's high school student often has the maturity and technical expertise necessary to participate in e-learning experiences.  However, students of this age frequently require the support of a teacher in a classroom.  Blended learning combines the best of both worlds for high school students: the fluidity of using Internet resources and the reassurance of face-to-face experiences. It extends learning beyond the classroom, and expands the breadth of courses offerings, while providing the personal support and encouragement from a teacher still necessary for many students. The following paragraphs describe the effectiveness of blended learning, how to successfully achieve blended learning in a high school environment, and provide specific examples for teachers.

== Research on Effectiveness of Blended Learning ==

High school students are often motivated by online learning, and often have the maturity and self-discipline to work independently and succeed in online coursework.  &quot;Evidence overwhelmingly shows that ALN [Asynchronous Learning Networks] are at least as effective as classroom learning&quot; (Hilz et al., 2004). Much of the evidence of online learning success, however, relates to college and graduate level students who demonstrate a better completion rate than younger learners.  Some high schools have found that providing hybrid courses, or blended learning experiences that provide more face-to-face support to students have better completion rates.  One example is the Mannheim Township Virtual High School in Pennsylvania.  While receiving many accolades for their success with individual students participating in their online learning courses, the dropout rate hovered around 25%.  The program was uniquely revamped to address this issue.  &quot;The solution was a hybrid online and traditional course model that has resulted in a 99% completion rate (Oblender, 2002).

The weaknesses of online courses are addressed by hybrid, or blended learning courses.  Blended learning provides more structured time for student work while still allowing students the opportunity to proceed at their own pace.  Teachers are available to monitor progress and provide encouragement and support to students who may lag behind.  Blended learning courses provide physical resources that are not available in courses that are presented completely online, including language, technology and science labs (Oblender, 2002).

Blended learning also provides many benefits not available in traditional classrooms.  The need for textbooks is diminished.  Material presented is timely and relevant, and student progress is self-paced.  The students' learning environment is extended to organizations, people and facilities not available in the classroom.  Students who participate in blended learning gain advanced technological competencies (Oblender, 2002).

Distinct advantages exist for at-risk students when exposed to blended learning, particularly synchronous activities.  Joining a &quot;cyber-study group&quot; results in higher performance for these students compared to students who study alone.  &quot;Peer-to-peer interactions needed for collaboration promote a collective sense of responsibility . . . students who have low self-efficacy or an external locus of control receive feedback and encouragement from their study partners.&quot;  Also the presence of the instructor is more frequent, and results in more meaningful dialogue between teachers and students (Newlin, ''et al.'', 2002).


== Getting Started with Blended Learning ==

For teachers just getting started in blended learning, the simplest approach may be to choose websites that expand on what is being taught in class, and/or provide extra practice for specific skills.  In this scenario, the greatest proportion of the learning experience involves face-to-face learning, with a less significant web component.  High school teachers who are looking to add a web component should start simple.  The purpose is to expand on and clarify topics covered in class, and provide opportunities for students to extend the learning experience beyond the confines of the classroom.  Some examples:

Foreign language students can utilize [http://www.mylanguageexchange.com My Language Exchange].  At this website, a student can locate a student learning his language who is a native speaker of the language he is learning.  Together, the two students can participate in practice sessions using lesson plans, text and voice chat rooms, a dictionary, a private notepad, etc.

Math students can utilize online simulations of math concepts at [http://nlvm.usu.edu/en/nav/vlibrary.html The National Library of Virtual Manipulatives].  Simulations are available in Numbers and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, Measurement, Data Analysis, and Probability.  Using these manipulatives can provide a better understanding of math concepts, and well as practice in various areas.

English students can extend their learning of the writing process beyond the walls of the classroom by using [http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/GRAMMAR/composition/composition.htm Principles of Composition]. This site contains a full high school composition course with interactive lessons and practice.  

Students of American history can expand and develop their knowledge and understanding of major events in the history of our country by using  [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html The American Memory Collection] published and maintained by the Library of Congress. Another good source is to use some of the interactive sites provided by National Geographic. The Underground Railroad trip is especially good for upper elementary and jr. high students. It forces them to think and make decisions while explaining what the underground railroad is. 

Enriching science students through technology is made possible by the wide array of interactive resources available on the web.  Students can conduct an in depth and interactive study of Biology at [http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/sci_edu/biosites.html Interactive Biology].  Chemistry students can expand on textbook information with information and animations on periodic table elements by using [http://www.chemsoc.org/viselements/pages/periodic_table.html The Visual Elements Periodic Table].  Students of physics can enrich the learning experience by spending time at [http://www.physicsclassroom.com/ The Physics Classroom].

== Moving Forward:  Incorporating Synchronous Web Components Into the High School Class ==

As teachers and students gain confidence in the incorporation of blended learning, they can discover numerous web components available to enhance the learning experience for students.  Live synchronous experiences are good examples.  These include video conferencing, instant messaging, chat rooms, and virtual classroom modules.

Video conferencing serves a variety of purposes.  Most video conferencing options are not free, but available for an hourly fee, or through a subscription service. Students can benefit from the expertise of specialists in various areas and can participate in virtual field trips.  Students living in remote areas can benefit from resources and people only available in more populated areas.  The [http://www.albanyinstitute.org/resources/distlearning.htm Albany Institute of History and Art] offers numerous &quot;virtual field trips&quot; for high school students.  Students are active participants as they join in real time with the Institute's historians, examining artifacts and collaborating with experts. History students can interact with holocaust survivors via video-conferencing through [http://www.holocaust-nassau.org/teleconferencing.htm The Holocaust Memorial and Educational Center] in New York.  These are just a few of numerous video conferencing options available across the curriculum.

Video conferencing has purposeful academic applications in language courses, but some controversy exists over whether these needs can be addressed via asynchronous video.  CUSeeMe was the grandfather of two-way video conferencing.  Successors include NetMeeting, PalTalk and iVisit.  Live Video conferencing has its drawbacks, however.  Many schools lack the bandwidth necessary for effective and problem-free two-way conferencing (Godwin-Jones, 2003).

Instant messaging, discussion boards and chat rooms provide a means for remediation and consultation for students outside the school day.  &quot;Communication tools like discussion boards and chat rooms can be effective in inter-team collaboration as well as in faculty-student communication&quot; (Eastman, ''et al.'', 2002).  Students can become motivated in directing their own learning.  Through these synchronous activities, students become empowered, can develop better communications skills, and develop their ability to work cooperatively.  Students who are more timid in a face-to-face environment often gain confidence in online discussions.  Teachers frequently become more accessible to students through these types of synchronous activities (Eastman, ''et al.'', 2002).  Traditional text chats can now be enhanced with voice and/or video.  &quot;Apple recently announced multimedia enhancements of its iChat application, along with introducing the new iSight camera&quot; (Godwin-Jones).

== Use of Asynchronous Web Components in Secondary Education ==

Blogging, which began as an online journal several years ago has escalated to &quot;several hundred thousand diarists . . . actively posting blogs about almost every conceivable topic.&quot;  Blogs provide an instant, online writing space with the potential for an audience of thousands; free and instant publishing.  Teachers will find that the &quot;presence of an audience can increase engagement and a depth of writing&quot; (Bull, 2003).  &quot;Blogs also help students exchange ideas much like a group of students waxing poetic at a . . . coffeehouse.  Blog sites often prominently display the e-mail addresses of [their] creators, letting readers instantly provide feedback to the site&quot; (Toto, 2004).  Blogging has numerous instructional applications in high school. Literary activities using blogs include character journals, character roundtable, think-aloud postings, and literature circle group responses.  Revision and grammar activities include nutshelling (extracting a line from a paragraph that holds the most meaning), devil's advocate writing (online debate), and exploding sentences (slowing down a student from an earlier post and adding rich, descriptive detail).  At Hunderdon Central Regional High School in Flemington, New Jersey, students use a blog to discuss &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot; by Sue Monk Kidd in an American Literature Class (Bull, 2003). 

Blogs can also help improve student writing.  While students often begin their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.  Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.  Also blogging &quot;forces students to become more savvy about the world around them.&quot;   The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).  Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.  Appropriate use of blogs &quot;can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).

Course management systems provide a mode of presentation and organization for blended learning.  Moodle is a good example.  Moodle was design to &quot;provide a set of tools that support an inquiry- and discovery-based approach to online learning&quot; (Brandl, 2005).  Being available free of charge, it also has good financial benefits for school districts, as opposed to commercial course management systems.  Teachers using moodle are able to provide a virtual classroom round the clock.  &quot;Moodle has great potential for supporting conventional classroom instruction, for example, to do additional work outside of class, to become the delivery system for blended course formats (Brandl, 2005).  It is based on socio-constructivist theory, promoting cooperation among and between students and teachers.  It provides for both synchronous and asynchronous discussion through a chat option and threaded discussion.  &quot;At the core of the concept of an asynchronous learning network is the student as an active—and socially interactive—learner&quot; (Hilz et al., 2004).

== Pulling It All Together:  The Teacher's Perspective ==
The goal of blended learning is to use technology as a tool for learning and to promote a discovery-based approach to online learning.  It is also intended to help students become &quot;anytime, anywhere&quot; lifelong learners.  Keeping abreast of the technology is a challenge for teachers as well.  The teacher needs to participate in ongoing professional development, read the latest research, and share ideas with other teachers.  Teachers must actively seek out and utilize individuals that can act as mentors and technical support providers in their quest for effective blended learning techniques.  If teachers must be lifelong learners themselves in order to promote lifelong learning among their students -- they must lead by example.

== The Role of Blended Learning in the Future of High School Education == 

While teachers grapple with the challenges of staying up-to-date on new technologies, students being educated in this technological era are confident in their use of technology.  New teachers enter the workplace well-equipped to face the technological challenges that await.  As access to technological resources improves for all students and the digital divide narrows, high schools find themselves better able to implement blended learning.  In the near future, high school learning will no longer be limited the length of the school day or the confines of the school building.  Resources will be available for all students to learn anywhere, anytime.  

Across the country, high schools are already making this vision a reality.  One example is the Urban School in San Francisco, which has incorporated a 1:1 student laptop program.  Foreign language courses have been improved with the use of voice files to improve listening and speaking skills.  History students contribute meaningfully beyond the confines of the classroom and school to the broader community beyond by providing web-based election materials to the local community and producing an award-winning website that contains oral histories of area holocaust survivors.  Math and science simulations are available for extra practice and enrichment to students when and where they need it, and language arts students participate in online literature circles, generating “more thoughtful and meaningful responses” than would typically be expected in a traditional classroom discussion (Levin).


== Summary ==

The benefits for students abound in blended learning.  Teachers have the opportunity to individualize instruction at all levels and for all students.  Extra help is available to students who need it, and enrichment opportunities can be provided for students who move at a faster pace than the rest of the class.  Teacher availability extends beyond the confines of the school day and the school building.  Learning opportunities are expanded for all students.  Students become actively engaged, and are well-prepared for the technological workplace that will be theirs.  Collaboration is encouraged, and students have the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse and worldwide student body.  Curriculum connections can be made which encourage higher level thinking (Morehead et al., 2004).  Great potential exists for both students and teachers, and the future of blended learning is significant.
What of the questions that would seem to need to be addressed is the availability of the technology to allow for blended learning. It would seem that wealthier districts would have a significant advantage in the resources available to them. Many poorer districts have poor student to computer ratios or do not have the ability to make computers available to classroom students on a regular basis.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is highly unsatisfactory to explain its topic![[User:130.89.219.179|130.89.219.179]] 23:21, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

The example &quot;Is The Machine Working Correctly?&quot; is seriously flawed. A quick inspection of the data shows that the standard deviation is nowhere near the 0.05 value quoted. The z test does not take into account the sample standard deviation since it assumes that the standard deviation of the population is known. Which test can be used to determine the likelihood of getting this sample standard deviation?

== sample size for non-normal populations ==

The n=30 rule is over-simplistic. The answer really depends on whether there are outliers and/or skewness in the population distribution. With a symmetric, but non-normal distribution, n values smaller than 30 will suffice. With even moderate skewness, n&gt;30 will be necessary. With outliers, n may have to be hundreds or even thousands before the CLT has converged sufficiently.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Similar to a cone wrench, a headset wrench is a thinner than usual open ended wrench and is used to adjust the cone or cup and locknut in a threaded headset.  Common sizes range from 30mm to 36mm.  In general two headset wrenches are used in parallel to tighten the locknut against the cup or cone.

== Floating Point Numbers == 

This page will talk about how '''floating point''' numbers are used in assembly language constructs. This page will not talk about new constructs, it will not explain what the FPU instructions do, how floating point numbers are stored or manipulated, or the differences in floating-point data representations. However, this page will demonstrate briefly how floating-point numbers are used in code and data structures that we have already considered.

The x86 architecture does not have any registers specifically for floating point numbers, but it does have a special stack for them. The floating point stack is built directly into the processor, and has access speeds similar to those of ordinary registers. Notice that the FPU stack is not the same as the regular system stack.

== Calling Conventions ==

With the addition of the floating-point stack, there is an entirely new dimension for passing parameters and returning values. We will examine our calling conventions here, and see how they are affected by the presence of floating-point numbers. These are the functions that we will be assembling, using both GCC, and cl.exe:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 __cdecl double MyFunction1(double x, double y, float z)
 {
 	return (x + 1.0) * (y + 2.0) * (z + 3.0);
 }
 
 __fastcall double MyFunction2(double x, double y, float z)
 {
 	return (x + 1.0) * (y + 2.0) * (z + 3.0);
 }
 
 __stdcall double MyFunction3(double x, double y, float z)
 {
 	return (x + 1.0) * (y + 2.0) * (z + 3.0);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

Our first question is this: are the parameters passed on the stack, or on the floating-point register stack, or some place different entirely? Key to this question, and to this function is a knowledge of what '''fld''' and '''fstp''' do. fld (Floating-point Load) pushes a floating point value onto the FPU stack, while fstp (Floating-Point Store and Pop) moves a floating point value from ST0 to the specified location, and then pops the value from ST0 off the stack entirely. Remember that '''double''' values in cl.exe are treated as 8-byte storage locations (QWORD), while floats are only stored as 4-byte quantities (DWORD). It is also important to remember that floating point numbers are not stored in a human-readable form in memory, even if the reader has a solid knowledge of binary. Remember, these aren't integers. Unfortunately, the exact format of floating point numbers is well beyond the scope of this chapter.

x is offset +8, y is offset +16, and z is offset +24 from ebp. Therefore, z is pushed first, x is pushed last, and the parameters are passed right-to-left on the ''regular stack'' not the floating point stack. To understand how a value is returned however, we need to understand what '''fmulp''' does. fmulp is the &quot;Floating-Point Multiply and Pop&quot; instruction. It performs the instructions:

 ST1 := ST1 * ST0
 FPU POP ST0

This multiplies ST(1) and ST(0) and stores the result in ST(1). Then, ST(0) is marked empty and stack pointer is incremented. Thus, contents of ST(1) are on the top of the stack. So the top 2 values are multiplied together, and the result is stored on the top of the stack. Therefore, in our instruction above, &quot;fmulp ST(1), ST(0)&quot;, which is also the last instruction of the function, we can see that the last result is stored in ST0. Therefore, floating point parameters are passed on the regular stack, but floating point results are passed on the FPU stack.

One final note is that MyFunction2 cleans its own stack, as referenced by the '''ret 20''' command at the end of the listing. Because none of the parameters were passed in registers, this function appears to be exactly what we would expect an STDCALL function would look like: parameters passed on the stack from right-to-left, and the function cleans its own stack. We will see below that this is actually a correct assumption.

For comparison, here is the GCC listing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 LC1:
 	.long	0
 	.long	1073741824
 	.align 8
 LC2:
 	.long	0
 	.long	1074266112
 .globl _MyFunction1
 	.def	_MyFunction1;	.scl	2;	.type	32;	.endef
 _MyFunction1:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	subl	$16, %esp
 	fldl	8(%ebp)
 	fstpl	-8(%ebp)
 	fldl	16(%ebp)
 	fstpl	-16(%ebp)
 	fldl	-8(%ebp)
 	fld1
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fldl	-16(%ebp)
 	fldl	LC1
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fmulp	%st, %st(1)
 	flds	24(%ebp)
 	fldl	LC2
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fmulp	%st, %st(1)
 	leave
 	ret
 	.align 8
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a very difficult listing, so we will step through it (albeit quickly). 16 bytes of extra space is allocated on the stack. Then, using a combination of fldl and fstpl instructions, the first 2 parameters are moved from offsets +8 and +16, to offsets -8 and -16 from ebp. Seems like a waste of time, but remember, optimizations are off. '''fld1''' loads the floating point value 1.0 onto the FPU stack. '''faddp''' then adds the top of the stack (1.0), to the value in ST1 ([ebp - 8], originally [ebp + 8]).

=== FASTCALL ===

Here is the cl.exe listing for MyFunction2:

&lt;/source&gt;

We can see that this function is taking 20 bytes worth of parameters, because of the @20 decoration at the end of the function name. This makes sense, because the function is taking two '''double''' parameters (8 bytes each), and one '''float''' parameter (4 bytes each). This is a grand total of 20 bytes. We can notice at a first glance, without having to actually analyze or understand any of the code, that there is only one register being accessed here: '''ebp'''. This seems strange, considering that FASTCALL passes its regular 32-bit arguments in registers. However, that is not the case here: all the floating-point parameters (even z, which is a 32-bit float) are passed on the stack. We know this, because by looking at the code, there is no other place where the parameters could be coming from. 

Notice also that '''fmulp''' is the last instruction performed again, as it was in the CDECL example. We can infer then, without investigating too deeply, that the result is passed at the top of the floating-point stack.

Notice also that x (offset [ebp + 8]), y (offset [ebp + 16]) and z (offset [ebp + 24]) are pushed in reverse order: z is first, x is last. This means that floating point parameters are passed in right-to-left order, on the stack. This is exactly the same as CDECL code, although only because we are using floating-point values.

Here is the GCC assembly listing for MyFunction2:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 	.align 8
 LC5:
 	.long	0
 	.long	1073741824
 	.align 8
 LC6:
 	.long	0
 	.long	1074266112
 .globl @MyFunction2@20
 	.def	@MyFunction2@20;	.scl	2;	.type	32;	.endef
 @MyFunction2@20:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	subl	$16, %esp
 	fldl	8(%ebp)
 	fstpl	-8(%ebp)
 	fldl	16(%ebp)
 	fstpl	-16(%ebp)
 	fldl	-8(%ebp)
 	fld1
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fldl	-16(%ebp)
 	fldl	LC5
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fmulp	%st, %st(1)
 	flds	24(%ebp)
 	fldl	LC6
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fmulp	%st, %st(1)
 	leave
 	ret	$20
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a tricky piece of code, but luckily we don't need to read it very close to find what we are looking for. First off, notice that no other registers are accessed besides '''ebp'''. Again, GCC passes all floating point values (even the 32-bit float, z) on the stack. Also, the floating point result value is passed on the top of the floating point stack. 

We can see again that GCC is doing something strange at the beginning, taking the values on the stack from [ebp + 8] and [ebp + 16], and moving them to locations [ebp - 8] and [ebp - 16], respectively. Immediately after being moved, these values are loaded onto the floating point stack and arithmetic is performed. z isn't loaded till later, and isn't ever moved to [ebp - 24], despite the pattern.

LC5 and LC6 are constant values, that most likely represent floating point values (because the numbers themselves, 1073741824 and 1074266112 don't make any sense in the context of our example functions. Notice though that both LC5 and LC6 contain two '''.long''' data items, for a total of 8 bytes of storage? They are therefore most definitely '''double''' values.

=== STDCALL ===

Here is the cl.exe listing for MyFunction3:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;

 _MyFunction3@20 ENDP
 _TEXT	ENDS
 END
&lt;/source&gt;

x is the highest on the stack, and z is the lowest, therefore these parameters are passed from right-to-left. We can tell this because x has the smallest offset (offset [ebp + 8]), while z has the largest offset (offset [ebp + 24]). We see also from the final fmulp instruction that the return value is passed on the FPU stack. This function also cleans the stack itself, as noticed by the call '''ret 20''. It is cleaning exactly 20 bytes off the stack which is, incidentally, the total amount that we passed to begin with. We can also notice that the implementation of this function looks exactly like the FASTCALL version of this function. This is true because FASTCALL only passes DWORD-sized parameters in registers, and floating point numbers do not qualify. This means that our assumption above was correct.

Here is the GCC listing for MyFunction3:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 	.align 8
 LC9:
 	.long	0
 	.long	1073741824
 	.align 8
 LC10:
 	.long	0
 	.long	1074266112
 .globl @MyFunction3@20
 	.def	@MyFunction3@20;	.scl	2;	.type	32;	.endef
 @MyFunction3@20:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	subl	$16, %esp
 	fldl	8(%ebp)
 	fstpl	-8(%ebp)
 	fldl	16(%ebp)
 	fstpl	-16(%ebp)
 	fldl	-8(%ebp)
 	fld1
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fldl	-16(%ebp)
 	fldl	LC9
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fmulp	%st, %st(1)
 	flds	24(%ebp)
 	fldl	LC10
 	faddp	%st, %st(1)
 	fmulp	%st, %st(1)
 	leave
 	ret	$20
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we can also see, after all the opening nonsense, that [ebp - 8] (originally [ebp + 8]) is value x, and that [ebp - 24] (originally [ebp - 24]) is value z. These parameters are therefore passed right-to-left. Also, we can deduce from the final fmulp instruction that the result is passed in ST0. Again, the STDCALL function cleans its own stack, as we would expect.

=== Conclusions ===

Floating point values are passed as parameters on the stack, and are passed on the FPU stack as results. Floating point values do not get put into the general-purpose integer registers (eax, ebx, etc...), so FASTCALL functions that only have floating point parameters collapse into STDCALL functions instead. '''double''' values are 8-bytes wide, and therefore will take up 8-bytes on the stack. '''float''' values however, are only 4-bytes wide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Unix shell}}
The ''shell prompt'' (or ''command line'') is where one types commands. When accessing the system through a text-based terminal, the shell is the main way of accessing programs and doing work on the system. In effect, it is a shell surrounding all other programs being run. When accessing the system through a graphical environment such as X11, it remains possible to open a terminal emulator and do useful work with the shell.

This chapter describes how to find a shell prompt and start using it.

{{TODO|todonote=Find places to introduce pagers, pipes, redirects, and some basic file managing commands. These might be separate chapters under [[../]].}}

==Finding a shell prompt==
People get shell prompts in different ways, such as:
*They use a graphical environment (such as Aqua, GNOME, or KDE) and a terminal emulator.
*They do not use GUI, but simply use TTY device; sometimes also use GUI and get to a TTY device with Ctrl+Alt+F[number] (most GNU/Linux systems allow 1-6 for [NUMBER]&lt;!--What about for BSDS?--&gt;). To get back to The X Window System, use Ctrl+Alt+F[number 1 higher than the number of TTY devices].

===Using the TTY device===
Unix systems can use TTY devices for a shell. The first line looks like
 login:

Type your username at this prompt, then type your password. This gives a shell.

===Opening a terminal emulator===
A '''terminal emulator''' (or console emulator) is a program that emulates the terminal hardware that early users traditionally used to login to Unix. It appears as a window in the graphical environment and allows access to the shell prompt.

There are several ways to open a terminal emulator:
*With The X Window System, try '''xterm'''. Most setups either start you with an xterm or two when you login, or provide a menu from which you can start an xterm.
**KDE provides a '''Terminal Program (Konsole)'''. You can find it in the K Menu &gt; System menu. If you right click on an empty part of your icon panel, you can Add an Application Button for the terminal.
**GNOME provides a terminal emulator somewhere in the '''Programs''' menu.
**LXDE provides the terminal emulator LXTerminal (at least in the Lubuntu distro). It can be found in the Accesories submenu of the launch menu, usually situated in the lower left corner of your desktop.
**Using Enlightenment 17, right click on the desktop, then go to Enlightenment&gt;Eterm. 
*On Mac OS X, use &lt;tt&gt;/Applications/Utilities/Terminal&lt;/tt&gt;. That is, go to the Applications folder on your hard disk, and to the Utilities folder inside it, and double-click the icon for the Terminal program. You may want to keep the Terminal icon on your Dock.
Most terminal emulators, like other graphical programs, provide a menu bar to configure the terminal. For example, they allow you to change the font and colors; some people prefer white text on a black background. xterm is more difficult to configure; its menus can be found by holding the Control key and clicking with each of the three mouse buttons.

===Using SSH to access a remote shell===
The '''ssh''' program is a secure way to connect to a shell account on a remote server. The server must be running the '''sshd''' servers software to accept the connection. See the chapter on [[../Connecting to Remote Unix/]].

==Appearance of the prompt==
The shell prompt normally ends in a $ sign. For simplicity, the examples in this book use a shell prompt like this:
 $

Some older shell prompts end in % instead:
 %

The C shell sometimes uses &gt; instead:
 &gt;

Several shells have prompts that give more information, such as:
 localhost:puffy {1}

You can also customize your shell prompt. For bash, use [http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#SEC83 these] special characters in the variables $PS[1-4]. $PS1 is what you usually see and $PS2 is what you see when you are doing a multi-line command with a backslash ('\'). For more see [http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html the manual].

Never copy/type the shell prompt used in this book. The shell will always give you a prompt if it is ready to accept commands.

===Root shell prompt===
If you [[../Becoming Root|become root]] or login as root, most systems change the shell prompt to end with #. The root account is allowed to do ''anything'' (delete or change any file) so the # is a reminder of the power of the prompt. Avoid using the # prompt when necessary; see the chapter on [[../Becoming Root/]]. In this book, root shell prompts look like this:
 #
&lt;!--
==Showing the default shell: the printenv command==
There are actually several different shell programs. Each shell provides a prompt, waits for a command, and runs it. The first examples in this book all use features common to most shells, so we will start by using the default shell of your user account. (The default shell is the one you get from a console or ssh login or a terminal emulator.)
*A terminal emulator might be configured to use a different shell than the default shell of your user account. Most terminal emulators use the default shell of your user account unless you configure the terminal emulator to behave differently.

The command &lt;tt&gt;'''printenv SHELL'''&lt;/tt&gt; will display the name of the default shell. Note that everything with the shell is sensistive to case: &quot;printenv&quot; must use ''all lowercase letters'' and &quot;SHELL&quot; must use ''all uppercase letters''.

To run the command, we type it, then we press the Return or Enter key to tell the shell to run the command. In this example, we are running a shell called '''bash''':
 $ '''printenv SHELL'''
 /bin/bash
 $

This runs the '''printenv''' program, which prints (shows) the value of the SHELL environment variable in one line on the terminal below the line where you typed the command. When another shell prompt appears, printenv is finished running.
--&gt;

==The basics of using the shell==
===Arguments and Options===
When entering a command, the shell does a few things in this order (if it succeeds, it executes the found command):
# The shell checks if the command is an absolute path (such as '''/bin/ls''') and if that path is an executable file.
# If the command is not an absolute path, the shell:
## searches through its builtin commands for the entered command.
## Looks in the directories in [[../Environment#Environment Variables|enviornment variable]] [[../../Environment_Variables#PATH|PATH]] for the entered command. It starts its search with the first directory listed in PATH, then the second and so on.

For examples, we'll be using the command '''ls''', which lists files and directories. This command lists the contents of &lt;tt&gt;/var&lt;/tt&gt; (which may differ on your computer):
 $ '''ls /var'''
 account backups db      lib     msgs    run     tmp
 audit   crash   empty   log     named   rwho    www
 authpf  cron    games   mail    quotas  spool   yp

The first word, &quot;ls&quot;, is the name of the program or command built into the shell to run. In this case, the program /bin/ls is run. The &quot;/var&quot; in this case is an ''argument''; it tells ls what to list. Arguments are separated by whitespace, usually one space.

There are some special arguments called options. Each command decides what is an option, but for many commands, options with only one hyphen to start usually are short for a more descriptive option that starts with two hyphens and some that start with two hyphens don't have shorthands. Here is an example (read it as &quot;el es dash el slash var&quot;):
 $ '''ls -l /var'''
 drwxr-xr-x   2 root    wheel      512 Mar 20  2005 account
 drwxrws---   2 root    wheel      512 Mar 20  2005 audit
 drwxrwx---   2 root    authpf     512 Mar 20  2005 authpf
 ...
 drwxr-xr-x   2 root    wheel      512 Jun 11 02:09 yp

Note that these commands require that options come before other arguments. For example, the following does not work (unless you have a file or directory called &lt;tt&gt;-l&lt;/tt&gt;):
 $ '''ls /var -l'''
 ls: -l: No such file or directory
 /var:
 account backups db      lib     msgs    run     tmp
 audit   crash   empty   log     named   rwho    www
 authpf  cron    games   mail    quotas  spool   yp

Exception: on systems with the GNU C library (GNU and GNU/Linux), many programs (not all of them) will automatically treat the options as if they were in the front, so &lt;tt&gt;'''ls /var -l'''&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;'''ls -l /var'''&lt;/tt&gt;. This is nice for users who forget to type some option.

What if there really is a file called &quot;-l&quot;? Then it must be specified that &quot;-l&quot; is not an option. One does this using the &quot;--&quot; argument, which means &quot;end of options&quot;. This is why it is inconvenient to have filenames start with hyphens.
 $ '''ls -- -l'''
 -l

===Editing Commands===
If the shell has command-line editing, then the arrow, End, and Home keys are useful. The left and right arrows allow the user to move the text cursor to edit the command and the Home and End keys allow the user to move the to the beginning or end of the line. For example, we want to list some specific files, like this:
 $ '''ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/profile'''

But we typed:
 $ '''ls l- /etc/passwrd /etc/profile'''

We can press the Home key to move the cursor to the beginning of the line, then use the right arrow to move the cursor to the right to delete the &quot;-l&quot;. After this, we press Return to run the command as normal. (This will not work in many non-shell programs that lack command line editing!)

Shells with history features allow using the up arrow to recall previous commands to the shell prompt. These previous lines are not run again unless the user presses Return. The down arrow returns down the list.

If the arrow keys are broken, or you actually find some keyboard without arrows, then the Control Emacs navigation keys (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+F, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+E and Ctrl+A) also work in most shells.

===The current/working directory===
Use '''cd''' to change the directory you are &quot;in.&quot; The syntax is cd followed by the pathname. cd bin would take you to the bin directory (located in the directory you are currently in), cd .. would take you up one level. cd ~ would take you to your home directory, and cd ~ followed by a username would take you to that user's home.

Although many shell prompts have the current directory's name or the end of the current directory's name right in the prompt (like '[user@localhost ~]$'), you can use the command '''pwd''' to Print the Working Directory.
 $ '''cd /etc'''
 $ '''pwd'''
 /etc
 $ '''ls passwd profile'''
 passwd profile
 $ '''cd ~john'''
 $ '''pwd'''
 /home/john

==Finding help for commands==
The first word of the command is the name of the command. For example, in the following command, &quot;ls&quot; is the command name, and &quot;-l&quot;, &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, and &quot;/etc/profile&quot; are the arguments.
 $ '''ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/profile'''

But how do we know what the &quot;ls&quot; command does? Most Unix-like systems provide ''online manual pages'' for each command. For example, 
 $ '''man ls'''

This opens the manual page in a program called the ''pager''. The most common pagers are '''less''' and '''more'''. These let the user type &lt;SPACE BAR&gt; to scroll down a screenful, 'b' to scroll up a screenful, &lt;RETURN&gt; to scroll down by one line, and 'q' to quit the pager.

However, the manual pages are often not useful for persons who know almost nothing about the commands. The chapter on [[Guide to UNIX/Commands|Commands]] will help. The section [[Guide to UNIX/Commands/Getting Help]] contains strategies for how to use man and the other help tools effectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Arabic Reading and Writing Basics ==
The standard way to write Arabic is with the Arabic writing system. It represents words by representing the sounds that occur in the word. It represents the consonants that occur in a word prominently. Vowels are usually not represented.

In English, both consonants and vowels are represented prominently. The letter &quot;a&quot; and the letter &quot;b&quot; occupy approximately equal area. Sometimes vowels are omitted for brevity, like in &quot;Scrn Lk&quot; for Screen Lock on a keyboard, but this is unusual. In the Arabic writing system, omitting vowels is pervasive. It is the standard. Symbols for vowels are an afterthought in the Arabic writing system, they are sprinkled on and are rarely used.

Although the Arabic writing system represents consonants prominently and represents vowels obscurely, a difference in the vowels can change the meaning of a word. So how do people read Arabic when the writing system does not usually represent vowels? Experienced readers of Arabic are capable of predicting the vowels based on the context. For beginners, extra symbols are written to represent the vowels. In cases where the author of a text anticipates ambiguity, the author can write the minimum vowels necessary to resolve ambiguity.

As an example the word for &quot;reply&quot; written without vowels is: رد
The same word written with a vowel is: رَد. Notice how the vowel is given no horizontal space.

The direction of writing in the Arabic writing system is also different than English. Arabic is written from right to left, unlike English which is written from left to right. This horizontal direction is the main difference. The vertical direction is the same as English; when a line is completed the next line is placed below the previous line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
From 1867 until 1982, the Division of Powers was the most important issue in Canadian constitutional law.  

Upon reading s. 91 and 92 of the BNA Act (renamed the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' in 1982), it becomes clear that much of what a government does today was not envisaged in 1867.  The welfare state, electricity, air and space travel, telecommunications, the automobile, and industrial pollution are of major importance to modern governments.  Yet none of these things existed in 1867, and so nothing was mentioned about them in the BNA Act division of powers.

However, as seen in the last lesson on the Unwritten Constitution, a constitutional principle exists that full sovereignty is vested in the two levels of government, i.e., anything that can be thought of is either in the jurisdiction of the federal government or the provincial government.  Therefore, for a century and a half, Canadian (and British) courts have been stretching the meaning of the words of the BNA Act to extend to cover all of these new areas of society.
The British North America Act, 1867,(BNA ACT) which established a federal Constitution for Canada, enumerated in Sections 91 and 92 the topics on which the Dominion and the Provinces could respectively legislate. Notwithstanding that the lists were framed so as to be fairly full and comprehensive, it was not long before it was found that the topics enumerated in the two sections overlapped, and the Privy Council had time and again to pass on the constitutionality of laws made by the Dominion and Provincial legislatures. It was in this situation that the Privy Council evolved the doctrine, that for deciding whether an impugned legislation was intra vires, regard must be had to its pith and substance. That is to say, if a statute is found in substance to relate to a topic within the competence of the legislature, it should be held to be intra vires, even though it might incidentally trench on topics not within its legislative competence. The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond its competence may be an element in determining whether the legislation is colourable, that is, whether in the guise of making a law on a matter within its competence, the legislature is, in truth, making a law on a subject beyond its competence. But where that is not the position, then the fact of encroachment does not affect the vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment. Vide Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. William Parsons (1881) 7 AC 96; The Attorney-General for Ontariao v. Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada 1894 A.C. 189; The Attorney General of Ontaria v. Attorney-General for the Dominion (1896) AC 348; Union Colliery Company of British Columbia v. Bryden (1899) AC 580; Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontaria (1937) AC 355; Attorney-General for Alberta V. Attorney-General for Canada (1939) AC 117 and Board of Trustees of Letherbridge Northern Irrigation District v. Independent Order of Foresters (1940) AC 513.

== Peace, Order, and Good Government ==
The Fathers of Confederation believed at the time that they had covered every possible new area of law with a clause in the BNA Act.  The first paragraph of section 91 of the BNA Act states that the federal government has the power '''&quot;to make laws for the Peace, Order, and good Government of Canada, in relation to all Matters not coming within the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces&quot;''', in addition to the powers specifically listed as federal.  Thus, any new areas of law would become federal.

It quickly became apparent, however, that the &quot;Peace, Order and Good Government&quot; (POGG)section, if interpreted too broadly, could effectively rob the provinces of most of their powers.  For instance: the invention of the automobile.  The automobile could have been seen as a new jurisdiction, under the complete control of the federal government.  But if so, the province's jurisdiction over roads, cities, intra-provincial transportation, and land would become effectively meaningless.

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) is a court run by the House of Lords in London.  It was the highest court in Canada from 1867 to 1949, and heard Canada's important division of powers cases from that era.  It could overrule the Supreme Court of Canada; many important cases bypassed the Supreme Court altogether and went directly to the JCPC.

The JCPC developed a doctrine called &quot;pith and substance&quot;.  This meant that, whenever a  government's legislation was challenged for being outside its jurisdiction, the JCPC would examine the &quot;pith and substance&quot; of the legislation.  The court would try to figure out what the law was &quot;really about&quot;.  Once the JCPC had figured out the legislation's &quot;pith and substance,&quot; it would decide which one of the listed powers mentioned in s. 91 or 92 of the BNA Act most closely corresponded with that &quot;pith and substance&quot;, to see if the government had jurisdiction.  If the pith and substance of the law was substantially within the government's jurisdiction, then any incidental effects the law had on another government's jurisdiction were permissible.

This doctrine greatly increased the importance of the listed powers in s. 91 and 92, consequently decreasing the importance of the POGG clause.  The power that the JCPC found most often corresponded to the &quot;pith and substance&quot; of contested legislation was s. 92(13), the provincial jurisdiction over &quot;Property and Civil Rights.&quot;

&quot;Civil Rights&quot; is a term of art in Canadian law.  Unlike in the United States, where &quot;civil rights&quot; is synonymous with &quot;human rights&quot;, civil rights in Canada means the ability of a person to make contracts (including marriage contracts), to buy, sell, and use property, to have parental authority, and to sue and be sued; one can think of them as the rights one attains upon adulthood.

The JCPC found that the pith and substance of most disputed laws related to property and civil rights.  In ''Toronto Electric Commissioners'' v. ''Snider'' (1925), the JCPC struck down the federal ''Industrial Disputes Investigation Act''.  It was a law giving the federal government certain authority over certain labour disputes.  The JCPC rejected the federal government's argument that such a law was for the Peace, Order, and Good Government of Canada, holding that the POGG power really just gave the federal government the power to act during emergencies.  Rather, since labour disputes are contract disputes, such a law is in pith and substance about Civil Rights, a provincial jurisdiction.  Therefore, the federal law was struck down as unconstitutional.

The POGG power never really recovered from the rulings of the JCPC.  Eventually, the federal government abolished appeals to the JCPC, making the Supreme Court of Canada truly the supreme court.  The Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted the POGG power slightly more broadly.  In the ''Anti-Inflation Reference'' (1975), the federal government asked the Supreme Court whether the federal government could fight inflation by imposing wage and price controls (usually in provincial jurisdiction) using its POGG power.  The majority of Supreme Court justices agreed, but for differing reasons.  Most felt that POGG was an emergency power, and that the Court should be deferential in letting the federal government decide whether inflation was a &quot;national emergency&quot; or not.  This is the &quot;national emergency&quot; doctrine of POGG.  A smaller group of judges felt that another doctrine of POGG was also valid: the &quot;national concern&quot; doctrine.  This doctrine means that where a new type of jurisdiction emerges, which does not correspond to any of the listed jurisdictions of the BNA Act, AND if it is of &quot;national concern&quot;, then it falls under POGG.

The Supreme Court clarified the &quot;national concern&quot; doctrine in  [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/cgi-bin/disp.pl/en/pub/1988/vol1/html/1988scr1_0401.html ''R.'' v. ''Crown Zellerbach'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[1988]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 S.C.R. 401].  The Supreme Court stated that the &quot;National Concern&quot; doctrine is valid, and has the effect of essentially adding a new category to the list of federal powers, if one can answer &quot;yes&quot; to all of these questions:

# Is the jurisdiction in question a single, distinct, and indivisible jurisdiction?
# Is it impossible for the provinces to deal with this jurisdiction on their own?
# Does it have ascertainable and reasonable limits, so that it does not remove large areas of jurisdiction from the provinces?

Despite these decisions, the POGG power has very rarely justified the federal government exercising jurisdiction.  Much more common is the politically controversial &quot;Spending Power&quot;.  Using its taxing power under s. 91(3) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'', the federal government collects more tax revenue than it needs in order to exercise the areas under its own jurisdictions.  It gives the extra money to the provinces to spend on their jurisdictions, providing that the provinces meet certain conditions required by federal laws.  This gives the federal government varying amounts of influence over areas of provincial jurisdiction, such as health and education. and its all ???

== Interjurisdictional Immunity ==
As seen previously, if the government has jurisdiction over the &quot;pith and substance&quot; of the law it has enacted, then any &quot;incidental effects&quot; on other governments' jurisdictions are acceptable.  For instance, the federal ''Divorce Act'' is valid legislation because the federal government has jurisdiction over divorce (s.91(26)), even though the '''Divorce Act''' has some incidental effects on child custody, which is usually considered to be within the provincial jurisdictions of &quot;Civil rights&quot; (s.92(13)) and &quot;Matters of a private nature&quot; (s.92(16)). 

In a few rare instances, the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the federal government's jurisdiction (up until now, never the provincial government's jurisdiction) had &quot;Inter-Jurisdictional Immunity.&quot;  Provincial government legislation could have no effect on these jurisdictions, not even incidentally.

There are two cases where this has happened.  The first is federal election postering. In ''McKay'' v. ''the Queen'' (1965), the Supreme Court of Canada held that municipal by-laws could not be enforced to prevent the posters of federal political parties from being put up during election periods.  This was because federal election postering has Inter-Jurisdictiona Immunity from provincial government legislation.  Since municipalities get their authority to make by-laws from provincial legislation (see BNA Act s. 92(8)), such by-laws had no effect on federal election posters.  This did not mean that the municipal by-law was rendered invalid; it maintained its effect on every type of postering except federal election posters.

The other case were the Supreme Court has recognized Inter-Jurisdictional Immunity is in Federal Works and Undertakings.  This federal power oddly comes from BNA Act s.92(10)(a).  The provincial government has jurisdiction over &quot;works and undertakings&quot; except the ones listed.  One of these exceptions is &quot;telegraphs&quot;.  Consequently, the major telephone companies are all under the jurisdiction of the federal government.

Worker health and safety is a provincial jurisdiction (&quot;Civil rights&quot;).  So, if the province passes a law which, in pith and substance, regulates worker health and safety, can it have incidental effects of the major telephone companies?  No, according to the Supreme Court decision in [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1988/vol1/html/1988scr1_0749.html ''Bell Canada v. Quebec (C.S.S.T.)'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[1988]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 S.C.R. 749].  The Supreme Court laid out the following test:

# If the purpose of the provincial law is to regulate a federal work/undertaking, then it is unconstitutional.
# If the provincial law directly affects a vital part of the federal work/undertaking, then interjurisdictional immunity applies (the law has no effect on the federal work/undertaking).
# If the provincial law has an indirect effect which impairs the operation of the federal work/undertaking, then interjurisdictional immunity applies.

On the facts of the case, the Supreme Court ruled that occupational health and safety directly affected the vital management decisions of Bell Canada, and therefore the law had no effect on the company.  

The Interjurisdictional Immunity doctrine has a very limited application; for the mostpart, provincial legislation applies to companies that are usually under the jurisdiction of the federal government.

      <comment>/* Justicibility */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the governmental structure of Canada there is no clear separation of powers between the judicial, executive, and legislative branches of government. As such, the role of the courts will often overlap into other territories, such as the Supreme Court's advisory role in hearing reference cases.  Conversely, the judicial realm can be encroached by other groups, such as the creation of administrative tribunals to hear cases. Nonetheless, there are limits to these sorts of encroachments as can be seen in the issue of justicibility and jurisdiction.  Following this, there is the further issue of who is able to apply to the Courts. Namely, what type of individual or group can have proper standing to make a claim to a Court. Lastly, we will look at what sort of remedies are available under the Constitution to a successful claimants.

== Justiciability ==
The justiciability of a dispute asks whether the issue is so political or speculative that the courts should not be involved.  The concern is that the courts may go beyond their constitutional role in Canada if they were to get involved in controversies that are outside of their expertise of interpreting and applying the law. 

The US constitution is based on a strict doctrine of separation of powers, which is enforced by the &quot;political question&quot; doctrine that prevents courts from examining issues that are meant to be dealt with by the legislative branch.  In Canada, however, there is a presumption that the heads of power will overlap to some degree. The &quot;political question&quot; doctrine has been rejected by the Courts (''Operation Dismantle'').

The current practice has been that so long as there is a ''legal component'' to the issue, the dispute will be considered justiciable, but only the legal issue can be examined. In ''Re Quebec Secession'', the Court examined only the &quot;legal framework&quot; of the province's ability to secede, but not the merits of the decision to do so. Equally, in ''Operation dismantle'' the courts refused to examine the soundness of the executive branch's policy. In ''Re Canada Assistance Plan'', They further articulated that even if the question is partly political, if there is a &quot;sufficiently legal component&quot; than it can be fairly examined.

== Jurisdiction ==
As already mentioned, the jurisdictional division between courts is not clean split. The debate focuses on the application of section 96 which gives the federal government the authority to appoint judges to the Superior Courts. As the true authority of the Superior Court is said to be inherent, this section has been construed to provide protection for the Superior Courts' jurisdiction.  The Superior Court functions as an anchor to which the entire court system radiates from. The issue of jurisdiction can be framed as the carving out of jurisdiction for inferior and statutory courts. To complicate matters, jurisdiction is not necessarily exclusive. It is possible for courts to have concurrent jurisdiction where two or more types of court can hear a given case.

=== Provincial Courts ===


===Tribunals ===
In recent years the use of administrative tribunals in handling disputes has exploded. These tribunals, created by federal or provincial statute, are typically composed of mostly individuals without legal experience. Familiar examples are rental boards, workers' compensation boards, no-fault automobile insurance boards, and labor dispute panels.  

The power of a tribunal to review cases depends on the governments ability to encroach on section 96 powers. The leading case on this is the Supreme Court decision of ''Re Residential Tenancies Act (1981)''.

Over the past few years there has been a developing tradition of allowing public interest groups to apply to the Courts with constitutional arguments. The test for whether a public interest group can dispute a law was first given in ''Borowski''. The Court proposed a three-step test:
#

== Remedies ==


==Mootness==
Mootness refers to a legal issue that has no connection to the controversy to be resolved in a court case. The Court generally will decline issues that are moot. The test for mootness is &quot;whether there is a live controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties. The court may decline to hear a hypothetical or abstract issue. However, it may exercise its discretion to depart from this general policy or practice&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;Borowski v Canada (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1989] 1 SCR 342 at 15&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

== Government jurisdiction ==
By virtue of section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over matters relating to “Indians and lands reserved for the Indians”. On this basis the federal government has sole jurisdiction to negotiate treaties with the aboriginal peoples. Any attempt on the part of the provincial governments to interfere with any of the treaties would be in violation of the Constitution.

The Indian Act is the sole legislation regulating the government oversight of aboriginals. Much of the Act deals with the rights of band members living on reserves, and has little constitutional significance.

=== Provincial Jurisdiction ===

Section 88 of the Act provides that the provinces can have jurisdiction over aboriginal matters so long as it does not conflict with the laws of the Act.
:''88. Subject to the terms of any treaty and any other Act of Parliament, all laws of general application from time to time in force in any province are applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with this Act or any order, rule, regulation or by-law made thereunder, and except to the extent that those laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made by or under this Act.''

The extent of provincial authority over Indian matters apply only with respect to matters that fall within the provincial jurisdiction. However, in practice five exceptions have been developed. 

== Aboriginal and Treaty rights ==
Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 acknowledges the existence of aboriginal and treaty rights, it states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''35. (1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.&lt;br /&gt;
''(2) In this Act, &quot;aboriginal peoples of Canada&quot; includes the Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.&lt;br /&gt;
''(3) For greater certainty, in subsection (1) &quot;treaty rights&quot; includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired. &lt;br /&gt;
''(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female persons.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Often this section is confused as being part of the Charter which ends at section 34. Thus, this section provides an absolute right to aboriginals and is not subject to section 1 or 33. 

The word &quot;existing&quot; is key to the understanding of section 35. The Supreme Court acknowledged in ''R. v. Sparrow''[1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075 that, prior to 1982, aboriginal rights existed by virtue of the common law, and therefore could extinguished by an Act of Parliament. However with the constitutional entrenchment of those rights in section 35, aboriginal rights cannot be extinguished unilaterally by the government. 

Broadly speaking, section 35 provides for two types of aboriginal rights: Aboriginal Treaty Rights and Aboriginal Rights. The first is a sui generis right gained through the enactment of treaties between the government and the aboriginal peoples. Proving the existence of these rights can often prove difficult as they are frequently based on oral tradition passed on through the aboriginal peoples. The second type is a right based in the common law.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before 1982, the only way to amend the written Constitution of Canada was to ask the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London to pass legislation.  Even upon the passage of the [''Statute of Westminster'', 1931, when the United Kingdom Parliament stated that its laws no longer applied to Canada, the U.K. Parliament retained the right to amend the Constitution of Canada through section 4 of the ''Statute''.  The ''Constitution Act, 1982'', was therefore made law by a statute of the United Kingdom (called the ''Canada Act'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two ways to install Project WOnder -- binary distribution or building from source.

=== Nightly Build Server ===
The easiest way is to install the binary distribution.  m Dimension Technology runs a nightly build server for Project WOnder that preserves historical builds at http://webobjects.mdimension.com/wonder .  Simply grab the Wonder-VERSIONNUMBER-Frameworks.tar.gz archive and uncompress it into your /Library/Frameworks folder, and you have successfully installed Project WOnder.

=== Build from Source ===
The second, slightly more annoying, way to install WOnder is to build it yourself from the SourceForge CVS tree.
# cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@wonder.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wonder login
# There is no password
# cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@wonder.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/wonder co -P Wonder
# cd Wonder
# You will need to make sure you have a wobuild.properties file in ~/Library/. The contents should be similar to this:
  wo.dir.root=/
  wo.woroot=/
  wo.dir.user.home.library.frameworks=/Users/username/Library/Frameworks
  wo.dir.local=/
  wo.wosystemroot=/System
  wo.dir.library=/System/Library
  wo.dir.user.home.library=/Users/username/Library
  wo.dir.local.library=/Library
  wo.dir.library.frameworks=/System/Library/Frameworks
  wo.dir.local.library.frameworks=/Library/Frameworks
  wo.wolocalroot=/
  wo.dir.system=/System
  eclipse.home=/Developer/Applications/Java\ Tools/Eclipse/

Lastly, run &quot;ant dist&quot;, &quot;ant frameworks&quot;, or &quot;ant examples&quot;.

This will build all the frameworks and applications into ~/Roots.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Passive of Being&lt;/font&gt;===

The passive voice, indicating a state of being, is expressed with '''es''' followed by the past participle of the verb:

*'''es exultat''' – ''is exalted''
*'''esed savat''' – ''was known''
*'''sal es morit''' – ''shall be dead''

Note that the stress is on the vowel before the final  '''-t'''.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Sexless Nouns Ending in -U&lt;/font&gt;===

As discussed in Lesson 1, replacing the '''-i''' ending of an adjective with '''-u''' forms a sexless noun with the character of the adjective:

*'''li malu''' – ''the evil one, evil''
*'''li privatus''' – ''the private ones''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;E/A/O Words&lt;/font&gt;===

The related nouns and verbs which alternate the endings '''–e''', '''–a''' and '''–o''' are a major characteristic of the Novial language. Note that all '''e/a/o''' words are from sexless nouns so no confusion is possible with the use of these endings for ''male or female/female/male'' as was described in Lesson 1.

In the preceding reading texts several examples of '''e/a/o''' words occurred and were listed with their translations but with no further explanation.

These endings provide a very convenient way of converting a sexless noun ending in '''–e''' into a corresponding verb ending in '''–a''', '''provided that the meaning of the verb is very obvious'''. If there is any possibility of uncertainty in meaning, another verbal ending should be used for clarity.

*'''rakonte – rakonta – rakonto''' (''story – (to) tell – telling'')
*'''date – data –dato''' (''a date – (to) date, provide a date - dating'')
*'''lume – luma –lumo''' (''a light – (to) shine - shining'')
*'''drinke – drinka – drinko''' (''a drink – (to) drink - drinking'')
*'''sadle – sadla – sadlo''' (''a saddle – (to) saddle - saddling'')
*'''forme – forma – formo''' (''a form – (to) form - forming'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Prefix NON-&lt;/font&gt;===

The prefix '''non-''' converts the stem to sense ''not''. Note this is not the direct opposite which is expressed with the prefix '''des-'''. Examples:

*'''non-expresiv''' – ''inexpressive''
*'''non-mutual''' – ''non-reciprocal''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Prefix RI-&lt;/font&gt;===

The prefix '''ri-''' indicates repetition. As an independent word '''ri''' means ''again''.

*'''konstruktione''' – ''construction''
*'''rikonstruktione''' – ''reconstruction''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Suffix -AD-&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffix '''-ad-''' is added to verbal stems to indicate repeated or continuous action.

*'''regarda''' – ''(to) look''
*'''regardada''' –''(to) keep on looking, (to) stare''

==example==

This is from a game show, maybe &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; or &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

#Three doors are shown. A nice price is behind one of the doors.
#A contestant is asked to choose 1 of 3 doors to open. 
#Before opening the selected door, one of the unselected doors is opened, revealing some junk. (a goat maybe)
#The contestant is offered the option to change his choice. (they may, '''and should''')
#The chosen door is opened, revealing either a goat or something nice.

Lots of people get this one wrong. Lots of wrong people feel really sure that they are correct. Wikipedia may have an article about this example.

There is indeed a Wikipedia article about this problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_hall_problem

um...
&quot;The probability of one die showing six is 11/36&quot;...a die has 6 sides on it, not 11.  Let's not be teaching BS with a book.  This is a sure way to make people not want to look at Wikibooks.  I will try to correct the mistake.  But come on! since when does a die have 11 sides??? [[User:CatastrophicToad|CatastrophicToad]] 18:26, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

I don't kno how familiar you are with probability theory, but the text was correct, allthough I made it a little more explicit. The experiment was throwing two dice and hence in 11 of the 36 cases (at least) one dice shows six. And BTW there are dice with eleven sides. [[User:Nijdam|Nijdam]] 23:46, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

The text is not correct.  The probability of a double six given that you've seen one of the dice and it's a six is 1/6.  Because the outcome of the two die are independent events, you can look at it as mathematically equivalent to throwing one die twice.  The first comes up six; what's the probability of a six when you roll it again?  Dice has no memory.  Now consider what the probability is that you get at least one six when rolling two dice.  This is a different problem than the one where one die is revealed.  In this case, the probability is higher (11/36).  Either die could have the six so the number of rolls that fit the problem statement is higher.  Too bad the first example given in a &quot;textbook&quot; is wrong.

The point is the difference between one of the dice or dice number one. When saying &quot;one of the dice&quot; it may refer to any one of the two. If it were the case that die number one shows six, the probability of the other, number two, showing six would be 1/6. But that is not the case as might be see nfrom the example. But for utter accuracy I change &quot;one dice&quot; into &quot;one of the dice&quot;.[[User:Nijdam|Nijdam]] 20:50, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

I don't think conditional probability is introduced in the best way. The two dice, and accidentally seeing that one of them is six is a good example (and you're right to change it to one of the dice). It might be clearer if you have somebody tell you rather then you accidentally seeing one of the dice.

However, the thing I really dislike is whenthe probabilities are pulled together and the conditional probability just stated as being 1/36 / 11/36

I feel it would be better to say: Now look at all possibilities for the two dice, where at least one of them shows a six. Note that there are 11 possibilities, all equally likely and so the chance of a double 6 given you know there is one.....--[[User:MarkyParky|MarkyParky]] 23:16, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

Hello MP, the problem is that in this case we may refer to the 36 possibillities that are equally likely. But that is not the general case. What if P(B)=0.321 and P(AB) = 1/99? Maybe it is good to mention somehing like we &quot;blow up&quot; the probabillity of the event B to 100% etc.?[[User:Nijdam|Nijdam]] 15:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

The statement that accidentally seeing one of the die is a 6 gives us a 1/11 probability is wrong, becase it fails to take into account the odds that one of the die was a 6, but that the die we accidentally saw was not the 6. If we imagine one red die and one blue die, we can see that the the odds of the blue die being 6 (having seen the red die and knowing it's 6) are 1/6. The same holds true if we saw the blue die is 6. The only case where where the odds are 1/11 is when we know that EITHER the red die OR the blue die is a 6, which is not the case if we actually saw the die. Therefore, it should be changed to say &quot;Suppose somebody looks under the cup, sees the result, and tells us AT LEAST ONE of the die is 6.

I'm sorry, this is just all wrong, and most of the above discussion is not even relevant.  In the example as currently given:  ONE die is known to be six; ONE die is not known; we wonder what the probability of &quot;double-six&quot; is. The probability that THE UNKNOWN DIE is a six is 1/6.  If the unknown die is a six, given that the known die is also a six, we have &quot;double-six&quot;; therefor, the probability of double-sixes is 1/6.  Simple. I will not edit, because I really am not sure what the point of this example is supposed to be, so I can't usefully fix it.

== Incoming link from Wikiversity ==

I'm not sure what to do.  I am working on '''[[Wikiversity:Bell's_theorem/Introduction#Conditional_probability|v:Bell's theorem]]''' and need to reference conditional probability.  The best wiki on this is right here, so I made a link to one section (that I added).  The alternative is for me to copy this page to Wikiversity and edit it.  That eliminates the cross-wiki stuff, but also forces duplication.  Which alternative is best?

Another option is to use a permalink from the article that needs the info on Wikibooks.  I just added that to my article. --[[User:Guy vandegrift|Guy vandegrift]] ([[User talk:Guy vandegrift|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Guy vandegrift|contribs]]) 21:43, 26 September 2015 (UTC)See also: ''[[w:User:Guy vandegrift]]''

== The lede ==

In addition to creating the example with the venn diagrams and integers (even/prime), I changed the lede:

1. I tried to put more information into less space.  The pair of equations appears on one line, but split with a space (&amp;nbsp) so that people with cell phones will be able to see two lines.
&lt;pre&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \, \Leftrightarrow &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B)  = P(A|B) P(B) =  P(B|A) P(A)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

I see no reason to use an entire paragraph to show what is algebraically trivial.

2.  Wikipedia calls it Bayes' theorem, so I noted the controversy and linked to Wikpedia.  Is that OK?  If not, I have no objection to removing the link to Wikipedia and reference to Bayes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==gcc==
If you have gcc 3.0 or higher, Linux uses the -mregparm=3 option to put 3 args in registers.
For per-function control, it does this:

 #define asmlinkage CPP_ASMLINKAGE __attribute__((regparm(0)))
 #define FASTCALL(x)     x __attribute__((regparm(3)))
 #define fastcall        __attribute__((regparm(3)))

Usage in a header file:

 extern void FASTCALL(__up_read(struct rw_semaphore *sem));

Usage in a C file:

 void fastcall sched_exit(task_t * p)
 {

While gcc on Windows does support a few odd Microsoftisms, that's not really the way gcc is meant to be used.

Also, on x86-64, gcc puts up to 6 integer arguments in registers without being affected by floating-point usage. (8 args for double, and 8 args for float)

==errors==

From here,
  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Reverse_Engineering/Calling_Conventions

&quot;STDCALL passes arguments right-to-left, and returns the value in eax. (The Microsoft documentation erroneously claims that arguments are passed left-to-right, but this is not the case: see the Calling Conventions Example page for details.)&quot;

From here,
  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Reverse_Engineering/Examples/Calling_Conventions

&quot;Notice that y is a higher offset from ebp, which indicates that these arguments are passed on the stack from left-to-right, instead of right-to-left as the Microsoft documentation claims.&quot;

One must be wrong.  It appears this page is in error.  y is located at ebp+12 and x is located at ebp+8, so y is pushed first, or right-to-left.

Also, MASM 5.1 documentation defines STDCALL as selecting between CDECL and PASCAL for variable and fixed arguments, respectively.  You've presented STDCALL as CDECL only in the MS and GNU C summary.

----
I modified the page to indicate that in this example the stdcall function takes arguments right-to-left.

== Simple Present ==
The basic form of simple present is I am, you are, he/she is, they are etc... 

&lt;p&gt;मैं हूँ - am &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;तू है / तुम हो / आप हैं - ّYou are (in order of politeness from least to most)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;वह है - He/She is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;वे हैं - They are. &lt;/p&gt;

We can now use this to create more complex sentences.

I am so very, ''very'' happy to see Mnemosyne plugged in this section. :) --[[User:Notyourbroom|Notyourbroom]] ([[User talk:Notyourbroom|talk]]) 21:33, 26 March 2009 (UTC)

== Skritter ==

I think it would be useful to add Skritter (http://www.skritter.com) under the writing section.  Since I'm not independent (I work for them) I'll just suggest it here and let others add it if they agree.

This chapter describes different types of partitioning maps and the programs used to adjust partitioning maps.

A ''partition map'' divides the disk into partitions. Each ''partition'' can be formatted separately. Partitions are normally used for ''filesystems'', which hold computer files, or ''swap'', which is used as additional (but slower) memory by operating systems. The chapter for [[../Filesystems and Swap/]] described how Unix-like systems use partitions.

The Unix-like system is often installed on the same disk as some other operating system. In that case, both the Unix-like kernel and the other system must understand the same kind of partioning map.
*On i386 hardware, ''fdisk'' partitioning is common. It is used by DOS, Windows, and Linux. The BIOS which boots the computer starts the Master Boot Record (MBR) on the disk. The MBR understands the fdisk format.
*On Macintoshes, the ''Apple partition map'' allows the disk to contain one or more Macintosh (HFS+ or the older HFS) partitions. The BIOS (Open Firmware) can boot the Macintosh without an MBR, because the BIOS can find bootloader files on HFS+ and HFS partitions.
*The *BSD systems can use an MBR with a *BSD partition map, but most configurations use a non-BSD partition map with a &quot;slice&quot; that contains a *BSD partition map and partitions.

==MS-DOS or MBR partition maps (fdisk)==
''This section might need corrections.''

The original IBM PC defined a simple partition map format for MS-DOS. Enshrined in the BIOS implementation of PC-style computers, this partition map is used by DOS and Windows. It is also used by most Linux systems on PC-style hardware for BIOS compatibility, and because Linux is often installed on the same disks as DOS and Windows. To distinguish this older partitioning format from newer formats available for Windows, Microsoft now uses the term ''MBR partitioning'' – so-called because the partition table is contained within the master boot record (MBR) – to describe the MS-DOS format. Much literature refers to this partitioning format by the terms DOS and MS-DOS. 

With the MBR partition map:
* The master boot record (MBR) is not part of any partition. The MBR contains a bootstrap loader program and a basic partition table in a fixed location.
* The basic partition table is limited to four ''primary partitions''. If you want more partitions, one of the primary partitions must be identified as an ''extended partition''.  The extended partition can be divided into ''logical partitions''. For example, Windows might be installed on primary partitions 1 (drive C:) and 2 (drive D:). Linux might be using 3 partitions (root &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;, swap, and home &lt;tt&gt;/home&lt;/tt&gt;). Root is on primary partion 3. Primary partition 4 is the extended partition, and contains swap and &lt;tt&gt;/home&lt;/tt&gt; as logical partitions, and possibly extra space for future logical partitions.
* A primary partition might also be a *BSD slice. That means that it contains a *BSD disklabel and several *BSD partitions.
* One primary partition might be marked active. The default MBR boot loader (the one from MS-DOS and FreeDOS) boots the active primary partition. However, some MBR boot loaders like GRUB might give you a menu instead of booting the active partition.
* You can declare the type of each partition. Some systems use the type to find their filesystems. BSD uses the type to find its slice, but Linux ignores the types completely. Linux instead goes by its &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/tt&gt; file.

To manipulate fdisk partitions, look for a program called FDISK.EXE on DOS or ''fdisk'' on Linux.

==Apple partition maps==
Mac OS hard disks normally contain Apple partioning maps. These maps are created when Apple's Drive Setup program was used to format the disk. With these partition maps:
* Partition 1 contains the partition map.
* For some reason, Drive Setup insists on creating 128 MB of unused Apple_Free space as partition 2.&lt;!-- IIRC it is reserved for a bootstrap and secondary loader --&gt; Some older disks with Mac OS 9 drivers installed have several tiny partitions, starting at 2, which are only used by Mac OS 9 and older.
* You can create at least 17 partitions, and probably more.
* There is no Master Boot Record (MBR).

To manipulate Apple partitions, go to a shell prompt on Mac OS X or *BSD and use ''pdisk'' or ''diskutil''. Most GNU/Linux systems now call that same program ''mac-fdisk'' for some reason.

===Partition Types===
Actually, partition types on Apple partition maps can be arbitrary strings, for example &quot;OpenBSD&quot;. Some operating systems are still stuck with &quot;Apple_UNIX_SVR2&quot; though.

&lt;!-- I prefer CSS, but it forces you to put a border on each cell.
     I use transitional HTML here instead. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:00, 21 October 2005 (UTC) --&gt;
{|border=&quot;1&quot;
|&lt;tt&gt;Apple_partition_map&lt;/tt&gt;
|This partition contains the partition map. It exists so that no other partition overlaps the partition map.
|-
|Mac OS classic drivers
|These tiny partitions would be after the partition map, but most disks now lack them. Mac OS 9 and earlier would load a device driver for the disk from these partitions. All other systems, including Mac OS X, do not use them.
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Apple_HFS&lt;/tt&gt;
|This is an HFS+ or HFS partition. Mac OS mounts all partitions of this type (unless the HFS do-not-mount flag is set). This might also be an MS-DOS format partition; Mac OS can also mount those.
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Apple_UFS&lt;/tt&gt;
|This is a UFS partition mounted by Mac OS X.
*It has its own Apple-format disklabel and separate boot partition (Apple_Boot? not Apple_Bootstrap) in case someone copies a bootable copy of Mac OS X to the partition.
*Especially with newer versions of Mac OS X, there is ''almost never a reason to use Apple_UFS''. Use HFS+ instead. Trying to use Apple_UFS partitions with OpenBSD can corrupt data.
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/tt&gt;
|This is the OpenBSD slice. A disk must have zero or one of these.
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Apple_Bootstrap&lt;/tt&gt;
|The BIOS (Open Firmware) can boot from this partition, but Mac OS will not mount it. This partition type is used by &quot;ybin&quot; to contain &quot;yaboot&quot;, the Linux bootloader. It can also contain an OS-menu with Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux as possible entries.
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Apple_UNIX_SVR2&lt;/tt&gt;
|Nominally, it is an [[w:A/UX|A/UX]] partition for Apple's port of [[w:UNIX System V#SVR2|SVR2]] to the 68k Mac. However, Apple borrowed this partition type for their dualithic Linux for PowerPC Mac. Both Apple systems are obsolete, but now both Linux and NetBSD are using this partition type.
*Using NetBSD's pdisk, you can flag two Apple_UNIX_SVR2 partitions as root and swap partitions. These become &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; when you boot NetBSD.
*It is confusing if you have Linux and NetBSD on the same disk.
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Apple_Free&lt;/tt&gt;
|Map editors like pdisk create this &quot;partition&quot; whenever partitions are deleted. An &quot;Apple_Free&quot; partition is just unused space. There is usually one big &quot;Apple_Free&quot; partition.
*Drive Setup on Mac OS X also insists on wasting 128 MB on an Apple_Free partition between the Apple_partion_map and the first Apple_HFS. If careful, one can use the 128 MB as swap for OpenBSD.
|}

===Example===
On the example system, we use &quot;pdisk&quot; on OpenBSD to see the partition map. We run the &quot;pdisk /dev/rwd0c&quot; command on OpenBSD. On Mac OS X the command would be &quot;pdisk /dev/disk0&quot;. Most Linux distros now give the name &quot;mac-fdisk&quot; to &quot;pdisk&quot;, so the command would be &quot;mac-fdisk /dev/hda&quot;. We use the pdisk command &quot;p&quot; to print the partition map and then &quot;q&quot; to quit.

==BSD slices and partitions==
{{wikipedia|BSD disklabel}}
''This section might need corrections.''

The terms &quot;slice&quot; and &quot;partition&quot; are often defined as follows:
*A ''partition'' is an entry (filesystem or swap) in the BSD disklabel.
*A ''slice'' is the partition of the non-BSD partition map (like fdisk or Apple) which contains the BSD disklabel and partitions.

The BSD partition map is called a ''disklabel''. In the following discussion, &quot;partition map&quot; refers to a non-BSD partition map which is not a disklabel.

BSD partitioning is special because on a disk with *BSD installed, 'a' must be root and 'b' if it exists must be swap. The disklabel indicates the locations, types, and letters of all partitions. Because of these special traits, BSD disklabels are confined to slices on any disks that are also used by non-BSD operating systems. This leads to three situations when a disk is used with BSD:

#''The disk has a partition map and a disklabel.'' The partition map is at the beginning of the disk (possibly after the MBR). One of the partitions is a BSD slice. The disklabel is at the beginning of the BSD slice. The *BSD system will use the disklabel while other systems use the partition map. A disk with OpenBSD/macppc installed uses this configuration.
#''The disk has a partition map but no disklabel.'' If the disk is used with *BSD, the BSD kernel generates a partition map, assigning letters to all recognized types of partitions. With Apple partition maps, OpenBSD/macppc only recognizes Apple_HFS partitions. NetBSD/macppc recognizes both Apple_HFS and NetBSD (Apple_UNIX_SVR2) partitions, so NetBSD/macppc installations do not need a disklabel.
#''The disk has only a disklabel.'' The disklabel is at the beginning of the disk, possibly after the MBR, and the entire disk is reserved to *BSD. Only *BSD can use this disk.

===Is there room for the disklabel?===
To make room for a disklabel, all UFS/FFS partitions leave the first bytes unused. Thus you can put a root UFS/FFS partition directly at the beginning of the disk (except the MBR) and still have room for a disklabel.

All UFS/FFS partitions must be listed in a disklabel to be useful. Mac OS X will put an Apple-specific disklabel on all Apple_UFS partitions because those are not listed in a BSD disklabel.

===How does BSD read a non-BSD partition map?===
The *BSD distros have different approaches for using non-BSD partitions, or having *BSD and a non-*BSD operating system on the same disk.
* If NetBSD sees an Apple partitioning map, it will assign letters to all of the HFS+ partitions and NetBSD partitions.
* If OpenBSD sees an Apple partitioning map, it will search for a partition of type &quot;OpenBSD&quot;, and use the disklabel on that partition. If no disklabel exists, OpenBSD assigns letters to all &quot;Apple_HFS&quot; (HFS+) partitions, starting with letter 'i'. When creating a disklabel, one starts with the HFS+ partitions already in the disklabel. Then one adds OpenBSD partitions by dividing the &quot;OpenBSD&quot; Apple partition into several disklabel partitions, which is a form of secondary partitioning. Use '''disklabel -E''' to edit the disklabel.

In blended learning, instructors use facets of self-paced instruction and live, collaborative learning to moderate the offline setting.

Self-paced learning is an instructional tool where the learner is in control and manages the pace of learning.  (Singh, 2001)  The on-demand nature of self-paced learning makes it optimal for the offline atmosphere of blended learning.  Here, learners not only control the pace of instructional information, but they also do not face the time restrictions of a face-to-face classroom.  The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at all times.  Generally, the responsibilities of self-paced learning are consistent with the instruction of a face-to-face traditional classroom.  The instructor is responsible for supplying the instructional material, and the learner is responsible for reading, comprehending, and familiarizing him/herself with the material.  

Self-paced instruction will often come in the form of asynchronous formats including: 

*Documents &amp; Web Pages
*Web/Computer Based Training Modules
*Assessments
*Surveys
*Simulations
*Recorded lectures, discussions, or live events
*Online Learning Communities and Discussion Forums (Singh, 2001)

Collaborative learning is a process where learning takes place through group or cooperative efforts. (Hiltz, 1999)  A live, collaborative learning environment depends on dynamic communication between learners that fosters knowledge sharing.  (Singh, 2001)  In live, collaborative learning atmospheres the communication process between learners is just as meaningful and vital as an educational end product.  Collaborative learning emphasizes the following factors:
     
*active participation and interaction among learners
*knowledge viewed as a social construct
*environments that facilitate peer interaction, evaluation, and cooperation
*learners who benefit from self explanation when more experienced or knowledgeable learners contribute
*learners who benefit from internalization by verbalizing in a conversation (Hiltz, 1999)

:Book is fine.
== OOP ==
There needs to be more on object oriented programming. Perhaps a short introduction to OOP in the description of VB.NET and why it is important to learn? I already know VB6, so I am used to operators, variables, loops, etc. If you are going to discuss VB6, perhaps give some examples of changes to VB.NET that outdated what was used in VB6. Like the On Error Goto structure is not to be used for error trapping, and that Try/Catch/Finally/End Try structure is used instead. Perhaps also mention how true and false values are handled differently as are boolean expressions, which can wreck code that worked in VB6 but works differently in VB.NET. --[[User:Orion Blastar|Orion Blastar]] 04:28, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

Most of electrical engineering was invented by 1925, reduced to practice by 1935, and mathematically analyzed and scientifically understood by 1945. So what makes this book different? Symbolic computation programs such as MATLAB, MuPAD, and Mathematica eliminate calculators and time consuming math. Cloud computing at sites like Circuit Lab make simulation possible on a cell phone. This leaves room for more material to be covered at greater depth.

'''This Course'''

The 1st and 2nd order differential equations can be solved with Euler's equation (phasors) and calculus. This solution technique is compared with Laplace transforms. The course builds on Kirchhoff's laws to write differential equations using transfer functions. The particular solution reduces to a final condition if sources are replaced with a unit step function. All that needs to be calculated is the homogeneous step response. Then response to any complex voltage or current source can then be found through the convolution integral.  

'''Requirements'''

This book will expect the reader to have a firm understanding of Calculus specifically, and will not stop to explain the fundamental topics in Calculus. This book shows where Laplace transforms provide an alternative solution, but only in a few examples in parallel with phasor solutions. 

''This book is not nearly completed, and could still use a lot of work. People with knowledge of the subject are encouraged to contribute.''

*safely connect AC power to a computer's line-in jack (to see the waveform -- a UPS would be interesting)
*build a modem from a soundcard (for audio) and serial port (for on-hook control)
*build a modem from a soundcard (for audio) and parallel port (for on-hook control)
*drive LEDs (of various types) off of a parallel port
*build a stun gun
*low-power FM transmitter for audio from a common cheap microphone
*low-power FM transmitter for audio from line-out
*low-power AM transmitter for audio from a common cheap microphone
*low-power AM transmitter for audio from line-out
*build a crude AC-to-DC step-down power supply
*build a switching AC-to-DC step-down power supply
*build a DC-to-AC power supply, stepping up of course
*build the whole UPS, with power loss and low battery signals :-)
*abuse a transistor or two for measuring temperature
*build a capacitance-based proximity switch
*build a [[w:Theremin|theremin]]
*modulate an LED (FM, AM, PM, etc.) to transmit audio, and then receive it
*power a small fan or light from a USB port

*ligntning-protected computer-to-outside line, for pool or garden monitoring and control

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:47, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:I definately am interested in adding alot of good examples, but i run into a few problems:
#nobody else besides me has really contributed yet to this wikibook
#we need to get alot more of the theoretical framework written down before we can attempt any design examples
#examples are going to require diagrams (and they can't all be ASCII) and lots of formulas which can be very time-intensive to produce.
Also, some of these examples wouldnt really fit into this wikibook, because it is mostly an exposition of time-domain analysis of DC circuits. Circuit Theory 2 has AC current and frequency methods. Many of these examples that you have listed will require information on semiconductors, electromagnetic fields, electromagnetic wave propagation, TTL, and Digital logic, which are all well beyond the scope of this book. Also, some of the examples, such as a &quot;stun gun&quot; or an &quot;EMP gun&quot; would be better suited for a text like &quot;how to get arrested&quot; or &quot;how to hurt those around you&quot;, and are less suited for a serious text on Circuit Engineering techniques. I definately do plan to add many examples in the future, however. Also, i think i would like to incorporate examples from software suites such as MatLab and PSpice, among others. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 14:15, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

::Note that the semiconductor part can often be glossed over. Analysing the rest can still be useful. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:09, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

::A serious text can certainly include entertaining examples. It should have them, to draw the reader's attention. There's nothing wrong with building a stun gun. You can test it on yourself. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:09, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

:::That's true, there is nothing saying that our examples cannot be &quot;real-world&quot; examples, or that they can't be interesting or entertaining. However, the current scope of this wikibook is far to limited to be covering nearly any of the topics listed above. Later EE books (if we ever get around to making more) can certainly tackle some of those topics. The average reader of this wikibook simply doesnt have enough background knowledge of the subject, and would be far too easily distracted by &quot;flashy&quot; examples, and might gloss over the mathematically rigorous (but very important) principals. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 11:44, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

== What This Book Is Not ==

Perhaps it would be simpler to define the narrow scope of what this book ''is'' then the large scope of what it is not. However, in wikibooks tradition, I will attempt to outline my perspective on what this book is and is not, and then open the floor up to discussion on the subject:

#This is not a mathbook. We do not need to teach calculus here, but instead we can assume that people reading this book will have a certain knowledge of calculus before hand. We can certainly point people in the direction of the math bookshelf, however.
#This is not a physics book. There is a certain amount of mathematical rigour that a physics book on this subject will contain that this book will not. It is less important to know the mathematical details that govern a capacitor then it is to know how a capacitor is used in a circuit. To employ a capacitor, for instance, an engineer needs only to run down to RadioShack, and purchase one. We can treat the capacitor then like a black box with a given input/output relationship.
#This book is not open-ended. This book has a very clear scope: It covers time-domain analysis of circuits with DC sources. Within that small framework however, we can write whatever it is we please, so long is we dont break rules 1 and 2. 
#This book is not monolithic. I don't expect that any book will be able to contain the sum total of all knowledge on circuit theory. Even if our subset is restricted to time-domain analysis of DC circuits, we can't possibly hope to include all possible information. This book should instead contain the bare fundamentals, and allow additional &quot;advanced topics&quot; or &quot;corrolary topics&quot; to be given their own books. This way, people can read on specifically the topic they are looking for.
#This is not the [[Electronics]] wikibook. That book has already been written, and there is no sense rewriting a book of that caliber. This book has a specific audience (Electrical Engineering students), and a specific premise (teach the fundamentals without bogging the reader down with unnecessary details).

I think this is a nice layout of what i think this book should and should not be. If people have a differing opinion, please mention it here. For a general outline of my thoughts on the subject, see [[User:Whiteknight|my user page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 21:41, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

== New Sections ==

I would like to add some new material to this book. Specifically, I would like to add more information about 3-phase power, and 3-phase networks (Y and Delta). If anybody else has any requests or suggestions for new material, leave a message here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:54, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

:Also, I would like to include information about Op-Amps, and a few other subjects. I'll get around to it eventually. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:12, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

== Book Components ==

I have created a number of components for use with this book:

*[[Template:Circuit Theory Page]]
*[[Template:Circuit Theory Stub]]
*[[:Category:Electric Circuits]]
*[[:Category:Circuit Theory/Stubs]]

These templates and categories are explained further on their respective module pages and talk pages. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:39, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

== Rework of Book ==
This book has a very attractive goal. However, the signals and systems class that it prepares seems to be evolving away from extending this course, and towards accomplishing the prerequisites for a digital signal processing course. This means more of signals and systems needs to be crammed into this course. What gets left out of this course is the math of differential equations. There is a simple way through differential equations math that will be shown in the re-organization of the book that uses calculus to derive and explain a small  narrow path through differential equations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How the Arabic alphabet was organized has changed over the centuries. First was the abjad order going &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;d&quot; ; Then, someone decided to organize the alphabet by shapes so that letters made with the same shapes went right after each other (it is noeprevalent alphabet organization and used everywhere). Then, recently, someone found a different way to organize it: by type of tail, then by type of shape, then by type of dot.&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;

Remember to read from right to left when reading Arabic letters.

The letters written above are called (starting from the right) ''baa'',  ''taa'', ''thaa'', and ''faa''.
Now don't get confused, the first three do look similar, but are different letters because of the dots. The first letter up there has one dot underneath. The second one has two dots on top. The third has three dots snuggled up in a triangle shape. And the fourth letter has a different shape and only one dot.

The pattern is that all letters are named with the sound they make at the beginning of their names. All letters make consonant sounds.

* Baa (ب) makes the [b] sound like the first sound in &quot;boy&quot;.
* Taa (ت) makes the [‎t̪] sound. This is very similar to the 't' sound in English; however, there are some slight differences that will be imperceptible to English speakers. The sound is made with the tip of the tongue moved slightly forward. Also it is not aspirated. It is exactly the same as the 't' in French.
* Tħaa (ث) makes the [θ] sound. This is like &quot;th&quot; in &quot;think&quot;, ''not'' the one in &quot;they&quot;. Arabic has another letter for that sound.
* Faa (ف) makes the [f] sound, like 'f' in &quot;feel&quot; or 'ph' in the name &quot;Phil&quot;.

All of these letters have the same tail. They connect to letters after them, within a word. Remember, every letter has four forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The U.S. federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq., (the “SCA”) regulates when an electronic communication service (“ECS”) provider may the contents of or other information about a customer’s emails and other electronic communications to private parties.  Congress passed the SCA to prohibit a provider of an electronic communication service “from knowingly divulging the contents of any communication while in electronic storage by that service to any person other then the addressee or intended recipient.”  S.Rep. No. 99-541, 97th Cong. 2nd Sess. 37, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3591.  

==Overview==

The SCA provides that any “person or entity providing an electronic communication service to the public shall not knowingly divulge to any person or entity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage by that service,” with limited exceptions. 18 U.S.C. § 2702(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Under the SCA, “‘contents’, when used with respect to any wire, oral, or electronic communication, includes any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication.”  18 U.S.C. § 2510(8).  

As courts have held, the SCA “protects users whose electronic communications are in electronic storage with an ISP or other electronic communications facility.”  ''Theofel v. Farey-Jones'', 341 F.3d 978, 982 (9th Cir. 2003).

==Providers of Electronic Communication Service vs. Remote Computing Service==

ECPA divides providers covered by the statute into &quot;provider[s] of electronic communication service&quot; and &quot;provider[s] of remote computing service.&quot; To understand these terms, it helps to recall the era in which ECPA, a 1986 statute, was drafted. At that time, network account holders generally used third-party network service providers for two reasons. First, account holders used their accounts to send and receive communications such as e-mail. The use of computer networks to communicate prompted privacy concerns because in the course of sending and retrieving messages, it was common for several computers to copy the messages and store them temporarily. Copies created by these providers of &quot;electronic communication service&quot; and placed in temporary &quot;electronic storage&quot; in the course of transmission sometimes stayed on a provider's computer for several months. See H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 22 (1986).

The second reason account holders used network service providers was to outsource computing tasks. For example, users paid to have remote computers store extra files, or process large amounts of data. When users hired such commercial &quot;remote computing services&quot; to perform tasks for them, they would send a copy of their private information to a third-party computing service, which retained the data for later reference. Remote computing services raised privacy concerns because the service providers often retained copies of their customers' files. See S. Rep. No. 99-541 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3557.

ECPA protects communications held by providers of electronic communication service when those communications are in &quot;electronic storage,&quot; as well as communications held by providers of remote computing service. To that end, the statute defines &quot;electronic communication service,&quot; &quot;electronic storage,&quot; and &quot;remote computing service&quot; in the following way:

===&quot;Electronic communication service&quot;===

An electronic communication service (&quot;ECS&quot;) is &quot;any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications.&quot; 18 U.S.C. § 2510(15). (For a discussion of the definitions of wire and electronic communications, see Chapter 4.C.2, infra.) For example, &quot;telephone companies and electronic mail companies&quot; generally act as providers of electronic communication services. See S. Rep. No. 99-541 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3568; see also FTC v. Netscape Communications Corp., 196 F.R.D. 559, 560 (N.D. Cal. 2000) (noting that Netscape, a provider of e-mail accounts through netscape.net, is a provider of ECS).

The legislative history and case law indicate that the key issue in determining whether a company provides ECS is that company's role in providing the ability to send or receive the precise communication at issue, regardless of the company's primary business. See H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 65 (1986). Any company or government entity that provides others with means of communicating electronically can be a &quot;provider of electronic communication service&quot; relating to the communications it provides, even if providing communications service is merely incidental to the provider's primary function. See Bohach v. City of Reno, 932 F. Supp. 1232, 1236 (D. Nev. 1996) (city that provided pager service to its police officers can be a provider of electronic communication service); United States v. Mullins, 992 F.2d 1472, 1478 (9th Cir. 1993) (airline that provides travel agents with computerized travel reservation system accessed through separate computer terminals can be a provider of electronic communication service).

Conversely, a service cannot provide ECS with respect to a communication if the service did not provide the ability to send or receive that communication. See Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. MAPHIA, 948 F. Supp. 923, 930-31 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (video game manufacturer that accessed private e-mail stored on another company's bulletin board service in order to expose copyright infringement was not a provider of electronic communication service); State Wide Photocopy v. Tokai Fin. Servs. Inc., 909 F. Supp. 137, 145 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (financing company that used fax machines and computers but did not provide the ability to send or receive communications was not provider of electronic communication service).

Significantly, a mere user of ECS provided by another is not an ECS. For example, a web site is not a provider of electronic communication service, even though it may send and receive electronic communications from customers. In Crowley v. Cybersource Corp., 166 F. Supp. 2d 1263, 1270 (N.D. Cal. 2001), the plaintiff argued that Amazon.com (to whom plaintiff sent his name, credit card number, and other identification information) was an electronic communications service provider because &quot;without recipients such as Amazon.com, users would have no ability to send electronic information.&quot; The court rejected this argument, holding that Amazon was properly characterized as a user rather than a provider of ECS. See id.

===&quot;Electronic storage&quot;===

18 U.S.C. § 2510(17) defines &quot;electronic storage&quot; as &quot;any temporary, intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof,&quot; or in the alternative as &quot;any storage of such communication by an electronic communication service for purposes of backup protection of such communication.&quot; The mismatch between the everyday meaning of &quot;electronic storage&quot; and its narrow statutory definition has been a source of considerable confusion. It is crucial to remember that &quot;electronic storage&quot; refers only to temporary storage, made in the course of transmission, by a provider of electronic communication service. For example, the court in In re Doubleclick Inc. Privacy Litigation, 154 F. Supp. 2d 497, 511-12 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), held that cookies, which are information stored on a user's computer by a web site and sent back to the web site when the user accesses the web site, fall outside of the definition of &quot;electronic storage&quot; and hence outside of ECPA because of their &quot;long-term residence on plaintiffs' hard drives.&quot;

To determine whether a communication is in &quot;electronic storage,&quot; it helps to identify the communication's final destination. A copy of a communication is in &quot;electronic storage&quot; only if it is a copy of a communication created at an intermediate point that is designed to be sent on to its final destination. For example, e-mail that has been received by a recipient's service provider but has not yet been accessed by the recipient is in &quot;electronic storage.&quot; See Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service, 36 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir. 1994). At that stage, the copy of the stored communication exists only as a temporary and intermediate measure, pending the recipient's retrieval of the communication from the service provider. Once the recipient retrieves the e-mail, however, the communication reaches its final destination. If a recipient then chooses to retain a copy of the accessed communication on the provider's system, the copy stored on the network is no longer in &quot;electronic storage&quot; because the retained copy is no longer in &quot;temporary, intermediate storage . . . incidental to . . . electronic transmission.&quot; 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17). Rather, because the process of transmission to the intended recipient has been completed, the copy is simply a remotely stored file. See Fraser v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 135 F. Supp. 2d 623, 635-38 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (holding that because an e-mail was acquired from post-transmission storage, it was not in &quot;electronic storage&quot; and its acquisition was not prohibited under ECPA); H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 64-65 (1986) (noting Congressional intent that opened e-mail and voicemail left on a provider's system be covered by provisions relating to remote computing services, rather than provisions relating to services holding communications in &quot;electronic storage&quot;).

As a practical matter, whether a communication is held in &quot;electronic storage&quot; by a provider governs whether that service provides ECS with respect to the communication. The two concepts are coextensive: a service provides ECS with respect to a communication if and only if the service holds the communication in electronic storage. Thus, it follows that if a communication is not in temporary, intermediate storage incidental to its electronic transmission, the service cannot provide ECS for that communication. Instead, the service must provide either &quot;remote computing service&quot; (also known as &quot;RCS,&quot;discussed below), or else neither ECS nor RCS. See discussion infra.

===&quot;Remote computing service&quot;===

The term &quot;remote computing service&quot; (&quot;RCS&quot;) is defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2711(2) as &quot;provision to the public of computer storage or processing services by means of an electronic communications system.&quot; An &quot;electronic communications system&quot; is &quot;any wire, radio, electromagnetic, photooptical or photoelectronic facilities for the transmission of wire or electronic communications, and any computer facilities or related electronic equipment for the electronic storage of such communications.&quot; 18 U.S.C. § 2510(14).

Roughly speaking, a remote computing service is provided by an off-site computer that stores or processes data for a customer. See S. Rep. No. 99-541 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3564-65. For example, a service provider that processes data in a time-sharing arrangement provides an RCS. See H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 23 (1986). A mainframe computer that stores data for future retrieval also provides an RCS. See Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service, 816 F. Supp. 432, 443 (W.D. Tex. 1993) (holding that provider of bulletin board services was a remote computing service). In contrast with a provider of ECS, a provider of RCS does not hold customer files on their way to a third intended destination; instead, they are stored or processed by the provider for the convenience of the account holder. Accordingly, files held by a provider acting as an RCS cannot be in &quot;electronic storage&quot; according to § 2510(17).

Under the definition provided by § 2711(2), a service can only be a &quot;remote computing service&quot; if it is available &quot;to the public.&quot; Services are available to the public if they are available to any member of the general population who complies with the requisite procedures and pays any requisite fees. For example, America Online is a provider to the public: anyone can obtain an AOL account. (It may seem odd at first that a service can charge a fee but still be considered available &quot;to the public,&quot; but this mirrors commercial relationships in the physical world. For example, movie theaters are open &quot;to the public&quot; because anyone can buy a ticket and see a show, even though tickets are not free.) In contrast, providers whose services are open only to those with a special relationship with the provider are not available to the public. For example, employers may offer network accounts only to employees. See Andersen Consulting LLP v. UOP, 991 F. Supp. 1041, 1043 (N.D. Ill. 1998) (interpreting the &quot;providing . . . to the public&quot; clause in § 2702(a) to exclude an internal e-mail system that was made available to a hired contractor but was not available to &quot;any member of the community at large&quot;). Such providers cannot provide remote computing service because their network services are not available to the public.

Whether an entity is a provider of &quot;electronic communication service,&quot; a provider of &quot;remote computing service,&quot; or neither depends on the nature of the particular communication sought. For example, a single provider can simultaneously provide &quot;electronic communication service&quot; with respect to one communication and &quot;remote computing service&quot; with respect to another communication.

==Classifying Types of Information Held by Service Providers==

Network service providers can store different kinds of information relating to an individual customer or subscriber. Consider the case of the e-mail exchange between Joe and Jane discussed above. Jane's service provider, LocalISP, probably has access to a range of information about Jane and her account. For example, LocalISP may have opened and unopened e-mails; account logs that reveal when Jane logged on and off LocalISP; Jane's credit card information for billing purposes; and Jane's name and address. When agents and prosecutors wish to obtain such records, they must be able to classify these types of information using the language of ECPA. ECPA breaks the information down into three categories: basic subscriber information listed in 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(2); &quot;record[s] or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of [the] service&quot;; and &quot;contents.&quot; See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510(8), 2703(c)(1).

===1. Basic Subscriber Information Listed in 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(2)===

18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(2) lists the categories of basic subscriber information:

(A) name; (B) address; (C) local and long distance telephone connection records, or records of session times and durations; (D) length of service (including start date) and types of service utilized; (E) telephone or instrument number or other subscriber number or identity, including any temporarily assigned network address; and (F) means and source of payment for such service (including any credit card or bank account number)[.]

In general, the items in this list relate to the identity of a subscriber, his relationship with his service provider, and his basic session connection records. This list does not include other, more extensive transaction-related records, such as logging information revealing the e-mail addresses of persons with whom a customer corresponded during a prior session. The PATRIOT Act enhanced the categories of basic subscriber information in three respects. See PATRIOT Act § 210, 115 Stat. 272, 283 (2001). It added &quot;records of session times and durations,&quot; as well as &quot;any temporarily assigned network address&quot; to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(2). In the Internet context, these records include the IP address assigned by an Internet service provider to a customer for a particular session. They also include other information relating to account access, such as the originating telephone number for dial-up Internet access or the IP address of a user accessing an account over the Internet. In addition, the PATRIOT Act added to this list of subscriber information the &quot;means and source of payment&quot; that a customer uses to pay for an account, &quot;including any credit card or bank account number.&quot;

===2. Records or Other Information Pertaining to a Customer or Subscriber===

18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1) covers a second type of information: &quot;a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of such service (not including the contents of communications).&quot; This is a catch-all category that includes all records that are not contents, including basic subscriber information.

Common examples of &quot;record[s] . . . pertaining to a subscriber&quot; include transactional records, such as account logs that record account usage; cell-site data for cellular telephone calls; and e-mail addresses of other individuals with whom the account holder has corresponded. See H.R. Rep. No. 103-827, at 10, 17, 31 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3489, 3490, 3497, 3511; United States v. Allen, 53 M.J. 402, 409 (C.A.A.F. 2000) (concluding that &quot;a log identifying the date, time, user, and detailed internet address of sites accessed&quot; by a user constituted &quot;a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber or customer of such service&quot; under ECPA). See also Hill v. MCI Worldcom, 120 F. Supp. 2d 1194, 1195-96 (S.D. Iowa 2000) (concluding that the &quot;names, addresses, and phone numbers of parties . . . called&quot; constituted &quot;a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber or customer of such service&quot; for a telephone account). According to the legislative history of the 1994 amendments to § 2703(c), the purpose of separating the basic subscriber information from other non-content records was to distinguish basic subscriber information from more revealing transactional information that could contain a &quot;person's entire on-line profile.&quot; H.R. Rep. No. 103-827 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3489, 3497, 3511.

===3. Contents===

The contents of a network account are the actual files stored in the account. See 18 U.S.C. § 2510(8) (&quot;'contents,' when used with respect to any wire, oral, or electronic communication, includes any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication&quot;). For example, stored e-mails or voice mails are &quot;contents,&quot; as are word processing files stored in employee network accounts. The subject headers of e-mails are also contents. Cf. Brown v. Waddell, 50 F.3d 285, 292 (4th Cir. 1995) (noting that numerical pager messages provide &quot;an unlimited range of number-coded substantive messages&quot; in the course of holding that the interception of pager messages requires compliance with Title III).

Contents can be further divided into three subcategories: contents stored &quot;in electronic storage&quot; by providers of electronic communication service; contents stored by providers of remote computing services; and contents held by neither. The distinctions among these types of content are discussed in Part B, supra.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==First Amendment Right==
It is well-settled that the U.S. First Amendment shelters the right to speak anonymously.  
*''Buckley v. Am. Constitutional Law Foundation'', [[w:Court Citation|525 U.S. 182]], 200 (1999) (invalidating, on First Amendment grounds, state statute requiring initiative petitioners to wear identification badges); 
*''[[w:Talley v. California|Talley v. California]]'', 362 U.S. 60, 65 (1960) (holding anonymity protected under the First Amendment because forced &quot;“identification and fear of reprisal might deter perfectly peaceful discussions of public matters of importance”&quot;). 
These cases celebrate the important role played by anonymous or pseudonymous writings through history, from the literary efforts of Shakespeare and Mark Twain through the explicitly political advocacy of the Federalist Papers.    

As the Supreme Court has held, “Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority,” that “exemplifies the purpose” of the First Amendment: “to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation...at the hand of an intolerant society.”  ''McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n'', 514 U.S. 334, 357 (1995) (holding that an “author’s decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment”).  

Therefore, courts must “be vigilant... [and] guard against undue hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of ideas.”  Buckley, 525 U.S. at 192.  This vigilant review “must be undertaken and analyzed on a case-by-case basis,” where the court’s “guiding principle is a result based on a meaningful analysis and a proper balancing of the equities and rights at issue.”  ''Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3'', 775 A.2d at 760-761.  Moreover, that review must take place whether the speech in question takes the form of political pamphlets or Internet postings.  ''Reno v. ACLU'', 521 U.S. 844, 870 (1997) (there is “no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment protection that should be applied to” the Internet).

==Case Law==
“Against the backdrop of First Amendment protection for anonymous speech, courts have held that civil subpoenas seeking information regarding anonymous individuals raise First Amendment concerns”. ''Sony Music Entertainment v. Does'', 326 F.Supp.2d 556, 565 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).  See, e.g., ''Doe v. 2theMart.com'', 140 F.Supp.2d 1088 (W.D. Wash. 2001) (granting, on First Amendment grounds, motion to quash subpoena to Internet service provider seeking identification of anonymous posters of messages critical of defendant); ''Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3'', 775 A.2d 756, 771 (N.J. Super. A.D. 2001); (strict procedural safeguards must be imposed “as a means of ensuring that plaintiffs do not use discovery procedures to ascertain the identities of unknown defendants in order to harass, intimidate or silence critics in the public forum opportunities presented by the Internet”); ''Columbia Ins. Co., v. Seescandy.com'', 185 F.R.D. 573, 578 (N.D.Cal.1999) (plaintiff’s desire to seek redress for injury must be balanced against the legitimate and valuable right to participate in online forums anonymously or pseudonymously). 

This has led to courts adopting multi-part tests.
===Columbia Ins. Co. v. Seescandy.com===
In ''Columbia Ins. Co. v. Seescandy.com'', one of the first cases to address this issue, the court required the plaintiff to (1) identify the missing party with sufficient specificity that the court could determine whether the defendant could be sued in federal court; (2) make a good faith effort to communicate with the anonymous defendants and to provide them with notice that the suit had been filed against them – thus assuring them an opportunity to defend their anonymity; and (3) demonstrate that it had viable claims against such defendants.  185 F.R.D. at 579.

===Doe v. 2theMart.com===
In ''Doe v. 2theMart.com'', the court found that the Constitution requires a judicial balancing of four factors before a subpoena can be used to identify anonymous Internet speakers: &quot;[W]hether: (1) the subpoena . . . was issued in good faith and not for any improper purpose, (2) the information sought relates to a core claim or defense, (3) the identifying information is directly and  materially relevant to that claim or defense, and (4) [adequate] information . . . is unavailable from any other source.&quot;

===Sony Entertainment Inc. v. Does===
See also ''Sony Entertainment Inc. v. Does'', 326 F. Supp. 2d 556, 564-65 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (denying motion to quash subpoena to Internet service provider seeking identifying information for anonymous defendant; summarizing and applying and then applied the following criteria:  “(1) a concrete showing of a prima facie claim of actionable harm...  (2) specificity of the discovery request ... (3) the absence of  alternative means to obtain the subpoenaed information... (4) a central need for the subpoenaed information to advance the claim ...  and (5) the party’s expectation of privacy”) (internal citations omitted)

Is it legal to discriminate by creed, or personal belief? (e.g. &quot;No Democrats may rent in this building&quot; or &quot;No Republicans may work for this company&quot;)

Criminal conviction status is not a protected class under any federal law.  Employers are permitted to take a person's criminal convictions into account when making a hiring decision.  In fact, an employer could be exposed to a tort of negligent hire if it failed to check a person's background.  However, because there is a race based differential in criminal conviction rates in this country, adopting an absolute rule again hiring anyone with a criminal background could expose an employer to a disparate impact discrimination complaint.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A statistical test is always about one or more parameters of the concerned population (distribution). The appropiate test depends on the type of null and alternative hypothesis about this (these) parameter(s) and the available information from the sample.

==Example==
It is conjectured that British children gain more weight lately. Hence the population mean &amp;mu; of the weight X of children of let's say 12 years of age is the parameter at stake. In the recent past the mean weight of this group of children turned out to be 45 kg. Hence the null hypothesis (of no change) is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,H_0: \mu = 45&lt;/math&gt;.

As we suspect a gain in weight, the alternative hypothesis is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,H_1: \mu &gt; 45&lt;/math&gt;.

A random sample of 100 children shows an average weight of 47 kg with a standard deviation of 8 kg.

Because it is reasonable to assume that the weights are normally distributed, the appropriate test will be a t-test, with test statistic:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\bar{X} - 45}{S}\sqrt{100}&lt;/math&gt;.

Under the null hypothesis T will be Student distributed with 99 degrees of freedom, which means approximately standard normally distributed.

The null hypothesis will be rejected for large values of T. For this sample the value t of T is:

:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{47 - 45}{8}\sqrt{100} = 2.5&lt;/math&gt;.

Is this a large value? That depends partly on our demands. The so called p-value of the observed value t is:

:&lt;math&gt;p=P(T\ge t; H_0)= P(T\ge 2.5; H_0) \approx P(Z\ge 2.5) &lt;0.01 &lt;/math&gt;,

in which Z stands for a standard normally distributed random variable.

If we are not too critical this is small enough, so reason to reject the null hypothesis and to assume our conjecture to be true.

Now suppose we have lost the individual data, but still know that the maximum weight in the sample was 68 kg. It is not possible then to use the t-test, and instead we have to use a test based on the statistic max(X).

It might also be the case that our assumption on the distribution of the weight is questionable. To avoid discussion we may use a distribution free test instead of a t-test.

A statistical test begins with a hypothesis; the form of that hypothesis determines the type(s) of test(s) that can be used. In some cases, only one is appropriate; in others, one may have some choice.

For example: if the hypothesis concerns the value of a single population mean (&lt;math&gt;\mu &lt;/math&gt;), then a one sample test for mean is indicated. Whether the z-test or t-test should be used depends on other factors (each test has its own requirements).

A complete listing of the conditions under which each type of test is indicated is probably beyond the scope of this work; refer to the sections for the various types of tests for more information about the indications and requirements for each test.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]

Small, open-faced sandwiches, Bruschette make perfect appetizers. They are delicious and quick and easy to make.

Makes about 24 Bruschette 

==Ingredients==
*1 long loaf crusty French [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] 
*3 medium ripe roma [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*3 large fresh [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]] balls
*24 fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] leaves 
*Coarse [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
*Black [[Cookbook: Pepper|pepper]]
*Extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Oregano|Oregano]]
*[[Cookbook:Vinegar#Balsamic vinegar|Balsamic vinegar]]

==Procedure==
#Cut Bread into 1/2&quot; (1.27cm) slices on the diagonal 
#Lightly toast bread in the oven on both sides 
#Cut tomatoes into 1/4 inch (0.75cm) slices and place one on each slice of bread. 
#Cut mozzarella balls into 1/4 inch (0.75cm) slices and place on top of tomato. 
#Chop basil into thin strips and sprinkle on top with the oregano.
#Combine olive oil and balsamic vinegar (to taste) in small bowl
#Drizzle with mixture and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*An optional re-toasting with toppings on will make the mozzarella melt and be even more delicious
*Authentic Italian Bruschetta begins with rubbing roasted garlic cloves on the toasted bread slices

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Too Wordy?==

This is my first edit here, so I'm unsure how well this fits in.  I wrote a lot of description (probably of mediocre quality) due to my experiences at teaching undergraduates, where I noticed that a lot of them needed a lot of work in conceptual foundations in the early part of the course in order to be able to apply the math in later segments.  Usually a lot of students seem to understand the math, but their lack of conceptual understanding means that they don't know how to apply the equations that they learned in class.  I also could not find any guidelines on how heavy this work should be on conceptual explanations.

Feel free to cut out huge chunks.

==N3L Incorrectly Explained?==
The present explnation of N3L uses Fg and normal force (Fn - from the chair)... which is part of the concept of balanced forces in N1&amp;2L...

... but the correct corresponding N3L force for Fg from the earth downwards on the person would be '''the Fg of the person upwards on the earth.'''

This is a very common mistake I see time and time again and leads to continuing confusion by 1st year students on this topic.  A believe a better (albit unconventional) explanation is to restate N3L as &quot;All forces exist between two objects&quot;.  ''There is only one force Fg that acts on both the person and the earth, pulling them together.''

The example given in the present article then places a chair between the person and the earth and complicates the situation by adding two new sets of normal forces - between the top of the chair and the person, and between the bottom of the chair and the earth.

I would suggest a change to reflect what I believe is a clearer explanation.

Hope this helps!

== Structure ==

I was wondering why you would want to structure such a thing. Don't you think its not something that could be standardized? Do you think religion is something that should be universal, or are we in need of a universal set of moral values?
P.S. Surprised to see no one has said anything on this idea. It's a great subject for dispute.  --[[Special:Contributions/68.168.206.55]], 09:34, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

: I agree that it is a great subject for dispute.  Because Wikibooks is a resource, however, it's only function is to convey pertinent information in the most concise manner possible.  The information in this book is certainly pertinent to many readers, but the format of questions, dispute, and persuasiveness requires the reader to come up with their own answers in many cases.  This would be inconsistent with the &quot;textbook&quot; mission of Wikibooks.  If we are to turn this persuasive writing into a textbook, we will have to rewrite it as a resource, which will require additional research and a focus on ''filling existing needs'' rather than ''attempting to create perception of a need'' in the reader.  --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 14:57, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== Globalisation and moral code ==

Hello:
In my opinion, globalisation, global moral questions (e.g., use of fetal stem cells, pollution, global warming, loss of rain forests, and many other examples) necessitate a &quot;universal moral code.&quot; Such a code might be used by global leaders to make important decisions, the kind that will affect our grand-children's future. I think that a suitable &quot;universal religion&quot; need not replace any individual's own personal religion, but it might be something that communities might use to seek/obtain consensus.
However, if this kind of discussion could be useful to students/adults, is there a place in the Wiki entity where it might be placed, please?  [[User:David Hockey|David H]] 22:10, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== Zephram Stark's objection ==

I think that Zephram Stark's objection to the format would rule out many established works that have been regarded as valid textbooks for centuries, in some cases millennia.  The most obvious being Plato's Dialogues.  Socratic dialogue is almost by definition in the form of 'questions, dispute, and persuasiveness' and of course 'requires the reader to come up with their own answers'.  If Plato or Socrates were alive today and proposed to write a textbook of morals would we exclude the Phaedo?  A textbook is not the same thing as a manual.  When I was studying physics the books I used certainly did not contain all of the answers.  I suspect that narrow definitions of textbooks would also exclude such works as Antony Flew's 'An Introduction to Western Philosphy' which is certainly a textbook even though it has no exercises.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 19:18, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

== A Different Perception of Religion ==

Hi all. Just some thoughts to chew on. Most people who would be attracted to a new (old made new) idea of human behaviour to help create a moral ethos, would turn off the second &quot;religion&quot; is mentioned. Unfortunately a growing part of the human race equates religion to disturbance, hate and war. The misdoings of all the religions and power brokers that drive them, have tarnished the unconscious connection we have with our perception of a God. This applies equally to any entity that presents such a being or moral code.
My backgound is in psychotherapy, with a 45 years dedication to the human mind. A while ago I began a program to create an on-line organisation named the Fellowship of Peace, to try to overcome the issues I raised above. It is based on having people take responsibility for their own actions based on there affect on others, as well as themselves. It invites people of all religious beliefs, including non-believers, to adopt a different way of thinking towards others and to work towards a world peace through creating peace internally. Part of that process in involving cause and effect in their decision making, creates a non invasive way of modifying moral codes.
If you are interested take a look at http://www.fellowshipofpeace.net to get the idea. Maybe this will help contributions to this book. I am also more than willing to contribute if anyone thinks this line of thought is a valid part of the book.

: Hello Garyj:
: Yes, I think that there must be many ways to solve the problems that memories-of-old-religious-happenings create in one’s mind!
: But, the Fellowship of Peace’s belief in the existence of “an intelligence that encompasses all things human, animal, vegetable and mineral” prevent me from investigating all of the group’s ideas. What evidence is there to support this belief? Why is it stated? How does such a view effect your group’s ideas?
: Why, as stated in the group’s Principles, must “the greediest, the most powerful must follow . . . (your) peace”? I think that this is a nice thing to hope for, but I do not think that all human beings would follow “peace.” Some need power, control over others, even to hurt others, more than they need peace, surely? For instance, how would the group handle the dictators of the world?
: I wish The Fellowship of Peace success, but I think that the world needs more than I suspect that your organisation may be able to provide.

:: Thanks for the feedback David.
:: The suppositions used here are based on a view of the way individual unconscious programs inpact on the collective unconscious, and visa versa. Dictators like Hitler, and others, would not get the power unless they had a solid support base. The support base comes from the emotional connection to the collective unconscious which is simply the &quot;average&quot; emotional and content memory of the entire population. I know it sounds simplistic, but Hitlers power came from the disatisfaction of the German population at soaring inflation and poor economic management at the time. It was a simple process to blame this (rightly or wrongly) on the financial manipulations of Jewish money, and presto, youu  have a strong, and very angry, following that allowed one man to take control. Dictators seem always to come from perceived oppression of a population or group.
:: Let's now take a look at the reverse scenario. If individuals work to find internal levels of personal peace, the emotional impact on the collective unconscious is lessened gradually so that the stresses and strains in a society are reduced. Under those conditions a dictator has less ability to gain status. By expanding this across borders, there is less chance of war occuring. And make no mistake, it will take generations to start to have a workable effect.
:: The above theory is based on my 40 years of studying the way populations and individuals function, both on a wide scale and at an individual clinical psychotherapy level. One gets a very clear understanding of how people respond in a penetrating clinical role that looks only the the processes and unconcious mind uses to protect an individual!
:: As for the concept of a universal intelligence. I am not referring to an entity. It refers to the total intelligent energy of all matter, solid or otherwise. Ultimately all things are just pure energy. That energy forms solids based on the localised content of the energy, including us. In a study of the basis and core of all religions it is this energy that humans tend to give a human form to. 
:: We don't see it that way. We see everything as being that intelligent energy. It has nothing to do with right or wrong, light or dark, or even morals. Morals and ethics are purely a human concoction to enhance the power of the churches. If a universal religion (and I hate that word because of the perception it creates) is to work, it must be formed from rules of behaviour accepted by the mass of individuals, sometimes after an education process so that individuals understand the desired outcome in an unselfish way. I have said elsewhere in this book that that initial education needs to come from authority figures (parents) in the first five years of life to create a solid base.
:: Would love to have your further feedback.

::: Oh, and just as an aside, the Fellowship of Peace is only one avenue and does not claim to be the whole solution. You are very right in this. It's just that someone needed to do something to start and I couldn't find anyone doing anything. I am excited that you have kicked these discussions off and I take my hat off to you.

::: Hello Gary:
::: Sorry to be so late in replying; we've been on vacation.
::: I agree that all things we know about are &quot;made from energy.&quot; I don’t know what giving a “human form to… energy” means.
::: Sure, churches elaborated morals and ethics, but language-users need some purpose to allow them to say what is the “right” way to behave when “moral” questions are asked. For example, to say whether it is “good” or “bad” to use fetal stem cells, one must have in mind what one hopes to achieve by using them. The hope to get into heaven might prompt one to say “no, don’t use them.” Wishing to advance civilisation might tell one to say “yes, do use them.”

Hi, im new here. 
I believe that the concept of God cannot be separated from the religions. The idea of an universal religion should gather the positive values of them and not an atheistic view of them. The main scope must be to gather most of their believes in order to make them universal.

For example the religions that are more known are the Theist religions. However Buddhists dont workship an especific God, Nevertheless they workship the enlightement. The Enligthement or the supreme knowledge, can be consider as God.
In this way Buddhists could workship God considering him as the total Enlightement, therefore God could be an universal concept within all the religions.  

Also the concept of the afterlife is something extremly important in several religions. One can name it with different names such as Heaven, Nirava, Paradise, enlightenment etc. 
But there is one afterlife. therefore all this ideas could be grasped and mixed, in order to be aware that there is an afterlife, and that will enhace the importance of the practice of moral values. 

In order to develop an universal religion you must combine the ambiguous cultures of their ancient values, with the philosopical knowledge, in order to make an universal religion without any funtamentalist believes.

I personately disagree about what you said about people fighting over who will be a prophet. 
I think that men are sinners, and therefore they can make awfull religious wars, however that dosent spoils the religion. people like that are just behaving in a fundamental way, and they are acting against most of the true values o their own religions.

== the totality of what people are doing ==

a universal religion, will have to look at the totality of what people are doing ie suffering
www.Dhamma.org Yes, I agree. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 13:47, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

== Well isn't this opinionated ==

I believe religion is a personal thing, but it's only my view. But the main fact is this is doing the same thing as giving out Christian leaflets... In my opinion it isn't theology at all - it really should be removed from wikibooks

== A revised Introduction ==
The following was moved from the Introduction to this discussion section. I think that it has not fully considered points addressed in the four Parts. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 12:57, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

: It is pro se that a universal religion must be developed based on widely held values and wisdom.  Although this religion should be rational, it should not be treated or viewed as science.  However, like science its assumptions should be minimal.  As such there is no need for a belief in God.  The function of religion is to reaffirm the communities belief system and values.  It is also self-evident that no single &quot;prophet&quot; or magical revelation should shape the core beliefs.  The world is exhausting itself with fights over the question: &quot;Who is God's prophet?&quot;

== proposal to merge sections ==

I propose that we merge the four sections of the book into one book, using this as the main page of the book and then turning the section titled &quot;developing a universal religion&quot; simply into &quot;Development&quot;. If discussion does not ensue before around a week resulting in a contrary consensus, then I will go ahead and &quot;be bold&quot;. [[User:Emesee|Emesee]] ([[User talk:Emesee|talk]]) 05:54, 2 July 2008 (UTC)
: I think I am going to start &quot;being bold&quot; unless someone waiting to pounce on this starts up a discussion with within the next hour or so, give or take an hour. [[User:Emesee|Emesee]] ([[User talk:Emesee|talk]]) 03:16, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

== tangentially more for later (perhaps) ==

Being human is a subjective experience, no? There are certain parts that may be objective. However, by the vary nature of the term (subjective), we do experience subjective aspects of reality.

What aspects of the things that we experience subjectively could we put into the realm of the objective? Suppose we say that happiness is a preferable state to unhappiness. Is this not an objective truth based on the very nature of definitions of happiness and unhappiness? 

Different things make different people happy and unhappy.

Could we connect certain things with theological truths? ...

== more text for later inclusion or not ==

Let us start by examining the basic tenets of various religions to determine if they are logical and acceptable.

Suppose there is one God. Does that seem realistic? Can you see this God with your eyes? Can you infer the God is there by the effects that occur around you in the same way they infer some mysterious dark energy exists? 

Suppose there is one God, and suppose this God is all good, all knowing, and all powerful. 

Is there anything this God could not do? By definition... [[User:Emesee|Emesee]] ([[User talk:Emesee|talk]]) 03:04, 2 August 2008 (UTC)



Hello Emesee.

I should let you know that the four Parts were/are from a book I published in 2003. I can send you a .pdf file of it, if you want. (Email me if you do want it.)
Your suggestion for “more text for later inclusion or not” sounds like a new exploration. Are you going to start a new book using it?

By Catholic Church Ignatius designated the Christian Church in its universal aspect, excluding heretics, such as those who disavow &quot;the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 7). He called such people &quot;beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 4). (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic)

== It would be a terrible thing to have a Universal Religion ==

I don’t think it is possible artificially create a universal of anything. People are different and have different test and values and different opinions.

It would make more sense to create a “customized” religion that fit for a particular individual or help people to choose the right religion for them.

I am assuming though that the purpose of finding the right religion is to help a person to live a happier life.

== What is &quot;religion?&quot; ==

A common view today, among rationalist and empiricist religious revisionists, is to shoehorn the broad phenomenon of religion into a singular mass self-deception which may have a mix of beneficial and harmful personal and social consequences. While this may be comforting and conducive to hasty conclusions for some, it is in fact quite delusional.

Example. &quot;According to the meta-science of evolutionary psychology, religion is a survival tool, an attempt to develop those 'feelings' that help us survive - dealing with our neighbours, accepting certain constraints and holding certain opinions, working together for some purpose such as world peace international justice, or the glory of God is as much an emotional response to things that we find life-threatening as much as a rational response to 'making the world better'.&quot;

First, evolutionary psychology may be a meta-science or it may just be a hypothetical construction. Tagging something as &quot;science&quot; affords ideas a certain sense of veracity and realness only to a somewhat careless audience. The premise that religion should, at most, be accepted with a wink and a nod, by &quot;realists,&quot; as a social and personal coping mechanism is nothing but an additional careless assumption which only indicates the prejudiced mind of the author.

Empiricism and rationalism are two more religions which preach creation myths to the &quot;faithful&quot; about where consciousness, life and the universe all have their origin. Intoxicating terms like &quot;complexity,&quot; &quot;emergence&quot; and &quot;singularity&quot; are invoked by this clergy to rouse a irrational exuberance in the intellectual true believers.

Such a project as this would do well to reconsider the role and reality of religion in human civilization as well as a complete reevaluation of the extent to which science offers true teleological and eschatological conclusions. Science works within a certain domain and within that domain, it is useful. Beyond that domain, the practitioners and enthusiasts of science have trouble admitting their limitations. This should be remedied. 

With respect to religion, appreciate the diversity and don't hesitate to refer to people such as William James and Emile Durkheim, for starters, for a better understanding of the deep ocean one is wading into while expecting a kiddie pool.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Treatment of Hot Flashes'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Hormonal Therapy==
===Estrogens===
*Estrogen replacement therapy is effective, but its use in BCA patients is not indicated due to an increase in new breast cancer events


*'''HABITS''' (1997-2003)
**Randomized. ''Stopped prematurely for increased risk of breast cancer.'' 434 women randomized/345 at least one follow-up. DCIS to Stage II BCA. Tamoxifen allowed. Arm 1) Hormone replacement therapy (choice allowed locally) x2 years vs. Arm 2) control. HRT given as estrogen only (21%), continuously combined regimens (46%), sequential regimens (26%), and non-protocol treatments or no HRT (6%). In non-HRT group, 18% exposed to HRT
**'''2004''' PMID 14962527 -- &quot;HABITS (hormonal replacement therapy after breast cancer--is it safe?), a randomised comparison: trial stopped.&quot; (Holmberg L, Lancet. 2004 Feb 7;363(9407):453-5.) Median F/U 2.1 years
***Outcome: new breast cancer event HRT 15% vs. non-HRT 5% (SS). LR 6% vs. 1%, DM 6% vs. 3%, contralateral 3% vs. 0.6%
***Conclusion: Hormone-replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms represents unacceptable risk for new breast cancer events

===Progestins===
*Progestins offer significant and long-lasting relief
**'''Depomedroxyprogesterone acetate''' (Depo-Provera): IM injection. 400 mg one dose, can consider additional 500 mg at 2 week intervals x2
**'''Megestrol acetate''': 20 mg PO QD


*'''NCCTG N99C7''' (2002-2004) -- Medroxyprogesterone 400 mg IM vs venlafaxine 75 mg PO
**Randomized. 227 patients with bothersome hot flashes. Tamoxifen, raloxifene, and AI allowed, antineoplastics, androgens, and estrogens not allowed. Arm 1) Medroxyprogesterone (MPA) 400 mg IM x1 vs Arm 2) MPA 500 mg IM x3 Q2W vs Arm 3 venlafaxine 37.5 mg QD x 1 week, then 75 mg QD. Due to slow accrual, Arm 2 was discontinued.
**'''2006''' PMID 16505409 &amp;mdash; &quot;Phase III Comparison of Depomedroxyprogesterone Acetate to Venlafaxine for Managing Hot Flashes: North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trial N99C7.&quot; (Loprinzi CL, JCO 2006 Mar 20;24(9):1409-14.)
***Outcome: reduction in hot flashes MPA 79% vs. venlafaxine 55% (SS), reduction by &gt;50% MPA 74% vs. venlafaxine 46% (SS)
***Toxicity: Better in MPA arm
***Conclusion: Single MPA dose well tolerated and more effective than venlafaxine

==Antiseizure medications==
===[http://www.ezbuyrx.com/buy-gabapentin-neurontin.php Gabapentin]===
Gabapentin was designed as a simple analogue of GABA that would be sufficiently lipid-soluble to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. It turned out to be an effective anticonvulsant in several animal models but, surprisingly, not by acting on GABA receptors. It main site of action appears to be on T-type calcium channel function, by binding to particular channel subunit, and it inhibits the release of various neurotransmitters and modulators, but eh details remain unclear.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Noun Cases exist in Arabic. This allows words to be moved around far more freely than English allows. So why would a language allow such movement of words? Well stylistic reasons of course. A person composing the sentence in their head might put the most important info at the beginning.  It's all about style.
Think about the following sentences:
The dog jumped over the house.
Jumped the dog over the house.
Over the house, jumped the dog.

Notice that the first of those three sentences sounds like completely regular English. Now the other sentences have the words switched around, It doesn't sound like completely regular English, it sounds poetic, in a strange sort of way (It also sounds wrong). Now in Arabic this is done more often than English, because of habit. Arabic also does this (moves words around, keeping same meaning) more often than English because it can afford to without confusing Arabs, or changing the meaning. So how can Arabic do something with words in a sentence that English cannot, simple: noun cases.

Other languages are known for noun-cases, but Arabic uses them in the simplest way. Arabic noun-cases are indicated by vowels Dammah, fatHah, kasrah, and their doubled counterparts (collectively called &quot;tanween&quot;). These marks go at the end of a noun, and are rarely indicated in writing (except for the Quran, and children's books).

Even though Arabic allows more free word order, It is not completely free.  There are limits and there is a default way words go in sentences. Most deviation happens in poetry.

What is important is to learn how to recognize noun cases to help get the meaning of the sentence.

==== CYGWIN ====

This wikibook assumes that you run a UNIX-like operating system.  If your computer runs Windows, you will need to use Cygwin.

CygWin is essentially a [[UNIX]] Like Operating Environment.  That is, CygWin is a Linux Emulator for windows boxes.  CygWin loads a Linux environment into memory on your Windows PC.  This allows you to run [[Native Linux Applications]] on a windows box.  At first, this whole CygWin thing sounds very intimidating.  However, setting up and using CygWin is a very simple process.  

Here is what is necessary for installing CYGWIN on your windows box:  

*Download the install file from the CygWin website. 
**After CygWin has finished downloading, open up the executable by double clicking on it with your left mouse button. 
**A [[wiktionary:splash screen|splash screen]] greets you.  
***Click ''next''. 
**You are presented with a prompt which asks what you want to do.  
***Select the default option of ''Install from Internet'' 
**Select the ''next'' button  
***You are prompted to specify where on your Hard Disk Drive you want to install the CygWin Operating System Environment.  
***If it is not specified as such, change the install directory to &quot;C:\cygwin&quot;
****Here, ''C:'' is the letter that designates your Local Hard Disk Drive 
****Leave the other options set to their Default Values
**Select the ''next'' button
**Next, you are prompted to specify where to save the installation files
***Specify a location on your Hard Disk Drive where you can find them in the future  
***You will probably want to delete them after the installation process is completed
***Select the ''Next'' button 
**The next screen will prompt you to specify your network settings
***If you do not use a [[wiktionary:proxy|proxy]], just click next on this screen
****If you encounter problems at this point, try letting the installer use use Internet Explorer's settings
*****Provided that no problems are encountered, you will be presented with a list of servers from which to download the installation files for CygWin
****Select a download site and then select the ''next'' button
****The installer will download the package list necessary for setting up CygWin
****Once the download is completed, select the ''view'' option at the top of the dialogue box to view the available packages that can be installed. 
**You will need the following packages: 
***autoconf2.59 (or greater) 
***automake1.9 
***bash
***bison
***coreutils
***diff
***diffutils
***flex
***gcc 
***gcc-core
***gcc-g++ 
***grep
***gzip
***make 
***patch
***patchutils 
***subversion 
***tar
***wget 
**Select the packages by clicking where it says ''skip'' 
***''Skip'' should change to a version number for the latest package that is available. 
****Do not worry if other packages are selected
*****Packages that are required by CygWin and by the other packages that you have selected are automatically set to be install 
***When you are finished making the selections of packages, select the ''next'' button
**CygWin will now begin to download and install the selected packages
***This download and install process will usually take a very long time to complete
**After the install has finished, you will have a UNIX Like Operating System ready to run on your windows box

This completes the procedure necessary for installing the CygWin Operating System Environment.  Armed with a UNIX Like emulator on your windows box, you are ready to install the ToolChain.  This process is discussed in the next sectionl.

=== PSP ToolChain ===

In this section of Getting Started--The PlayStation Portable Laboratory, I will explain the procedure necessary for installing the PlayStation Portable ToolChain.  First, though, let me tell you a little about the ToolChain.  You see, Sony Developers use special libraries and header files for creating their PSP Programs, Applications, and Emulators. This collection of libraries and header files are called a ToolChain.  The Sony ToolChain is an official product of Sony Corporation, and it is licensed only for use by those who can afford the massively expensive licensing fee.  That means that most of us cannot afford to use the official product.  Fortunately for us, though, many [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext94/hack12.txt | HACKERS] have done what they do best and created their own version of the PSP ToolChain.  That is the one that I use, since it is [[GPL]] and [[Open Source]] compliant [[Free Software Foundation | FREE Software]].  

So, how do we install the GPL Open Source compliant FREE PSP ToolChain that these HACKERS have created?  The process is actually quite simple.  To install the PSP ToolChain, you will want to use your CygWin System.  What follows is a short explanation of how to set up the PSP ToolChain in your CygWin Operating System Environment.  

First, it is necessary to start up the CYGWIN System.  From the Windows START Menu, choose CygWin &amp;rarr; CygWin Bash Shell.  Otherwise, choose '''run''' &amp;rarr; &quot;C:/cygwin/cygwin.bat&quot;.  A ''Command Line'' will be provided in a [[wiktionary:DOS | DOS Shell Window]].  This is the command line from which you will execute most of the ''commands'' and ''programs'' that you use in CygWin.  On the [[wiktionary:command line | command line]], you should see something along the lines of ''''yourusername@yourcomputername ~'''', which identifies the user account that is being used and the computer upon which the CygWin Operating System Environment is currently running.  

OK, now that you have started your CygWin Operating System Environment and verified that it is working, it is time to shut it down.  Either click the red [X] Box in the upper right hand corner of the DOS Shell Window, or type ''''exit'''' and press the &lt;enter&gt; or &lt;return&gt; key on your computer's keyboard.  It might seem somewhat foolish to start and then stop the CygWin Operating System Environment without actually doing anything with it, but it is a necessary step.  It verifies that everything has been installed up to this point.  

The second step in the PSP ToolChain installation process is to download the latest version of the ToolChain.  Use [http://www.google.com | GOOGLE] or [http://sourceforge.net | SourceForge] or a similar search engine to locate the FREE OpenSource GPL version of the PSP ToolChain.  Download it to your computer's [[wiktionary:Hard Disk Drive | HDD]].  

Once the PSP ToolChain has been downloaded to your machine, you will need to extract the compressed files.  Use an extractor such as WinAce or Winrar to extract the file contents of the PSP ToolChain archive.  Place the extracted file in the ''''C:/cygwin/home/user'''' Directory.  In this case, ''''''user'''''' is your own username [the user account that you saw when you had the CygWin Operating System Environment open a few moments before.  ''See?''  I told you that it was a necessary step to start and then stop the CygWin System before you get to this part.  Doing so allows you to know where the files need to be put.

Since CygWin is not a true Linux Operating System it has a few quirks that must be dealt with.  For instance, rather than the gmake [[wiktionary:parser | parser]] that was used by the majority of the OpenSource FREE GPL PSP ToolChain Development Croo, the CygWin Operating System Environment uses the ''''make'''' parser when [[wiktionary:compile | compiling]] a set of ''C'' or ''C++'' programming scripts.

&lt;noinclude&gt;
The caller is fed up of repeating this move, but is repeating it anyway.

It can also be used as another name for [[Rueda de Casino/Dame|dame]].
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

}}
&lt;noinclude&gt;
When the caller calls dame dos, the leaders all change partners, but miss one out.

An easy way of doing this is to follow the leader in front, watching his back.  If he misses the call, or doesn't know what dame dos is, then that way you shouldn't bump into him.
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
