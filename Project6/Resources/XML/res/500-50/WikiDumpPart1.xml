== The Study of Organic Chemistry ==
Organic chemistry is primarily devoted to the unique properties of the carbon atom and its compounds.  These compounds play a critical role in biology and ecology, Earth sciences and geology, physics, industry, medicine and &amp;mdash; of course &amp;mdash; chemistry.  At first glance, the new material that organic chemistry brings to the table may seem complicated and daunting, but all it takes is concentration and perseverance.  Millions of students before you have successfully passed this course and you can too!

This field of chemistry is based less on formulas and more on reactions between various molecules under different conditions. Whereas a typical general chemistry question may ask a student to compute an answer with an equation from the chapter that they memorized, a more typical organic chemistry question is along the lines of &quot;what product will form when substance X is treated with solution Y and bombarded by light&quot;. The key to learning organic chemistry is to ''understand'' it rather than cram it in the night before a test.  It is all well and good to memorize the mechanism of Michael addition, but a superior accomplishment would be the ability to explain ''why'' such a reaction would take place.

As in all things, it is easier to build up a body of new knowledge on a foundation of solid prior knowledge.  Students will be well served by much of the knowledge brought to this subject from the subject of [[General Chemistry]].  Concepts with particular importance to organic chemists are covalent bonding, Molecular Orbit theory, VSEPR Modeling, understanding acid/base chemistry vis-a-vis pKa values, and even trends of the periodic table.  This is by no means a comprehensive list of the knowledge you should have gained already in order to fully understand the subject of organic chemistry, but it should give you some idea of the things you need to know to succeed in an organic chemistry test or course.

Organic Chemistry is one of the subjects which are very useful and close to our daily life. We always try to figure out some of the unknown mysteries of our daily life through our factious  thinking habit, which generates superstitions. Through the help of chemistry we can help ourselves to get out of this kind of superstition.							
We always try to find the ultimate truth through our own convenience. In the ancient past we had struggled to make things to go as per our need. In that context we have found fire, house, food, transportation, etc…

Now the burning question is: &quot;how can chemistry help our daily life?&quot;  To find the answer of this questions, we have to know the subject thoroughly.  Let us start it from now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Organic Chemistry/Haloalkanes|&lt;&lt; Haloalkanes]] |'''Alkenes'''| [[Organic Chemistry/Alkynes|Alkynes &gt;&gt;]]

Alkenes are [[Organic Chemistry/Glossary#A|aliphatic]] [[Organic Chemistry/Glossary#H|hydrocarbons]] containing carbon-carbon double bonds and general formula C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;.

=Naming Alkenes=
Alkenes are named as if they were alkanes, but the &quot;-ane&quot; suffix is changed to &quot;-ene&quot;.  If the alkene contains only one double bond and that double bond is terminal (the double bond is at one end of the molecule or another) then it is not necessary to place any number in front of the name.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''butane:''' C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
'''butene:''' C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


If the double bond is not terminal (if it is on a carbon somewhere in the center of the chain) then the carbons should be numbered in such a way as to give the first of the two double-bonded carbons the lowest possible number, and that number should precede the &quot;ene&quot; suffix with a dash, as shown below.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''correct:''' pent-2-ene (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
'''incorrect:''' pent-3-ene (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
''The second one is incorrect because flipping the formula horizontally results in a lower number for the alkene.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


If there is more than one double bond in an alkene, all of the bonds should be numbered in the name of the molecule - even terminal double bonds.  The numbers should go from lowest to highest, and be separated from one another by a comma. The IUPAC numerical prefixes are used to indicate the number of double bonds.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''octa-2,4-diene:''' CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHCH=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''deca-1,5-diene:''' CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Note that the numbering of &quot;2-4&quot; above yields a molecule with two double bonds separated by just one single bond.  Double bonds in such a condition are called &quot;conjugated&quot;, and they represent an enhanced stability of conformation, so they are energetically favored as reactants in many situations and combinations.

==EZ Notation==

Earlier in stereochemistry, we discussed cis/trans notation where cis- means same side and trans- means opposite side. Alkenes can present a unique problem, however in that the cis/trans notation sometimes breaks down. The first thing to keep in mind is that alkenes are planar and there's no rotation of the bonds, as we'll discuss later. So when a substituent is on one side of the double-bond, it stays on that side.

[[Image:EZNotation3.png|thumb|400px|center|cis-but-2-ene and trans-but-2-ene]]

The above example is pretty straight-forward. On the left, we have two methyl groups on the same side, so it's cis-but-2-ene. And on the right, we have them on opposite sides, so we have trans-but-2-ene. So in this situation, the cis/trans notation works and, in fact, these are the correct names.

[[Image:EZNotation5.png|thumb|759px|center|(E)-3-methylpent-2-ene and (Z)-3-methylpent-2-ene]]

From the example above, how would you use cis and trans? Which is the same side and which is the opposite side? Whenever an alkene has 3 or 4 differing substituents, one must use the what's called the EZ nomenclature, coming from the German words, Entgegen (opposite) and Zusammen (same).

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |

'''E''': Entgegen, opposite sides of double bond&lt;br&gt;
'''Z''': Zusammen, same sides (zame zides) of double bond
|}

Let's begin with (Z)-3-methylpent-2-ene. We begin by dividing our alkene into left and right halves. On each side, we assign a substituent as being either a high priority or low priority substituent. The priority is based on the atomic number of the substituents. So on the left side, hydrogen is the lowest priority because its atomic number is 1 and carbon is higher because its atomic number is 6.

On the right side, we have carbon substituents on both the top and bottom, so we go out to the next bond. On to the top, there's another carbon, but on the bottom, a hydrogen. So the top gets high priority and the bottom gets low priority.

Because the high priorities from both sides are on the same side, they are Zusammen (as a mnemonic, think 'Zame Zide').

Now let's look at (E)-3-methylpent-2-ene. On the left, we have the same substituents on the same sides, so the priorities are the same as in the Zusammen version. However, the substituents are reversed on the right side with the high priority substituent on the bottom and the low priority substituent on the top. Because the High and Low priorities are opposite on the left and right, these are Entgegen, or opposite.

The system takes a little getting used to and it's usually easier to name an alkene than it is to write one out given its name. But with a little practice, you'll find that it's quite easy.

===Comparison of E-Z with cis-trans===

|[[Image:Cis-2-butene.PNG]]||[[Image:Trans-2-butene.PNG]]
|-
| cis-but-2-ene || trans-but-2-ene
|}

To a certain extent, the Z configuration can be regarded as the ''cis-'' isomer and the E as the ''trans-'' isomers. This correspondence is exact only if the two carbon atoms are identically substituted.

In general, cis-trans should only be used if each double-bonded carbon atom has a hydrogen atom (i.e. R-CH=CH-R').

[http://goldbook.iupac.org/E01882.html IUPAC Gold book on E-Z notation.]

=Properties=

Alkenes are molecules with carbons bonded to hydrogens which contain at least two sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized carbon atoms.  That is, to say, at least one carbon-to-carbon double bond, where the carbon atoms, in addition to an electron pair shared in a ''sigma'' (&amp;sigma;) bond, share one pair of electrons in a ''pi'' (&amp;pi;) bond between them.

The general formula for an aliphatic alkene is: C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt; -- ''e.g.'' C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''or'' C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

==Diastereomerism==

===Restricted rotation===
Because of the characteristics of pi-bonds, alkenes have very limited rotation around the double bonds between two atoms. In order for the alkene structure to rotate the pi-bond would first have to be broken - which would require about 60 or 70 kcal of energy.  For this reason alkenes have different chemical properties based on which side of the bond each atom is located.

For example, but-2-ene exists as two [[Organic Chemistry/Chirality/Diastereomers|diastereomers]]:

&lt;/center&gt;

=Relative stability=
Observing the reaction of the addition of hydrogen to 1-butene, (Z)-2-butene, and (E)-2-butene, we can see that all of the products are butane.  The difference between the reactions is that each reaction has a different energy: -30.3 kcal/mol for 1-butene, -28.6 kcal/mol for (Z)-2-butene and -27.6 kcal/mol for (E)-2-butene.  This illustrates that there are differences in the stabilities of the three species of butene isomers, due to the difference in how much energy can be released by reducing them.

The relative stability of alkenes may be estimated based on the following concepts:
*An internal alkene (the double bond ''not'' on the terminal carbon) is more stable than a terminal alkene (the double bond ''is'' on a terminal carbon).

Internal alkenes are more stable than terminal alkenes because they are connected to more carbons on the chain. Since a terminal alkene is located at the end of the chain, the double bond is only connected to one carbon, and is called primary (1°). Primary carbons are the least stable. In the middle of a chain, a double bond could be connected to two carbons. This is called secondary (2°). The most stable would be quaternary (4°).

*In general, the more and the bulkier the alkyl groups on a sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized carbon in the alkene, the more stable that alkene is.

*A trans double bond is more stable than a cis double bond.

==Preparation==

There are several methods for creating alkenes.&lt;ref&gt;IIT Chemistry by Dr.O.P.Agrawal and Avinash Agrawal&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these methods, such as the Wittig reaction, we'll only describe briefly in this chapter and instead, cover them in more detail later in the book. For now, it's enough to know that they are ways of creating alkenes.

===Dehydrohalogenation of Haloalkanes===

[[Image:Synthesis_of_alkenes_-_Dehydrohalogenation3.png|thumb|400px|center|Synthesis of alkene by dehydrohalogenation]]

Alkyl halides are converted into alkenes by dehydrohalogenation: elimination of the elements of hydrogen halide. Dehydrohalogenation involves removal of the halogen atom together with a hydrogen atom from a carbon adjacent to the one bearing the halogen. It uses the E2 elimination mechanism that we'll discuss in detail at the end of this chapter The haloalkane must have a hydrogen and halide 180° from each other on neighboring carbons. If there is no hydrogen 180° from the halogen on a neighboring carbon, the reaction will not take place. It is not surprising that the reagent required for the elimination of what amounts to a molecule of acid is a strong base for example: alcholic KOH.&lt;p&gt;
     In some cases this reaction yields a single alkene. and in other cases yield a mixture. n-Butyl chloride, for example, can eliminate hydrogen only from C-2 and hence yields only 1-butene. sec-Butyl chloride, on the other hand, can eliminate hydrogen from either C-l or C-3 and hence yields both 1-butene and 2-butene. Where the two alkenes can be formed, 2-butene is the chief product.

===Dehalogenation of Vicinal Dibromides===

[[Image:Synthesis_of_alkenes_from_vicinal_dihalides2.png|thumb|400px|center|Synthesis of alkene via debromination of vicinal dihalides using Sodium Iodide]]

[[Image:Synthesis_of_alkenes_from_vicinal_dihalides1.png|thumb|400px|center|Synthesis of alkene via debromination of vicinal dihalides using Zinc]]

The dehalogenation of vicinal dihalides (halides on two neighboring carbons, think &quot;vicinity&quot;) is another method for synthesizing alkenes. The reaction can take place using either sodium iodide in a solution of acetone, or it can be performed using zinc dust in a solution of either heated ethanol or acetic acid.

This reaction can also be performed with magnesium in ether, though the mechanism is different as this actually produces, as an intermediate, a Grignard reagent that reacts with itself and and causes an elimination, resulting in the alkene.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Dehydration of alcohols===

[[Image:Synthesis_of_alkenes_-_Dehydration_of_alcohol.png|thumb|400px|center|Synthesis of alkene by dehydration of an alcohol]]
An alcohol is converted into an alkene by dehydration: elimination of a molecule of water. Dehydration requires the presence of an acid and the application of heat. It is generally carried out in either of two ways, heating the alcohol with sulfuric or phosphoric acid to temperatures as high as 200, or passing the alcohol vapor over alumina, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; , at 350-400, alumina here serving as a Lewis acid.&lt;p&gt;
Ease of dehydration of alcohols : 3° &gt; 2° &gt; 1° &lt;p&gt;
Where isomeric alkenes can be formed, we again find the tendency for one isomer to predominate. Thus, sec-butyl alcohol, which might yield both 2-butene and 1-butene, actually yields almost exclusively the 2-isomer&lt;p&gt;
The formation of 2-butene from n-butyl alcohol illustrates a characteristic of dehydration that is not shared by dehydrohalogenalion: the double bond can be formed at a position remote from the carbon originally holding the -OH group. This characteristic is accounted for later. It is chiefly because of the greater certainty as to where the double bond will appear that dehydrohalogeation is often preferred over dehydration as a method of making alkenes.

===Reduction of Alkynes===
Reduction of an alkyne to the double-bond stage can unless the triple bond is at the end of a chain yield either a cis-alkene or a trans-alkene. Just which isomer predominates depends upon the choice of reducing agent.&lt;p&gt;
Predominantly trans-alkene is obtained by reduction of alkynes with sodium or lithium in liquid ammonia. Almost entirely cis-alkene (as high as 98%) is obtained by hydrogenation of alkynes with several different catalysts : a specially prepared palladium called Lindlar's catalyst; or a nickel boride called P-2 catalyst.&lt;p&gt; 
Each of these reactions is, then, highly stereoselective. The stereoselectivity in the cis-reduction of alkynes is attributed, in a general way, to the attachment of two hydrogens to the same side of an alkyne sitting on the catalyst surface; presumably this same stereochemistry holds for the hydrogenation of terminal alkynes which cannot yield cis- and trans-alkenes.

===Wittig Reaction===
[[Image:Wittig_reactions.png|thumb|400px|center|Synthesis of alkene via Wittig reaction]]

==Markovnikov's Rule==

Before we continue discussing reactions, we need to take a detour and discuss a subject that's very important in Alkene reactions, &quot;Markovnikov's Rule.&quot; This is a simple rule stated by the Russian Vladmir Markovnikov in 1869, as he was showing the orientation of addition of HBr to alkenes.

His rule states:&quot;When an unsymmetrical alkene reacts with a hydrogen halide to give an alkyl halide, the hydrogen adds to the carbon of the alkene that has the greater number of hydrogen substituents, and the halogen to the carbon of the alkene with the fewer number of hydrogen substituents&quot; (This rule is often compared to the phrase: &quot;The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.&quot; Aka, the Carbon with the most Hydrogens gets another Hydrogen and the one with the least Hydrogens gets the halogen)

This means that the nucleophile of the electophile-nucleophile pair is bonded to the position most stable for a carbocation, or partial positive charge in the case of a transition state. 

===Examples===

&lt;math&gt; CH_2=CH-CH_3 + H-Br -&gt; CH3-CHBr-CH_3 &lt;/math&gt;
Here the Br attaches to the middle carbon over the terminal carbon, because of Markovnikov's rule, and this is called a Markovnikov product.

===Markovnikov product===
The product of a reaction that follows Markovnikov's rule is called a Markovnikov product.

===Markovnikov addition===
Markovnikov addition is an addition reaction which follows Markovnikov's rule, producing a Markovnikov product.

===Anti-Markovnikov addition===
Certain reactions produce the opposite of the Markovnikov product, yielding what is called anti-Markovnikov product. That is, hydrogen ends up on the more substituted carbon of the double bond. The hydroboration/oxidation reaction that we'll discuss shortly, is an example of this, as are reactions that are conducted in peroxides.

A modernized version of Markovnikov's rule often explains the &quot;anti-Markovnikov&quot; behavior. The original Markovnikov rule predicts that the hydrogen (an electrophile) being added across a double bond will end up on the carbon with more hydrogens. Generalizing to all electrophiles, it is really the electrophile which ends up on the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogens. Usually hydrogen plays the role of the electrophile; however, hydrogen can also act as an nucleophile in some reactions. The following expansion of Markovnikov's rule is more versitile:

&quot;When an alkene undergoes electrophilic addition, the electrophile adds to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogen substituents. The nucleophile adds to the more highly substituated carbon.&quot;

Or more simply:

&quot;The species that adds first adds to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogens.&quot;

The fact that some reactions reliably produce anti-Markovnikov products is actually a powerful tool in organic chemistry. For example, in the reactions we discuss below, we'll show two different ways of creating alcohols from alkenes: Oxymercuration-Reduction and Hydroboration/Oxidation. Oxymercuration produces a Markovnikov product while Hydroboration produces an anti-Markovnikov product. This gives the organic chemist a choice in products without having to be stuck with a single product that might not be the most desired.

===Why it works===

Markovnikov's rule works because of the stability of [[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/Carbocations|carbocation intermediates]]. Experiments tend to reveal that carbocations are planar molecules, with a carbon that has three substituents at 120° to each other and a vacant &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital that is perpendicular to it in the 3rd plane. The &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital extends above and below the trisubstituent plane.

This leads to a stabilizing effect called hyperconjugation. Hyperconjugation is what happens when there is an unfilled (antibonding or vacant) C-C &amp;pi; orbital and a filled C-H &amp;sigma; bond orbital next to each other. The result is that the filled C-H &amp;sigma; orbital interacts with the unfilled C-C &amp;pi; orbital and stabilizes the molecule. The more highly substituted the molecule, the more chances there are for hyperconjugation and thus the more stable the molecule is.

Another stabilizing effect is an [[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/Inductive effect|inductive effect]].

===Exceptions to the Rule===
There are a few exceptions to the Markovnikov rule, and these are of tremendous importance to organic synthesis.

# HBr in Hydrogen Peroxide: Due to formation of free radicals, and the mechanism in which it reacts, the alkyl free radical forms at the middle atom, where it is most stable, and a hydrogen attaches itself here. Note here hydrogen addition is the second step, unlike in the above example.

==Addition reactions==

===Hydroboration===

Hydroboration is a very useful reaction in Alkenes, not as an end product so much as an intermediate product for further reactions. The primary one we'll discuss below is the Hydroboration/Oxidation reaction which is actually an a hydroboration reaction followed by a completely separate oxidation reaction.

[[Image:Hydroboration_mechanism_in_alkene.png|759px|thumb|center|Hydroboration mechanism]]

The addition of BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a concerted reaction in that several bonds are broken and formed at the same time. Hydroboration happens in what's called [[Organic_Chemistry/Glossary#S|syn-addition]] because the boron and one of its hydrogens attach to the same side of the alkene at the same time. As you can see from the transition state in the center of the image, this produces a sort of box between the two alkene carbons and the boron and its hydrogen. In the final step, the boron, along with its other two hydrogens, remains attached to one carbon and the other hydrogen attaches to the adjacent carbon.

This description is fairly adequate, however, the reaction actually continues to happen and the -BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; continue to react with other alkenes giving an R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH and then again, until you end up with a complex of the boron atom attached to 3 alkyl groups, or R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B.

This trialkyl-boron complex is then used in other reactions to produce various products.
&lt;center&gt;
{|
|[[Image:Borane-state.png|150px|thumb|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; complex]]||[[Image:Bh3-thf-complex.png|150px|thumb|BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-THF complex]]
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Borane, in reality, is not stable as BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Boron, in this configuration has only 6 electrons and wants 8, so in its natural state it actually creates the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; complex shown on the left.

Furthermore, instead of using B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; itself, BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is often used in a complex with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as shown in the image on the right.In either situation, the result of the reactions are the same.

===Hydroboration/Oxidation===
&lt;ref name=McMurry&gt;Organic Chemistry, John McMurry&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Hydroboration_oxdation_of_alkene.png|500px|thumb|center|Hydroboration/Oxidation reaction]]

With the reagent diborane, (BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, alkenes undergo hydroboration to yield alkylboranes, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B, which on oxidation give alcohols.The reaction procedure is simple and convenient, the yields are exceedingly high, and the products are ones difficult to obtain from alkenes in anyother way.&lt;p&gt;
Diborane is the dimer of the hypothetical BH3 (borane) and, in the reactions that concern us, acts much as though it were BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; . Indeed, in tetrahydrofuran, one of the solvents used for hydroboration, the reagent exists as the monomer, in the form of an acid-base complex with the solvent.&lt;p&gt; Hydroboration involves addition to the double bond of BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (or, in following
stages, BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R and BHR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with hydrogen becoming attached to one doubly-bonded
carbon, and boron to the other. The alkylborane can then undergo oxidation,
in which the boron is replaced by -OH. &lt;p&gt; Thus, the two-stage reaction process of hydroboration-oxidation permits, in effect, the addition to the carbon-carbon double bond of the elements of H-OH.&lt;p&gt;
Reaction is carried out in an ether, commonly tetrahydrofuran or &quot;diglyme&quot;
(diethylene glycol methyl ether, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Diborane is
commercially available in tetrahydrofuran solution. The alkylboranes are not
isolated, but are simply treated in situ with alkaline hydrogen peroxide.
=====Stereochemistry and Orientation=====
Hydroboration-oxidation, then, converts alkenes into alcohols. Addition is highly regiospecific; the preferred product here, however, is exactly opposite to the one formed by oxymercuration-demercuration or by direct acid-catalyzed hydration.&lt;p&gt;
The hydroboration-oxtdation process gives products corresponding to &lt;b&gt;anti-Markovnikov&lt;/b&gt;
addition of water to the carbon-carbon double bond.&lt;p&gt;
The reaction of 3,3-dimethyl-l -butene illustrates a particular advantage of the
method. Rearrangement does not occur in hydroboration evidently because
carbonium ions are not intermediates and hence the method can be used without
the complications that often accompany other addition reactions.
The reaction of 1,2-dimethylcyclopentene illustrates the stereochemistry of
the synthesis: hydroboration-oxidation involves overall&lt;b&gt; syn addition&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

===Oxymercuration/Reduction===
&lt;ref name=McMurry/&gt;
[[Image:Oxymercuration_reduction.png|500px|thumb|center|Oxymercuration/Reduction of 1-propene]]

Alkenes react with mercuric acetate in the presence of water to give hydroxymercurial compounds which on reduction yield alcohols.&lt;p&gt; The first stage, oxymercuration, involves addition to the carbon-carbon double bond of -OH and -HgOAc. Then, in reduction, the -HgOAc is replaced by -H. The reaction sequence amounts to hydration of the alkene, but is much more widely applicable than direct hydration.&lt;p&gt;
The two-stage process of oxymercuration/reduction is fast and convenient, takes place under mild conditions, and gives excellent yields often over 90%. The alkene is added at room temperature to an aqueous solution of mercuric acetate diluted with the solvent tetrahydrofuran. Reaction is generally complete within minutes. The organomercurial compound is not isolated but is simply reduced in situ by sodium borohydride, NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. (The mercury is recovered as a ball of elemental mercury.)&lt;p&gt;
Oxymercuration/reduction is highly regiospecific, and gives alcohols corresponding to Markovnikov addition of water to the carbon-carbon doublen bond.&lt;p&gt;
Oxymercuration involves electrophilic addition to the carbon-carbon double bond, with the mercuric ion acting as electrophile. The absence of rearrangement and the high degree of stereospecificity (typically anti) in the oxymercuration step argues against an open carbonium ion as intermediate. Instead, it has been proposed, there is formed a cyclic mercurinium ion, analogous to the bromonium and chloronium ions involved in the addition of halogens. In 1971, Olah reported spectroscopic evidence for the preparation of stable solutions of such mercurinium ions.&lt;p&gt;
The mercurinium ion is attacked by the nucleophilic solvent water, in the
present case to yield the addition product. This attack is back-side (unless prevented
by some structural feature) and the net result is anti addition, as in the
addition of halogens. Attack is thus of the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 type; yet the orientation
of addition shows that the nucleophile becomes attached to the more highly substituted
carbon as though there were a free carbonium ion intermediate. As we
shall see, the transition state in reactions of such unstable threemembered
rings has much S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 character.&lt;p&gt; Reduction is
generally not stereospecific and can, in certain special cases, be accompanied by
rearrangement.&lt;p&gt; Despite the stereospecificity of the first stage, then, the overall process is not,in general, stereospecific. Rearrangements can occur, but are not common. The
reaction of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene illustrates the absence of the rearrangements
that are typical of intermediate carbonium ions.

===Diels-Alder Reaction===

The Diels–Alder reaction is a reaction (specifically, a cycloaddition) between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene, commonly termed the dienophile, to form a substituted cyclohexene system. The reaction can proceed even if some of the atoms in the newly formed ring are not carbon. Some of the Diels–Alder reactions are reversible; the decomposition reaction of the cyclic system is then called the retro-Diels–Alder. &lt;p&gt;
[[Image: Diels-alder_(1,3-butadiene_-_Ethylene).png|500px|thumb|center|Diels-alder for 1,3-butadiene-Ethylene]]

The Diels–Alder reaction is generally considered one of the more useful reactions in organic chemistry since it requires very little energy to create a cyclohexene ring, which is useful in many other organic reactions &lt;p&gt;
A concerted, single-step mechanism is almost certainly involved; both new carbon-carbon bonds are partly formed in the same transition state, although not necessarily to the same extent. The Diels-Alder reaction is the most important example of cycloaddition. Since reaction involves a system of 4 π electrons (the diene) and a system of 2 π it electrons (the dienophile), it is known as a [4 + 2] cycloaddition.

===Catalytic addition of hydrogen===
Catalytic hydrogenation of alkenes produce the corresponding alkanes. The reaction is carried out under pressure in the presence of a metallic catalyst. Common industrial catalysts are based on platinum, nickel or palladium, but for laboratory syntheses, [[w:Raney nickel|Raney nickel]] (formed from an alloy of nickel and aluminium) is often employed.

The catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene to yield ethane proceeds thusly:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + catalyst → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Electrophilic addition===

Most addition reactions to alkenes follow the mechanism of electrophilic addition. An example is the [[w:Prins reaction|Prins reaction]], where the electrophile is a carbonyl group.

====Halogenation====

Addition of elementary bromine or chlorine in the presence of an organic solvent to alkenes yield vicinal dibromo- and dichloroalkanes, respectively.

The decoloration of a solution of bromine in water is an analytical test for the presence of alkenes: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → BrCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br

The reaction works because the high electron density at the double bond causes a temporary shift of electrons in the Br-Br bond causing a temporary induced dipole. This makes the Br closest to the double bond slightly positive and therefore an electrophile.

====Hydrohalogenation====
Addition of hydrohalic acids like HCl or HBr to alkenes yield the corresponding haloalkanes.

:an example of this type of reaction: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HBr → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CHBr-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

If the two carbon atoms at the double bond are linked to a different number of hydrogen atoms, the halogen is found preferentially at the carbon with less hydrogen substituents (Markovnikov's rule).

Addition of a carbene or carbenoid yields the corresponding cyclopropane

===Oxidation===
Alkenes are oxidized with a large number of oxidizing agents.  In the presence of oxygen, alkenes burn with a bright flame to form carbon dioxide and water.  Catalytic oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with percarboxylic acids yields epoxides.

Reaction with ozone in ozonolysis leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two aldehydes or ketones:
R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CH=CH-R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CHO + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CHO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This reaction can be used to determine the position of a double bond in an unknown alkene.

===Polymerization===
Polymerization of alkenes is an economically important reaction which yields polymers of high industrial value, such as the plastics polyethylene and polypropylene. Polymerization can either proceed via a free-radical or an ionic mechanism.

=Substitution and Elimination Reaction Mechanisms=

==Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions==
Nucleophilic substitution reactions ('''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''') are very closely related to the '''E1''' and '''E2''' elimination reactions, discussed later in this section, and it is generally a good idea to learn the reactions together, as there are parallels in reaction mechanism, preferred substrates, and the reactions sometimes compete with each other.

It's important to understand that substitution and elimination reactions are not associated with a specific compound or mixture so much as they're a representation of how certain reactions take place. At times, combinations of these mechanisms may occur together in the same reaction or may compete against each other, with influences such as solvent or nucleophile choice being the determining factor as to which reaction will dominate.

&lt;H3&gt;Note&lt;/H3&gt;
In the notation '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2, '''

:'''S''' stands for ''substitution'' (something takes the place of something else)&lt;br&gt;
:'''N''': stands for ''nucleophilic'' (a '''nucleophile''' displaces another nucleophile)&lt;br&gt;
:'''1''': stands for ''unimolecular'' (the concentration of only one kind of molecule determines the rate of the reaction)&lt;br&gt;
:'''2''': stands for ''bimolecular'' (the concentration of two types of molecules determine the rate of the reaction)
|}

In nucleophilic substitution, a '''nucleophile''' attacks a molecule and takes the place of another nucleophile, which then leaves. The nucleophile that leaves is called the '''leaving group'''.

Nucleophilic substitutions ''require ''
#a '''nucleophile''' (such as a Lewis base)
#an '''electrophile''' with a '''leaving group'''

A '''leaving group''' is a charged or neutral moiety (group) which breaks free.

===S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 vs S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2===
One of the main differences between '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' is that the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' reaction is a 2-step reaction, initiated by disassociation of the leaving group. The '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reaction, on the other hand, is a 1-step reaction where the attacking nucleophile, because of its higher affinity for and stronger bonding with the carbon, forces the leaving group to leave. These two things happen in a single step.

These two different mechanisms explain the difference in reaction rates between '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions. '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' reactions are dependent on the leaving group disassociating itself from the carbon. It is the rate-limiting step and thus, the reaction rate is a first-order reaction whose rate depends solely on that step.

:&lt;math&gt;Rate = k[RX]&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, in '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions, the single step of the nucleophile coming together with the reactant from the opposite side of the leaving group, is the key to its rate. Because of this, the rate is dependent on both the concentration of the nucleophile as well as the concentration of the reactant. The higher these two concentrations, the more frequent the collisions. Thus the reaction rate is a second-order reaction:

:&lt;math&gt;Rate = k[Nu:][RX]&lt;/math&gt; (where Nu: is the attacking nucleophile)

===S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 Reactions===

There are primarily 3 things that affect whether an '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reaction will take place or not. The most important is structure. That is whether the alkyl halide is on a methyl, primary, secondary, or tertiary carbon. The other two components that determine whether an '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reaction will take place or not, are the nucleophilicity of the nucleophile and the solvent used in the reaction.

|}

The structure of the alkyl halide has a great effect on mechanism. CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;X &amp; RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X are the preferred structures for '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2'''. R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHX can undergo the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' under the proper conditions (see below), and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CX rarely, if ever, is involved in '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions.

[[Image:SN2CompleteReactionMechanism3.png|frame|center|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 nucleophilic substitution of bromine with a generic nucleophile]]

The reaction takes place by the nucleophile attacking from the opposite side of the bromine atom. Notice that the other 3 bonds are all pointed away from the bromine and towards the attacking nucleophile. When these 3 bonds are hydrogen bonds, there's very little steric hinderance of the approaching nucleophile. However, as the number of R groups increases, so does the steric hinderance, making it more difficult for the nucleophile to get close enough to the [[w:alpha carbon|α-carbon]], to expel the bromine atom. In fact, tertiary carbons (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CX) are so sterically hindered as to prevent the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' mechanim from taking place at all.

In the case of this example, a secondary α-carbon, there is still a great deal of steric hinderance and and whether the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' mechanism will happen will depend entirely on what the nucleophile and solvent are. '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions are preferred for methyl halides and primary halides.

Another important point to keep in mind, and this can be seen clearly in the example above, during an '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reaction, the molecule undergoes an inversion. The bonds attached to the α-carbon are pushed away as the nucleophile approaches. During the transition state, these bonds become planar with the carbon and, as the bromine leaves and the nucleophile bonds to the α-carbon, the other bonds fold back away from the nucleophile. This is particularly important in [[Organic_Chemistry/Chirality|chiral]] or pro-chiral molecules, where an R configuration will be converted into an S configuration and vice versa. As you'll see below, this is in contrast to the results of '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' reactions.

'''Examples:'''

:OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;—Cl → HO—CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

OH- is the nucleophile, Cl is the electrophile, HOCH3 is the product, and Cl- is the leaving group.

or,

:Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Br → I-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The above reaction, taking place in acetone as the solvent, sodium and iodide disassociate almost completely in the acetone, leaving the iodide ions free to attack the CH-Br molecules. The negatively charged iodide ion, a nucleophile, attacks the methyl bromide molecule, forcing off the negatively charged bromide ion and taking its place. The bromide ion is the leaving group.

====Nucleophilicity====
Nucleophilicity is the rate at which a nucleophile displaces the leaving group in a reaction. Generally, nucleophilicity is stronger, the larger, more polarizable, and/or the less stable the nucleophile. No specific number or unit of measure is used. All other things being equal, nucleophiles are generally compared to each other in terms of relative reactivity. For example, a particular strong nucleophile might have a relative reactivity of 10,000 that of a particular weak nucleophile. These relationships are generalities as things like solvent and substrate can affect the relative rates, but they are generally good guidelines for which species make the best nucleophiles.

All nucleophiles are [[Organic Chemistry/Foundational concepts of organic chemistry/Acids and bases|Lewis bases]]. In '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions, the preferred nucleophile is a strong nucleophile that is a weak base. Examples of these are N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, RS&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

Alternatively, a strong nucleophile that's also a strong base can also work. However, as mentioned earlier in the text, sometimes reaction mechanisms compete and in the case of a strong nucleophile that's a strong base, the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' mechanism will compete with the '''E2''' mechanism. Examples of strong nucleophiles that are also strong bases, include RO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

|}


====Leaving Group====
Leaving group is the group on the substrate that leaves. In the case of an alkyl halide, this is the halide ion that leaves the carbon atom when the nucleophile attacks. The tendency of the nucleophile to leave is

| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;bottom&quot; |

&lt;H3&gt;Relative Reactivity of Leaving Groups&lt;/H3&gt;
I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt;&gt; F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
Fluoride ions are very poor leaving groups because they bond very strongly and are very rarely used in alkyl halide substitution reactions. Reactivity of a leaving group is related to its basicity with stronger bases being poorer leaving groups.

====Solvent====

The solvent can play an important role in '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions, particularly in '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' involving secondary alkyl halide substrates, where it can be the determining factor in mechanism. Solvent can also have a great effect on reaction rate of '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions.

The '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' mechanism is preferred when the solvent is an aprotic, [[Organic Chemistry/Foundational concepts of organic chemistry/Electronegativity|polar]] solvent. That is, a solvent that is polar, but without a polar hydrogen. Polar, protic solvents would include water, alcohols, and generally, solvents with polar NH or OH bonds. Good aprotic, polar solvents are [[w:Hexamethylphosphoramide|HMPA]], CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, [[w:Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], and [[w:Dimethylformamide|DMF]].

A polar solvent is preferred because it better allows the dissociation of the halide from the alkyl group. A protic solvent with a polar hydrogen, however, forms a 'cage' of hydrogen-bonded solvent around the nucleophile, hindering its approach to the substrate.

|}

===S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 Reactions===
The '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism is very different from the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' mechanism. In some of its preferences, its exactly the opposite and, in some cases, the results of the reaction can be significantly different.

Like the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' mechanism, structure plays an important role in the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism. The role of structure in the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism, however, is quite different and because of this, the reactivity of structures is more or less reversed.

|}

The '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism is preferred for tertiary alkyl halides and, depending on the solvent, may be preferred in secondary alkyl halides. The '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism does not operate on primary alkyl halides or methyl halides. To understand why this is so, let's take a look at how the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism works.

[[Image:SN1CompleteMechanism2.png|frame|center|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 nucleophilic substitution of a generic halide with a water molecule to produce an alcohol.]]

At the top of the diagram, the first step is the spontaneous dissociation of the halide from the alkyl halide. Unlike the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' mechanism, where the attacking nucleophile causes the halide to leave, the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism depends on the ability of the halide to leave on its own. This requires certain conditions. In particular, the stability of the [[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/Carbocations|carbocation]] is crucial to the ability of the halide to leave. Since we know tertiary carbocations are the most stable, they are the best candidates for the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism. And with appropriate conditions, secondary carbocations will also operate by the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism. Primary and methyl carbocations however, are not stable enough to allow this mechanism to happen.

Once the halide has dissociated, the water acts as a nucleophile to bond to the carbocation. In the'''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions, there is an inversion caused by the nucleophile attacking from the opposite side while the halide is still bonded to the carbon. In the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism, since the halide has left, and the bonds off of the α-carbon have become planar, the water molecule is free to attack from either side. This results in, primarily, a [[w:Racemic|racemic]] mixture. In the final step, one of the hydrogens of the bonded water molecule is attacked by another water molecule, leaving an alcohol.

''Note: Racemic mixtures imply entirely equal amounts of mixture, however this is rarely the case in '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1'''. There is a slight tendency towards attack from the opposite side of the halide. This is the result some steric hinderence from the leaving halide which is sometimes close enough to the leaving side to block the nucleophile's approach from that side.''

====Solvent====
Like the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' mechanism, the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' is affected by solvent as well. As with structure, however, the reasons differ. In the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' mechanism, a polar, protic solvent is used. The polarity of the solvent is associated with the dielectric constant of the solvent and solutions with high dielectric constants are better able to support separated ions in solution. In '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions, we were concerned about polar hydrogen atoms &quot;caging&quot; our nucleophile. This still happens with a polar protic solvent in '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' reactions, so why don't we worry about it? You have to keep in mind the mechanism of the reaction. The first step, and more importantly, the rate-limiting step, of the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' reaction, is the ability to create a stable carbocation by getting the halide anion to leave. With a polar protic solvent, just as with a polar aprotic solvent,we're creating a stable cation, however it's the polar hydrogens that stabilize the halide anion and make it better able to leave. Improving the rate-limiting step is always the goal. The &quot;caging&quot; of the nucleophile is unrelated to the rate-limiting step and even in its &quot;caged&quot; state, the second step, the attack of the nucleophile, is so much faster than the first step, that the &quot;caging&quot; can simply be ignored.

===Summary===

'''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''', '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''', '''E1''', and '''E2''', are all reaction mechanisms, not reactions themselves. They are mechanisms used by a number of different reactions. Usually in organic chemistry, the goal is to synthesize a product. In cases where you have possibly competing mechanisms, and this is particularly the case where an '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' and an '''E1''' reaction are competing, the dominating mechanism is going to decide what your product is, so knowing the mechanisms and which conditions favor one over the other, will determine your product.

In other cases, knowing the mechanism allows you to set up an environment favorable to that mechanism. This can mean the difference between having your product in a few minutes, or sometime around the next ice age.

So when you're designing a synthesis for a product, you need to consider, I want to get product Y, so what are my options to get to Y? Once you know your options and you've decided on a reaction, then you need to consider the mechanism of the reaction and ask yourself, how do I create conditions that are going to make this happen correctly and happen quickly?

==Elimination Reactions==
Nucleophilic substitution reactions and Elimination reactions share a lot of common characteristics, on top of which, the '''E1''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' as well as '''E2''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions can sometimes compete and, since their products are different, it's important to understand them both. Without understanding both kinds of mechanisms, it would be difficult to get the product you desire from a reaction.

In addition, the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions will be referenced quite a bit by way of comparison and contrast, so it's probably best to read that section first and then continue here.

Elimination reactions are the mechanisms for creating alkene products from [[Organic_Chemistry/Haloalkanes|haloalkane]] reactants. '''E1''' and '''E2''' elimination, unlike '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' substitution, mechanisms do not occur with methyl halides because the reaction creates a double bond between two carbon atoms and methylhalides have only one carbon.

In the notation '''E1''' and '''E2''',

:'''1''': stands for ''unimolecular'' (the concentration of only one kind of molecule determines the rate of the reaction)&lt;br&gt;
:'''2''': stands for ''bimolecular'' (the concentration of two types of molecules determine the rate of the reaction)

===E1 vs E2===

==== Reaction rates ====

'''E1''' and '''E2''' are two different pathways to creating alkenes from haloalkanes. As with '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions, one of the key differences is in the reaction rate, as it provides great insight into the mechanisms.

'''E1''' reactions, like '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' reactions are 2-step reactions. Also like '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' reactions, the rate-limiting step is the dissociation of the halide from its alkane, making it a first-order reaction, depending on the concentration of the haloalkane, with a reaction rate of:

:&lt;math&gt;Rate = k[RX]&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, '''E2''' reactions, like '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions are 1-step reactions. And again, as with '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2''' reactions, the rate limiting step is the ability of a nucleophile to attach to the alkane and displace the halide. Thus it is a second-order reaction that depends on the concentrations of both the nucleophile and haloalkane, with a reaction rate of:

:&lt;math&gt;Rate = k[Nu:][RX]&lt;/math&gt; (where Nu: is the attacking nucleophile)

==== Zaitsev's Rule ====

[[Organic_Chemistry/Glossary#W, X, Y, Z|Zaitsev's rule]] (sometimes spelled &quot;Saytzeff&quot;) states that in an elimination reaction, when multiple products are possible, the most stable alkene is the major product. That is to say, the most highly substituted alkene (the alkene with the most non-hydrogen substituents) is the major product.

Both '''E1''' and '''E2''' reactions produce a mixture of products, when possible, but generally follow Zaitsev's rule. We'll see below why '''E1''' reactions follow Zaitsev's rule more reliably and tend to produce a purer product.

[[Image:Dehydrohalogenation_of_(S)-2-bromo-3-methylbutane_small.png|frame|center|'''Dehydrohalogenation reaction of (S)-2-bromo-3-methylbutane''']]

The above image represents two possible pathways for the dehydrohalogenation of (S)-2-bromo-3-methylbutane. The two potential products are 2-methylbut-2-ene and 3-methylbut-1-ene. The images on the right are simplified drawings of the molecular product shown in the images in the center.

As you can see on the left, the bromine is on the second carbon and in an '''E1''' or '''E2''' reaction, the hydrogen could be removed from either the 1st or the 3rd carbon. Zaitsev's rule says that the hydrogen will be removed predominantly from the 3rd carbon. In reality, there will be a mixture, but most of the product will be 2-methylbut-2-ene by the '''E1''' mechanism. By the '''E2''' reaction, as we'll see later, this might not necessarily be the case.

===E2===

RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X &gt; R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHX &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CX

|}

The '''E2''' mechanism is concerted and higly stereospecific, because it can occur only when the H and the leaving group X are in an anti-coplanar position. That is, in a Newman projection, the H and X must be 180°, or in the anti-configuration. This behaviour stems from the best overlap of the 2''p'' orbitals of the adjacent carbons when the pi bond has to be formed. If the H and the leaving group cannot be brought into this position due to the structure of the molecule, the ''E2'' mechanism will not take place.

[[Image:E2-eliminationmechanism.png|frame|center|'''Mechanism of E2 elimination. Note the anti-coplanarity of the X-C-C-H atoms''']]

Therefore, only molecules having accessible H-X anti-coplanar conformations can react via this route. Furthermore, the '''E2''' mechanism will operate contrary to Zaitsev's rule if the only anti-coplanar hydrogen from the leaving group results in the least stable alkene. A good example of how this can happen is by looking at how cyclohexane and cyclohexene derivatives might operate in '''E2''' conditions.

[[Image:E2-Elimination_with_sterics_sample3.png|frame|center|'''E2''' with preferential elimination]]

Let's look at the example above. The reactant we're using is 1-chloro-2-isopropylcyclohexane. The drawing at the top left is one conformation and the drawing below is after a ring flip. In the center are Newman projections of both conformations and the drawings on the right, the products.

If we assume we're treating the 1-chloro-2-isopropylcyclohexane with a strong base, for example CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (ethanolate), the mechanism that dominates is '''E2'''. There are 3 hydrogens off of the carbons adjacent to our chlorinated carbon. The red and the green ones are two of them. The third would be hard to show but is attached to the same carbon as the red hydrogen, angled a little down from the plane and towards the viewer. The red hydrogen is the only hydrogen that's 180° from the chlorine atom, so it's the only one eligible for the '''E2''' mechanism. Because of this, the product is going to be only 3-isopropylcylcohex-1-ene. Notice how this is contrary to Zaitsev's rule which says the most substituted alkene is preferred. By his rule, 1-isopropylcyclohexene should be our primary product, as that would leave the most substituted alkene. However it simply can't be produced because of the steric hindrance.

The images below shows the molecule after a ring flip. In this conformation, no product is possible. As you can see from the Newman projection, there are no hydrogens 180° from the chlorine atom.

So it's important, when considering the '''E2''' mechanism, to understand the geometry of the molecule. Sometimes the geometry can be used to your advantage to preferentially get a single product. Other times it will prevent you from getting the product you want, and you'll need to consider a different mechanism to get your product.

''Note: Often the word '''periplanar''' is used instead of '''coplanar'''. '''Coplanar''' implies precisely 180 degree separation and &quot;peri-&quot;, from Greek for &quot;near&quot;, implies near 180 degrees. Periplanar may actually be more accurate. In the case of the 1-chloro-3-isopropylcyclohexane example, because of molecular forces, the chlorine atom is actually slightly less than 180 degrees from both the hydrogen and the isopropyl group, so in this case, '''periplanar''' might be a more correct term.''

===E1===


[[Image:E1EliminationReaction.png|frame|center|E1 elimination of an alkyl halide by a base]]


The '''E1''' mechanism begins with the dissociation of the leaving group from an alkyl, producing a carbocation on the alkyl group and a leaving anion. This is the same way the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' reaction begins, so the same thing that helps initiate that step in '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' reactions, help initiate the step in '''E1''' reactions. More specifically, secondary and tertiary carbocations are preferred because they're more stable than primary carbocations. The choice of solvent is the same as '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' as well; a polar protic solvent is preferred because the polar aspect stabilizes the carbocation and the protic aspect stabilizes the anion.

What makes the difference between whether the reaction takes the '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1''' or '''E1''' pathway then, must depend on the second step; the action of the nucleophile. In '''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1'''  reactions, a strong nucleophile that's a weak base is preferred. The nucleophile will then attack and bond to the carbocation. In '''E1''' reactions, a strong nucleophile is still preferred. The difference is that a strong nucleophile that's also a strong base, causes the nucleophile to attack the hydrogen at the β-carbon instead of the α-carbocation. The nucleophile/base then extracts the hydrogen causing the  bonding electrons to fall in and produce a pi bond with the carbocation.

Because the hydrogen and the leaving group are lost in two separate steps and the fact that it has no requirements as to geometry, the '''E1''' mechanism more reliably produces products that follow Zaitsev's rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

'''Chirality''' (pronounced kie-RAL-it-tee) is the property of ''handedness''. If you attempt to superimpose your right hand on top of your left, the two do not match up in the sense that your right hand's thumb overlays your left hand's pinky finger.  Your two hands cannot be superimposed identically, despite the fact that your fingers of each hand are connected in the same way.  Any object can have this property, including molecules.

An object that is '''chiral''' is an object that can not be superimposed on its mirror image. Chiral objects don't have a ''plane of symmetry''. An achiral object has a plane of symmetry or a rotation-reflection axis, i.e. reflection gives a rotated version.

'''Optical isomers''' or '''enantiomers''' are stereoisomers which exhibit chirality. Optical isomerism is of interest because of its application in inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, pharmacology and biochemistry.

They are often formed when asymmetric centers are present, for example, a carbon with four different groups bonded to it. Every stereocenter in one enantiomer has the opposite configuration in the other.

When a molecule has more than one source of asymmetry, two optical isomers may be neither perfect reflections of each other nor superimposeable: some but not all stereocenters are inverted. These molecules are an example of '''diastereomers''': They are not enantiomers. Diastereomers seldom have the same physical properties. Sometimes, the stereocentres are themselves symmetrical. This causes the counterintuitive situation where two chiral centres may be present but no isomers result. Such compounds are called '''meso compounds'''.

[[Image:Chiral molecures example.svg|right|thumbnail|300px|Chiral relationship.]]

A mixture of equal amounts of both enantiomers is said to be a '''racemic mixture'''. 

It is the symmetry of a molecule (or any other object) that determines whether it is chiral or not. Technically, a molecule is achiral (not chiral) if and only if it has an axis of improper rotation; that is, an n-fold rotation (rotation by 360°/n) followed by a reflection in the plane perpendicular to this axis which maps the molecule onto itself. A chiral molecule is not necessarily dissymmetric (completely devoid of symmetry) as it can have, e.g., rotational symmetry. A simplified rule applies to tetrahedrally-bonded carbon, as shown in the illustration: if all four substituents are different, the molecule is chiral.

It is important to keep in mind that molecules which are dissolved in solution or are in the gas phase usually have considerable flexibility and thus may adopt a variety of different conformations. These various conformations are themselves almost always chiral. However, when assessing chirality, one must use a structural picture of the molecule which corresponds to just one chemical conformation - the one of lowest energy.

==Chiral Compounds With Stereocenters==

Most commonly, chiral molecules have point chirality, centering around a single atom, usually carbon, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different absolute configurations at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism), and is exemplified by the α-carbon of amino acids.

The special nature of carbon, its ability to form four bonds to different [[w:substituent|substituents]], means that a mirror image of the carbon with four different bonds will not be the same as the original compound, no matter how you try to rotate it. Understanding this is vital because the goal of organic chemistry is understanding how to use tools to synthesize a compound with the desired chirality, because a different arrangement may have no effect, or even an undesired one.

A carbon atom is chiral if it has four different items bonded to it at the same time.  Most often this refers to a carbon with three heteroatoms and a hydrogen, or two heteroatoms plus a bond to another carbon plus a bond to a hydrogen atom.  It can also refer to a nitrogen atom bonded to four different types of molecules, if the nitrogen atom is utilizing its lone pair as a nucleophile.  If the nitrogen has only three bonds it is  '''not''' chiral, because the lone pair of electrons can flip from one side of the atom to the other spontaneously.

''Any atom in an organic molecule that is bonded to four different types of atoms or chains of atoms can be considered &quot;chiral&quot;.''

If a carbon atom (or other type of atom) has four different substituents, that carbon atom forms a ''chiral center'' (also known as a ''stereocenter''). Chiral molecules often have one or more stereocenters. When drawing molecules, stereocenters are usually indicated with an asterisk near the carbon.

'''Example:'''

'''Left''': The carbon atom has a Cl, a Br, and 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. That's only 3 different substituents, which means this is not a stereocenter.&lt;br&gt;
'''Center''': The carbon atom has one ethyl group (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), one methyl group (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and 2 H. This is not a stereocenter.&lt;br&gt;
'''Right''': The carbon atom has a Cl and 1 H. Then you must look around the ring. Since one side has a double bond and the other doesn't, it means the substituents off that carbon are different. The 4 different substituents make this carbon a stereocenter and makes the molecule chiral.

A molecule can have multiple chiral centers without being chiral overall: It is then called a meso compound. This occurs if there is a symmetry element (a mirror plane or inversion center) which relates the chiral centers.

===Fischer projections===

Fischer projections (after the German chemist [[wikipedia:Emil Fischer|Hermann Emil Fischer]]) is an ingenious means for representing configurations of carbon atoms. Taking in consideration a carbon center, place horizontally the bonds extending towards the observer. The backward bonds will be vertical. This position is then shorthanded as two lines: the horizontal (forward) and the vertical, as showed in the figure below:

[[Image:Fischer_Projection2.svg|frame|center|'''Principle of Fischer projection''']]

====Operations on Fischer projections====

*''in a Fischer projection, exchange two substituent positions results in the inversion of the stereocenter''
*''rotation by 90° of the Fischer projection results in inversion''
*''rotation by 180° of the Fischer projection preserves the configuration''

== Naming conventions ==

There are three main systems for describing configuration: the oldest, the ''relative'' whose use is now deprecated, and the current, or ''absolute''. The relative configuration description is still used mainly in glycochemistry. Configuration can also be assigned on the purely empirical basis of the optical activity.

=== By optical activity: (+)- and (-)- ===

An optical isomer can be named by the direction in which it rotates the plane of polarized light. If an isomer rotates the plane clockwise as seen by a viewer towards whom the light is traveling, that isomer is labeled (+). Its counterpart is labeled (-). The (+) and (-) isomers have also been termed d- and l-, respectively (for dextrorotatory and levorotatory). This labeling is easy to confuse with D- and L- and is therefore not encouraged by IUPAC.

The fact that an enantiomer can rotate polarised light clockwise (''d''- or ''+''- enantiomer) does not relate with the relative configuration (D- or L-) of it.

=== By relative configuration: D- and L- ===

Fischer, whose research interest was in carbohydrate chemistry, took glyceraldehyde (the simplest sugar, systematic name 2,3-dihydroxyethanal) as a template chiral molecule and denoted the two possible configurations with D- and L-, which rotated polarised light clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively. 

[[Image:Glycerinaldehyd.svg|center|450px||Glycerladehyde, the starting molecule for ''relative configuration'' assignent ]]

All other molecules are assigned the D- or L- configuration if the chiral centre can be formally obtained from glyceraldehyde by substitution. For this reason the D- or L- naming scheme is called ''relative configuration''.

An optical isomer can be named by the spatial configuration of its atoms. The D/L system does this by relating the molecule to glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde is chiral itself, and its two isomers are labeled D and L. Certain chemical manipulations can be performed on glyceraldehyde without affecting its configuration, and its historical use for this purpose (possibly combined with its convenience as one of the smallest commonly-used chiral molecules) has resulted in its use for nomenclature. In this system, compounds are named by analogy to glyceraldehyde, which generally produces unambiguous designations, but is easiest to see in the small biomolecules similar to glyceraldehyde.

[[Image:op_isomer.png|300px|left|Optical isomers]]
One example is the amino acid alanine: alanine has two optical isomers, and they are labeled according to which isomer of glyceraldehyde they come from. Glycine, the amino acid derived from glyceraldehyde, incidentally, does not retain its optical activity, since its central carbon is not chiral. Alanine, however, is essentially methylated glycine and shows optical activity.

The D/L labeling is unrelated to (+)/(-); it does not indicate which enantiomer is dextrorotatory and which is levorotatory. Rather, it says that the compound's stereochemistry is related to that of the dextrorotatory or levorotatory enantiomer of glyceraldehyde. Nine of the nineteen L-amino acids commonly found in proteins are dextrorotatory (at a wavelength of 589 nm), and D-fructose is also referred to as levulose because it is levorotatory.

The dextrorotatory isomer of glyceraldehyde is in fact the D isomer, but this was a lucky guess. At the time this system was established, there was no way to tell which configuration was dextrorotatory. (If the guess had turned out wrong, the labeling situation would now be even more confusing.)

A rule of thumb for determining the D/L isomeric form of an amino acid is the &quot;CORN&quot; rule. The groups:

:COOH, R, NH2 and H (where R is an unnamed carbon chain)

are arranged around the chiral center carbon atom. If these groups are arranged clockwise around the carbon atom, then it is the L-form. If counter-clockwise, it is the D-form.This rule only holds when the hydrogen atom is pointing out of the page. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/aminoacids/background.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By absolute configuration: R- and S- ===

Main article: [[Organic Chemistry/Chirality/R-S notational system|R-S System]]

The absolute configuration system stems from the [[wikipedia:Cahn_Ingold_Prelog_priority_rules|Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules]], which allow a precise description of a stereocenter without using any reference compound. In fact the basis is now the atomic number of the stereocenter substituents.

The R/S system is another way to name an optical isomer by its configuration, without involving a reference molecule such as glyceraldehyde. It labels each chiral center R or S according to a system by which its ligands are each assigned a priority, according to the Cahn Ingold Prelog priority rules, based on atomic number.

This system labels each chiral center in a molecule (and also has an extension to chiral molecules not involving chiral centers). It thus has greater generality than the D/L system, and can label, for example, an (R,R) isomer versus an (R,S) — diastereomers.

The R/S system has no fixed relation to the (+)/(-) system. An R isomer can be either dextrorotatory or levorotatory, depending on its exact ligands.

The R/S system also has no fixed relation to the D/L system. For example, one of glyceraldehyde's ligands is a hydroxy group, -OH. If a thiol group, -SH, were swapped in for it, the D/L labeling would, by its definition, not be affected by the substitution. But this substitution would invert the molecule's R/S labeling, due to the fact that sulfur's atomic number is higher than carbon's, whereas oxygen's is lower. [Note: This seems incorrect. Oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon. Sulfur has a higher atomic number than oxygen. The reason the assignment priorities change in this example is because the CH2SH group gets a higher priority than the CHO, whereas in glyceraldehyde the CHO takes priority over the CH2OH.]

For this reason, the D/L system remains in common use in certain areas, such as amino acid and carbohydrate chemistry. It is convenient to have all of the common amino acids of higher organisms labeled the same way. In D/L, they are all L. In R/S, they are not, conversely, all S — most are, but cysteine, for example, is R, again because of sulfur's higher atomic number.

The word “racemic” is derived from the Latin word for grape; the term having its origins in the work of Louis Pasteur who isolated racemic tartaric acid from wine.

==Chiral Compounds Without Stereocenters==

It is also possible for a molecule to be chiral without having actual point chirality (stereocenters). Commonly encountered examples include 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) and 1,3-dichloro-allene which have axial chirality, and (E)-cyclooctene which has planar chirality.

For example, the isomers which are shown by the following figure are different. The two isomers cannot convert from one to another spontaneously because of restriction of rotation of double bonds.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Hexa-3,4-dien-3-ol.png]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Other types of chiral compounds without stereocenters (like restriction of rotation of a single bond because of steric hindrance) also exist. Consider the following example of the R and S binol molecules:

[[image:binol.png|150px]]

[[Image:Chiral Biph.PNG|150px]]

''The biphenyl C-C bond cannot rotate if the X and Y groups cause steric hindrance.''

[[Image:Spiroverbindung Chiralität.svg|200px]]

''This compound exhibits spiral chirality.''

== Properties of optical isomers ==

Enantiomers have - ''when present in a symmetric environment'' - identical chemical and physical properties except for their ability to rotate plane-polarized light by equal amounts but in opposite directions.  A solution of equal parts of an optically-active isomer and its enantiomer is known as a racemic solution and has a net rotation of plane-polarized light of zero.

Enantiomers differ in how they interact with different optical isomers of other compounds. In nature, most biological compounds (such as amino acids) occur as single enantiomers. As a result, different enantiomers of a compound may have substantially different biological effects. Different enantiomers of the same chiral drug can have very different pharmological effects, mainly because the proteins they bind to are also chiral.

For example, spearmint leaves and caraway seeds respectively contain L-carvone and D-carvone - enantiomers of carvone. These smell different to most people because our taste receptors also contain chiral molecules which behave differently in the presence of different enantiomers.

[[Image:Limonene struttura.PNG|thumb|300px|Limonene enantiomers have different smells.]]

D-form Amino acids tend to taste sweet, whereas L-forms are usually tasteless. This is again due to our chiral taste molecules. The smells of oranges and lemons are examples of the D and L enantiomers.

Penicillin's activity is stereoselective. The antibiotic only works on peptide links of D-alanine which occur in the cell walls of bacteria - but not in humans. The antibiotic can kill only the bacteria, and not us, because we don't have these D-amino acids.

The electric and magnetic fields of polarized light oscillate in a geometric plane. An axis normal to this plane gives the direction of energy propagation. Optically active isomers rotate the plane that the fields oscillate in. The polarized light is actually rotated in a racemic mixture as well, but it is rotated to the left by one of the two enantiomers, and to the right by the other, which cancel out to zero net rotation.

== Chirality in biology ==

Many biologically-active molecules are chiral, including the naturally-occurring amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), and sugars. Interestingly, in biological systems most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are L and sugars are D. The origin of this homochirality in biology is the subject of much debate. 

[[Image:Op isomer.png|thumb|right|Enantiomers of amino acids.]]

Chiral objects have different interactions with the two enantiomers of other chiral objects. Enzymes, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. Imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity which binds a substrate. If this glove is right handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound while the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

== Chirality in inorganic chemistry ==
[[Image:Delta-ruthenium-tris(bipyridine)-cation-3D-balls.png|thumb|[Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Many coordination compounds are chiral; for example the well-known [Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement [7]. In this case, the Ru atom may be regarded as a stereogenic centre, with the complex having point chirality. The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)3]2+ may be designated as Λ (left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands) and Δ (right-handed twist). Hexol is a chiral cobalt compound.

== More definitions ==
* Any non-racemic chiral substance is called '''scalemic'''
* A chiral substance is '''enantiopure''' or '''homochiral''' when only one of two possible enantiomers is present.
* A chiral substance is '''enantioenriched''' or '''heterochiral'''  when an excess of one enantiomer is present but not to the exclusion of the other. 
* '''Enantiomeric excess''' or '''ee''' is a measure for how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, in a sample with 40% ee in R,  the remaining 60% is racemic with 30% of R and 30% of S, so that the total amount of R is 70%.


== Enantiopure preparations ==
Several strategies exist for the preparation of enantiopure compounds. The first method is the separation of a racemic mixture into its isomers. Louis Pasteur in his pioneering work was able to isolate the isomers of tartaric acid because they crystallize from solution as crystals with differing symmetry. A less common and more recently discovered method is by enantiomer self-disproportionation, which is an advanced technique involving the separation of a primarily racemic fraction from a nearly enantiopure fraction via column chromatography.
  
In a non-symmetric environment (such as a biological environment) enantiomers may react at different speeds with other substances. This is the basis for ''chiral synthesis'', which preserves a molecule's desired chirality by reacting it with or catalyzing it with chiral molecules capable of maintaining the product's chirality in the desired conformation (using certain chiral molecules to help it keep its configuration).  Other methods also exist and are used by organic chemists to synthesize only (or maybe only ''mostly'') the desired enantiomer in a given reaction.

== Enantiopure medications ==

Advances in industrial chemical processes have allowed pharmaceutical manufacturers to take drugs that were originally marketed in racemic form and divide them into individual enantiomers, each of which may have unique properties.  For some drugs, such as zopiclone, only one enantiomer (eszopiclone) is active;  the FDA has allowed such once-generic drugs to be patented and marketed under another name.  In other cases, such as ibuprofen, both enantiomers produce the same effects. Steroid receptor sites also show stereoisomer specificity.

Examples of racemic mixtures and enantiomers that have been marketed include:

*'''Ofloxacin''' (Floxin) and '''Levofloxacin''' (Levaquin)
*'''Bupivacaine''' (Marcaine) and '''Ropivacaine''' (Naropin)
*'''Methylphenidate''' (Ritalin) and '''Dexmethylphenidate''' (Focalin)
*'''Cetirizine''' (Zyrtec) and '''Levocetirizine''' (Xyzal)
*'''Albuterol''' (Ventolin) and '''Levalbuterol''' (Xopenex)
*'''Omeprazole''' (Prilosec) and '''Esomeprazole''' (Nexium)
*'''Citalopram''' (Celexa / Cipramil) and '''Escitalopram''' (Lexapro / Cipralex) 
*'''Zopiclone''' (Imovane) and '''Eszopiclone''' (Lunesta)
*'''Modafinil''' (Provigil) and '''Armodafinil''' (Nuvigil) — sulfur is the chiral center in modafinil, instead of carbon.

Many chiral drugs must be made with high enantiomeric purity due to potential side-effects of the other enantiomer. (The other enantiomer may also merely be inactive.)

Consider a racemic sample of thalidomide. One enantiomer was thought to be effective against morning sickness while the other is now known to be teratogenic. Unfortunately, in this case administering just one of the enantiomers to a pregnant patient would still be very dangerous as the two enantiomers are readily interconverted ''in vivo''. Thus, if a person is given either enantiomer, both the D and L isomers will eventually be present in the patient's serum and so chemical processes may not be used to mitigate its toxicity.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In [[Organic Chemistry/Alkenes|alkene]] chemistry, we demonstrated that allylic carbon could maintain a cation charge because the double bond could de-localize to support the charge. What of having two double bonds separated by a single bond? What of having a compound that alternates between double bond and single bond? In addition to other concepts, this chapter will explore what a having a [[Organic Chemistry/Dienes/Conjugation|conjugated]] system means in terms of stability and reaction.

Dienes are simply hydrocarbons which contain two double bonds. Dienes are intermediate between [[Organic Chemistry/Alkenes| alkene]]s and polyenes.

Dienes can divided into three classes:
*Unconjugated dienes have the double bonds separated by two or more single bonds. These are also known as isolated dienes.
*Conjugated dienes have conjugated double bonds separated by one single bond
*Cumulated dienes ([[w:cumulene|cumulenes]]) have the double bonds sharing a common atom as in a group of compounds called ''allenes''.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Brief History==
Gevela Jacob Berzelius, a physician by trade, first coined the term &quot;organic chemistry&quot; in 1806 for the study of compounds derived from biological sources.  Up through the early 19th century, naturalists and scientists observed critical differences between compounds that were derived from living things and those that were not.

Chemists of the period noted that there seemed to be an essential yet inexplicable difference between the properties of the two different types of compounds. The '''vital force theory''', sometimes called &quot;vitalism&quot; (vital means &quot;life force&quot;), was therefore proposed, and widely accepted, as a way to explain these differences, that a &quot;vital force&quot; existed within organic material but did not exist in any inorganic materials.

== Synthesis of Urea ==
[[Image:Urea3D.png|thumb|right|100px|''Urea'']]
Friedrich Wöhler is widely regarded as a pioneer in organic chemistry as a result of his synthesizing of the biological compound urea (a component of urine in many animals) utilizing what is now called &quot;the Wöhler synthesis.&quot; 

Wöhler mixed silver or lead cyanate with ammonium nitrate; this was supposed to yield ammonium cyanate as a result of an exchange reaction, according to Berzelius's dualism theory. Wöhler, however, discovered that the end product of this reaction is ''not'' ammonium cyanate (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OCN), an inorganic salt, but urea ((NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO), a biological compound. (Furthermore, heating ammonium cyanate turns it into urea.) Faced with this result, Berzelius had to concede that (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OCN were ''isomers''. Until this discovery in the year 1828, it was widely believed by chemists that organic substances could only be formed under the influence of the &quot;vital force&quot; in the bodies of animals and plants. Wöhler's synthesis dramatically proved that view to be false.

Urea synthesis was a critical discovery for biochemists because it showed that a compound known to be produced in nature only by biological organisms could be produced in a laboratory under controlled conditions from inanimate matter. This &quot;in vitro&quot; synthesis of organic matter disproved the common theory (vitalism) about the vis vitalis, a transcendent &quot;life force&quot; needed for producing organic compounds.

== Organic vs Inorganic Chemistry ==
Although originally defined as the chemistry of biological molecules, organic chemistry has since been redefined to refer specifically to carbon compounds &amp;mdash; even those with non-biological origin.  Some carbon molecules are not considered organic, with carbon dioxide being the most well known and most common inorganic carbon compound, but such molecules are the exception and not the rule.

Organic chemistry focuses on carbon and following movement of the electrons in carbon chains and rings, and also how electrons are shared with other carbon atoms and heteroatoms.  Organic chemistry is primarily concerned with the properties of covalent bonds and non-metallic elements, though ions and metals do play critical roles in some reactions.

The applications of organic chemistry are myriad, and include all sorts of plastics, dyes, flavorings, scents, detergents, explosives, fuels and many, many other products.  Read the ingredient list for almost any kind of food that you eat &amp;mdash; or even your shampoo bottle &amp;mdash; and you will see the handiwork of organic chemists listed there.

== Major Advances in the Field of Organic Chemistry ==

Of course a chemistry text should at least mention Antoine Laurent Lavoisier.  The French chemist is often called the &quot;Father of Modern Chemistry&quot; and his place is first in any pantheon of great chemistry figures.  Your general chemistry textbook should contain information on the specific work and discoveries of Lavoisier &amp;mdash; they will not be repeated here because his discoveries did not relate directly to organic chemistry in particular. Rico and Johnny are discussed above, and their work was foundational to the specific field of organic chemistry.  After those two, three more scientists are famed for independently proposing the elements of structural theory.  Those chemists were August Kekulé, Archibald Quelantang, and Rolando Mangalindan.

Kekulé was a German, an architect by training, and he was perhaps the first to propose that isomerism was due to carbon's proclivity towards forming four bonds.  Its ability to bond with up to four other atoms made it ideal for forming long chains of atoms in a single molecule, and also made it possible for the same number of atoms to be connected in an enormous variety of ways.  Couper, a Scot, and Butlerov, a Russian, came to many of the same conclusions at the same time or just a short time after.

Through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth, experimental results brought to light much new knowledge about atoms, molecules, and molecular bonding.  In 1916 it was [[../Electron_dot_structures#A_note_about_Gilbert_N._Lewis|Gilbert Lewis]] of U.C. Berkeley who described covalent bonding largely as we know it today (electron-sharing).  Nobel laureate Linus Pauling further developed Lewis' concepts by proposing resonance while he was at the California Institute of Technology.  At about the same time, Sir Robert Robinson of Oxford University focused primarily on the electrons of atoms as the engines of molecular change.  Sir Christopher Ingold of University College, London, organized what was known of organic chemical reactions by arranging them in schemes we now  know as mechanisms, in order to better understand the sequence of changes in a synthesis or reaction.

The field of organic chemistry is probably the most active and important field of chemistry at the moment, due to its extreme applicability to both biochemistry (especially in the pharmaceutical industry) and petrochemistry (especially in the energy industry).  Organic chemistry has a relatively recent history, but it will have an enormously important future, affecting the lives of everyone around the world for many, many years to come.

== How To Balance Hormones Naturally ==

[http://hormonebalancingdiet.com/how-to-balance-hormones-naturally/ Hormones] are responsible for maintaining your weight as well as your anxiety levels and fatigue is all dependent on your hormone levels. You don’t realize that your mood also depends upon your hormone levels. If you have any hormone-related problem going on, you really need to find your question: “[http://hormonebalancingdiet.com/how-to-balance-hormones-naturally/ How To Balance Hormones Naturally]?“. You will consider medication as the first line of treatment but that’s not right. You can fix almost every hormone related issue without taking any medication and by simply just fixing your routine.

Definition of hormone reset:

Coming to the definition of hormone reset, we can simply explain this by saying that bringing the hormones back to normal levels in order to maintain good health is known as hormone reset. As you have already been told that a lot of your daily life issues are due to the imbalance in these hormones. You need to know how and which hormone affects you in what way. Your weight gain is related to a specific hormone which is known as leptin.

Before we start explaining this to you specifically, we would like to give you a general idea about the hormones and the way they lay their effects on you. The most important hormones with specific effects on the body are estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, insulin, leptin, cortisol, thyroid and growth hormone. These hormones are potent enough to bring very drastic changes in your body. Hence, this is essential to balance and maintain the levels of these hormones in your body otherwise this can lead to unfavorable circumstances.

Now it is important for you to know how to balance hormones naturally. Your hormones are basically produced by the endocrine cells and are transported to their site of action. We will tell you a few things that you need to keep in mind in order to maintain the normal levels of hormones.

I'm really looking forward to someone with more expertise doing some [[Textbook]]s on the [[Unix]]. I think it would be a good idea to do it on a '''user story'''-basis.

'''This is a template page. Please do not add recipes here .'''

This is a recommended template for recipes that are submitted to the cookbook.  Please note that this is only a guideline. Feel free to add more sections, or omit some (although the recipe needs to be useful).

The five dot system is used to represent the relative difficulty of a recipe.  Please keep these descriptions in mind when assigning a difficulty score.

* [[Image:1o5dots.svg|You can boil water, right?]] - You can boil water, right?
* [[Image:2o5dots.svg|Fairly easy]] - Fairly easy
* [[Image:3o5dots.svg|Medium difficulty]] - Medium difficulty
* [[Image:4o5dots.svg|Fairly hard]] - Fairly hard
* [[Image:5o5dots.svg|Are you the Iron Chef?]] - Are you the Iron Chef?

These image pages are useful in that clicking on them brings you to a list of recipes of a particular difficulty.  Note, we borrowed these images from the German Cookbook ([[:de:Kochbuch|Kochbuch]]), which has since been moved to the [[:de:|de:wikibooks.org]] domain, but there still may be a few German language recipes floating around.

Here is a list of sample recipes using the template.

* [[Cookbook:Beef and Barley Stew|Beef and Barley Stew]]
* [[Cookbook:Chocolate Mousse|Chocolate Mousse]]
* [[Cookbook:Tarbes Salad|Tarbes Salad]]

&lt;/div&gt;

=== Template for recipe submissions ===

{{recipe}} | Cuisine | Type of course

 */ A short description of the recipe should go here;
 anywhere from one sentence to a paragraph or two is
 acceptable.  Describe who uses the dish, and how, as
 well as anything normally prepared with it.  Stories
 of the recipe's creation or other anecdotes are perfectly
 acceptable.
 
 A photo of the completed dish would be helpful, and
 should be in the lead section, perhaps attached to the
 table somehow. /*

== Ingredients ==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) item one
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 mL) item 2
* etc.
* (but '''not on this template page -- make a new page with a new name''')

 */ The ingredients should be listed in the order they
 are called for in the procedure below. The ingredients 
 should be linked to using the &quot;pipe trick&quot;, ie
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:carrot|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which produces [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]].
 If optional ingredients and substitutions would make 
 this list less readable, place them in the notes, tips, 
 or variations section instead (if they are specific to
 some different cooking  procedure) or place them in a 
 second list after the first one. Otherwise, simply 
 mark them &quot;(optional)&quot;. Consider using separate lists 
 for filling and shell, meat and sauce, and so on. /*

 */ Quantities should be listed in whichever system (imperial
 or metric) the recipe was created in, with the other system's
 equivalent values listed immediately after, in &quot;()&quot;.  This
 lets users know which units are &quot;original&quot; and which are
 estimated conversions. Always provide volume measurements.
 In some countries, kitchens are simply not equipped to measure
 by mass or weight. (yes, they lack a balance or scale)
 Do not specify the size of normal chicken eggs; &quot;Large&quot; in
 the USA is similar to &quot;size M&quot; (not size L) in the EU, and
 other countries will surely have their own ideas as well. /*

== Procedure ==

# Step one
# Step two
# etc.
# (but '''not on this template page -- make a new page with a new name''')

 */ Photos of the procedures as they are completed should
 be in |thumb| format, so a caption identifying what step
 is being performed can be included in the pic. /*

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* Note 1
* Tip 1
* Variation 1
* etc.

 */ This area can be used for any additional information
 that doesn't fit in other areas of the  recipe module. /*

== Warnings ==

* Warning 1
* Warning 2
* etc.

==Atomic Structure==

Atoms are made up of a '''nucleus''' and '''electrons''' that orbit the nucleus. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. An atom in its natural, uncharged state has the same number of electrons as protons.

===The nucleus===

The nucleus is made up of  '''protons''', which are positively charged, and '''neutrons''', which have no charge.  Neutrons and protons have about the same mass, and together account for most of the mass of the atom.

===Electrons===

The electrons are negatively charged particles. The mass of an electron is about 2000 times smaller than that of a proton or neutron at 0.00055 amu. Electrons circle so fast that it cannot be determined where electrons are at any point in time. The image depicts the old Bohr model of the atom, in which the electrons inhabit discrete &quot;orbitals&quot; around the nucleus much like planets orbit the sun. This model is outdated. Current models of the atomic structure hold that electrons occupy fuzzy clouds around the nucleus of specific shapes, some spherical, some dumbbell shaped, some with even more complex shapes.

==Shells and Orbitals==

===Electron shells===
Electrons orbit atoms in clouds of distinct shapes and sizes. The electron clouds are layered one inside the other into units called '''shells''', with the electrons occupying the simplest orbitals in the innermost shell having the lowest '''energy state''' and the electrons in the most complex orbitals in the outermost shell having the highest energy state. The higher the energy state, the more '''energy''' the electron has, just like a rock at the top of a hill has more potential energy than a rock at the bottom of a valley. The main reason why electrons exist in higher energy orbitals is because only two electrons can exist in any orbital. So electrons fill up orbitals, always taking the lowest energy orbitals available. An electron can also be pushed to a higher energy orbital, for example by a photon. Typically this is not a stable state and after a while the electron descends to lower energy states by emitting a photon spontaneously. These concepts will be important in understanding later concepts like optical activity of chiral compounds as well as many interesting phenomena outside the realm of organic chemistry (for example, how lasers work).

===Electron orbitals===

Each different shell is subdivided into one or more '''orbitals''', which also have different energy levels, although the energy difference between orbitals is less than the energy difference between shells.

Longer wavelengths have less energy; the s orbital has the longest wavelength allowed for an electron orbiting a nucleus and this orbital is observed to have the lowest energy.

Each orbital has a characteristic shape which shows where electrons most often exist.  The orbitals are named using letters of the alphabet.  In order of increasing energy the orbitals are: '''s''', '''p''', '''d''', and '''f''' orbitals.

As one progresses up through the shells (represented by the principal quantum number '''n''') more types of orbitals become possible. The shells are designated by numbers. So the 2s orbital refers to the s orbital in the second shell.

===S orbital===

The '''s orbital''' is the orbital lowest in energy and is spherical in shape. Electrons in this orbital are in their fundamental frequency.  This orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons.

[[Image:S-orbital.png]]

===P orbital===

The next lowest-energy orbital is the '''p orbital'''. Its shape is often described as like that of a dumbbell.  There are three p-orbitals each oriented along one of the 3-dimensional coordinates x, y or z.  Each of these three &quot;p&quot; orbitals can hold a maximum of two electrons.

[[Image:P-orbital.png]]

These three different p orbitals can be referred to as the p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''s''' and '''p''' orbitals are important for understanding most of organic chemistry as these are the orbitals that are occupied in the type of atoms that are most common in organic compounds.

===D and F orbitals===
----
There are also D and F orbitals. D orbitals are present in transition metals. Sulphur and phosphorus have empty D orbitals. Compounds involving atoms with D orbitals do come into play, but are rarely part of an organic molecule. F are present in the elements of the lanthanide and actinide series. Lanthanides and actinides are mostly irrelevant to organic chemistry.

==Filling electron shells==
&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' &lt;br&gt; [[w:Electron configuration|Electron configuration]]
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When an atom or ion receives electrons into its orbitals, the orbitals and shells fill up in a particular manner.

There are three principles that govern this process:
#'''the Pauli exclusion principle''',
#'''the Aufbau (build-up) principle''', and
#'''Hund's rule'''.

=== Pauli exclusion principle ===
&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' [[w:Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli]]&lt;br&gt; [[w:Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]]
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

No two electrons in an atom can have all four quantum numbers the same.  What this translates to in terms of our pictures of orbitals is that each orbital can only hold two electrons, one &quot;spin up&quot; and one &quot;spin down&quot;.

=== Hund's rule ===

This states that filled and half-filled shells tend to have additional stability.  In some instances, then, for example, the 4s orbitals will be filled before the 3d orbitals.

&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' &lt;br&gt; [[w:Hund's rule of Maximum Multiplicity|Hund's rule]]
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This rule is applicable only for those elements that have d electrons, and so is less important in organic chemistry (though it is important in organometallic chemistry).

==Octet rule==

The '''octet rule''' states that atoms tend to prefer to have eight electrons in their valence shell, so will tend to ''combine'' in such a way that each atom can have eight electrons in its valence shell, similar to the electronic configuration of a noble gas. In simple terms, molecules are more stable when the outer shells of their constituent atoms are empty, full, or have eight electrons in the outer shell.



The main exception to the rule is helium, which is at lowest energy when it has two electrons in its valence shell.

Other notable exceptions are aluminum and boron, which can function well with six valence electrons; and some atoms beyond group three on the periodic table that can have over eight electrons, such as sulfur. Additionally, some noble gasses can form compounds when expanding their valence shell.

==Hybridization==
&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' &lt;br&gt; [[w:Orbital hybridisation|Orbital hybridization]]
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''Hybridization''' refers to the combining of the orbitals of two or more covalently bonded atoms. Depending on how many free electrons a given atom has and how many bonds it is forming, the electrons in the s and the p orbitals will combine in certain manners to form the bonds.

It is easy to determine the hybridization of an atom given a Lewis structure. First, you count the number of pairs of free electrons and the number of ''sigma'' bonds (single bonds). Do not count double bonds, since they do not affect the hybridization of the atom. Once the total of these two is determined, the hybridization pattern is as follows:

 Sigma Bonds + Electron Pairs     Hybridization
               2                       sp
               3                       sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
               4                       sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

The pattern here is the same as that for the electron orbitals, which serves as a memory guide.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Ionic Bonding ==
[[Image:Sodium_chloride_crystal.png|thumb|right|The Sodium Chloride Crystal Structure.  Each atom has six nearest neighbors, with octahedral geometry.  This arrangement is known as 
c close packed'' (ccp).  &lt;br&gt;
Light blue = Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dark green = Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]]

'''Ionic bonding''' is when positively and negatively charged '''ions''' stick to each other through electrostatic force. These bonds are '' slightly weaker than [[#Covalent Bonding|covalent bonds]]'' and stronger than Van der Waals bonding or hydrogen bonding.

In ionic bonds the [[Organic Chemistry/Foundational concepts of organic chemistry/Electronegativity|electronegativity]] of the negative ion is so much stronger than the electronegativity of the positive ion that the two ions do not share electrons. Rather, the more electronegative ion assumes full ownership of the electron(s).

Sodium chloride forms crystals with cubic symmetry. In these, the larger chloride ions are arranged in a cubic close-packing, while the smaller sodium ions fill the octahedral gaps between them.  Each ion is surrounded by six of the other kind.  This same basic structure is found in many other minerals, and is known as the halite structure.

Perhaps the most common example of an ionically bonded substance is NaCl, or table salt. In this, the [[w:sodium|sodium (Na)]] atom gives up an electron to the much more electronegative [[w:chlorine|chlorine (Cl)]] atom, and the two atoms become ions, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.The electrostatic bonding force between the two oppositely charged ions extends outside the local area attracting other ions to form giant crystal structures. For this reason most ionically bonded materials are solid at room temperature.

== Covalent Bonding ==
'''Covalent bonding''' is close to the heart of organic chemistry. This is where two atoms '''share electrons''' in a bond. The goal of each atom is to ''fill its octet'' as well as have a ''formal charge of zero''. To do this, atomic nuclei share electrons in the space between them. This sharing also allows the atoms to reach a '''lower energy state''', which '''stabilizes''' the molecule. Most reactions in chemistry are due to molecules achieving a lower energy state. Covalent bonds are most frequently seen between atoms with similar electronegativity.  In molecules that only have one type of atom, e.g. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , the electronegativity of the atoms is necessarily identical, so they cannot form ionic bonds. They always form covalent bonds.

Carbon is especially good at covalent bonding because its electronegativity is intermediate relative to other atoms. That means it can give as well as take electrons as needs warrant.

Covalently bonded compounds have strong internal bonds but weak attractive forces between molecules. Because of these weak attractive forces, the melting and boiling points of these compounds are much lower than compounds with [[Organic Chemistry/Foundational concepts of organic chemistry/Ionic bonding|ionic bond]]s. Therefore, such compounds are much more likely to be liquids or gases at room temperature than ionically bonded compounds.

In molecules formed from two atoms of the same element, there is no difference in the electronegativity of the bonded atoms, so the electrons in the covalent bond are shared equally, resulting in a completely '''non-polar covalent''' bond.  In covalent bonds where the bonded atoms are different elements, there is a difference in electronegativities between the two atoms.  The atom that is more electronegative will attract the bonding electrons more toward itself than the less electronegative atom.  The difference in charge on the two atoms because of the electrons causes the covalent bond to be polar.  Greater differences in electronegativity result in more polar bonds.  Depending on the difference in electronegativities, the [[polarity]] of a bond can range from non-polar covalent to ionic with varying degrees of '''polar covalent''' in between.  An overall imbalance in charge from one side of a molecule to the other side is called a '''dipole moment'''.  Such molecules are said to be '''polar'''. For a completely symmetrical covalently bonded molecule, the overall dipole moment of the molecule is zero.  Molecules with larger dipole moments are more polar.  The most common polar molecule is water.

==Bond Polarity and Dipole Moment==

[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|Methane]]

The ideas of bond polarity and dipole moment play important roles in organic chemistry.

If you look at the image of methane on the right, the single most important aspect of it in terms of bond polarity is that it is a symmetric molecule. It has 4 hydrogens, all bonded at 109.5° from the other, and all with precisely the same bond angle. Each carbon-hydrogen bond is slightly polar (hydrogen has an electronegativity of 2.1, carbon 2.5), but because of this symmetry, the polarities cancel each other out and overall, methane is a non-polar molecule.

The distinction is between '''Bond Polarity''' and '''Molecular polarity'''. The total polarity of a molecule is measured as '''Dipole Moment'''. The actual calculation of dipole moment isn't really necessary so much as an understanding of what it means. Frequently, a guesstimate of dipole moment is pretty easy once you understand the concept and until you get into the more advanced organic chemistry, exact values are of little value.

Basically, the molecular polarity is, essentially, the summation of the vectors of all of the bond polarities in a molecule.

== Van der Waals Bonding ==
Van der Waals bonding is the collective name for three types of interactions:

#'''Permanent Dipole interactions:''' these are the electrostatic attractive forces between two dipoles, these are responsible for fluromethane's (CH3F) high boiling point (about -15 deg C) compared to Nitrogen (about -180 deg C).
#'''Permanent dipole / induced dipole:''' these are the interactions between a permanent dipole and another molecule, causing the latter molecule's electron cloud to be distorted and thus have an induced dipole itself.  These are much weaker than the permanent dipole / dipole interactions.  These forces occur in permanent dipole-molecules, and in mixtures of permanent dipole and dipole free molecules.
#'''Instantaneous dipole / induced dipole:''' At any specific moment the electron cloud is not necesarily symetrical, this instantaneous dipole then induces a dipole in another molecule and they are attracted, this is the weakest of all molecular interactions.

A Dipole is caused by an atom or molecule fragment having a higher electronegativity (this is a measure of its effective nuclear charge, and thus the attraction of the nucleus by electrons) than one to which it is attached.  This means that it pulls electrons closer to it, and has a higher share of the electrons in the bond.  Dipoles can cancel out by symmetry, eg: Carbon dioxide (O=C=O) is linear so there is no dipole, but the charge distribution is asymmetric causing a quadripole moment (this acts similarly to a dipole, but is much weaker).

== Organometallic Compounds and Bonding ==
Organometallic chemistry combines aspects of inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry, because organometallic compounds are  chemical compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal or metalloid element.  Organometallic bonds are different from other bonds in that they are not either truly covalent or truly ionic, but each type of metal has individual bond character.  Cuprate (copper) compounds, for example, behave quite differently than Grignard reagents (magnesium), and so beginning organic chemists should concentrate on how to use the most basic compounds mechanistically, while leaving the explanation of exactly what occurs at the molecular level until later and more in-depth studies in the subject.

Basic organometallic interactions are discussed fully in a later chapter.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Resonance ==

'''Resonance''' refers to structures that are not easily represented by a single electron dot structure but that are intermediates between two or more drawn structures.

Resonance is easily misunderstood in part because of the way certain chemistry textbooks attempt to explain the concept.  In science, analogies can provide an aid to understanding, but analogies should not be taken too literally.  It is sometimes best to use analogies to introduce a topic, but then explain the differences and inevitable complications as further details on a complicated subject.  This is the case for resonance.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just as entropic principles cannot be applied to individual molecules, it is impossible to say whether or not any given individual molecule with a resonance structure is literally in one configuration or another.  The actual situation on the molecular scale is that each configuration of the molecule contributes a percentage to the possible configurations, resulting in a &quot;blend&quot; of the possible structures.  Changes in molecular shape occur so rapidly, and on such a tiny scale, that the '''actual physical locations of individual electrons cannot be precisely known''' (due to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle).  The result of all that complexity is simply this: molecules with resonance structures are treated as mixtures of their multiple forms, with a greater percentage of probability given to the most stable configurations.

The '''nuclei of the atoms are not moving''' when they are represented by resonance structure drawings.  Rather, the electrons are portrayed as if they were moving instead.  The true situation is that no one can say for certain exactly where any individual electron is at any specific moment, but rather electron location can be expressed as a probability only.  What a dot structure is actually showing is where electrons almost certainly are located, therefore resonance structures indicate a split in those same probabilities.  Chemists are absolutely certain where electrons are located when one carbon bonds four hydrogens (methane), but it is less certain where precisely any given electron is located when six carbons bond six hydrogens in a ring structrue (benzene).  Resonance is an expression of this uncertainty, and is therefore the average of probable locations.

Resonance structures are '''stabilizing''' in molecules because they allow electrons to lengthen their wavelengths and thereby '''lower their energy'''.  This is the reason that benzene (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) has a lower heat of formation than organic chemists would predict, not accounting for resonance.  Other aromatic molecules have a similar stability, which leads to an overall entropic preference for aromaticity (a subject that will be covered fully in a later chapter).  Resonance stability plays a major role in organic chemistry due to resonant molecules' lower energy of formation, so students of organic chemistry should understand this effect and practice spotting molecules stabilized by resonant forms.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[image:Resonance_example2.PNG|Carbonate]]
&lt;br&gt;
In the Lewis structures above, carbonate (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) has a resonance structure. Using laboratory procedures to measure the bond length of each bond, we do not find that one bond is shorter than the two others (remember, double bonds are shorter than single bonds), but instead that all bonds are of the same length somewhere between the length of typical double and single bonds.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Resonance Structures ==
[[Image:Benz3.png|200px|frame|right|Scheme 1. Resonance structures of Benzene]]
&lt;!--More diagrams welcome--&gt;
'''Resonance structures''' are diagrammatic tools used predominately in [[w:organic chemistry|organic chemistry]] to symbolize '''resonant bonds''' between [[w:atom|atom]]s in [[w:molecule|molecule]]s. The electron density of these bonds is spread over the molecule, also known as the [[w:delocalization|delocalization]] of [[w:electron|electron]]s.  Resonance contributors for the same molecule all have the same [[w:chemical formula|chemical formula]] and same sigma framework, but the pi electrons will be distributed differently among the atoms.  Because [[w:Lewis dot diagram|Lewis dot diagram]]s often cannot represent the true electronic structure of a molecule, resonance structures are often employed to approximate the true electronic structure. Resonance structures of the same molecule are connected with a double-headed arrow. While organic chemists use resonance structures frequently, they are also used in inorganic structures, with [[w:nitrate|nitrate]] as an example.

== Key characteristics ==
The key elements of resonance are:
*Resonance occurs because of the overlap of [[w:atomic orbital|orbital]]s.  Double bonds are made up of [[w:pi bond|pi bonds]], formed from the overlap of 2p [[w:atomic orbital|orbital]]s. The electrons in these pi orbitals will be spread over more than two atoms, and hence are delocalized.
*Both paired and unshared electrons may be delocalized, but all the electrons must be conjugated in a pi system.
*If the orbitals do not overlap (such as in [[w:orthogonal|orthogonal]] orbitals) the structures are not true resonance structures and do not mix.
*Molecules or species with resonance structures are generally considered to be more stable than those without them.  The delocalization of the electrons lowers the orbital energies, imparting this stability.  The resonance in benzene gives rise to the property of [[w:aromaticity|aromaticity]]. The gain in stability is called the '''resonance energy'''.
*All resonance structures for the same molecule must have the same sigma framework ([[w:Sigma bond|sigma bond]]s form from the &quot;head on&quot; overlap of hybridized orbitals).  Furthermore, they must be correct [[w:Lewis structure|Lewis structure]]s with the same number of electrons (and consequent [[w:Electric charge|charge]]) as well as the same number of unpaired electrons.  Resonance structures with arbitrary separation of charge are unimportant, as are those with fewer covalent bonds. These unimportant resonance structures only contribute minimally (or not at all) to the overall bonding description; however, they are important in some cases such as for a [[w:Carbonyl|carbonyl]] group.
* The '''hybrid structure''' is defined as the superposition of the resonance structures.  A benzene ring is often shown with a circle inside a hexagon (in American texts) rather than alternating double bonds &amp;mdash; the latter example misrepresents the electronic structure. Bonds with broken [[w:Bond order|bond order]]s are often displayed as double bonds with one solid and one dashed line.

== What resonance is not ==
Significantly, resonance structures do not represent different, isolatable structures or compounds.  In the case of benzene, for example, there are two important resonance structures - which can be thought of as cyclohexa-1,3,5-trienes.  There are other resonance forms possible, but because they are higher in energy than the triene structures (due to charge separation or other effects) they are less important and contribute less to the &quot;real&quot; electronic structure (average hybrid).  However, this does not mean there are two different, interconvertable forms of benzene; rather, the true electronic structure of benzene is an average of the two structures.  The six carbon-carbon bond lengths are identical when measured, which would be invalid for the cyclic triene.
Resonance should also not be confused with a [[w:Chemical equilibrium|chemical equilibrium]] or [[w:Tautomerism|tautomerism]] which are equilibria between  compounds that have different sigma bonding patterns. [[w:Hyperconjugation|Hyperconjugation]] is a special case of resonance.

== History ==
The concept of resonance was introduced by [[w:Linus Pauling|Linus Pauling]] in 1928. He was inspired by the [[w:Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] treatment of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in which an electron is located between two hydrogen nuclei. The alternative term '''mesomerism''' popular in German and French publications with the same meaning was introduced by [[w:Christopher Ingold|Christopher Ingold]] in 1938 but did not catch on in the English literature. The current concept of [[w:Mesomeric effect|Mesomeric effect]] has taken on a related but different meaning. The double headed arrow was introduced by the German chemist Arndt (also responsible for the [[w:Arndt-Eistert synthesis|Arndt-Eistert synthesis]]) who preferred the German phrase ''zwischenstufe'' or ''intermediate phase''.

Due to confusion with the physical meaning of the word ''[[w:Resonance|resonance]]'', as no elements do actually appear to be resonating, it is suggested to abandon the term ''resonance'' in favor of ''delocalization''  {{Ref|Kerber}}. Resonance energy would become delocalization energy and a ''resonance structure'' becomes '''contributing structure'''. The double headed arrows would get replaced by commas.

== Examples ==
[[Image:Resonance examples.png|thumb|center|400px|Scheme 2. Examples of resonance ozone, benzene and the allyl cation]]

The [[w:ozone|ozone]] molecule is represented by two resonance structures in the top of ''scheme 2''. In reality the two terminal oxygen atoms are equivalent and the hybrid structure is drawn on the right with a charge of -1/2 on both oxygen atoms and partial double bonds.
The concept of benzene as a hybrid of two conventional structures (middle ''scheme 2'') was a major breakthrough in chemistry made by [[w:Kekule|Kekule]], and the two forms of the ring which together represent the total resonance of the system are called ''Kekule structures''. In the hybrid structure on the right the circle replaces three double bonds.
The [[w:allyl|allyl]] [[w:cation|cation]] (bottom ''scheme 2'') has two resonance forms and in the hybrid structure the positive charge is delocalized over the terminal methylene groups.

==Arrhenius Definition: Hydroxide and Hydronium Ions==

The first and earliest definition of acids and bases was proposed in the 1800's by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius, who said that an '''acid''' was anything that dissolved in water to yield '''H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions''' (like stomach acid HCl, hydrochloric acid), and a '''base''' was anything that dissolved in water to give up '''OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions''' (like soda lye NaOH, sodium hydroxide).  Acids and bases were already widely used in various occupations and activities of the time, so Arrhenius' definition merely attempted to explained well-known and long-observed phenomenon.

Although simple, at the time this definition of the two types of substances was significant.  It allowed chemists to explain certain reactions as ion chemistry, and it also expanded the ability of scientists of the time to predict certain chemical reactions.  The definition left a great deal wanting, however, in that many types of reactions that did not involve hydroxide or hydronium ions directly remained unexplained.

Many general chemistry classes (especially in the lower grades or introductory levels) still use this simple definition of acids and bases today, but modern organic chemists make further distinctions between acids and bases than the distinctions provided under Arrhenius's definition.

==Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases: Proton donors and acceptors==

A new definition for acids and bases, building upon the one already proposed by Arrhenius, was brought forth independently by Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry in 1923.  The new definition did not depend on a substance's dissolution in water for definition, but instead suggested that a substance was acidic if it readily donated a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to a reaction and a substance was basic if it accepted a proton in a reaction.

&lt;H2&gt;Definiton of Brønsted-Lowry Acid and Base&lt;/H2&gt;

An '''acid''' is any '''proton donor''' and a '''base''' is any '''proton acceptor'''.
|}

The major advantage of the updated definition was that it was not limited to aqueous solution.  This definition of acids and bases allowed chemists to explain a great number of reactions that took place in protic or aprotic solvents that were not water, and it also allowed for gaseous and solid phase reactions (although those reactions are more rare).

For example, the hypothetical acid HA will disassociate into H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;HA \overrightarrow\longleftarrow H^+ + A^-&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


The Brønsted-Lowry definiton of acids and bases is one of two definitions still in common use by modern chemists.

==Lewis Acids and Bases: Electron donors and acceptors==

The second definition in widespread use deals not with a molecule's propensity for accepting or donating protons but rather with accepting or donating electrons, thereby demonstrating a slightly different emphasis and further broadening the explanatory and predictive powers of acid-base chemistry.

&lt;H2&gt;Definition of Lewis Acids and Bases&lt;/H2&gt;

A Lewis '''acid''' is an '''electron acceptor''' and a Lewis '''base''' is an '''electron donor'''.
|}


Probably the most important aspect of Lewis acids and bases is which types of atoms can donate electrons, and which types of atoms can receive them.  Essentially atoms with lone pairs, i.e. unshared pairs of electrons in an outer shell, have the capability of using those lone pairs to attract electron-deficient atoms or ions.  This is why ammonia can bond a fourth hydrogen ion to create the ammonium ion; its lone pair of electrons can attract and bond to a free H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in solution and hold on to it.  For the same reason, methane cannot become methanium ion under ordinary circumstances, because the carbon in methane does not have any unshared pairs of electrons orbiting its nucleus.  Generally speaking, Lewis acid are in the nitrogen, oxygen or halogen groups of the periodic table.

==Nucleophiles and Electrophiles==

Whether or not an atom can donate or accept electrons it can be called a nucleophile or electrophile, respectively.  '''Electrophiles''' (literally, &quot;lovers of electrons&quot;) are attracted to electrons. Electrophiles therefore seek to pair with unshared electrons of other atoms. '''Nucleophiles''', or &quot;nucleus lovers&quot;, seek positively charged nuclei such as those available in acidic solutions as hydronium ions.  It is important to note that electrophiles and nucleophiles are often '''ions''', but sometimes they are not. 

Understanding '''electrophiles''' and '''nucleophiles''' goes beyond simply ideas of acids and bases. They are, in a majority of cases, the major players in organic reactions. As we will, over and over again, find reactions that are the result of nucleophiles ''attacking'' electrophiles. Keep in mind that the idea of nucleophiles and electrophiles is very related to the ideas of acids and bases in the Lewis context.

But it is also important to understand that, while they are related, they are not exactly the same thing either. An ion or molecule can be a strong nucleophile and a weak base (e.g. N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, RS&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;). Another ion can be a poor nucleophile and a strong base ((CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;). And yet others are strong nucleophiles and strong bases (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, RO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, HO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and poor nucleophiles and poor bases (RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, ROH, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

This will all be discussed in greater detail as the topics of specific reactions and reaction mechanisms are covered. In the meantime, try to bear in mind that nucleophiles are basic and electrophiles are acidic.

==pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and Acidity ==

The acid dissociation constant of a substance is commonly called its pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, and it is a measure of the negative log of the K value of an acid dissociation reaction.  (The K value refers to the equilibrium calculations you learned how to perform in general chemistry -- if you have forgotten your K's and Q's, now would be a good time to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKa refresh your memory] on the topic.)

:&lt;math&gt;pK_a = -\log(K_a)&lt;/math&gt;

The lower the pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value is, the more acidic (and consequently, less basic) a substance is.  There is also a pK&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; value for all relevant substances, but it is common in organic chemistry to use pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; exclusively, even when discussing bases.  This is because extremely high pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values correlate exactly to extremely low pK&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; values, so there is no need to use both kinds of measurements.  Any pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value higher than seven means that a substance is not acidic when placed in water, but '''it does not mean that substance cannot be an acid'''.  Alcohols are a good example of this: they can donate a hydrogen ion in chemical reactions but they do not do so readily, which makes them acidic but only very weakly so.  Many of the acids in organic chemistry are considerably weaker than acids used for inorganic chemistry, so discussion of acid-base chemistry in organic reactions may not necessarily relate well to your previous understanding of the topic.

== Electron Dot Structures ==
&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' &lt;br&gt; [[w:Lewis structures|Lewis structures]]
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
'''Electron dot structures''', also called ''Lewis structures'', give a representation of the valence electrons surrounding an atom.

Each valence electron is represented by one dot, thus, a lone atom of hydrogen would be drawn as an ''H'' with one dot, whereas a lone atom of Helium would be drawn as an ''He'' with two dots, and so forth.

Representing two atoms joined by a covalent bond is done by drawing the atomic symbols near to each other, and drawing a single line to represent a shared pair of electrons.  It is important to note: a single valence electron is represented by a dot, whereas a pair of electrons is represented by a line.

The covalent compound hydrogen fluoride, for example, would be represented by the symbol ''H'' joined to the symbol ''F'' by a single line, with three pairs (six more dots) surrounding the symbol ''F''.  The line represents the two electrons shared by both hydrogen and fluorine, whereas the six paired dots represent fluorine's remaining six valence electrons.

Dot structures are useful in illustrating simple covalent molecules, but the limitations of dot structures become obvious when diagramming even relatively simple organic molecules.  The dot structures have no ability to represent the actual physical orientation of molecules, and they become overly cumbersome when more than three or four atoms are represented.

Lewis dot structures are useful for introducing the idea of covalence and bonding in small molecules, but other model types have much more capability to communicate chemistry concepts.

==== A note about Gilbert N. Lewis ====
&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' &lt;br&gt; [[w:Gilbert N. Lewis|Gilbert N. Lewis]]yo
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Lewis was born in Weymouth, Massachusetts as the son of a Dartmouth-graduated lawyer/broker.  He attended the University of Nebraska at age 14, then three years later transferred to Harvard.  After showing an initial interest in Economics, Gilbert Newton Lewis earned first a B.A. in Chemistry, and then a Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1899.

For a few years after obtaining his doctorate, Lewis worked and studied both in the United States and abroad (including Germany and the Philippines) and he was even a professor at M.I.T. from 1907 until 1911.  He then went on to U.C. Berkeley in order to be Dean of the College of Chemistry in 1912.

In 1916 Dr. Lewis formulated the idea that a covalent bond consisted of a shared pair of electrons.  His ideas on chemical bonding were expanded upon by Irving Langmuir and became the inspiration for the studies on the nature of the chemical bond by Linus Pauling.

In 1923, he formulated the electron-pair theory of acid-base reactions. In the so-called Lewis theory of acids and bases, a &quot;Lewis acid&quot; is an electron-pair acceptor and a &quot;Lewis base&quot; is an electron-pair donor.

In 1926, he coined the term &quot;photon&quot; for the smallest unit of radiant energy.

Lewis was also the first to produce a pure sample of deuterium oxide (heavy water) in 1933. By accelerating deuterons (deuterium nuclei) in Ernest O. Lawrence's cyclotron, he was able to study many of the properties of atomic nuclei.

During his career he published on many other subjects, and he died at age 70 of a heart attack while working in his laboratory in Berkeley.  He had one daughter and two sons; both of his sons became chemistry professors themselves.

== Formal Charge ==
&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' &lt;br&gt; [[w:Lewis_structure#Formal_Charge|Formal charge]]
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The '''formal charge''' of an atom is the charge that it would have if every bond were 100% covalent (non-polar). Formal charges are computed by using a set of rules and are useful for accounting for the electrons when writing a reaction mechanism, but they don't have any intrinsic physical meaning. They may also be used for qualitative comparisons between different resonance structures (see below) of the same molecule, and often have the same sign as the partial charge of the atom, but there are exceptions.

The formal charge of an atom is computed as the difference between the number of valence electrons that a neutral atom would have and the number of electrons that &quot;belong&quot; to it in the Lewis structure when one counts lone pair electrons as belonging fully to the atom, while electrons in covalent bonds are split equally between the atoms involved in the bond. The total of the formal charges on an ion should be equal to the charge on the ion, and the total of the formal charges on a neutral molecule should be equal to zero.

For example, in the hydronium ion, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the oxygen atom has 5 electrons for the purpose of computing the formal charge—2 from one lone pair, and 3 from the covalent bonds with the hydrogen atoms. The other 3 electrons in the covalent bonds are counted as belonging to the hydrogen atoms (one each). A neutral oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons (due to its position in group 16 of the periodic table); therefore the formal charge on the oxygen atom is 6 – 5 = +1. A neutral hydrogen atom has one electron. Since each of the hydrogen atoms in the hydronium atom has one electron from a covalent bond, the formal charge on the hydrogen atoms is zero. The sum of the formal charges is +1, which matches the total charge of the ion.

: Formal Charge: number of valence electrons for an atom - (number of lone pair electrons + number electrons in bonds/2)
: &lt;math&gt;FC = N_{valence} - \left( N_{lone pairs} + \frac{N_{electrons}}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

In chemistry, a formal charge (FC) on an atom in a molecule is defined as:

: FC = number of valence electrons of the atom - ( number of lone pair electrons on this atom + total number of electrons participating in covalent bonds with this atom / 2).
: &lt;math&gt;FC = N_{valence} - \left( N_{lone pairs} + \frac{N_{participating electrons}}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

When determining the correct Lewis structure (or predominant resonance structure) for a molecule, the structure is chosen such that the formal charge on each of the atoms is minimized.

===Examples===
; carbon in methane : &lt;math&gt;FC = 4 - \left( 0 + \frac{8}{2} \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
; Nitrogen in &lt;math&gt;NO_2^{-}&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;FC = 5 - \left( 2 + \frac{6}{2} \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
; double bonded oxygen in &lt;math&gt;NO_2^{-}&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;FC = 6 - \left( 4 + \frac{4}{2} \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
; single bonded oxygen in &lt;math&gt;NO_2^{-}&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;FC = 6 - \left( 6 + \frac{2}{2} \right) = -1&lt;/math&gt;

The real heart of organic chemistry is the reactions. Everything that you study is geared to prepare you for organic syntheses and other chemical transformations performed in the lab. This chapter gives you the basic tools to begin looking at these reactions.

==Some basic reaction types==
One way to organize organic reactions places them into a few basic categories:

*'''addition reactions'''
*'''elimination reactions'''
*'''substitution reactions'''
*'''rearrangement reactions'''

Other categories include:
*'''Oxidations '''
*'''Reductions'''
*'''Alkylations'''

Sometimes one reaction can fall into more than one category. These classifications are just a tool and are not rigid.

==Addition reaction==

Something is added to something else to produce a third thing.

:A + B → C

''Note: the letters A, B and C here represent any atomic, ionic or molecular species which can undergo this type of reaction.''

== Elimination reaction ==

Something comes off of a molecule, resulting in two products.

:A → B + C

==Substitution reactions==

This involves the exchange of one group for another.

:AB + CD → AC + BD

Common reaction types include
*radical reactions and
*nucleophilic substitutions
**S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1, Unimolecular nucleophilic substitution
**S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2, Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution

==Rearrangement reactions==

A molecule shifts or otherwise rearranges to form a different molecule.

:A → B

This typically happens when one molecule changes into an isomer of itself.

===Homolytic vs heterolytic cleavage===
Two bonded atoms can come apart from each other in one of two ways. Either 
#each atom gets away with half of the shared electrons, or 
#one of the atoms leaves with more of the shared electrons than the other. 

In '''homolytic cleavage''', each atom leaves with one-half of the shared electrons (one electron for a single bond, or two for double bonds). 

A—B --&gt; A* + B*

&lt;small&gt; A* and B* represent uncharged radicals. The &quot;*&quot; represents an unbonded, unpaired valence electron.&lt;/small&gt;

In '''heterolytic cleavage''', one atom leaves with all of the previously shared electrons and the other atom gets none of them. 

A—B --&gt; A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + B&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

''same'' indicates that each atom leaves with the same number of electrons from the bond. ''different'', refers to the fact that the atoms each end up with a different number of electrons.

==Polar reactions==
'''Polar reactions''' occur when two bonded atoms come apart, one taking more of the shared electrons than the other. They involve '''heterolytic cleavage'''.  The result is two charged species&amp;mdash;one cation and one anion.

==Radical reactions==
'''Radical reactions''' don't deal with charged particles but with radicals. '''Radicals''' are uncharged atoms or molecules with an incomplete octet of valence electrons. 

When a molecule comes apart by '''homolytic cleavage''' the result is two radicals. Although uncharged, radicals are usually very reactive because the unfilled octet is unstable and the radical can lower its energy by forming a bond in a way that allows it to fill its valence shell while avoiding any electrostatic charge..

== Problem ==

A rectangular pizza is placed on a tray. The sides of the tray extend by 4 units to the right and left and by 3 units (x) above and below. Calculate a value of x such that the area of the tray protruding is as small as possible.

[[Image:pizza.png|Pizza image]]

== Answer ==

The solution to this problem lies in differential calculus. Looking at the diagram below, we can see that the area of the tray extending from the pizza is given by

[[Image:1st-eq.png|math subst image]]

Substituting:

&lt;math&gt;{\mathrm y} = \frac{60}x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A = (\frac{60}x + 6)(x + 8) - 60&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{60x}x + 6x + \frac{480}{x} - 60&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A = 6x + \frac{480}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:x-1.png|math subst image]]

[[Image:x-2b.png|math subst image]]

&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\mathrm d}A}{{\mathrm d}x} = 6 - \frac{480}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the area should be at a minimum:

&lt;math&gt;0 = 6 - \frac{480}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt80&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</text>

Long ago, people observed the differences between compounds that were derived from living things and those that were not. There seemed to be an impassable gap between the properties of the two groups. Someone proposed the '''vital force theory''' to explain the difference. The theory said that there was a something called a vital force that dwelled within the organic material that did not exist in the nonorganic materials. However, to echo the words of President Ronald Reagan, it was &quot;only&quot; a theory.

Atoms are made up of a '''nucleus''' and '''electrons''' that orbit the nucleus. An atom in its natural, uncharged state has the same number of electrons as protons. If it gains or loses electrons, the atom is then referred to as an '''ion'''.

===The nucleus===

The nucleus is made up of '''protons''', which each have a positive charge, and '''neutrons''', which have no charge.  Neutrons and protons have about the same mass, and together account for most of the mass of the atom. Each of these particles is made up of even smaller particles, though the existence of these particles do not come into play at the energies and time spans in which most chemical reactions occur.

===Electrons===

The electrons are negatively charged and fly around the nucleus of an atom at something like light speed. We cannot determine exactly where electrons are at any point in time, rather, we can only guess at the probability of finding an electron at a point in space relative to a nucleus at any point in time. The image depicts the Bohr model of the atom, in which the electrons inhabit discrete &quot;orbitals&quot; around the nucleus much like planets orbit the sun.  Current models of the atomic structure hold that electrons occupy fuzzy clouds around the nucleus of specific shapes, some spherical, some dumbbell shaped, some with even more complex shapes.  Even though the simpler Bohr model of atomic structure has been superseded, we still refer to these electron clouds as &quot;orbitals&quot;.  The number of electrons and the nature of the orbitals they occupy greatly influence the reactivity of atoms in organic chemistry.

----
===Electron orbitals===
Electrons orbit atoms in clouds of distinct shapes and sizes. The electron clouds are layered one inside the other into units called '''shells''' (think nested Russian dolls), with the electrons occupying the smallest, innermost shell having the lowest '''energy state''' and the electrons in the largest, outermost shell having the highest energy state. The higher the energy state, the more '''potential energy''' the electron has, just like a rock at the top of a hill has more potential energy than a rock at the bottom of a valley. These concepts will be important in understanding later concepts like optical activity of chiral compounds as well as many interesting things outside the realm of organic chemistry (like how lasers work).

===Wave nature of electrons===

Electrons behave as particles but also as waves. (Work by Albert Einstein and others revealed that in fact, light and all matter behaves with this dual nature, and it is most clearly observed in the tiniest particles.) One of the results of this observation is that electrons are not just in simple orbit around the nucleus as we imagine the moon to circle the earth, but instead occupy space as if they were a wave on the surface of a sphere.  

If you jump a jumprope you could imagine that the wave in the rope is in its fundamental frequency.  The high and low points fall right in the middle, and the places where the rope doesn't move much (the '''nodes''') occur only at the two ends. If you shake the rope fast enough in a rythmic way, using more energy than you would just jumping rope, you might be able to make the rope vibrate with a wavelength shorter than the fundamental.  You them might see that the rope has more than one place along its length where it vibrates from its highest spot to its lowest spot.  Furthermore, you'll see that there is one or more places (or nodes) along its length where the rope seems to move very little, if at all. 

Or consider stringed musical instruments.  The sound made by these instruments comes from the different ways, or '''modes''' the strings can vibrate.  We can refer to these different patterns or modes of vibrations as '''linear harmonics.'''  Going from there, we can recognize that a drum makes sound by vibrations that occur across the 2-dimensional surface of the drumhead.  Extending this now into three dimensions, we think of the electron as vibrating across a 3-dimensional sphere, and the patterns or modes of vibration are referred to as '''spherical harmonics'''.  The mathematical analysis of spherical harmonics were worked out by the French mathematician Legendre long before anyone started to think about the shapes of electron orbitals.  The algebraic expressions he developed, known as Legendre polynomials, describe the three dimension shapes of electron orbitals in much the same way that the expression '''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = z''' describes a circle (or, for that matter, a drumhead).  Many organic chemists need never actually work with these equations, but it helps to understand where the pictures we use to think about the shapes of these orbitals come from.  

===Electron shells===

Each different shell is subdivided into one or more '''orbitals''', which also have different energy levels, although the energy difference between orbitals is less than the energy difference between shells.

Longer wavelengths have less energy; the s orbital has the longest wavelength allowed for an electron orbiting a nucleus and this orbital is observed to have the lowest energy.

Each shell in an orbital has a characteristic shape, and are named by a letter. They are: '''s''', '''p''', '''d''', and '''f'''.

As one progresses up through the shells (represented by the principle quantum number '''n''') more types of orbitals become possible.

===S orbital===

The '''s orbital''' is the orbital lowest in energy and is spherical in shape. Electrons in this orbital are in their fundamental frequency. 

[[Image:S-orbital.png]]

===P orbital===

The next lowest-energy orbital is the '''p orbital'''. Its shape is often described as like that of a dumbbell.  There are three p-orbitals each oriented along one of the 3-dimensional coordinates x, y or z.

[[Image:P-orbital.png]]

These three different p orbitals can be referred to as the p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''s''' and '''p''' orbitals are important for understanding most of organic chemistry as these are the orbitals that are occupied by the type of atoms that are most common in organic compounds.

===D orbital===

There are 5 types of '''d''' orbitals.  Three of them are roughly X-shaped, as shown here, and might be viewed as being shaped like a crossed pair of dumbbells .  They are referred to as d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub u&gt;, and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;.  Like the p-orbitals, these three d orbitals have a node at the origin of the coordinate system where the three axes all come together.  Unlike the p orbitals, however, these three d orbitals are not oriented along the x, y, or z axes, but instead are oriented in between them.  The d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, for instance, lies in the xy plane, but the lobes of the orbital point out in between the x and y axes.

===F orbital and beyond===

There are 7 kinds of F orbitals, but we will not discuss their shapes here.  F orbitals are filled in the elements of the lanthanide and actinide series, although electrons in these orbitals rarely come into play in organometallic reactions involving these elements.

----


When an atom or ion receives electrons into its orbitals, the orbitals and shells fill up in a particular manner.

There are three principles that govern this process: 1) the Aufbau (build-up) principle, 2) the Pauli exclusion principle, and 3) Hund's rule.


=== Exclusion principle ===

No more than one electron can have all four quantum numbers the same.  What this translates to in terms of our pictures of orbitals is that each orbital can only hold two electrons, one &quot;spin up&quot; and one &quot;spin down&quot;.

=== Build-up principle ===

You may consider an atom as being &quot;built up&quot; from a naked nucleus by gradually adding to it one electron after another, until all the electrons it will hold have been added.  Much as one fills up a container with liquid from the bottom up, so also are the orbitals of an atom filled from the lowest energy orbitals to the highest energy orbitals.  

However, the three p orbitals of a given shell all occur at the same energy level.  So, how are they filled up?  Is one of them filled full with the two electrons it can hold first?  Or do each of the three orbitals receive one electron apiece before the any single orbital is double occupied.  As it turns out, the latter situation occurs.

=== Hund's rule ===

This rule is applicable only for those elements that have d electrons, and so is less important in organic chemistry (though it is important in organometallic chemistry).  It says that filled and half-filled shells tend to have additional stability.  In some instances, then, for example, the 4s orbitals will be filled before the 3d orbitals.


=== Building atoms with quantum mechanics (advanced topic) ===

The equations (like the Legendre polynomials that describe spherical harmonics, and thus the shapes of orbitals) of quantum mechanics are distinguished by four types of numbers.  The first of these '''quantum numbers''' is referred to as the principal quantum number, and is indicated by '''n'''.  This merely represents which shell electrons occupy, and shows up in the periodic chart as the rows of the periodic chart.  It has integral values, n=1,2,3 . . . .   The highest energy electrons of the atoms in the first row all have n=1.  Those in the atoms in the second row all have n=2.  As one gets into n=3, Hund's rule mixes it up a little bit, but when one gets to the end of the third row, at least, the electrons with the highest energy have n=3.

The next quantum number is indicated by the letter '''m''' and indicates how many different types of shells an atom can have.  Those elements in the first row can have just one, the s orbital.  The elements in the second row can have two, the s and the p orbitals.  The elements in the third row can have three, the s, p, and d orbitals.  And so on.  It may be funny to think of s, p and d as 
&quot;numbers&quot;, but these are used as an historical and geometrical convenience.

The third kind of quantum number '''m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' specifies, for those kinds of orbitals that can have different shapes, which of the possible shapes one is referring to.  So, for example, a 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital indicates three quantum numbers, represented respectively by the 2, the p and the z.  

Finally, the fourth quantum number is the '''spin''' of the electron.  It has only two possible values, +1/2 or -1/2.


Pretty much only computational chemists have to treat quantum numbers as numbers per se is equations.  But it helps to know that the wide variety of elements of the periodic table and the different shapes and other properties of electron orbitals have a unifying principle--the proliferation of different shapes is not completely arbitrary, but is instead bounded by very specific rules.

Afbau Principle (it means 'building up'):-
It states that the orbitals should be filled according to their increasing energies
Thus the lowest energy orbital which is available is filled first. The increasing order
of energies of the various orbitals is:-
 1s,2s,2p,3s,3p,4s,3d,4p,5s,4d,5p,6s,4f,5d,6p,7s,5f......
The order of increasing of energy of orbitals can be calc. from(n+l) rule or 'Bohr bury rule' 
According to this rule, the value of n+l is the energy of the orbital and such 
on orbital will be filled up first. e.g. 
4s orbital having lower value of(n+l) has lower energy than 3d orbital and hence 4s orbital
is filled up first.
For 4s orbital, n+l=4+0=4
For 3d orbital, n+l=3+2=5,therefore 4s orbital will be filled first.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I agree that this is a stunning piece of work! However, having found his email (raymond@kestrel.nmt.edu), I am loath to contact him personally. Perhaps we could construct a letter of appreciation and an invitation over here from all of us. Forgive me if I take the liberty of starting the ball rolling - I think it should include:
*thanks for his work
*request that we continue to publish it (just for politness sake, I know it's GNU FDL)
*an invitation to visit Wikibooks, Wikipedia, Wikiversity etc. --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 23:55, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

This is great! Let's make sure we give this guy proper credit per the GNU FDL
and also make him aware of what we are doing. [[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

Hey Mav, there are more things like this one [http://www.opencursus.be/modules.php?name=Downloads here] with the GNU FDL license and everything .. I started one up for Cell Bio but there are many more to harvest. [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I've done an initial conversion of [http://kestrel.nmt.edu/~raymond/classes/ph13xbook/node11.html this page]:

===Beats===

Suppose two sound waves of different frequency impinge on your ear at the same time. The displacement perceived by your ear is the superposition of these two waves, with time dependence
&lt;math&gt; A(t) = \sin ( \omega_1 t) + \sin ( \omega_2 t) = 2 \sin ( \omega_0 t) \cos ( \Delta \omega t) , &lt;/math&gt; (2.19)

where we now have &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = ( \omega_1 + \omega_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega = ( \omega_2 - \omega_1 )/2&lt;/math&gt;. What you actually hear is a tone with angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; which fades in and out with period
&lt;math&gt;T_{beat} = \pi / \Delta \omega = 2 \pi / ( \omega_2 - \omega_1 ) = 1 / ( f_2 - f_1 ) . &lt;/math&gt; (2.20)

The ''beat frequency'' is simply
&lt;math&gt; f_{beat} = 1/T_{beat} = f_2 - f_1 . &lt;/math&gt; (2.21)

Note how beats are the time analog of wave packets -- the mathematics are the same except that frequency replaces wavenumber and time replaces space.

Is this generally acceptable? -- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 18:41 17 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Why don't you add other sections of your textbook here? I'm more interested in editing the more &quot;fun&quot; section than elementary wave theory/geometric optics.

:Why don't you help out and add some other sections yourself.  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 22:50, 11 Sep 2003 (UTC)

----
Do you realize the presence of a partially ported textbook which no one seems to bother to completely transfer is actually hampering the creation of a textbook? If you'd never thought of porting over a textbook, by now, I'm pretty sure we'd have more material!

:Why don't you help out and add some other sections yourself.  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 22:50, 11 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Two questions:

# If we make changes to this textbook and the original author makes changes, there is no easy way to &quot;merge&quot; them like in CVS for example.  How complete is his work?  If it is 99% complete physics textbook then that's fine.  I guess we could also entice him to work on this &quot;fork&quot; of his textbook once we port it over.

:We could try, but anyway I don't think it matters if they diverge.[[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]

# Should all the graphics be changed to have a white background?  The grey looks horrid.  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 22:59, 11 Sep 2003 (UTC)
:I agree, or why not make it transparent, that way if we ever change the colour of the page w wonlt have go and change all the graphics. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]

About TeX/HTML:

Over at www.wikipedia.org, on a few articles I've helped out with, I've been pushing for italic HTML in the text regions, and TeX for indented formulas, so like the following:

So, a great physicist proved that ''a = b + c'' except when ''e &lt; d''.  Here is the proof of that:

:&lt;math&gt;a &lt; b,&lt;/math&gt;

so,

:&lt;math&gt;e + d + c + a &gt; b&lt;/math&gt;

Sorry I was stumped for a good example.  Anyways, TeX in the text looks really bad, unless the PNG is made smaller by a future version of wikipedia.  [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 23:22, 11 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Great book ! I'll give a hand to porting it here. BTW, has anyone reached the author ? [[User:R|R]] 19:07, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)

===Aim of text===

Popped on over here from Wikipedia and couldn't help but check out the books in my field.  My question though is what type of course this is supposed to be a text for.  

:None, specifically. Textbooks don't have to be tied to courses.  This text is based on http://kestrel.nmt.edu/~raymond/classes/ph13xbook/index.html. It should give an introduction to the basic principles and methods of physics, with emphasis on the underlying unity. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

It seems like way too much material for one semester, but each chapter is too little material, too.  

:That depends quite a bit on the university, and the country - one of the reasons why this text is not being tailored for a specific course. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

Specifically, I'm looking at the Quantum Mechanics.  It looks like it's going to be on a level of what is usually (at the schools I've been at) called Quantum Physics, which is a second year undergraduate course.  But if it solves the Hydrogen atom (there's a Hydrogen Atom section at least),

:The source text doesn't give a full solution. It uses the uncertainty principle to estimate the ground state. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

then it looks like it's trying to be a text for a junior/senior-level Quantum Mechanics course, in which case it needs many more sections on Dirac notation, spin, angular momentum, the harmonic oscillator, path integrals, and maybe time-independent perturbation theory.  

:I'd put all that into a separate undergraduate comprehensive QM book, which should also include time-dependant perturbations, scattering and quantum thermodynamics, everything short of postgrad. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 05:43, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

The latter is the stuff I think is interesting and would be into working on.  So yeah, what is this textbook trying to be?  -Laura Scudder

I got the same feeling as Laura above. If all the topics mentioned on [[Modern Physics]] covered with any reasonable depth, it should actually cover the full 4 year of physics major education (taking UC Berkeley as example, Intro (mere skimming surface, except for mechanics and E&amp;M) to each of those topics would cover the first 3 semesters (7A - C), Quantum mechanics would cover 137A and B, E&amp;M would cover 110A and B, Mechanics would cover 105. Nuclear physics and relativity (special and general) would cover a year (or two courses) of electives. The only thing it's missing is statistical mechanics and a lab course! I think [[Modern Physics]] needs to be clear (on the front page somewhere) regarding its aims, esp. whether it actually intends to cover all mentioned topics in depth (essentially forming what is comparable to Landau's course on theoretical physics), or whether it intends to simply give the student a quick taste of each without going into details.

I'm making this request because people seem to be suggesting often that other advanced textbooks be merged into this project, and if this project doesn't intend to cover all these topics in depth (and essentially forming a *complete* physics education for physics majors) ... well, it should be clearly out in the open.

== Thanks to Flonejek ==
Flonejek, you are doing a great service in working on this book. It may not be overtly glamorous work at the onset but the result will be very helpful to many people. Thank you. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Cool, thanks --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 07:49, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

The various contents pages have some of the subsections in a different order to the source book.

If we're keeping this as a single coherent course (even if possibly in multiple volumes) many of them will need returning to the original order, to preserve logical dependance.

If we're going to convert the source book into a set of stand-alone books, most of the chapters will need considerably more expansion and some reordering.

I'll do it the first way, unless anyone objects.  [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

== I'm Back :) ==

Had some tough times at school, but now i'm back, and hope to be making at least one edit/addition a week --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 04:38, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:Be nice to have people editing this book. You may notice I've made some changes to some of the chapters, and added some extra material, both to reflect the previous changes in chapter order from the base text and to enhance the presentation of pysics as a subject with a underlying unity, not just a random collection of formulas.

:This does mean that half the [[Modern Physics:Accelerated Reference Frames|chapter]] you just uploaded has already been incorporated into other chapters, and the the rest will need some revision, with 'Event horizons' being folded into it, that being rather a short chapter to stand alone and material that will work best closer to its diagram. :)

:Since we're both working on this book, perhaps it'll be best if we both keep an eye on what the other is doing, to make sure the book retains its unity. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 06:17, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::Ok, I agree with that, especially the re-orientation away from a formula based text, I had a bit of a struggle understanding most of them myself. For now I'm going to read over whats been written already, and then I'll start adding/editing stuff again, mostly on weekends. I like the changes you made as well, though I might redraw a few of those diagrams in inkscape, at the moment they look a bit straggly. --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 00:11, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:: Hey, I'd be quite keen to help out on some physics books here. I started by deriving the time-independent Shrôdinger equation and correcting a couple of mistakes in the Operators page. Is that cool or am I being a bit too formula-y? [[User:Spitvalve|Spitvalve]] 22:27, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

== Another source ==

Another source available is http://www.physicsforfree.com, which has three &quot;copyright free&quot; textbooks.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 02:27, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

== Navigation Template ==

I'm going to be doing alot of work and contributing to the electromagnetics section of this book, and I've created a handy template that (i think) we should employ throughout this book: {{tl|ModernPhysicsNav}}. This template creates a backlink to the main page if no arguments are provided, and it will provide a link to a section page if an argument is provided. More information about this template, and the way to use it can be found [[Template:ModernPhysicsNav|On the template page itself, HERE]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:11, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

:It would take the same amount of time to rename a page to create automatic backlinks as it would using this template, so I personally don't see it as being needed.  What I find to be a lot more useful are links to the next chapter of a book, rather than back to the contents page. See {{tl|Chess/Navigation}} for an example. The format would be &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Modern Physics nav|previous subpage name|next subpage name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the bottom of each page. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 07:00, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

:I see it's already been added. Nevermind then! No need to redo everything. :) --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 07:05, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

::Sorry, I was a little hasty, perhaps. I got very frustrated very quickly by the lack of page navigation in this book. If you go to [[Modern Physics:Waves:Contents|The Waves Chapter]], you can see that people have already provided individual navigation templates for pages in an individual section. I propose that we extend that idea to cover each individual section in this book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:36, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

::As per your suggestion, Hagindaz, I'll edit the navigation template to optionally take 2 more parameters: A link to the previous page, and a link to the next page. In this way, we can add this kind of navigation on a per-page basis, if we want to, or let other navigation templates do the job, such as on the [[Modern Physics:Waves:Contents|Waves]] section. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:23, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

:::I am in favour of each section of this book being written as a book in its own right. Published modern physics textbooks are usually 2 or more volumes with at least 1000 pages. Perhaps the template could be used in each subsidiary book ie: Quantum physics : Heisenberg uncertainty principle. rather than Modern physics: Quantum Physics: Heisenberg etc. Each template would have a link to the Modern Physics introductory page. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:42, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

== Stub Template ==

I created a specific template for use in marking stubs for this book: {{tl|ModernPhysicsStub}}. This template automatically puts all stub pages of this book into [[:Category:Modern Physics/Stubs]], which is a sub-category of [[:Category:Modern Physics]]. We can use this template and these categories to quickly find all stub pages in this book that require attention. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:42, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

:Combined, here is a list of available templates and category designations that are specifically designed for use with this book:

*[[Template:ModernPhysicsTOC]]
*[[Template:ModernPhysicsNav]]
*[[Template:ModernPhysicsStub]]
*[[:Category:Modern Physics]]
*[[:Category:Modern Physics/Stubs]]

:All of these tools are explained on their respective module and talk pages. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

== Contributors ==

These people were listed as &quot;Contributors&quot; on the front page, but none of them have been active on wikibooks for at least 1 year (and in some cases much more). I have removed the names from the front page, therefore, and put them here. I don't think that we need to list contributors (especially not on the front page), but we could create a separate page for it (or a separate section on this talk page) if we really wanted to --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:24, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

*[[User:Carandol|Carandol]] Has done the majority of the usability formatting, current main contributor
*[[User:Flonejek|Flonejek]] Improved navigation and copied over a few chapters 
:: I'm still in highschool, and as such this wikibook is a bit of a struggle for me to keep working on, mainly because its too complex for me and I'm too lazy to currently try and comprehend the next few chapters that need work... --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 06:20, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)

The book was designed specifically for students who had not previously been exposed to mathematics as mathematicians view it.  That is, as a subject whose goal is to ''rigorously'' prove theorems starting from clear consistent definitions.  This book attempts to build students up from a background where mathematics is simply a tool that provides useful calculations to the point where the students have a grasp of the clear and precise nature of mathematics.  A more detailed discussion of the prerequisites and goal of this book is given in the introduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There's a nice public domain C/C++ primer available [http://www.vectorsite.net/tscpp.html here]; there are also two FDL licensed books on http://savannah.gnu.org which I'll dig up if there's interest, and a C++ wiki, linked from the [[en:C plus plus|Wikipedia C++]] article.

Would it be a good idea to integrate these as a basis? I'd go with the first link for the general basis, as it covers both languages. I'll do the conversion if people agree that it's a good idea. -- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 17:53 17 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:I don't like the general idea of C/C++ being taught as one - printf() and scanf() are not useful/recommended in C++ and cout&lt;&lt; and cin&gt;&gt; are invalid in C. Vectorsite (your first link) covers C with a footnote on C++ at the end. File methods are different, memory allocation is different, string manipulation is different (I'd love to be using std::string if I knew it better than the char* methods)...if not separate C and C++ books, there should be C- and C++-specific variants of some sections/chapters. Even Bjarne Stroustrop mentions somewhere on his website he doesn't like the phrase &quot;C/C++&quot; - the languages are too different. [[User:Geoffrey|Geoffrey]] 00:11 18 Jul 2003 (UTC)


I agree with the C/C++ problem.  I've decided that it might be good to just do a version of each chapter.  And then a third chapter that will compare the differences between each language. What do you guys think? [[User:Mrquick|Josh]]

Well, when I said use them as a basis, that's what I meant. The languages have many differences, yes, but they also have a lot in common. I've put a wikified version of the vectorsite stuff in my user namespace; I would use them as a basis, and split them out - it's a primer, not a textbook proper. 

We could easily have textbooks for different angles; C++ for beginners, C++ for C programmers, or C for C++ programmers. There's a lot of overlap here, articles could be shared, others adapted for a different approach. For example, the introduction to classes in C++ would be the same for absolute beginners as it would be for C programmers interested in C++. I think it's better to start with something than to start from scratch, and the vectorsite stuff gives that. And if nothing else, the quick reference would make a good appendix.

-- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 17:37 18 Jul 2003 (UTC)

I think that the vectorsite stuff could make a good reference, but I don't like its methods. I remember that when I was originally learning how to program that I read some of those books, but they never really helped me a lot. I never really got good at programming until I actually tried to write some semi-big programs.  So I was thinking of trying to teach it, and introduce all of the concepts through the use in programming something.  For example, I've written a really small game, Pitfall (you an ASCII character falling down a pit of ascii characters), that can be programmed to introduce most of the beginning concepts of programming. I don't just plan to give it to them, and then explain it line by line, I was thinking I'd walk them through the process of programming (introduce them to the mind set of programming) it.

-- [[User:Mrquick|Josh]] /time

The languages are only really common at core syntax. C++ includes C functionality, but it is expected that most of it is not used. Completely different approaches are taken to the same tasks. For example, #define versus const. A &quot;dual&quot; approach will have to explain that in C, const variables can't be used in constant expressions. Beyond the most basic things, C++ does things differently than C: printf versus cout, malloc versus new, pointer versus reference, array versus vector, char* versus string, and so on. The basic syntax is similar but that is hardly grounds for the whole languages being similar. (Occasionally, the lower-level C things like #define's are proper and necessary, but they'll still not the usual C++ way.)

Also, those who only want to learn one or the other will be annoyed with all the extraneous information.

I think we should have separate textbooks for each language, which do not closely parallel each other. (Many C++ things don't have any C parallels, anyway.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to C; Functions; Control Constructs ==

The C programming language is sometimes referred to as a &quot;middle-level&quot; language. It provides low-level programming capability at the expense of some user-friendliness. Some cynics claim that &quot;C combines the flexibility and power of assembly language with the user-friendliness of assembly language.&quot;

The original implementations of C were defined as described in the classic reference, ''The C Programming Language'', by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. This definition left a few things to be desired, and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a group in the 1980s to tighten up the spec. The result was &quot;ANSI C&quot;, which is the focus of this document. 

=== An Introductory C Program ===

Here's a simple C program to calculate the volume of a sphere:

   /* sphere.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;                /* Include header file for printf. */
   #define PI 3.141592654            /* Define a constant. */

   float sphere( int rad );          /* Function prototype. */

   void main()                       /* Main program. */
   {
     float vol;                      /* Declare variable. */
     int radius = 3;                 /* Declare and initialize variable. */
     vol = sphere( radius );         /* Call function, get result, print it. */
     printf( &quot;Volume: %f\n&quot;, vol );
   }

   float sphere( int rad )           /* Function. */
   { 
     float result;                   /* Local variable declaration. */
     result = rad * rad * rad;
     result = 4 * PI * result / 3;
     return( result );               /* Result returned to main program. */
   }

The first thing you'll figure out about this program are that comments are enclosed by &quot;/*&quot; and &quot;*/&quot;. Comments can go almost anywhere, since the compiler ignores them. You'll also notice that most lines of statements in the program end with a &quot;;&quot; and that some do not. Either forgetting a &quot;;&quot; or adding one where it isn't needed is a common C programming bugs. Lines of code are grouped by using curly brackets (&quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot;).

C is case-sensitive. All C keywords are in lower-case. You can declare program variable and function names in whatever case you want, but by convention they should be in lower case. Constants, more on this momentarily, are upper case by convention.

* Not all the lines in a C program are executable statements. Some of the statements shown above are &quot;preprocessor directives&quot;.

C compilation is a multi-pass process. To create a program, a C compiler system performs the following steps:

* It runs the source file text through a &quot;C preprocessor&quot;. All this does is perform various text manipulations on the source file, such as macro expansion, constant expansion, file inclusion, and conditional compilation
* more on all these things later. The output of the preprocessor is a second-level source file for actual compilation. You can think of the C preprocessor as a sort of specialized &quot;text editor&quot;.

* Next, it runs the second-level source file through the compiler proper, which actually converts the source code statements into their binary equivalents. That is, it creates an &quot;object file&quot; from the source file.

The object file still cannot be executed, however. If it makes use of C library functions, such as &quot;printf()&quot; in the example above, the binary code for the library functions has to be merged, or &quot;linked&quot;, with the program object file. Furthermore, some addressing information needs to be linked to the object file so it can actually be loaded and run on the target system.

      These linking tasks are performed by a &quot;linker&quot;, which takes one or more object files and links them to binary library files to create an &quot;executable&quot; file that can actually be run. Note that you can create programs from a set of multiple object files using the linker.

      C has a large number of libraries and library functions. C by itself has few statements, so much of its functionality is implemented as library calls. 

Commands intended for the C preprocessor, rather than for the C compiler itself, start with a &quot;#&quot; and are known as &quot;preprocessor directives&quot; or &quot;metacommands&quot;. The example program above has two such metacommands:

  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #define PI 3.14

The first statement, &quot;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&quot;, simply merges the contents of the file &quot;stdio.h&quot; to the contents of the current program file before compilation. The &quot;stdio.h&quot; file contains declarations required for use of the standard-I/O library, which provides the &quot;printf()&quot; function.

Incidentally, the &quot;stdio.h&quot; file, or &quot;header file&quot;, only contains declarations. The actual code for the library is contained in separate library files that are added at link time. You can create your own header files with your own declarations if you like, and include them as follows:

   #include &quot;mydefs.h&quot;

Angle brackets are only used to define default header files that the C preprocessor can find in default directories.

 A C program is built up of one or more functions. The program above contains two user-defined functions, &quot;main()&quot; and &quot;sphere()&quot;, as well as the &quot;printf()&quot; library function.

The &quot;main()&quot; function is mandatory when writing a self-contained program. It defines the function that is automatically executed when the program is run. All other functions will be directly or indirectly called by &quot;main()&quot;.

You call a C function simply by specifying its name, with any arguments enclosed in following parentheses, with commas separating the arguments. In the program above, the &quot;printf()&quot; function is called as follows:

   printf( &quot;Volume: %f\n&quot;, volume );

This invocation provides two arguments. The first -- &quot;Volume: %f\n&quot; -- supplies text and some formatting information. The second, &quot;volume&quot;, supplies a numeric value.

A function may or may not return a value. The &quot;sphere()&quot; function does, and so is invoked as follows:

   volume = sphere( radius );

A function uses the &quot;return&quot; keyword to return a value. In the case of &quot;sphere&quot;, it returns the volume of the sphere with the statement:

   return( result );

 All variables in a C program must be &quot;declared&quot; by specifying their name and type. The example program declares two variables for the &quot;main&quot; routine:

   float volume;
   int radius = 3;

-- and one in the &quot;sphere&quot; routine:

   float result;

The declarations of &quot;volume&quot; and &quot;result&quot; specify a floating-point, or real, variable. The declaration of &quot;radius&quot; specifies an integer variable. The declaration allows variables to be initialized when declared if need be, in this case declaring &quot;radius&quot; and assigning it a value of &quot;3&quot;.

All three of these declarations define &quot;local&quot; variables. Local variables exist only within the functions that declare them. You could declare variables of the same name in different functions, and they would still remain distinct variables. You can also declare &quot;global&quot; variables that can be shared by all functions by declaring them outside the program's functions and then using the &quot;extern&quot; keyword within the functions to allow access to it.

   /* global.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void somefunc( void );
   int globalvar;

   void main()
   {
     extern int globalvar;
     globalvar = 42;
     somefunc();
     printf( &quot;%d\n&quot;, globalvar );
   }

   void somefunc( void )
   {
     extern int globalvar;
     printf( &quot;%d\n&quot;, globalvar );
     globalvar = 13;
   }

 You'll notice that besides the variable declarations, there is also a function declaration, or &quot;function prototype&quot;, that allows the C compiler to check that any calls to the function are correct:

   float sphere( int rad );

The function prototypes declare the type of value the function returns (the type will be &quot;void&quot; if it does not return a value), and the arguments that are to be provided with the function.

Finally, the &quot;printf()&quot; library function provides text output capabilities for the program. You can use &quot;printf()&quot; to print a simple message as follows:

   printf( &quot;Hello, world!&quot; );

-- displays the text:

   Hello, world!

Remember that &quot;printf()&quot; doesn't automatically add a &quot;newline&quot; to allow following &quot;printf()&quot;s to print on the next display line. If you execute:

   printf( &quot;Twas bryllig &quot; );
   printf( &quot;and the slithy toves&quot; );

-- you get the text:

   Twas bryllig and the slithy toves

You must add a newline character (&quot;\n&quot;) to force a newline. For example:

   printf( &quot;Hello,\nworld!&quot; );

-- gives:

   Hello,
   world!

These examples only print a predefined text constant. You can also include &quot;format codes&quot; in the string and then follow the string with one or more variables to print the values they contain:

   printf( &quot; Result = %f\n&quot;, result );

This would print something like:

   Result = 0.5

The &quot;%f&quot; is the format code that tells &quot;printf&quot; to print a floating-point number. For another example, consider:

   printf( &quot;%d times %d = %d\n&quot;, a, b, a * b );

-- which would print something like:

   4 * 10 = 40

The &quot;%d&quot; prints an integer quantity. Math or string expressions and functions can be included in the argument list.

If you simply want to print a string of text, you can use a simpler function, &quot;puts()&quot;, that displays the specified text and automatically appends a newline:

   puts( &quot;Hello, world!&quot; );

Just for fun, let's take a look at what our example program would be like in the earlier versions of C:

   /* oldspher.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #define PI 3.141592654

   float sphere();        /* Parameters not defined in function prototype. */

   main()
   {
     float volume;
     int radius = 3;

     volume = sphere( radius );
     printf( &quot;Volume: %f\n&quot;, volume );
   }

   float sphere( rad )
   int rad;          /* Parameter type not specified in function header. */
   { 
     float result;

     result = rad * rad * rad;
     result = 4 * PI * result / 3;
     return result;
   }

The following sections elaborate on the principles outlined in this section. They may repeat information presented above for the sake of completeness.

=== C Functions in Detail ===

As noted previously, any C program must have a &quot;main()&quot; function to contain the code executed by default when the program is run.

There can be as many functions as you like in the program, and all functions are &quot;visible&quot; to all other functions. For example, if you have:

   /* fdomain.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void func1( void );
   void func2( void );
   
   void main()
   {
     puts( &quot;MAIN&quot; );
     func1();
     func2();
   }

   void func1( void )
   {
     puts( &quot;FUNC1&quot; );
   }

   void func2( void )
   {
     puts( &quot;FUNC2&quot; );
     func1();
   }

-- then &quot;main()&quot; can call &quot;func1()&quot; and &quot;func2()&quot;; &quot;func1()&quot; could call &quot;func2()&quot;; and &quot;func2()&quot; can call &quot;func1()&quot;. In principle, even &quot;main()&quot; could be called by other functions, but there's no intelligent reason to do so. Although &quot;main()&quot; is the first function in the listing above, there's no particular requirement that it be so, but by convention it always is.

Functions can call themselves recursively. For example, &quot;func1()&quot; can call &quot;func1()&quot; indefinitely, or at least until a stack overflow occurs. You cannot declare functions inside other functions.

Functions are defined as follows:

   float sphere( int rad )
   { 
      ...
   }

They begin with a function header that starts with a return value type declaration (&quot;float&quot; in this case), then the function name (&quot;sphere&quot;), and finally the arguments required (&quot;int rad&quot;).

ANSI C dictates that function prototypes be provided to allow the compiler to perform better checking on function calls:

   float sphere( int rad );

For an example, consider a simple program that &quot;fires&quot; a weapon (simply by printing &quot;BANG!&quot;):

   /* bango.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void fire( void );

   void main()
   {
     printf( &quot;Firing!\n&quot; );
     fire();
     printf( &quot;Fired!\n&quot; );
   }

   void fire( void )
   {
     printf( &quot;BANG!\n&quot; );
   }

Since &quot;fire()&quot; does not return a value and does not accept any arguments, both the return value and the argument are declared as &quot;void&quot;; &quot;fire()&quot; also does not use a &quot;return&quot; statement and simply returns automatically when completed.

Let's modify this example to allow &quot;fire()&quot; to accept an argument that defines a number of shots. This gives the program:

   /* fire.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void fire( int n );

   void main()
   {
     printf( &quot;Firing!\n&quot; );
     fire( 5 );
     printf( &quot;Fired!\n&quot; );
   }

   void fire( int n )
   {
     int i;
     for ( i = 1; i &lt;= n ; ++i )
     {
       printf( &quot;BANG!\n&quot; );
     }
   }

This program passes a single parameter, an integer, to the &quot;fire()&quot; function. The function uses a &quot;for&quot; loop to execute a &quot;BANG!&quot; the specified number of times (more on &quot;for&quot; later).

If a function requires multiple arguments, they can be separated by commas:

   printf( &quot;%d times %d = %d\n&quot;, a, b, a * b );

The word &quot;parameter&quot; is sometimes used in place of &quot;argument&quot;. There is actually a fine distinction between these two terms: the calling routine specifies &quot;arguments&quot; to the called function, while the called function receives the &quot;parameters&quot; from the calling routine.

When you list a parameter in the function header, it becomes a local variable to that function. It is initialized to the value provided as an argument by the calling routine. If a variable is used as an argument, there is no need for it to have the same name as the parameter specified in the function header.

For example:

  fire( shots );
  ...
  void fire( int n )
  ... 

The integer variable passed to &quot;fire()&quot; has the name &quot;shots&quot;, but &quot;fire()&quot; accepts the value of &quot;shots&quot; in a local variable named &quot;n&quot;. The argument and the parameter could also have the same name, but even then they would remain distinct variables.

Parameters are matched with arguments in the order in which they are sent:

   /* pmmatch.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void showme( int a, int b );

   void main()
   {
     int x = 1, y = 100;
     showme( x, y );
   }

   void showme( int a, int b )
   {
     printf( &quot;a=%d  b=%d\n&quot;, a, b );
   }

This prints:

   a=1  b=100

You can also modify this program to show that the arguments are not affected by any operations the function performs on the parameters, as follows:

   /* noside.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void showmore( int a, int b );

   void main()
   {
      int x = 1, y = 100;
      showmore( x, y );
      printf( &quot;x=%d  y=%d\n&quot;, x, y );
   }

   void showmore( int a, int b )
   {
      printf( &quot;a=%d  b=%d\n&quot;, a, b );
      a = 42;
      b = 666;
      printf( &quot;a=%d  b=%d\n&quot;, a, b );
   }

This prints:

   a=1  b=100
   a=42  b=666
   x=1  y=100

You can send arrays to functions as if they were any other type of variable:

   /* fnarray.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #define SIZE 10
   
   void testfunc( int a[] );
   
   void main()
   {
     int ctr, a[SIZE];
     for( ctr = 0; ctr &lt; SIZE; ++ctr )
     {
       a[ctr] = ctr * ctr;
     }
     testfunc( a );
   }
   
   void testfunc( int a[] )
   {
     int n;
     for( n = 0; n &lt; SIZE; ++ n )
     {
       printf( &quot;%d\n&quot;, a[n] );
     }
   }

Although a novice programmer would not want to deal with such complications, it is possible to define functions with a variable number of parameters. In fact, &quot;printf()&quot; is such a function. We won't worry about this issue further in this document.

The normal way to get a value out of a function is simply to provide it as a return value. This neatly encapsulates the function and isolates it from the calling routine. In the example in the first section, the function &quot;sphere()&quot; returned a &quot;float&quot; value with the statement:

   return( result );

The calling routine accepted the return value as follows:

   volume = sphere( radius );

The return value can be used directly as a parameter to other functions:

   printf( &quot;Volume: %f\n&quot;, sphere( radius ) );

The return value does not have to be used; &quot;printf()&quot;, for example, returns the number of characters it prints, but few programs bother to check.

A function can contain more than one &quot;return&quot; statement:

   if( error == 0 )
   {
     return( 0 );
   }
   else
   {
     return( 1 );
   }

You can place &quot;return&quot; anywhere in a function, and it does not have to return a value. Without a value, &quot;return&quot; simply causes the function to return control to the calling routine. This of course implies that the data type of the function be declared as &quot;void&quot;:

   void ftest( int somevar )
   {
      ...
      if( error == 0 )
      {
        return();
      }
      ...
   }

If there's no &quot;return&quot; in a function, the function returns after it executes its last statement. Again, this means the function type must be declared &quot;void&quot;.

The &quot;return&quot; statement can only return a single value, but this value can be a &quot;pointer&quot; to an array or a data structure. Pointers are a complicated subject and will be discussed in detail later. They can also be used to return values through an argument list. 

=== C Control Constructs ===

C contains a number of looping constructs, such as the &quot;while&quot; loop:

   /* while.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int test = 10;
     while( test &gt; 0 )
     {
       printf( &quot;test = %d\n&quot;, test );
       test = test - 2;
     }
   }

This loop may not execute at all, if &quot;test&quot; starts with an initial value less than or equal to 0. There is a variant, &quot;do&quot;, that will always execute at least once:

   /* do.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int test = 10;
     do 
     {
       printf( &quot;test = %d\n&quot;, test );
       test = test - 2;
     }
     while( test &gt; 0 );
   } 

The most common looping construct, however, is the &quot;for&quot; loop, which creates a loop much like the &quot;while&quot; loop but in a more compact form:

   /* for.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   
   void main()
   {
     int test;
     for( test = 10; test &gt; 0; test = test - 2 )
     {
       printf( &quot;test = %d\n&quot;, test );
     }

   }

Notice that with all these loops, the initial loop statement does not end with a &quot;;&quot;. If you did this with the &quot;for&quot; loop above, the &quot;for&quot; statement would execute to completion, but not run any of the statements in the body of the loop.

The &quot;for&quot; loop has the syntax:

   for( &lt;initialization&gt;; &lt;operating test&gt;; &lt;modifying expression&gt; )

All the elements in parentheses are optional. You could actually run a &quot;for&quot; loop indefinitely with:

   for( ; ; )
   {
     ...
   }

-- although using an indefinite &quot;while&quot; is cleaner:

   while( 1 )
   {
     ...
   }

You can use multiple expressions in either the initialization or the modifying expression with the &quot;,&quot; operator:

   /* formax.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int a, b;
     for ( a = 256, b = 1; b &lt; 512 ; a = a / 2, b = b * 2 )
     {
       printf( &quot;a = %d  b = %d\n&quot;, a, b );
     }
   }

The conditional tests available to C are as follows:

   a == b:   equals                       
   a != b:   not equals
   a &lt; b:    less than                    
   a &gt; b:    greater than
   a &lt;= b:   less than or equals          
   a &gt;= b:   greater than or equals

The fact that &quot;==&quot; is used to perform the &quot;equals&quot; test, while &quot;=&quot; is used as the assignment operator, often causes confusion and is a common bug in C programming:

   a == b:   Is &quot;a&quot; equal to &quot;b&quot;?
   a = b:    Assign value of &quot;b&quot; to &quot;a&quot;.

C also contains decision-making statements, such as &quot;if&quot;:

   /* if.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #define MISSILE 1

   void fire( int weapon )

   void main()
   {
     fire( MISSILE );
   }

   void fire( int weapon )
   {
     if( weapon == MISSILE )
     {
       printf( &quot;Fired missile!\n&quot; );
     }
     if( weapon != MISSILE )
     {
       printf( &quot;Unknown weapon!\n&quot;);
     }
   }

This example can be more easily implemented using an &quot;else&quot; clause:

   /* ifelse.c */

   void fire( int weapon )
   {
     if( weapon == MISSILE )
     {
       printf( &quot;Fired missile!\n&quot; );
     }
     else
     {
       printf( &quot;Unknown weapon!\n&quot;);
     }
   }

Since there is only one statement in each clause, the curly brackets aren't really necessary. This would work just as well:

   void fire( int weapon )
   {
     if( weapon == MISSILE )
       printf( &quot;Fired missile!\n&quot; );
     else
       printf( &quot;Unknown weapon!\n&quot; );
   }

However, the brackets make the structure more obvious; prevent errors if you add statements to the conditional clauses; and the compiler doesn't care one way or another, it generates the same code.

There is no &quot;elseif&quot; keyword, but you can nest &quot;if&quot; statements:

   /* nestif.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #define MISSILE 1
   #define LASER 2

   void fire( int weapon )

   void main()
   {
     fire( LASER );
   }

   void fire( int weapon )
   {
     if( weapon == MISSILE )
     {
       printf( &quot;Fired missile!\n&quot; );
     }
     else
     {
       if( weapon == LASER )
       {
         printf( &quot;Fired laser!\n&quot; );
       }
       else
       {
         printf( &quot;Unknown weapon!\n&quot;);
       }
     }
   }

This is somewhat clumsy, however, and the &quot;switch&quot; statement does a cleaner job:

   /* switch.c */

   void fire( int weapon )
   {
     switch( weapon )
     {
     case MISSILE:
       printf( &quot;Fired missile!\n&quot; );
       break;
     case LASER:
       printf( &quot;Fired laser!\n&quot; );
       break;
     default:
       printf( &quot;Unknown weapon!\n&quot;);
       break;
     }
   }

The &quot;switch&quot; statement tests the value of a single variable, which means that if you are testing multiple variables, or are testing for anything but equality to one of a list of values, you'll still have to use the &quot;if&quot; statement. The optional &quot;default&quot; clause is used to handle conditions not covered by the other cases.

Each clause ends in a &quot;break&quot;, which causes execution to break out of the &quot;switch&quot;. Leaving out a &quot;break&quot; can be another subtle error in a C program, since if it isn' there, execution flows right through to the next clause. However, this can be used to advantage. Suppose in our example the routine can also be asked to fire a ROCKET, which is the same as a MISSILE:

   void fire( int weapon )
   {
     switch( weapon )
     {
     case ROCKET:
     case MISSILE:
       printf( &quot;Fired missile!\n&quot; );
       break;
     case LASER:
       printf( &quot;Fired laser!\n&quot; );
       break;
     default:
       printf( &quot;Unknown weapon!\n&quot;);
       break;
     }
   }

The &quot;break&quot; statement is not specific to &quot;switch&quot; statements. It can be used to break out of other control structures, though good program design tends to avoid such improvisations:

   /* break.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int n;
     for( n = 0; n &lt; 10; n = n + 1 )
     {
       if( n == 5 )
       {
         break;  /* Punch out of loop at value 5. */
       }
       else
       {
         printf( &quot;%d\n&quot;, n );
       }
     }
   }

If the &quot;for&quot; loop were nested inside a &quot;while&quot; loop, a &quot;break&quot; out of the &quot;for&quot; loop would still leave you stuck in the &quot;while&quot; loop. The &quot;break&quot; keyword only applies to the control construct that executes it.

There is also a &quot;continue&quot; statement that allows you to skip to the end of the loop body and continue with the next iteration of the loop. For example:

   /* continue.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int n;
     for( n = 0; n &lt; 10; n = n + 1 )
     {
       if( n == 5 )
       {
         continue;
       }
       else
       {
         printf( &quot;%d\n&quot;, n );
       }
     }
   }

Finally, there is a &quot;goto&quot; statement:

   goto punchout;
   ...
   punchout:

-- that allows you to jump to an arbitrary tag within a function, but the use of this statement is generally discouraged.

While these are the lot of C's true control structures, there is also a special &quot;conditional operator&quot; that allows you to perform simple conditional assigment of the form:

   if( a == 5) 
   {
     b = -10;
   }
   else
   {
     b = 255;
   }

-- using a much tidier, if more cryptic, format:

   b = ( a == 5 ) ? -10 : 255 ;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== C Variables, Operators, &amp; Preprocessor Directives == 

C supports a flexible set of variable types and structures, as well as common arithmetic and math functions along with a few interesting operators that are unique to C. This chapter explains them in detail, and ends with a short discussion of preprocessor commands.

=== C Variables, Declarations, and Constants ===

C includes the following fundamental data types:

   ____________________________________________________________________

   type            use          size         range
   ____________________________________________________________________

   char            character     8 bits   -128 to 127
   unsigned char   character     8 bits   0 to 255
   short           integer      16 bits   -32,768 to 32,767
   unsigned short  integer      16 bits   0 to 65,535
   int             integer      32 bits   -32,768 to 32,767
   unsigned int    integer      32 bits   0 to 65,535
   long            integer      32 bits   -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
   unsigned long   integer      32 bits   0 to 4,294,967,295
   float           real         32 bits   1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38
   double          real         64 bits   2.2E-308 to 1.8E+308
   long double     real        128 bits   3.4E-4932 to 1.2E+4932
   ____________________________________________________________________

These are representative values. The definitions tend to vary from system to system. For example, in some systems an &quot;int&quot; is 16 bits, and a &quot;long double&quot; could be 64 bits. The only thing that is guaranteed is the precedence:

   short &lt;= int &lt;= long
   float &lt;= double &lt;= long double

One peculiarity of C that can lead to maddening problems is that while there is an &quot;unsigned char&quot; data type, for some reason many functions that deal with individual characters require variables to be declared &quot;int&quot; or &quot;unsigned int&quot;.

Declarations are of the form:

   int myval, tmp1, tmp2;
   unsigned int marker1 = 1, marker2 = 10;
   float magnitude, phase;

Variable names can be at least 31 characters long, though modern compilers will invariably support longer. Variables names can be made up of letters, digits, and the &quot;_&quot; (underscore) character; the first character must be a letter. While you can use uppercase letters in variable names, conventional C usage reserves uppercase for constant names. A leading &quot;_&quot; is also legal, but is generally reserved for marking internal library names.

C allows several variables to be declared in the same statement, with commas separating the declarations. The variables can be initialized when declared. Constant values for declarations can be declared in various formats:

   128:       decimal int
   256u:      decimal unsigned int
   512l:      decimal long int
   0xAF:      hex int
   0173:      octal int
   0.243:     float
   0.1732f:   float
   15.75E2:   float
   'a':       character
   &quot;giday&quot;:   string

There are a number of special characters defined in C:

   '\a':    alarm (beep) character
   '\\p':    backspace
   '\f':    formfeed
   '\n':    newline
   '\r':    carriage return
   '

'\v': vertical tab '\': backslash '\?': question mark '\'': single quote '&quot;\': double quote '\0NN': character code in octal '\xNN': character code in hex '\0': NULL character You can specify &quot;symbolic constants&quot; using the &quot;define&quot; C preprocessor declaration:

   #define PI 3.141592654

There is also a &quot;const&quot; declaration that defines a read-only variable, such as a memory location in ROM:

   const int a;

Arrays can be declared and initialized:

   int myarray[10];
   unsigned int list[5] = { 10, 15, 12, 19, 23 };
   float rdata[128], grid[5][5];

All C arrays have a starting index of 0, so &quot;list&quot; has the indexes 0 through 4. Elements in &quot;rdata&quot; would be accessed as follows:

   for( i = 1; i &lt;= 127; i = i + 1 )
   {
      printf ( &quot;\f\n&quot;, rdata[i] );
   }

C does not perform rigorous bounds checking on array access. You can easily overrun the bounds of the array if you're not careful, and never realize it except for the fact that you are getting some very strange data.

* Of particular importance are arrays of characters, which are used to store strings:

   char s[128];
   strcpy( s, &quot;This is a test!&quot;);

The string &quot;This is a test!&quot; is used to initialize &quot;s&quot; through the &quot;strcpy()&quot; function, discussed in a later chapter. The stored string will contain a terminating &quot;null&quot; character (the character with ASCII code 0, represented by '\0'). The null is used by C functions that manipulate strings to determine where the end of the string is, and it is important to remember the null is there.

The curious reader may wonder why the &quot;strcpy()&quot; function is needed to initialize the string. It might seem to be easier to do:

   char s[128] = &quot;This is a test!&quot;;

In fact, this is an absurd operation, but to explain why, the concept of &quot;pointers&quot; must be introduced.

C allows you to define pointers that contain the address of a variable or an array. You could, for example, define a pointer named:

   int *ptr;

-- that is the address of a variable, rather than the variable itself. You could, in a convoluted fashion, then put a value into that location with the statement:

   *ptr = 345;

In an inverse fashion, you can use &quot;&amp;&quot; to get the address of a variable:

   int tmp;
   somefunc( &amp;tmp );

This is confusing, so to sum up:

    * A pointer is declared in the form: &quot;*myptr&quot;.

    * If &quot;myvar&quot; is a variable, then &quot;&amp;myvar&quot; is a pointer to that variable.

    * If &quot;myptr&quot; is a pointer, then &quot;*myptr&quot; gives the variable data for that pointer. 

Pointers are useful because they allow a a function to return a value through a parameter variable. Otherwise, the function will simply get the data the variable contains and have no access to the variable itself.

One peculiar aspect of C is that the name of an array actually specifies a pointer to the first element in the array. For example, if you declare:

   char s[256];

-- then if you perform:

   somefunc( s )

-- you have actually passed the address of the character array to the function, and the function will be able to modify it. However:

   s[12]

-- gives the value in the array value with index 12. Remember that this is the 13th element, since indexes always start at 0.

There are more peculiarities to strings in C. Another interesting point is that a string literal actually evaluates to a pointer to the string it defines. This means that if you perform the following operation:

   char *p;
   p = &quot;Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything!&quot;;

-- then &quot;p&quot; would be a pointer to the memory in which the C compiler stored the string literal, and &quot;p[0]&quot; would evaluate to &quot;L&quot;. In a similar sense, you could also perform the following operation and get:

   char ch;
   ch = &quot;Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything!&quot;[0];

-- and get the character &quot;L&quot; into the variable &quot;ch&quot;.

This is very well and good, but why care? The reason to care is because this explains why the operation:

   char s[128] = &quot;This is a test!&quot;;

-- is absurd. This statement tells the C compiler to reserve 128 bytes of memory and set a pointer named &quot;s&quot; to point to them. Then it reserves another block of memory to store &quot;This is a test!&quot; and points &quot;s&quot; to that. This means the block of 128 bytes of memory that were originally allocated are now sitting empty and unusable, and the program is actually accessing the memory that stores &quot;This is a test!&quot;.

This will seem to work for a while, until the program tries to store more bytes into that block than can fit into the 16 bytes reserved for &quot;This is a test!&quot;. Since C is poor about bounds checking, this may cause all kinds of trouble.

This is why &quot;strcpy()&quot; is necessary, unless you simply want to define a string that will not be modified or will not be used to store more data than it is initialized to. In that case, you can perform:

   char *p;
   p = &quot;Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything!                   &quot;;

This is particularly tricky when passing strings as parameters to functions. The following example shows how to get around the pitfalls:

   /* strparm.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

   char *strtest( char *a, char *b );
   
   main ()
   {
     char a[256], 
          b[256], 
          c[256]; 

     strcpy( a, &quot;STRING A: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789&quot; );
     strcpy( b, &quot;STRING B: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789&quot; );
     strcpy( c, &quot;STRING C: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789&quot; );

     printf( &quot;Initial values of strings:\n&quot; );
     printf( &quot;\n&quot; );
     printf( &quot;   a = %s\n&quot;, a );
     printf( &quot;   b = %s\n&quot;, b );
     printf( &quot;   c = %s\n&quot;, c );
     printf( &quot;\n&quot; );

     strcpy( c, strtest( a, b ));
   
     printf( &quot;Final values of strings:\n&quot; );
     printf( &quot;\n&quot; );
     printf( &quot;   a = %s\n&quot;, a );
     printf( &quot;   b = %s\n&quot;, b );
     printf( &quot;   c = %s\n&quot;, c );
     printf( &quot;\n&quot; );
     
   }
   
   char *strtest( char *x, char *y )
   {
     printf( &quot;Values passed to function:\n&quot; );
     printf( &quot;\n&quot; );
     printf( &quot;   x = %s\n&quot;, x );
     printf( &quot;   y = %s\n&quot;, y );
     printf( &quot;\n&quot; );
   
     strcpy( y, &quot;NEWSTRING B: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789&quot; );
     return( &quot;NEWSTRING C: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789&quot; );
   }

You can define &quot;structures&quot; in C, which are collections of different data elements:

   /* struct.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;
   
   struct person                              /* Define structure type. */
   {
      char name[50];
      int age;
      float wage;
   };
   
   void display( struct person );
   
   void main()
   {
     struct person m;                         /* Declare an instance of it. */
     strcpy( m.name, &quot;Coyote, Wile E.&quot; );     /* Initialize it. */
     m.age = 41;
     m.wage = 25.50f;
     display( m );
   }
   
   void display( struct person p )
   {
     printf( &quot;Name: %s\n&quot;, p.name );
     printf( &quot;Age:  %d\n&quot;, p.age );
     printf( &quot;Wage: %4.2f\n&quot;, p.wage );
   }

This program has a few interesting features:

    * The structure has to be defined by a &quot;struct&quot; declaration before you can declare any structures themselves. In this case we define a struct of type &quot;person&quot;.

    * Instances of the struct (&quot;m&quot;) are then declared as by defining the structure type (&quot;struct person&quot;).

    * Elements of the structure are accessed with a &quot;dot&quot; notation (&quot;m.name&quot;, &quot;m.age&quot;, and &quot;m.wage&quot;). 

You can copy a structure to another structure with a single assignment statement, as long as the structures are of the same type:

   struct person m, n;
   ...
   m = n;

You can also declare arrays of structures:

   struct person group[10];
   ...
   strcpy( group[5].name, &quot;McQuack, Launchpad&quot; );

-- or even embed structures inside structure declarations:

   struct trip_rec
   {
      struct person traveler;
      char dest[50];
      int date[3];
      int duration;
      float cost;
   }

-- in which case the nested structure would be accessed as follows:

   struct trip_rec t1;
   ...
   strcpy( t1.traveler.name, &quot;Martian, Marvin&quot; );

The name of a structure defines a variable, not an address. If you pass the name of a structure to a function, the function works only on its local copy of the structure. If you want to return values, you have to provide an address:

   setstruct( &amp;mystruct );

There is a shorthand way to get at the elements of a structure if you have the pointer to the structure instead of the structure itself. If &quot;sptr&quot; is a pointer to a structure of type &quot;person&quot;, you could access its fields as follows:

   strcpy( sptr-&gt;name, &quot;Leghorn, Foghorn&quot; );
   sptr-&gt;age = 50;
   sptr-&gt;wage = 12.98;

C contains a concept similar to a structure known as a &quot;union&quot;. A union is declared in much the same way as a structure. For example:

   union usample 
   {
     char ch;
     int x;
   }

The difference is that the union can store either of these values, but not both at the same time. You can store a &quot;char&quot; value or an &quot;int&quot; value in an instance of the union defined above, but you can't store both at the same time. Only enough memory is allocated for the union to store the value of the biggest declared item in it, and that same memory is used to store data for all the declared items. Unions are not often used and will not be mentioned further.

The following example program shows a practical use of structures. It tests a set of functions that perform operations on three-dimensional vectors:

   vadd():     Add two vectors.
   vsub():     Subtract two vectors.
   vdot():     Vector dot product.
   vcross():   Vector cross product.
   vnorm():    Norm (magnitude) of vector.
   vangle():   Angle between two vectors.
   vprint():   Print out vector.

The program follows:

   /* vector.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;math.h&gt;
   
   #define PI 3.141592654
   
   struct v
   {
      double i, j, k;
   };
   
   void vadd( struct v, struct v, struct v* );
   void vprint( struct v );
   void vsub( struct v, struct v, struct v* );
   double vnorm( struct v );
   double vdot( struct v, struct v );
   double vangle( struct v, struct v );
   void vcross( struct v, struct v, struct v* );
   
   void main()
   {
     struct v v1 = { 1, 2, 3 }, v2 = { 30, 50, 100 }, v3;
     double a;
   
     printf( &quot;Sample Vector 1: &quot; );
     vprint( v1 );
     printf( &quot;Sample Vector 2: &quot; );
     vprint( v2 );
   
     vadd( v1, v2, &amp;v3 );
     printf( &quot;Vector Add:      &quot; );
     vprint( v3 );
   
     vsub( v1, v2, &amp;v3 );
     printf( &quot;Vector Subtract: &quot; );
     vprint( v3 );
   
     vcross( v1, v2, &amp;v3 );
     printf( &quot;Cross Product:   &quot; );
     vprint( v3 );
   
     printf( &quot;\n&quot; );
     printf( &quot;Vector 1 Norm:  %f\n&quot;, vnorm( v1 ) );
     printf( &quot;Vector 2 Norm:  %f\n&quot;, vnorm( v2 ) );
     printf( &quot;Dot Product:    %f\n&quot;, vdot( v1, v2 ) );
     a = 180 * vangle( v1, v2) / PI ;
     printf( &quot;Angle:          %3f degrees.\n&quot;, a );
   
   } 
   
   void vadd( struct v a, struct v b, struct v *c )  /* Add vectors. */
   {
     c-&gt;i = a.i + b.i;
     c-&gt;j = a.j + b.j;
     c-&gt;k = a.k + b.k;
   }
   
   double vangle( struct v a, struct v b )  /* Get angle between vectors. */
   {
     double c;
     c = vdot( a, b ) / ( vnorm( a ) * vnorm( b ) );
     return( atan( sqrt( ( 1 - ( c * c ) ) / ( c * c ) ) ) );
   }
   
   void vcross( struct v a, struct v b, struct v *c )  /* Cross product. */
   {
     c-&gt;i = a.j * b.k - a.k * b.j;
     c-&gt;j = a.k * b.i - a.i * b.k;
     c-&gt;k = a.i * b.j - a.j * b.i;
   }
   
   double vdot( struct v a, struct v b ) /* Dot product of vectors. */
   {
     return( a.i * b.i + a.j * b.j + a.k * b.k );
   }
   
   double vnorm ( struct v a )  /* Norm of vectors. */
   {
     return( sqrt( ( a.i * a.i ) + ( a.j * a.j ) + ( a.k * a.k ) ) );
   }
   
   void vprint ( struct v a )  /* Print vector. */
   {
     printf( &quot; I = %6.2f   J = %6.2f   K = %6.2f\n&quot;, a.i, a.j, a.k );
   }
   
   void vsub ( struct v a, struct v b, struct v *c )  /* Subtract vectors. */
   {
     c-&gt;i = a.i - b.i;
     c-&gt;j = a.j - b.j;
     c-&gt;k = a.k - b.k;
   }

You should be familiar with the concept of local and global variables by now. You can also declare a local variable as &quot;static&quot;, meaning it retains its value from one invocation of the function to the next. For example:

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void testfunc( void );

   void main()
   {
     int ctr;
     for( ctr = 1; ctr &lt; 8; ++ctr )
     {
       testfunc();
     }
   }
   
   void testfunc( void )
   {
     static int v;
     printf( &quot;%d\n&quot;, 2*v );
     ++v;
   }

This prints:

   0
   2
   4
   6
   8 
   10
   12
   14

-- since the initial value of a integer is 0 by default. It is not a good idea to rely on a default value!

There are two other variable declarations that you should recognize though you should have little reason to use them: &quot;register&quot;, which declares that a variable should be assigned to a CPU register, and &quot;volatile&quot;, which tells the compiler that the contents of the variable may change spontaneously.

There is more and less than meets the eye to these declarations. The &quot;register&quot; declaration is discretionary: the variable will be loaded into a CPU register if it can, and if not it will be loaded into memory as normal. Since a good optimizing compiler will try to make the best use of CPU registers anyway, this is not in general all that useful a thing to do.

The &quot;volatile&quot; declaration appears ridiculous jat first sight, something like one of those &quot;joke&quot; computer commands like &quot;halt and catch fire&quot;. Actually, it's used to describe a hardware register that can change independently of a program, such as the register for a realtime clock.

C is fairly flexible in conversions between data types. In many cases, the type conversion will happen transparently. If you convert from a &quot;char&quot; to a &quot;short&quot; data type, or from an &quot;int&quot; to a &quot;long&quot; data type, for example, the converted data type can easily accommodate any value in the original data type.

Converting from a bigger to a smaller data type can lead to odd errors. The same is true for conversions between signed and unsigned data types. For this reason, type conversions should be handled carefully, and it is usually preferable to do them explicitly, using a &quot;cast&quot; operation. For example:

   int a;
   float b;
   ...
   b = (float)a;

-- demonstrates a cast conversion from an &quot;int&quot; value to a &quot;float&quot; value.

You can define your own &quot;enumerated&quot; types in C. For example:

  enum day
  {
     saturday, sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday
  };

-- defines enumerated type &quot;day&quot; to consist of the values of the days of the week. In practice, the values are merely text constants associated to a set of consecutive integer values. By default, the set begins at 0 and counts up, so here &quot;saturday&quot; has the value 0, &quot;sunday&quot; has the value &quot;1&quot;, and so on.

You can, however, specify your own set of values if you like:

   enum temps
   {
     zero = 0, freeze = 32, boil = 220
   };

Obviously you could do similar things through sets of &quot;#define&quot; directives, but this is a much cleaner solution. Once you define the type, for example, you can declare variables of that type as follows:

   enum day today = wednesday;

The variable &quot;today&quot; will act as an &quot;int&quot; variable and will allow the operations valid for &quot;int&quot; variables. Once more, remember that C doesn't do much in the way of bounds checking, and you should not rely on the C compiler to give you warnings if you are careless.

Finally, you can use the &quot;typedef&quot; declaration to define your own data types:

   typedef str ch[128];

Then you could declare variables of this type as follows:

   str name;

=== C Operators ===

C supports the following arithmetic operators:

   c = a * b;   /* multiplication */
   c = a / b;   /* division */
   c = a % b;   /* mod (remainder division) */
   c = a + b;   /* addition */
   c = a - b;   /* subtraction */

It also supports the following useful (but cryptic) increment and decrement operators:

   ++a;   /* increment */
   --a;   /* decrement */

These operators can also be expressed as &quot;a++&quot; and &quot;a--&quot;. If all you want to do is increment or decrement, the distinction between the two forms is irrelevant. However, if you are incrementing or decrementing a variable as a component of some expression, then &quot;++a&quot; means &quot;increment the variable first, then get its value&quot;, while &quot;a++&quot; means &quot;get the value of the variable first, then increment it&quot;. Confusing these things can lead to subtle programming errors.

C supports a set of bitwise operations:

   a = ~a;       /* bit complement */
   a = b &lt;&lt; c;   /* shift b left by number of bits stored in c */
   a = b &gt;&gt; c;   /* shift b right by number of bits stored in c */
   a = b &amp; c;    /* b AND c */
   a = b ^ c;    /* b XOR c */
   a = b | c;    /* b OR c */

C allows you to perform all these operations in a shortcut fashion:

   a = a * b;   a *= b;
   a = a / b;   a /= b;
   a = a % b;   a %= b;
   a = a + b;   a += b;
   a = a - b;   a -= b;
   a = a &lt;&lt; b;  a &lt;&lt;= b;
   a = a &gt;&gt; b;  a &gt;&gt;= b;
   a = a &amp; b;   a &amp;= b;
   a = a ^ b;   a ^= b;
   a = a | b;   a |= b;

The C relational operations were discussed in the previous chapter and are repeated here for completeness:

   a == b:   equals
   a != b:   not equals
   a &lt; b:    less than
   a &gt; b:    greater than
   a &lt;= b:   less than or equals
   a &gt;= b:   greater than or equals

These are actually math operations that yield &quot;1&quot; if true and &quot;0&quot; if false. You could, for example, have an operation as follows:

   a = b * ( b &lt; 2 ) + 10 * ( b &gt;= 2 );

This would give &quot;a&quot; the value &quot;b&quot; if &quot;b&quot; is less than 2, and the value &quot;10&quot; otherwise. This is cute, but not recommended. It's cryptic; may impair portability to other languages; and in this case at least can be done much more effectively with the conditional operator discussed in the previous chapter:

   a = ( b &lt; 2 ) ? b : 10; 

This conditional operator is also known as the &quot;triadic&quot; operator.

There are similar logical operators:

   !:    logical NOT
   &amp;&amp;:   logical AND
   ||:   logical OR

Remember that these are logical operations, not bitwise operations -- don't confuse &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; and &quot;||&quot; with &quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;|&quot;. The distinction is that while the bitwise operators perform the operations on a bit-by-bit basis, the logical operations simply assess the values of their operands to be either &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; (any nonzero operand value evaluates to &quot;1&quot; in such comparisons) and return either a &quot;0&quot; or a &quot;1&quot;:

   if(( A == 5 ) &amp;&amp; ( B == 10 ))
   {
      ...
   }

Finally, there is a &quot;sizeof&quot; operand that returns the size of a particular operand in bytes:

   int tvar;
   ...
   printf ( &quot;Size = %d\n&quot;, sizeof( int ) );

This comes in handy for some mass storage operations. You can provide &quot;sizeof()&quot; with a data type name or the name of a variable, and the variable can be an array, in which case &quot;sizeof&quot; gives the size of the entire array.

The precedence of these operators in math functions -- that is, which ones are evaluated before others -- are defined as follows, reading from the highest precedence to the lowest:

   ()     []     -&gt;     .
   !      ~      ++     --     (cast)*       &amp;      sizeof   - (minus prefix)
   *      /      %
   +      -
   &lt;&lt;     &gt;&gt;
   &lt;      &lt;=     &gt;      &gt;=
   ==     !=
   &amp;
   ^
   |
   &amp;&amp;
   ||
   ?:
   =      +=     -=     *=     /=     %=     &gt;&gt;=     &lt;&lt;=     &amp;=
   ^=     |=
   , 

Of course, parentheses can be used to control precedence. If you have any doubts about the order of evaluation of an expression, add more parentheses. They won't cause you any trouble, and might save you some.

Advanced math operations are available as library functions. These will be discussed in a later chapter. 

=== C Preprocessor Directives ===

We've already seen the &quot;#include&quot; and &quot;#define&quot; preprocessor directives. The C preprocessor supports several other directives as well. All such directives start with a &quot;#&quot; to allow them to be distinguished from C language commands.

As explained in the first chapter, the &quot;#include&quot; directive allows you to insert the contents of other files in your C source code:

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

Observe that the standard header file &quot;stdio.h&quot; is specified in angle brackets. This tells the C preprocessor that the file can be found in the standard directories designated by the C compiler for header files. If you want to include a file from a nonstandard directory, you use double quotes:

   #include &quot;\home\mydefs.h&quot;

Include files can be nested. They can call other include files.

Also as explained in the first chapter, the &quot;#define&quot; directive can be used to specify symbols to be substituted for specific strings of text:

   #define PI 3.141592654
   ...
   a = PI * b;

In this case, the preprocessor does a simple text substitution on PI throughout the source listing. The C compiler proper not only does not know what PI is, it never even sees it.

The &quot;#define&quot; directive can be used to create function-like macros that allow parameter substitution. For example:

   #define ABS(value)  ( (value) &gt;=0 ? (value) : -(value) )

This macro could then be used in an expression as follows:

   printf( &quot;Absolute value of x = %d\n&quot;, ABS(x) );

Beware that such function-like macros don't behave exactly like true functions. For example, suppose you used &quot;x++&quot; as an argument for the macro above:

   val = ABS(x++);

This would result in &quot;x&quot; being incremented three times because &quot;x++&quot; is substituted in the expression three times:

   val = ( (x++) &gt;=0 ? (x++) : -(x++) )

Along with the &quot;#define&quot; directive, there is also an &quot;#undef&quot; directive that allows you to undefine a constant that has been previously defined:

   #undef PI

Another feature supported by the C preprocessor is conditional compilation, using the following directives:

   #if
   #else
   #elif
   #endif

These directives can test the values of defined constants to define which blocks of code are passed on to the C compiler proper:

   #if WIN == 1
     #include &quot;WIN.H&quot;
   #elif MAC == 1
     #include &quot;MAC.H&quot;
   #else
     #include &quot;LINUX.H&quot;
   #endif

You can nest these directives if needed. The &quot;#if&quot; and &quot;#elif&quot; can also test to see if a constant has been defined at all, using the &quot;defined&quot; operator:

   #if defined( DEBUG )
      printf( &quot;Debug mode!\n);
   #endif

-- or test to see if a constant has not been defined:

   #if !defined( DEBUG )
      printf( &quot;Not debug mode!\n);
   #endif

Finally, there is a &quot;#pragma&quot; directive, which by definition is a catch-all used to implement machine-unique commands that are not part of the C language. Such &quot;pragmas&quot; vary from compiler to compiler, as they are by definition nonstandard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== C Input &amp; Output ==

This chapter covers console (keyboard/display) and file I/O. You've already seen one console-I/O function, &quot;printf()&quot;, and there are several others, C has two separate approaches toward file I/O, one based on library functions that resembles console I/O, and a second that uses &quot;system calls&quot;. These topics are discussed in detail below.

=== C Console I/O ===

Console I/O in general means communications with the computer's keyboard and display. However, in most modern operating systems the keyboard and display are simply the default input and output devices, and user can easily redirect input from, say, a file or other program and redirect output to, say, a serial I/O port:

   type infile &gt; myprog &gt; com

The program itself, &quot;myprog&quot;, doesn't know the difference. The program uses console I/O to simply read its &quot;standard input (stdin)&quot; -- which might be the keyboard, a file dump, or the output of some other program -- and print to its &quot;standard output (stdout)&quot; -- which might be the display or printer or another program or a file. The program itself neither knows nor cares.

Console I/O requires the declaration:

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

Useful functions are:

   printf():     Print a formatted string to stdout.
   scanf():      Read formatted data from stdin.
   putchar():    Print a single character to stdout.
   getchar():    Read a single character from stdin.
   puts():       Print a string to stdout.
   gets():       Read a line from stdin.

PC-based compilers also have an alternative library of console I/O functions that you will see on occasion. These functions require the declaration:

   #include &lt;conio.h&gt;

The three most useful PC console I/O functions are:

    * getch():

      Get a character from the keyboard (no need to press Enter).

    * getche():

      Get a character from the keyboard and echo it.

    * kbhit():

      Check to see if a key has been pressed. 

The &quot;printf()&quot; function, as you remember, prints a string that may include formatted data:

   printf( &quot;This is a test!\n&quot; );

-- which can include the contents of variables:

   printf( &quot;Value1:  %d   Value2:  %f\n&quot;, intval, floatval );

The available format codes are:

   %d:   decimal integer
   %ld:  long decimal integer
   %c:   character
   %s:   string
   %e:   floating-point number in exponential notation
   %f:   floating-point number in decimal notation
   %g:   use %e and %f, whichever is shorter
   %u:   unsigned decimal integer
   %o:   unsigned octal integer
   %x:   unsigned hex integer

Using the wrong format code for a particular data type can lead to bizarre output.

You can obtain further control by using modifiers. For example, you can add a numeric prefix to specify the minimum field width:

   %10d

This specifies a minimum field width of ten characters. If the field width is too small, a wider field will be used. Adding a minus sign:

   %-10d

-- causes the text to be left-justified. You can also add a numeric precision:

   %6.3f

This specifies three digits of precision in a field six characters wide. You can specify a precision for strings as well, in which case it indicates the maximum number of characters to be printed. For example:

   /* prtint.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     printf( &quot;&lt;%d&gt;\n&quot;, 336 );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%2d&gt;\n&quot;, 336 );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%10d&gt;\n&quot;, 336 );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%-10d&gt;\n&quot;, 336 );
   }

This prints:

   &lt;336&gt;
   &lt;336&gt;
   &lt;       336&gt;
   &lt;336       &gt;

Similarly:

   /* prfloat.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     printf( &quot;&lt;%f&gt;\n&quot;, 1234.56 );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%e&gt;\n&quot;, 1234.56 );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%4.2f&gt;\n&quot;, 1234.56 );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%3.1f&gt;\n&quot;, 1234.56 );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%10.3f&gt;\n&quot;, 1234.56 );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%10.3e&gt;\n&quot;, 1234.56 );
   }

-- prints:

   &lt;1234.560000&gt;
   &lt;1.234560e+03&gt;
   &lt;1234.56&gt;
   &lt;1234.6&gt;
   &lt;  1234.560&gt;
   &lt; 1.234e+03&gt;

And finally:

   /* prtstr.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     printf( &quot;&lt;%2s&gt;\n&quot;, &quot;Barney must die!&quot; );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%22s&gt;\n&quot;, &quot;Barney must die!&quot; );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%22.5s&gt;\n&quot;, &quot;Barney must die!&quot; );
     printf( &quot;&lt;%-22.5s&gt;\n&quot;, &quot;Barney must die!&quot; );
   }

-- prints:

   &lt;Barney must die!&gt;
   &lt;      Barney must die!&gt;
   &lt;                 Barne&gt;
   &lt;Barne                 &gt;

Just for convenience, the table of special characters listed in chapter 2 is repeated here. These characters can be embedded in &quot;printf&quot; strings:

   '\a':    alarm (beep) character
   '\\p':    backspace
   '\f':    formfeed
   '\n':    newline
   '\r':    carriage return
   '

'\v': vertical tab '\': backslash '\?': question mark '\'': single quote '&quot;\': double quote '\0NN': character code in octal '\xNN': character code in hex '\0': NULL character The &quot;scanf()&quot; function reads formatted data using a syntax similar to that of &quot;printf&quot;, except that it requires pointers as parameters, since it has to return values. For example:

   /* cscanf.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int val;
     char name[256];
   
     printf( &quot;Enter your age and name.\n&quot; );
     scanf( &quot;%d %s&quot;, &amp;val, name ); 
     printf( &quot;Your name is: %s -- and your age is: %d\n&quot;, name, val );
   }

There is no &quot;&amp;&quot; in front of &quot;name&quot; since the name of a string is already a pointer. Input fields are separated by whitespace (space, tab, or newline), though you can use a count (&quot;%10d&quot;) to define a specific field width. Formatting codes are the same as for &quot;printf()&quot;, except:

    * There is no &quot;%g&quot; format code.

    * The &quot;%f&quot; and &quot;%e&quot; format codes work the same.

    * There is a &quot;%h&quot; format code for reading short integers. 

If you include characters in the format code, &quot;scanf()&quot; will read in that character and discard it. For example, if the example above were modified as follows:

   scanf( &quot;%d,%s&quot;, &amp;val, name );

-- then &quot;scanf()&quot; will assume that the two input values are comma-separated and swallow the comma when it is encountered.

If you precede a format code with an asterisk, the data will be read and discarded. For example, if the example were changed to:

   scanf( &quot;%d%*c%s&quot;, &amp;val, name );

-- then if the two fields were separated by a &quot;:&quot;, that character would be read in and discarded.

The &quot;scanf()&quot; function will return the value EOF (an &quot;int&quot;), defined in &quot;stdio.h&quot;, when its input is terminated.

The &quot;putchar()&quot; and &quot;getchar()&quot; functions handle single character I/O. For example, the following program accepts characters from standard input one at a time:

   /* inout.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main ()
   {
     unsigned int ch; 
   
     while ((ch = getchar()) != EOF)
     {
       putchar( ch ); 
     }
   }

The &quot;getchar&quot; function returns an &quot;int&quot; and also terminates with an EOF. Notice the neat way C allows you to get a value and then test it in the same expression, a particularly useful feature for handling loops.

One word of warning on single-character I/O: if you are entering characters from the keyboard, most operating systems won't send the characters to the program until you press the Enter key, meaning that you can't really do single-character keyboard I/O this way.

The little program above is the essential core of a character-mode text &quot;filter&quot;, a program that can perform some transformation between standard input and standard output. Such a filter can be used as an element to construct more sophisticated applications:

   type file.txt &gt; filter1 | filter2 &gt; outfile.txt

The following filter capitalizes the first character in each word in the input. The program operates as a &quot;state machine&quot;, using a variable that can be set to different values, or &quot;states&quot;, to control its operating mode. It has two states: SEEK, in which it is looking for the first character, and REPLACE, in which it is looking for the end of a word.

In SEEK state, it scans through whitespace (space, tab, or newline), e echoing characters. If it finds a printing character, it converts it to uppercase and goes to REPLACE state. In REPLACE state, it converts characters to lowercase until it hits whitespace, and then goes back to SEEK state.

The program uses the &quot;tolower()&quot; and &quot;toupper()&quot; functions to make case conversions. These two functions will be discussed in the next chapter.

   /* caps.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

   #define SEEK 0
   #define REPLACE 1

   void main()
   {
     int ch, state = SEEK;
     while(( ch = getchar() ) != EOF )
     {
       switch( state )
       {
       case REPLACE:
         switch( ch )
         {
         case ' ':
         case '

case '\n': state = SEEK; break; default: ch = tolower( ch ); break; } break; case SEEK: switch( ch ) { case ' ': case '\n': break; default: ch = toupper( ch ); state = REPLACE; break; } } putchar( ch ); } } * The &quot;puts()&quot; function is like a simplified version of &quot;printf()&quot; without format codes. It allows you to print a string that is automatically terminated with a newline:

   puts( &quot;Hello world!&quot; );

The &quot;gets()&quot; function is particularly useful: it allows you to read a line of text (terminated by a newline. The &quot;gets()&quot; function doesn't read the newline into the string into the program, making it much less finicky about its inputs than &quot;scanf()&quot;:

   /* cgets.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     char word[256], 
          *guess = &quot;blue&quot;;
     integer i, n = 0;

     puts( &quot;Guess a color (use lower case please):&quot; );
     while( gets( word ) != NULL )
     {
       if( strcmp( word, guess ) == 0 )
       {
          puts( &quot;You win!&quot; );
          exit( 0 );
       }
       else
       {
          puts( &quot;No, try again.&quot; );
       }
     }
   }

This program includes the &quot;strcmp&quot; function, which performs string comparisons and returns 0 on a match. This function is described in more detail in the next chapter.

You can use these functions to implement filters that operate on lines of text, rather than characters. A core program for such filters follows:

   /* lfilter.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main ()
   {
     char b[256];
     while (( gets( b ) ) != NULL )
     {
       puts( b ); 
     }
   }

The &quot;gets()&quot; function returns a NULL, defined in &quot;stdio.h&quot;, on input termination or error.

The PC-based console-I/O functions &quot;getch()&quot; and &quot;getche()&quot; operate much as &quot;getchar()&quot; does, except that &quot;getche()&quot; echoes the character automatically.

The &quot;kbhit()&quot; function is very different in that it only indicates if a key has been pressed or not. It returns a nonzero value if a key has been pressed, and zero if it hasn't. This allows a program to poll the keyboard for input rather than hanging on keyboard input, and waiting for something to happen. These functions require the &quot;conio.h&quot; header file, not the &quot;stdio.h&quot; header file. 

=== C File-I/O Through Library Functions ===

The file-I/O library functions are much like the console-I/O functions. In fact, most of the console-I/O functions can be thought of as special cases of the file-I/O functions. The library functions include:

   fopen():     Create or open a file for reading or writing.
   fclose():    Close a file after reading or writing it.

   fseek():     Seek to a certain location in a file.
   rewind():    Rewind a file back to its beginning and leave it open.
   rename():    Rename a file.
   remove():    Delete a file.

   fprintf():   Formatted write.
   fscanf():    Formatted read.
   fwrite():    Unformatted write.
   fread():     Unformatted read.
   putc():      Write a single byte to a file.
   getc():      Read a single byte from a file.
   fputs():     Write a string to a file.
   fgets():     Read a string from a file.

All these library functions depend on definitions made in the &quot;stdio.h&quot; header file, and so require the declaration:

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

C documentation normally refers to these functions as performing &quot;stream I/O&quot;, not &quot;file I/O&quot;. The distinction is that they could just as well handle data being transferred through a modem as a file, and so the more general term &quot;data stream&quot; is used rather than &quot;file&quot;. However, we'll stay with the &quot;file&quot; terminology in this discussion for the sake of simplicity.

* The &quot;fopen()&quot; function opens and, if need be, creates a file. Its syntax is:

   &lt;file pointer&gt; = fopen( &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;access mode&gt; );

The &quot;fopen()&quot; function returns a &quot;file pointer&quot;, declared as follows:

   FILE *&lt;file pointer&gt;;

The file pointer will be returned with the value &quot;NULL&quot;, defined in &quot;stdio.h&quot;, if there is an error. The &quot;access modes&quot; are defined as follows:

   r:    Open for reading.
   w:    Open and wipe (or create) for writing.
   a:    Append -- open (or create) to write to end of file.
   r+:   Open a file for reading and writing.
   w+:   Open and wipe (or create) for reading and writing.
   a+:   Open a file for reading and appending.

The &quot;filename&quot; is simply a string of characters.

It is often useful to use the same statements to communicate either with files or with standard I/O. For this reason, the &quot;stdio.h&quot; header file includes predefined file pointers with the names &quot;stdin&quot; and &quot;stdout&quot;. You don't need to do an &quot;fopen()&quot; on them, you can just assign them to a file pointer:

   fpin = stdin;
   fpout = stdout;

-- and following file-I/O functions won't know the difference.

The &quot;fclose()&quot; function simply closes the file given by its file pointer parameter. It has the syntax:

   fclose( fp );

The &quot;fseek()&quot; function call allows you to select any byte location in a file for reading or writing. It has the syntax:

   fseek( &lt;file_pointer&gt;, &lt;offset&gt;, &lt;origin&gt; );

The offset is a &quot;long&quot; and specifies the offset into the file, in bytes. The &quot;origin&quot; is an &quot;int&quot; and is one of three standard values, defined in &quot;stdio.h&quot;:

   SEEK_SET:   Start of file.
   SEEK_CUR:   Current location.
   SEEK_END:   End of file.

The &quot;fseek()&quot; function returns 0 on success and non-zero on failure.

The &quot;rewind()&quot;, &quot;rename()&quot;, and &quot;remove()&quot; functions are straightforward. The &quot;rewind()&quot; function resets an open file back to its beginning. It has the syntax:

   rewind( &lt;file_pointer&gt; );

The &quot;rename()&quot; function changes the name of a file:

   rename( &lt;old_file_name_string&gt;, &lt;new_file_name_string&gt; );

The &quot;remove()&quot; function deletes a file:

   remove( &lt;file_name_string&gt; )

The &quot;fprintf()&quot; function allows formatted ASCII data output to a file, and has the syntax:

   fprintf( &lt;file pointer&gt;, &lt;string&gt;, &lt;variable list&gt; );

The &quot;fprintf()&quot; function is identical in syntax to &quot;printf()&quot;, except for the addition of a file pointer parameter. For example, the following &quot;fprintf()&quot; call:

   /* fprpi.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int n1 = 16;
     float n2 = 3.141592654f;
     FILE *fp;

     fp = fopen( &quot;data&quot;, &quot;w&quot; );
     fprintf( fp, &quot;  %d   %f&quot;, n1, n2 ); 
     fclose( fp );
   }

-- stores the following ASCII data:

    16   3.14159

The formatting codes are exactly the same as for &quot;printf()&quot;:

   %d:   decimal integer
   %ld:  long decimal integer
   %c:   character
   %s:   string
   %e:   floating-point number in exponential notation
   %f:   floating-point number in decimal notation
   %g:   use %e and %f, whichever is shorter
   %u:   unsigned decimal integer
   %o:   unsigned octal integer
   %x:   unsigned hex integer

Field-width specifiers can be used as well. The &quot;fprintf()&quot; function returns the number of characters it dumps to the file, or a negative number if it terminates with an error.

The &quot;fscanf()&quot; function is to &quot;fprintf()&quot; what &quot;scanf()&quot; is to &quot;printf()&quot;: it reads ASCII-formatted data into a list of variables. It has the syntax:

   fscanf( &lt;file pointer&gt;, &lt;string&gt;, &lt;variable list&gt; );

However, the &quot;string&quot; contains only format codes, no text, and the &quot;variable list&quot; contains the addresses of the variables, not the variables themselves. For example, the program below reads back the two numbers that were stored with &quot;fprintf()&quot; in the last example:

   /* frdata.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int n1;
     float n2;
     FILE *fp;

     fp = fopen( &quot;data&quot;, &quot;r&quot; );
     fscanf( fp, &quot;%d %f&quot;, &amp;n1, &amp;n2 );
     printf( &quot;%d %f&quot;, n1, n2 );
     fclose( fp );
   }

The &quot;fscanf()&quot; function uses the same format codes as &quot;fprintf()&quot;, with the familiar exceptions:

    * There is no &quot;%g&quot; format code.

    * The &quot;%f&quot; and &quot;%e&quot; format codes work the same.

    * There is a &quot;%h&quot; format code for reading short integers. 

Numeric modifiers can be used, of course. The &quot;fscanf()&quot; function returns the number of items that it successfully read, or the EOF code, an &quot;int&quot;, if it encounters the end of the file or an error.

The following program demonstrates the use of &quot;fprintf()&quot; and &quot;fscanf()&quot;:

   /* fprsc.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int ctr, i[3], n1 = 16, n2 = 256;
     float f[4], n3 = 3.141592654f;
     FILE *fp;

     fp = fopen( &quot;data&quot;, &quot;w+&quot; );

     /* Write data in:   decimal integer formats
                         decimal, octal, hex integer formats
                         floating-point formats  */

     fprintf( fp, &quot;%d %10d %-10d \n&quot;, n1, n1, n1 );   
     fprintf( fp, &quot;%d %o %x \n&quot;, n2, n2, n2 );
     fprintf( fp, &quot;%f %10.10f %e %5.4e \n&quot;, n3, n3, n3, n3 );

     /* Rewind file. */

     rewind( fp );

     /* Read back data. */

     puts( &quot;&quot; );
     fscanf( fp, &quot;%d %d %d&quot;, &amp;i[0], &amp;i[1], &amp;i[2] );
     printf( &quot;   %d\t%d\t%d

fscanf( fp, &quot;%d %o %x&quot;, &amp;i[0], &amp;i[1], &amp;i[2] ); fscanf( fp, &quot;%f %f %f %f&quot;, &amp;f[0], &amp;f[1], &amp;f[2], &amp;f[3] );

fclose( fp ); } The program generates the output:

   16         16         16
   256        256        256
   3.141593   3.141593   3.141593   3.141600

The &quot;fwrite()&quot; and &quot;fread()&quot; functions are used for binary file I/O. The syntax of &quot;fwrite()&quot; is as follows:

   fwrite( &lt;array_pointer&gt;, &lt;element_size&gt;, &lt;count&gt;, &lt;file_pointer&gt; );

The array pointer is of type &quot;void&quot;, and so the array can be of any type. The element size and count, which give the number of bytes in each array element and the number of elements in the array, are of type &quot;size_t&quot;, which are equivalent to &quot;unsigned int&quot;.

The &quot;fread()&quot; function similarly has the syntax:

   fread( &lt;array_pointer&gt;, &lt;element_size&gt;, &lt;count&gt;, &lt;file_pointer&gt; );

The &quot;fread()&quot; function returns the number of items it actually read.

The following program stores an array of data to a file and then reads it back using &quot;fwrite()&quot; and &quot;fread()&quot;:

 
   /* fwrrd.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;math.h&gt;
   
   #define SIZE 20
   
   void main()
   {
     int n;
     float d[SIZE];
     FILE *fp;
   
     for( n = 0; n &lt; SIZE; ++n )                 /* Fill array with roots. */
     {
       d[n] = (float)sqrt( (double)n );
     }
     fp = fopen( &quot;data&quot;, &quot;w+&quot; );                 /* Open file. */
     fwrite( d, sizeof( float ), SIZE, fp );     /* Write it to file. */
     rewind( fp );                               /* Rewind file. */
     fread( d, sizeof( float ), SIZE, fp );      /* Read back data. */
     for( n = 0; n &lt; SIZE; ++n )                 /* Print array. */
     {
       printf( &quot;%d: %7.3f\n&quot;, n, d[n] );
     }
     fclose( fp );                               /* Close file. */
   }

The &quot;putc()&quot; function is used to write a single character to an open file. It has the syntax:

   putc( &lt;character&gt;, &lt;file pointer&gt; );

The &quot;getc()&quot; function similarly gets a single character from an open file. It has the syntax:

   &lt;character variable&gt; = getc( &lt;file pointer&gt; );

The &quot;getc()&quot; function also returns &quot;EOF&quot; on error. The console I/O functions &quot;putchar()&quot; and &quot;getchar()&quot; are really only special cases of &quot;putc()&quot; and &quot;getc()&quot; that use standard output and input.

* The &quot;fputs()&quot; function writes a string to a file. It has the syntax:

   fputs( &lt;string / character array&gt;, &lt;file pointer&gt; );

The &quot;fputs()&quot; function will return an EOF value on error. For example:

   fputs( &quot;This is a test&quot;, fptr );

The &quot;fgets()&quot; function reads a string of characters from a file. It has the syntax:

   fgets( &lt;string&gt;, &lt;max_string_length&gt;, &lt;file_pointer&gt; );

The &quot;fgets&quot; function reads a string from a file until if finds a newline or grabs &lt;string_length-1&gt; characters. It will return the value NULL on an error.

The following example program simply opens a file and copies it to another file, using &quot;fgets()&quot; and &quot;fputs()&quot;:

   /* fcopy.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   
   #define MAX 256
   
   void main()
   {
     FILE *src, *dst;
     char b[MAX];
   
     /* Try to open source and destination files. */
   
     if ( ( src = fopen( &quot;infile.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot; )) == NULL )
     {
        puts( &quot;Can't open input file.&quot; );
        exit();
     }
     if ( (dst = fopen( &quot;outfile.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot; )) == NULL )
     {
        puts( &quot;Can't open output file.&quot; );
        fclose( src );
        exit();
     }
   
     /* Copy one file to the next. */
   
     while( ( fgets( b, MAX, src ) ) != NULL )
     {
        fputs( b, dst );
     }
   
     /* All done, close up shop. */
   
     fclose( src );
     fclose( dst );
   }

=== C File-I/O Through System Calls ===

File-I/O through system calls is simpler and operates at a lower level than making calls to the C file-I/O library. There are seven fundamental file-I/O system calls:

   creat():    Create a file for reading or writing.
   open():     Open a file for reading or writing.
   close():    Close a file after reading or writing.
   unlink():   Delete a file.

   write():    Write bytes to file.
   read():     Read bytes from file.

These calls were devised for the UN*X operating system and are not part of the ANSI C spec.

Use of these system calls requires a header file named &quot;fcntl.h&quot;:

   #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

The &quot;creat()&quot; system call, of course, creates a file. It has the syntax:

   &lt;file descriptor variable&gt; = creat( &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;protection bits&gt; );

This system call returns an integer, called a &quot;file descriptor&quot;, which is a number that identifies the file generated by &quot;creat()&quot;. This number is used by other system calls in the program to access the file. Should the &quot;creat()&quot; call encounter an error, it will return a file descriptor value of -1.

The &quot;filename&quot; parameter gives the desired filename for the new file. The &quot;permission bits&quot; give the &quot;access rights&quot; to the file. A file has three &quot;permissions&quot; associated with it:

    * Write permission:

      Allows data to be written to the file.

    * Read permission:

      Allows data to be read from the file.

    * Execute permission:

      Designates that the file is a program that can be run. 

These permissions can be set for three different levels:

    * User level:

      Permissions apply to individual user.

    * Group level:

      Permissions apply to members of user's defined &quot;group&quot;.

    * System level:

      Permissions apply to everyone on the system. 

For the &quot;creat()&quot; system call, the permissions are expressed in octal, with an octal digit giving the three permission bits for each level of permissions. In octal, the permission settings:

   0644

-- grant read and write permissions for the user, but only read permissions for group and system. The following octal number gives all permissions to everyone:

   0777

Should you attempt to &quot;creat()&quot; an existing file (for which you have write permission), &quot;creat()&quot; will not return an error. It will instead wipe the contents of the file and return a file descriptor for it.

For example, to create a file named &quot;data&quot; with read and write permission for everyone on the system, you would write:

   #define RD_WR 0666
   ...
   int fd;                               /* Define file descriptor. */
   fd = creat( &quot;data&quot;, RD_WR );

The &quot;open()&quot; system call opens an existing file for reading or writing. It has the syntax:

   &lt;file descriptor variable&gt; = open( &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;access mode&gt; );

The &quot;open()&quot; call is similar to the &quot;creat()&quot; call in that it returns a file descriptor for the given file, and returns a file descriptor of -1 if it encounters an error. However, the second parameter is an &quot;access mode&quot;, not a permission code. There are three modes (defined in the &quot;fcntl.h&quot; header file):

   O_RDONLY:   Open for reading only.
   O_WRONLY:   Open for writing only.
   O_RDWR:     Open for reading and writing.

For example, to open &quot;data&quot; for writing, assuming that the file had been created by another program, you would write:

   int fd;
   fd = open( &quot;data&quot;, O_WRONLY );

A few additional comments before proceeding:

    * A &quot;creat()&quot; call implies an &quot;open()&quot;. There is no need to &quot;creat()&quot; a file and then &quot;open()&quot; it.

    * There is an operating-system-dependent limit on the number of files that a program can have open at any one time.

    * The file descriptor is no more than an arbitrary number that a program uses to distinguish one open file for another. When a file is closed, re-opening it again will probably not give it the same file descriptor. 

The &quot;close()&quot; system call is very simple. All it does is &quot;close()&quot; an open file when there is no further need to access it. The &quot;close()&quot; system call has the syntax:

   close( &lt;file descriptor&gt; );

The &quot;close()&quot; call returns a value of 0 if it succeeds, and returns -1 if it encounters an error.

The &quot;unlink()&quot; system call deletes a file. It has the syntax:

   unlink( &lt;file_name_string&gt; );

It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

The &quot;write()&quot; system call writes data from a open file. It has the syntax:

   write( &lt;file descriptor&gt;, &lt;buffer&gt;, &lt;buffer length&gt; );

The file descriptor is returned by a &quot;creat()&quot; or &quot;open()&quot; system call. The &quot;buffer&quot; is a pointer to a variable or an array that contains the data; and the &quot;buffer length&quot; gives the number of bytes to be written into the file.

While different data types may have different byte lengths on different systems, the &quot;sizeof()&quot; statement can be used to provide the proper buffer length in bytes. A &quot;write()&quot; call could be specified as follows:

   float array[10];
   ...
   write( fd, array, sizeof( array ) );

The &quot;write()&quot; function returns the number of bytes it actually writes. It will return -1 on an error.

The &quot;read()&quot; system call reads data from a open file. Its syntax is exactly the same as that of the &quot;write()&quot; call:

   read( &lt;file descriptor&gt;, &lt;buffer&gt;, &lt;buffer length&gt; );

The &quot;read()&quot; function returns the number of bytes it actually returns. At the end of file it returns 0, or returns -1 on error.

This chapter discusses some useful standard C libraries:

   Math library
   Standard utility library
   The &quot;sprintf()&quot; function
   String function library
   Character class test library

-- and the following minor topics:

   Command-line arguments
   Dynamic memory allocation
   Pointers to functions
   PC memory model and other declarations
   Troubleshooting hints

=== C Math Library ===

To use the math library, you need the declaration:

   #include &lt;math.h&gt;

The math functions consist of:

   sin( x ):      Sine of x.
   cos( x ):      Cosine of x.
   tan( x ):      Tangent of x.
   asin( x ):     Inverse sine of x.
   acos( x ):     Inverse cosine of x.
   atan( x ):     Inverse tangent of x.
   sinh( x ):     Hyperbolic sine of x.
   cosh( x ):     Hyperbolic cosine of x.
   tanh( x ):     Hyperbolic tangent of x.
   exp( x ):      Exponential function -- e^x.
   log( x ):      Natural log of x.
   log10( x ):    Base 10 log of x.
   pow( x, y ):   Power function -- x^y.
   sqrt( x ):     Square root of x.
   ceil( x ):     Smallest integer not less than x, returned as double.
   floor( x ):    Greatest integer not greater than x, returned as double.
   fabs( x ):     Absolute value of x.

All values are &quot;doubles&quot;, and trig values are expressed in radians.

=== C Standard Utility Library &amp; Time Library ===

* The utility functions library features a grab-bag of functions. It requires the declaration:

   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

Useful functions include:

   atof( &lt;string&gt; ):    Convert numeric string to double value.
   atoi( &lt;string&gt; ):    Convert numeric string to int value.
   atol( &lt;string&gt; ):    Convert numeric string to long value.
   rand():              Generates pseudorandom integer.
   srand( &lt;seed&gt; ):     Seed random-number generator -- &quot;seed&quot; is an &quot;int&quot;.
   exit( &lt;status&gt; ):    Exits program -- &quot;status&quot; is an &quot;int&quot;.
   system( &lt;string&gt; ):  Tells system to execute program given by the seed.
   abs( n ):            Absolute value of &quot;int&quot; argument.
   labs( n ):           Absolute value of long-int argument.

The functions &quot;atof()&quot;, &quot;atoi()&quot;, and &quot;atol()&quot; will return 0 if they can't convert the string given them into a value.

The time and date library includes a wide variety of functions, some of them obscure and nonstandard. To use this library you need the declaration:

   #include &lt;time.h&gt;

The most essential function is &quot;time()&quot;, which returns the number of seconds since some long-ago date. It returns a value as &quot;time_t&quot; (a &quot;long&quot;) as defined in the header file.

The following function uses &quot;time()&quot; to implement a program delay with resolution in seconds:

   /* delay.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;time.h&gt;

   void sleep( time_t delay );

   void main()
   {
     puts( &quot;Delaying for 3 seconds.&quot; );
     sleep( 3 );
     puts( &quot;Done!&quot; );
   }

   void sleep( time_t delay )
   {
     time_t t0, t1;
     time( &amp;t0 );
     do
     {
       time( &amp;t1 );
     }
     while (( t1 - t0 ) &lt; delay );
   }

The &quot;ctime()&quot; function converts the time value returned by &quot;time()&quot; into a time-and-date string. The following little program prints the current time and date:

   /* time.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;time.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     time_t *t;
     time( t );
     puts( ctime( t ));
   }

This program prints a string of the form:

   Tue Dec 27 15:18:16 1994

=== The C &quot;sprintf()&quot; Function ===

The &quot;sprintf&quot; function allows you to create strings with formatted data. Technically speaking, this is part of the standard-I/O library, and requires the declaration:

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

However, it is really a string function and needs to be discussed along with the other string functions.

The syntax of &quot;sprintf()&quot; is exactly the same as it is for &quot;printf()&quot;, with the notable exception that the first parameter is a pointer to a string. For example:

   /* csprntf.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
      char b[100];
      int i = 42;
      float f = 1.1234f;
      sprintf( b, &quot;Formatted data:  %d / %f&quot;, i, f );
      puts( b );
   }

-- prints the string:

   Formatted data:  42 / 1.1234

There is also an &quot;sscanf()&quot; function that similarly mirrors &quot;scanf()&quot; functionality.

=== C String Function Library ===

The string-function library requires the declaration:

   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

The most important string functions are as follows:

   strlen():   Get length of a string.
   strcpy():   Copy one string to another.
   strcat():   Link together (concatenate) two strings.
   strcmp():   Compare two strings.
   strchr():   Find character in string.
   strstr():   Find string in string.
   strlwr():   Convert string to lowercase.
   strupr():   Convert string to uppercase.

The &quot;strlen()&quot; function gives the length of a string, not including the null character at the end:

   /* strlen.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     char *t = &quot;XXX&quot;;
     printf( &quot;Length of &lt;%s&gt; is %d.\n&quot;, t, strlen( t ));
   }

This prints:

   Length of &lt;XXX&gt; is 3.

The &quot;strcpy&quot; function copies one string from another. For example:

   /* strcpy.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     char s1[100],
          s2[100];
     strcpy( s1, &quot;string 2&quot; );
     strcpy( s2, &quot;string 1&quot; );

     puts( &quot;Original strings: &quot; );
     puts( &quot;&quot; );
     puts( s1 );
     puts( s2 );
     puts( &quot;&quot; );

     strcpy( s2, s1 );

     puts( &quot;New strings: &quot; );
     puts( &quot;&quot; );
     puts( s1 );
     puts( s2 );
   }

This will print out:

   Original strings:

   string 1
   string 2

   New strings:

   string 1
   string 1

Please be aware of two features of this program:

    * This program assumes that &quot;s1&quot; has enough space to store the final string. The &quot;strcat()&quot; function won't bother to check, and will give you erroneous results if that is not the case.

    *A string constant can be used as the source string instead of a string variable. Using one for the destination, of course, makes no sense. 

These comments are applicable to most of the other string functions.

There is a variant form of &quot;strcpy&quot; named &quot;strncpy&quot; that will copy &quot;n&quot; characters of the source string to the destination string, presuming there are that many characters available in the source string. For example, if you make the following change in the example program:

   strncpy( s2, s1, 5 );

-- then the results change to:

   New strings:

   string 1
   string

Notice that the parameter &quot;n&quot; is declared &quot;size_t&quot;, which is defined in &quot;string.h&quot;.

The &quot;strcat()&quot; function joins two strings:

   /* strcat.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     char s1[50],
          s2[50];
     strcpy( s1, &quot;Tweedledee &quot; );
     strcpy( s2, &quot;Tweedledum&quot; );
     strcat( s1, s2 );
     puts( s1 );
   }

This prints:

   Tweedledee Tweedledum

There is a variant version of &quot;strcat()&quot; named &quot;strncat()&quot; that will append &quot;n&quot; characters of the source string to the destination string. If you used &quot;strncat()&quot; in the example above with a length of 7:

   strncat( s1, s2, 7 );

-- the result would be:

   Tweedledee Tweedle

Again, the length parameter is of type &quot;size_t&quot;.

The &quot;strcmp()&quot; function compares two strings:

   /* strcmp.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

   #define ANSWER &quot;blue&quot;

   void main()
   {
     char t[100];
     puts( &quot;What is the secret color?&quot; );
     gets( t );
     while ( strcmp( t, ANSWER ) != 0 )
     {
       puts( &quot;Wrong, try again.&quot; );
       gets( t );
     }
     puts( &quot;Right!&quot; );
   }

The &quot;strcmp()&quot; function returns a &quot;0&quot; for a successful comparison, and nonzero otherwise. The comparison is case-sensitive, so answering &quot;BLUE&quot; or &quot;Blue&quot; won't work.

There are three alternate forms for &quot;strcmp()&quot;:

    * A &quot;strncmp()&quot; function which, as you might guess, compares &quot;n&quot; characters in the source string with the destination string: &quot;strncmp( s1, s2, 6 )&quot;.

    * A &quot;stricmp()&quot; function that ignores case in comparisons.

    * Finally, a case-insensitive version of &quot;strncmp&quot; called &quot;strnicmp&quot;. 

* The &quot;strchr&quot; function finds the first occurrence of a character in a string. It returns a pointer to the character if it finds it, and NULL if not. For example:

   /* strchr.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     char *t = &quot;MEAS:VOLT:DC?&quot;;
     char *p;
     p = t;
     puts( p );
     while(( p = strchr( p, ':' )) != NULL )
     {
       puts( ++p );
     }
   }

This prints:

   MEAS:VOLT:DC?
   VOLT:DC?
   DC?

The character is defined as a character constant, which C regards as an &quot;int&quot;. Notice how the example program increments the pointer before using it (&quot;++p&quot;) so that it doesn't point to the &quot;:&quot; but to the character following it.

The &quot;strrchr()&quot; function is almost the same as &quot;strchr()&quot;, except that it searches for the last occurrence of the character in the string.

* The &quot;strstr()&quot; function is similar to &quot;strchr()&quot; except that it searches for a string, rather than a character. It also returns a pointer:

  char *s = &quot;Black White Brown Blue Green&quot;;
  ...
  puts( strstr( s, &quot;Blue&quot; ) );

* The &quot;strlwr()&quot; and &quot;strupr()&quot; functions simply perform lowercase or uppercase conversion on the source string. For example:

   /* casecvt.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     char *t = &quot;Die Barney die!&quot;;
     puts( strlwr( t ) );
     puts( strupr( t ) );
   }

-- prints:

   die barney die!
   DIE BARNEY DIE!

These two functions only implemented in some compilers and are not part of ANSI C.

=== C Character Class Test Library ===

These functions perform various tests on characters. They require the declaration:

   #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

The character is represented as an &quot;int&quot; and the functions return an &quot;int&quot;. They return 0 if the test is false, and non-0 if the test is true:

   isalnum( c ):    Character is alpha or digit.
   isalpha( c ):    Character is alpha.
   iscntrl( c ):    Character is control character.
   isdigit( c ):    Character is decimal digit.
   isgraph( c ):    Character is printing character (except space).
   islower( c ):    Character is lower-case.
   isprint( c ):    Character is printing character (including space).
   ispunct( c ):    Character is printing character but not space/alnum.
   isspace( c ):    Character is space, FF, LF, CR, HT, VT.
   isupper( c ):    Character is upper-case.
   isxdigit( c ):   Character is hex digit.

The library also contains two conversion functions that also accept and return &quot;int&quot;:

   tolower( c ):   Convert to lower case.
   toupper( c ):   Convert to upper case.

BACK_TO_TOP

=== C Command Line Arguments ===

C allows you to obtain the command line arguments provided when your executable is called, using two optional parameters of &quot;main()&quot; named &quot;argc&quot; (&quot;argument count&quot;) and &quot;argv&quot; (&quot;argument vector&quot;).

The &quot;argc&quot; variable gives the count of the number of command-line parameters provided to the program. This count includes the name of the program itself, so it will always have a value of at least one. The &quot;argv&quot; variable is a pointer to an array of strings, with each element containing one of the command-line arguments.

The following example program demonstrates:

   /* cmdline.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main( int argc, char *argv[] )
   {
     int ctr;
     for( ctr=0; ctr &lt; argc; ctr++ )
     {
       puts( argv[ctr] );
     }
   }

If you run this program from the command line as follows:

   stooges moe larry curley 

-- you'll get the output:

   stooges
   moe
   larry
   curley

In practice, the command line will probably take a number of arguments, some of which will indicate options or switches, designated by a leading &quot;-&quot; or &quot;/&quot;. Some of the switches may be specified separately or together, and some may accept an associated parameter. Other arguments will be text strings, giving numbers, file names, or other data.

The following example program demonstrates parsing the command-line arguments for an arbitrary program. It assumes that the legal option characters are &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;S&quot;, in either upper- or lower-case. The &quot;S&quot; option must be followed by some string representing a parameter.

   /* cparse.c */
   
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;
   
   main( int argc, char *argv[] )
   {
     int m, n,                              /* Loop counters. */
         l,                                 /* String length. */
         x,                                 /* Exit code. */
         ch;                                /* Character buffer. */
     char s[256];                           /* String buffer. */
   
     for( n = 1; n &lt; argc; n++ )            /* Scan through args. */
     {
       switch( (int)argv[n][0] )            /* Check for option character. */
       {
       case '-':
       case '/': x = 0;                   /* Bail out if 1. */
                 l = strlen( argv[n] );
                 for( m = 1; m &lt; l; ++m ) /* Scan through options. */
                 {
                   ch = (int)argv[n][m];
                   switch( ch )
                   {
                   case 'a':              /* Legal options. */
                   case 'A':
                   case 'b':
                   case 'B':
                   case 'C':
                   case 'd':
                   case 'D': printf( &quot;Option code = %c\n&quot;, ch );
                             break;
                   case 's':              /* String parameter. */
                   case 'S': if( m + 1 &gt;= l )
                             {
                               puts( &quot;Illegal syntax -- no string!&quot; );
                               exit( 1 );
                             }
                             else
                             {
                               strcpy( s, &amp;argv[n][m+1] );
                               printf( &quot;String = %s\n&quot;, s );
                             }
                             x = 1;
                             break;
                   default:  printf( &quot;Illegal option code = %c\n&quot;, ch );
                             x = 1;      /* Not legal option. */
                             exit( 1 );
                             break;
                   }
                   if( x == 1 )
                   {
                     break;
                   }
                 }
                 break;
       default:  printf( &quot;Text = %s\n&quot;, argv[n] ); /* Not option -- text. */
                 break;
       }
     }
     puts( &quot;DONE!&quot; );
   }

For a more practical example, here is a simple program, based on an example from the previous chapter, that attempts to read the names of an input and output file from the command line. If no files are present, it uses standard input and standard output instead. If one file is present, it is assumed to be the input file and opens up standard output. This is a useful template for simple file-processing programs.

   /* cpfile.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   #define MAX 256

   void main( unsigned int argc, unsigned char *argv[] )
   {
   
     FILE *src, *dst;
     char b[MAX];
   
     /* Try to open source and destination files. */
   
     switch (argc)
     {
     case 1:          /* No parameters, use stdin-stdout. */
       src = stdin;
       dst = stdout;
       break;

     case 2:          /* One parameter -- use input file &amp; stdout. */
       if ( ( src = fopen( argv[1], &quot;r&quot; )) == NULL )
       {
          puts( &quot;Can't open input file.\n&quot; );
          exit( 0 );
       }
       dst = stdout;
       break;

     case 3:         /* Two parameters -- use input and output files. */
       if ( ( src = fopen( argv[1], &quot;r&quot; )) == NULL )
       {
          puts( &quot;Can't open input file.\n&quot; );
          exit( 0 );
       }
       if ( ( dst = fopen( argv[2], &quot;w&quot; )) == NULL )
       {
          puts( &quot;Can't open output file.\n&quot; );
          exit( 0 );
       }
       break;

     default:        /* Too many parameters. */
       puts( &quot;Wrong parameters.\n&quot; );
       exit( 0 );

     }
   
     /* Copy one file to the next. */
   
     while( ( fgets( b, MAX, src ) ) != NULL )
     {
        fputs( b, dst );
     }
   
     /* All done, close up shop. */
   
     fclose( src );
     fclose( dst );
   }

=== Pointers to C Functions ===

You know by now that you can declare pointers to variables, arrays, and structures in C. You can also define pointers to functions. This feature allows you to pass functions as arguments to other functions. This is useful if you want to, say, build a function that determines solutions to a range of math functions.

The syntax for declaring pointers to functions is obscure, and so let's start with an idiot example: declaring a pointer to the standard library function &quot;printf()&quot;:

   /* ptrprt.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int (*func_ptr) ();                  /* Declare the pointer. */
     func_ptr = printf;                   /* Assign it a function. */
     (*func_ptr) ( &quot;Printf is here!\n&quot; ); /* Execute the function. */
   }

The function pointer has to be declared as the same type (&quot;int&quot; in this case) as the function it represents.

Next, let's pass function pointers to another function. This function will assume the functions passed to it are math functions that accept double and return double values:

   /* ptrroot.c */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;math.h&gt;
   
   void testfunc ( char *name, double (*func_ptr) () );
   
   void main()
   {
     testfunc( &quot;square root&quot;, sqrt );
   }
   
   void testfunc ( char *name, double (*func_ptr) () )
   {
     double x, xinc;
     int c;
   
     printf( &quot;Testing function %s:\n\n&quot;, name );
     for( c=0; c &lt; 20; ++c )
     {
       printf( &quot;%d: %f\n&quot;, c,(*func_ptr)( (double)c ));
     }
   }

You obviously cannot pass any arbitrary function to &quot;testfunc()&quot;, since it must agree with the expected number and type of parameters, as well as with the value returned.

=== C Dynamic Memory Allocation &amp; Deallocation ===

For simple programs, it is OK to just declare an array of a given size:

  char buffer[1024]

In more sophisticated programs, this leads to trouble. You may not know how big an array needs to be for the specific task the program is performing, and so allocating an array in a fixed size will either result in wasted memory or in not having enough to do the job.

The answer to this problem is to have the program allocate the memory at runtime, and that's what the &quot;malloc()&quot; library function does. For example, let's use &quot;malloc()&quot; to allocate an array of &quot;char&quot;:

   /* malloc.c */

   #include &lt;malloc.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;                    /* For &quot;exit&quot; function. */

   void main()
   {
     char *p;                             /* Pointer to array. */
     unsigned count;                      /* Size of array. */
   
     puts( &quot;Size of array?&quot; );
     scanf( &quot;%d&quot;, count );                /* Get size in bytes. */
     p = (char *)malloc( (size_t)count ); /* Allocate array. */
     if( p == NULL )                      /* Check for failure. */
     {
       puts( &quot;Can't allocate memory!&quot; );
       exit( 0 );
     }
     puts( &quot;Allocated array!&quot; );
     free( p );                           /* Release memory. */
   }

The header file &quot;malloc.h&quot; must be included, and a pointer to the memory block to be allocated must be declared. The &quot;malloc()&quot; function sets the pointer to the allocated memory block with:

   p = (char *)malloc( (size_t)count );

The count is in bytes and it is &quot;cast&quot; to the type of &quot;size_t&quot;, which is defined in &quot;malloc.h&quot;. The pointer returned by &quot;malloc()&quot; is &quot;cast&quot; to type &quot;char *&quot;, that is, a pointer to type &quot;char&quot;. By default, in ANSI C, &quot;malloc()&quot; returns a point of type &quot;void&quot;, which allows the pointer to be cast to any other type.

If the &quot;malloc()&quot; fails because it can't allocate the memory, it returns the value NULL (as defined in &quot;stdio.h&quot;).

It is simple to allocate other data types by changing the &quot;cast&quot; operations:

   int *buf;
   ...
   buf = (int *)malloc( (size_t)sizeof( int ) * count );

The &quot;sizeof()&quot; function is used to determine the number of bytes in the &quot;int&quot; data type.

When you have finished using the memory block, you get rid of it using the &quot;free&quot; function:

   free( p );

C also contains two other memory-allocation functions closely related to &quot;malloc()&quot;: the &quot;calloc()&quot; function, which performs the same function as &quot;malloc()&quot; but allows you to specify the block allocated in terms of number of elements:

   void *calloc( size_t &lt;number_elements&gt;, size_t &lt;sizeof_element_type&gt; );

-- and the &quot;realloc()&quot; function, which allows you to reallocate the size of an array that's already been allocated:

   void *realloc( void *&lt;block_pointer&gt;, size_t &lt;size_in_bytes&gt; );

=== Common Programming Problems in C ===

There are a number of common programming pitfalls in C that even trap experienced programmers:

#Confusing &quot;=&quot; (assignment operator) with &quot;==&quot; (equality operator). For example:

   if ( x = 1 )
   {
   }

-- is bogus, and so is:

   for ( x == 1; ...

#Confusing precedence of operations in expressions. When in doubt, use parentheses to enforce precedence.

#Confusing structure-member operators. If &quot;struct_val&quot; is a structure and &quot;struct_ptr&quot; is a pointer to a structure, then:

   struct_val-&gt;myname

-- is wrong and so is:

   struct_ptr.myname

#Using incorrect formatting codes for &quot;printf()&quot; and &quot;scanf()&quot;. Using a &quot;%f&quot; to print an &quot;int&quot;, for example, can lead to bizarre outputs.

#Remember that the actual base index of an array is 0, and the final index is 1 less than the declared size:

   int data[20];
   ...
   for ( x = 1; x &lt;= 20; ++x )
   {
     printf( &quot;%d\n&quot;, data[x] );
   }

-- will give you invalid results when &quot;x&quot; is 20. Since C does not do bounds checking, this one might be hard to catch.

#Muddling syntax for multidimensional arrays. If:

   data[10][10]

-- is a two-dimensional array, then:

   data[2][7]

-- will select an element in that array. However:

   data[ 2, 7 ]

-- will give invalid results but not be flagged as an error by C.

#Confusing strings and character constants. The following is a string:

   &quot;Y&quot;

-- as opposed to the character constant:

   'Y'

This can cause troubles in comparisons of strings against character constants.

#Forgetting that strings end in a null character ('\0'). This means that a string will always be one character bigger than the text it stores. It can also cause you trouble if you are manipulating strings on a character-by-character basis and forget to tack the null character onto the end of it.

#Failing to allocate enough memory for a string -- or, if you declare pointers, to allocate any memory for it at all.

#Declaring a string with a fixed size and then assigning it to a string literal:

   char a[256] = &quot;This doesn't work!&quot;;

#Failing to check return values from library functions. Most library functions return an error code; while it may not be desireable to check every invocation of &quot;printf()&quot;, you should take care not to ignore error codes in critical operations.

Of course, forgetting to store the value returned by a function when that's the only way to get the value out of it is a bonehead move, but people do things like that every now and then.

#Having duplicate library-function names. The compiler will not always catch such bugs.

#Forgetting to specify header files for library functions.

#Specifying variables as parameters to functions when you need to specify pointers, and the reverse. If the function returns a value through a parameter, that means it must be specified as a pointer:

   myfunc( &amp;myvar );

The following will not do the job:

   myfunc( myvar );

Remember that a function may require a pointer as a parameter even if it doesn't return a value, though as a rule this is not a good programming practice.

#Getting mixed up when using nested &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; statements. The best way to avoid problems with this is to always use brackets. Avoiding complicated &quot;if&quot; constructs is also a good idea; use &quot;switch&quot; if you have any choice in the matter. Using &quot;switch&quot; is also useful even if you have simple &quot;if&quot; statements, since it makes it easier to expand the construct if that is necessary.

#Forgetting semicolons, though the compiler usually catches that, or adding one where it isn't supposed to be, which it usually doesn't. For example:

   for( x = 1; x &lt; 10; ++x );
   {
      printf( &quot;%d\n&quot;, x )
   }

-- never prints anything.

#Forgetting &quot;break&quot; statements in &quot;switch&quot; constructs. As commented earlier, doing so will simply cause execution to flow from one clause of the &quot;switch&quot; to the next.

#Careless mixing and misuse of signed and unsigned values, or of different data types. This can lead to some insanely subtle bugs. One particular problem to watch out for is declaring single character variables as &quot;unsigned char&quot;. Many I/O functions will expect values of &quot;unsigned int&quot; and fail to properly flag EOF.

You should usually cast function arguments to the proper type even if it appears that type conversion will take care of it on its own.

#Confusion of variable names. It is recommended that such identifiers be unique in the first 6 characters to ensure portability of code.

#In general, excessively tricky and clever code. Programs are nasty beasts and even if you get one to work, remember that you will have to modify it and even port it to different languages. Maintain a clean structure and do the simple straightforward thing, unless it imposes an unacceptable penalty.

The C++ language is an &quot;object-oriented&quot; extension to C that supports fundamental C syntax but adds many new elements. This chapter provides an overview of its differences from C, while the next chapter discusses its central concept, classes.

=== C++ Fundamentals ===

A C++ program may at first look a great deal like a C program, and in fact most ANSI C programs can be compiled just fine under C++, but there are some differences.

The first and most obvious is that comments have a simplified form. While in C you would state:

   /* This is a comment.
      This is a second comment.
      This is the last comment here. */

-- in C++ you would say:

   // This is a comment.
   // This is a second comment.
   // This is the last comment here.

The second thing you notice in C++ is that simple I/O is performed differently than in C. C++ defines three standard I/O files:

   cin:      Console input.
   cout:     Console output.
   cerr:     Console error output device.

-- and input and output operators (&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) to go along with them. For example, the following program adds two numbers:

   // getxy.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
      double x, y;

      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Please enter X and Y.\n&quot;;
      cin &gt;&gt; x;
      cin &gt;&gt; y;
      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The sum of X and Y is &quot; &lt;&lt; x + y &lt;&lt; &quot;.\n&quot;;
   }

This form of C++ I/O is not fussy about data types, and data formatting can be performed. For example, you can print data in different number formats:

   // prbase.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
      int n = 666;
      cout &lt;&lt; dec &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; oct &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; '\n';
   }

This prints the value as follows:

   666 1232 29a

There is much more that can be said about C++ &quot;stream I/O&quot;, but it will have to wait for a later section.

While C++ supports the ANSI C function definition style:

   int example( int x, int y );

-- it also has some enhancements. Default parameter values can be specified:

   int example( int = 0, int = 100 );

This means that if you call &quot;example&quot; as follows:

   example();

-- then the default parameter values 0 and &quot;100&quot; will be specified. If you call it as:

   example( -100 );

-- the parameter values will be -100 and 100. If you specify both parameters:

   example( 1, 1000 );

-- then the values are &quot;1&quot; and &quot;1000&quot;. You cannot specify only the second parameter:

   example( ,1000 );

There are some other enhancements in function handling that will be discussed in a later section.

C++ incorporates the following additional keywords:

   class          
   delete
   friend
   inline
   new
   operator
   private
   protected
   public
   this
   virtual

These new keywords will be discussed in detail later in this document.

=== C++ Extensions to C ===

* One unusual difference of C++ relative to C is that it allows function prototyping within the &quot;main&quot; program. C++ is not picky about placement of declarations, although a function has to be prototyped before it is used.

Similarly, C++ is not fussy about the placement of variable declarations, and they can be declared within a block if need be. For example, the following is perfectly legal in C++:

   // vardec.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
      for( int l = 0; l &lt; 5; l++ )  // Notice declaration of &quot;l&quot;.
      {
         cout &lt;&lt; l &lt;&lt; '\n';
      }
   }

There are some peculiarities in this declaration with respect to scope, however. The scope of the variable &quot;l&quot; is the current block, but only the portions of the current block after the declaration. Statements before the declaration cannot refer to that variable.

Another new feature of C++ is that you can refer to a global variable and a local variable that have the same name by using the &quot;scope resolution operator&quot;, or &quot;::&quot;. For example:

   // prglob.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   int n = 42;                          // Global variable.

   void main()
   {
     int n = 666;                       // Local variable.
     cout &lt;&lt; ::n &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; '\n';   // Print global, then local variable.
   }

This displays:

   42 666

C++ has a new mechanism to replace the function macros of C, which you may recall can have unpredictable behavior. In C++ you can define &quot;inline functions&quot; with the syntax:

   inline ifunc( int x )
   {
     ...
   }

The code for this function is inserted in the program wherever the function is invoked, allowing for faster execution at the expense of memory usage.

C++ also features some improvements in the &quot;const&quot; keyword. In C the &quot;#define&quot; preprocessor metacommand is used to define constants:

   #define PI 3.141592654

In C++, the &quot;const&quot; keyword is preferred:

   const double PI 3.141592654;

If you don't specify the data type, C++ will assume &quot;int&quot;. The advantage of the &quot;const&quot; keyword is that it allows constant declarations to be made inside functions, resulting in constant values that are &quot;local&quot; to that function. (Of course, they can be used to define global constants as well.)

Another (minor) difference is in C++ handling of enumerated types. If you declare an enumerated type:

   enum Color { Red, White, Blue, Green, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black };

-- and then you declare a variable of that type, you don't have to specify it as an enum type:

   Color cvar;

You can still use standard C libraries in C++, but you must provide a &quot;linkage specification&quot; to tell the C++ compiler that it is using functions compiled for C. For example, if you want to use a function from the C standard library in a C++ program, you would have to write:

   // prnrnd.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   extern &quot;C&quot;
   {
     #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   }

   void main()
   {
     cout &lt;&lt; rand();
   }

=== C++ Memory Allocation -- Free &amp; Delete ===

C++ has two new keywords, &quot;new&quot; and &quot;delete&quot;, to perform variable memory allocation, in place of the C &quot;malloc&quot; and &quot;free&quot; routines. The &quot;new&quot; operator returns a pointer to memory allocated for a specified variable type from the &quot;free store&quot; reserved for the program, and the &quot;delete&quot; operator returns that memory to free store:

   // alloc.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   struct Date
   {
     int month;
     int day;
     int year;
   };

   void main()
   {
     Date *event = new Date;   // Allocate memory for variable of type Date.
     event-&gt;month = 7;
     event-&gt;day = 4;
     event-&gt;year = 1863;
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;What happened on &quot; &lt;&lt; event-&gt;day &lt;&lt; '/' 
                                 &lt;&lt; event-&gt;month &lt;&lt; '/'
			         &lt;&lt; event-&gt;year &lt;&lt; &quot;?\n&quot;;
     delete event;             // Deallocate memory.
   } 

You don't have to specify &quot;struct Date&quot;, as you would in C. The &quot;new&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; operators provide a much cleaner interface than &quot;malloc&quot; and &quot;free&quot;.

For another example, consider the dynamic allocation of arrays:

   // dynaloc.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Array size: &quot;;
      int size;
      cin &gt;&gt; size;                      // Get array size.
      int *array = new int[size];       // Allocate an array.
      for( int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++ )   // Load it with random numbers.
      {
        array[i] = rand();
      }
      for( i = 0; i &lt; size; i++ )
      {
        cout &lt;&lt; array[i] &lt;&lt; '\n';
      }
      delete array;                     // Return array to free store.
   }

Of course, if you dynamically allocate memory, there is a good chance that your program may run out of free store at some time, and so you need to be able to handle that circumstance. C++ includes a function named &quot;set_new_handler&quot; that allows you to specify a handler that will be invoked when the free store is exhausted:

   // newhand.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   #include &lt;new.h&gt;

   static void memhandler()
   {
     cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;Out of memory!\n&quot;;
     exit(1);
   }

   void main()
   {
     set_new_handler( memhandler );
     long sum = 0;
     while (1)
     {
       char *cp = new char[10000];
       sum += 10000;
       cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Memory allocated: &quot; &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; '\n';
     }
   }

=== C++ Function Overloading ===

A particular innovation in C++ relative to C is the use of &quot;function overloading&quot;. In standard C, if you defined a function named &quot;cube&quot; that used &quot;int&quot; values, then you would have to define a function with a different name that handled &quot;double&quot; values. C++ allows you to have multiple functions of the same name in the same program by using the &quot;overload&quot; keyword:

   // cubes.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   long cube( long l )
   {
     return l * l * l;
   }

   double cube( double d )
   {
     return d * d * d;
   }

   void main()
   {
     long n1 = 3;
     double n2 = 5.0;

     cout &lt;&lt; cube( n1 ) &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot; &lt;&lt; cube( n2 ) &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
   }

This program defines a pair of overloaded functions. The type of parameter will determine which function will be called.

=== C++ Structures ===

C++ extends the concepts of data structures defined in C.

The first and simplest difference is that in C++ defining a structure creates a new data type. The only obvious consequence of this (as shown earlier) is that while in C every instance of a defined structure must be declared as a &quot;struct&quot;:

   struct Date { int month, day, year };
   ...
   struct Date today;       /* C structure instance declaration. */

-- in C++ the &quot;struct&quot; keyword is not required in the instance declaration. For an example of C++ structure declaration:

   // cpstruct.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   struct Date
   {
     int month;
     int day;
     int year;
   };

   static void display( Date );     // Function proto with &quot;Date&quot; parameter.

   void main()
   {
     Date bday = { 2, 16, 1953 };
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My birthday is: &quot; &lt;&lt; '\n';
     display( bday );
   }

   static void display( Date d )
   {
     static char *months[] = { &quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, 
                               &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;,
			       &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot; };
     cout &lt;&lt; months[d.month-1] &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; d.day &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; d.year;
   }

You can also declare arrays of structures:

   Date days[20];

-- or pointers to them.

The first really significant difference in structure definition under C++ compared to C is that you can specify functions as elements of structures.

This is a big step toward the concept of object-oriented programming. Now, instead of having a data structure that simply stores data items, you can have functions to work with the data &quot;encapsulated&quot; in the structure.

The following example modifies the previous one to illustrate such encapsulation:

   // encaps.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   struct Date
   {
     int month, day, year;
     void display();                // Function bound to &quot;Date&quot; struct.
   };

   void Date::display( )
   {
     static char *months[] = { &quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, 
                               &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;,
			       &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot; };
     cout &lt;&lt; months[month-1] &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; day &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; year;
   }

   void main()
   {
     Date bday = { 2, 16, 1953 };
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My birthday is: &quot; &lt;&lt; '\n';
     bday.display();
   }

There are some interesting things about this program. First, the encapsulated function is defined with:

   void Date::display( )

-- to indicate that &quot;display()&quot; is associated with the struct &quot;Date&quot;. Note that a parameter of type &quot;Date&quot; is no longer defined, since the function is implicitly associated with a parameter of that form.

Similarly, the data fields are also directly accessible in the function:

   cout &lt;&lt; months[month-1] &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; day &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; year;

It is not necessary to use the notation &quot;d.months&quot;, &quot;d.day&quot;, &quot;d.year&quot;.

However, the function, being an element of that type of structure, is invoked using that notation:

   bday.display();

Structures also allow function overloading. Different structures can have a function of the same name. For example:

   // stover.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;time.h&gt;

   // *********************************************************************

   struct Date  // Date structure with a function named &quot;display()&quot;.
   {
     int month, day, year;
     void display();
   };

   void Date::display()
   {
     static char *months[] = { &quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, 
                               &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;,
			       &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot; };
     cout &lt;&lt; months[month] &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; day &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; year;
   }

   // *********************************************************************

   struct Time  // Time structure with a function named &quot;display()&quot;.
   {
     int hour, minute, second;
     void display();
   };

   void Time::display()
   {
     char t[15];
     sprintf( t, &quot;%d:%2d:%2d %s&quot;,
       ( hour &gt; 12 ? hour - 12 : (hour == 0 ? 12 : hour )),
       minute, second, ( hour &lt; 12? &quot;am&quot; : &quot;pm&quot; ));
     cout &lt;&lt; t;
   }

   // *********************************************************************
   
   void main()
   {
     time_t ctime = time(0);             // Get current time.
     struct tm current = *localtime( &amp;ctime );

     Time now;                           // Instances of defined structures.
     Date today;

     now.hour = current.tm_hour;         // Initialize Time structure.
     now.minute = current.tm_min;
     now.second = current.tm_sec;

     today.month = current.tm_mon;       // Initialize Date structure.
     today.day = current.tm_mday;
     today.year = current.tm_year + 1900;

     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;At the tone it will be &quot;;  // Display time and date.
     now.display();
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot; on &quot;;
     today.display();
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;.\n&quot;;
   }

When invoked, this program produces an output of the form:

   At the tone it will be 6:20:33 on March 17, 1995.

BACK_TO_TOP

[5.6] C++ REFERENCES

* Along with the traditional means of passing parameters to functions as values:

   int testfunc( int x );

-- or as pointers:

   \Bint testfunc( int *x );

-- C++ provides an additional calling scheme, using &quot;reference variables&quot;. This scheme is equivalent to using pointers, in that the function can change the value in the variable and return it to the calling program without having the overhead of passing all the data to the function. However, it doesn't require the use of pointer dereferencing operations in the target function, making it easier to pass structures and arrays to functions.

Reference variables are a slightly fuzzy concept, so please bear with the discussion. It will become clearer as elements are introduced.

A reference variable is defined as an &quot;alias&quot;, or synonym, for a variable. It is defined using the &quot;&amp;&quot; operator:

   int some_int;
   int&amp; ref_to_int = some_int;

This use of &quot;&amp;&quot; is distinct from its use as the &quot;address of&quot; operator:

   &amp;some_int

-- which gives the address of a variable. The reference is initialized when it is declared -- naturally, since it doesn't have any independent existence.

The following example illustrates the behavior of reference variables:

   // reftest.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     int some_int = 42;
     int&amp; ref_to_int = some_int;

     cout &lt;&lt; some_int &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; ref_to_int &lt;&lt; '\n';   // Print values.
     ref_to_int++;                                    // Increment reference.
     cout &lt;&lt; some_int &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; ref_to_int &lt;&lt; '\n';   // Print values.
     some_int++;                                      // Increment variable.
     cout &lt;&lt; some_int &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; ref_to_int &lt;&lt; '\n';   // Print values.
     cout &lt;&lt; &amp;some_int &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; &amp;ref_to_int &lt;&lt; '\n'; // Print addresses.
   }

This prints:

   42 42
   43 43
   44 44
   0x6555fffc 0x6555fffc

A reference, as this example shows, is not a copy of nor a pointer to the variable it aliases. It is simply another name for it.

* References are generally used in conjunction with arrays, structures, and class objects, to be discussed in the next chapter. There's not really much reason to define references for simple &quot;int&quot; or &quot;float&quot; variables.

The reason for having references is to simplify parameter passing to functions, as noted earlier in this section. They eliminate the overhead of passing large data structures to functions, eliminate the need for pointer dereferencing operations, and allow a function to modify the data from the source program.

For example:

   // ptrdemo.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   struct big     // A big structure that doesn't do much of anything.
   {
     int sn;
     char text[1024];
   } b = { 42, &quot;Life, the Universe, and Everything!&quot; };

   void fslow( big b1 );   // Function to call the big structure by value.
   void ffast( big&amp; b2 );  // Function to call the big structure by reference.

   void main()
   {
     fslow( b );           // Slow, because data must be put on stack.
     ffast( b );           // Fast, because data is directly accessed.
   }

   void fslow( big b1 )
   {
     cout &lt;&lt; b1.sn &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; b1.text &lt;&lt; '\n';
   }

   void ffast( big&amp; b2 )
   {
     cout &lt;&lt; b2.sn &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; b2.text &lt;&lt; '\n';
   }

A second example illustrates how references accomplish the same thing as pointers but don't require the clumsy pointer dereferencing syntax:

   // refdemo.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   struct big     // Same big struct as before.
   {
     int sn;
     char text[1024];
   } b = { 42, &quot;Life, the Universe, and Everything!&quot; };

   void fptr( big *b1 );    // Function to use pointers.
   void fref( big&amp; b2 );    // Function to use references.

   void main()
   {
     fptr( &amp;b ); 
     fref( b );
   }

   void fptr( big *b1 )
   { 
     cout &lt;&lt; b1-&gt;sn &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; b1-&gt;text &lt;&lt; '\n';  // Pointer deference.
   }

   void fref( big&amp; b2 )
   {
     cout &lt;&lt; b2.sn &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; b2.text &lt;&lt; '\n';    // As before.
   }

A function can, as noted, change the value of the referenced variable in the calling program. If this is not desired, in the case where you simply want fast and economical parameter passing, you can declare a reference as a constant:

   void func( const somestr&amp; d );  // Parameter &quot;d&quot; can't be changed.

References can also be returned by functions to calling programs:

   &amp;getref( int i );          // Prototype for function to return reference.
   ...
   somestr&amp; r = getref( 3 );  // Return reference value to calling routine.

Remember that a reference is an alias. You cannot really perform any operation on a reference but initialize it, since any other operation you perform on the reference is simply performed on the variable referenced. You also cannot define arrays of references.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Programming In C++: Classes ==

The central core concept of C++ is the class, and this chapter describes its essential features in an introductory fashion. The ramifications of classes are highly complicated, and this chapter does not, could not, explain them in detail. It simply provides a basis for further study.

=== C++ Classes ===

In C, you define variables of various types and create functions to manipulate them. In C++, you define variables and functions and bind them together as a new data type, or &quot;class&quot;.

We've already seen how in C++ structures can encapsulate both data and functions. A C++ class is an extension of the definition of C++ structures that adds several important features.

To start off the discussion, let's define a class to define cubes. This example has a few new features which will be explained in following text:

   // clscube.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   class Cube                         // Cube class.
   {
     private:
       int height, width, depth;      // Private data members.
     public:
       Cube( int, int, int );         // Constructor function prototype.
       ~Cube();                       // Destructor function prototype.
       int volume();                  // Member function prototype.
   };

   Cube::Cube( int h, int w, int d )  // Constructor function definition.
   {
     height = h;
     width = w;
     depth = d;
   };

   Cube::~Cube()                      // Destructor function definition.
   {
     // Does nothing.
   };

   int Cube::volume()                 // A member function (computes volume).
   {
     return height * width * depth;
   };


   void main()                        // This program demonstrates the class.
   {
     Cube somecube( 3, 3, 3 );        // Allocate a cube.
     cout &lt;&lt; somecube.volume() &lt;&lt; '\n';
   }

This example has a few interesting new features. The most important feature is that the class definition is divided into two sections: a &quot;public&quot; section (which, in this case, contains the class's function definitions) and a remaining &quot;private&quot; section (containing variables in this case) which is hidden from view from outside the class.

You could define either functions or variables as either &quot;public&quot; or &quot;private&quot;, but in practice the idea is to hide the variables and only allow access to them through functions, so the division in this example is typical and is the recommended usage.

This is one of the essentials of the class concept: to hide data details from the program, allowing it to manipulate data elements through member functions without any knowledge of the actual data structure. This allows a considerable degree of data independence.

The default is &quot;private&quot;. If you don't specify if class element is &quot;public&quot; or &quot;private&quot;, it is automatically defined as &quot;private&quot;.

You can also use &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; in structure definitions, but once you do so, you might as well declare a class and be done with it. There are some other keywords related to &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot;, but we'll put off discussion of them to later.

Note the definition of the function &quot;Cube()&quot;:

   Cube::Cube( int h, int w, int d )

This is a special member function, called a &quot;constructor&quot;, that is used to initialize an instance of a class when it is created. The declaration of an instance of a class automatically and transparently invokes the constructor.

In this example, an instance of the class is declared and allocated as follows:

   Cube somecube( 3, 3, 3 );

This declaration invokes the constructor function to initialize the instance.

You can also specify default values if desired in the constructor definition:

   Cube::Cube( int h = 1, int w = 1, int d = 1 )

In this case, if you define an instance of the class without parameters:

   Cube defcube;

-- then its three private variables will all default to a value of 1.

A constructor function doesn't return a value and so it is not declared as a type, not even of type &quot;void&quot;.

There is another curious definition here, for the function &quot;~Cube()&quot;. This is a &quot;destructor&quot; function, and it is automatically and transparently called when the program exits the context in which the class instance was created.

In this case, the destructor doesn't really do anything, it's just there to illustrate the thing exists. A destructor is useful when the constructor allocates memory that must be returned to the free pool after the class has outlived its usefulness. A destructor is also automatically and transparently invoked when the program context in which the class is defined is exited.

Neither constructors nor destructors are required for class definitions.

* Member functions, which actually do the work the class was defined to do, are declared as they are in C++ structures:

   int Cube::volume()

The member function, as with C++ structures, of course has direct access to the structure's variables and so they don't need to be specified as parameters.

The class can contain functions defined either as conventional functions or as inline functions, discussed in the previous chapter. C++ notation allows the inline functions to be incorporated directly into the class definition.

For example, the class definition in the example above could be made much more compact by eliminating the unneeded destructor function and writing the remaining constructor and member function in inline form:

   class Cube
   {
       int height, width, depth;   // Implied &quot;private&quot; variables.
     public:
       Cube( int h, int w, int d );
         { height = h; width = w; depth = d; }
       int volume();
         { return height * width * depth; }
   };

This gives the complete class definition. Notice that the inline functions are coded on a single line, which is a common convention that emphasizes their nature as inline functions. It is a good rule of thumb that if an inline function can't be coded on a single line, it shouldn't be an inline function.

It is also possible to have overloaded constructor functions that perform different actions when given different parameters:

   class Cube
   {
       int height, width, depth;
     public:
       Cube();                                  
       Cube( int h, int w, int d );
         { height = h; width = w; depth = d; }
       int volume();
         { return height * width * depth; }
   };

In this class definition, there are two constructor functions, one which has no parameters and doesn't initialize the private variables, and one that had parameters and does.

As a class is a C++ data type, it can imply the use of type conversions. If you assign an &quot;int&quot; value to a &quot;float&quot; variable, C or C++ will automatically perform the appropriate conversion. Of course, this requires a certain amount of smarts on the part of the compiler to recognize the need for the conversion, since the number formats are very different and the bits from the &quot;int&quot; variable need to be rearranged.

Since the C++ compiler doesn't have any more knowledge of a class than you define for it, it can't automatically perform type conversions, so you have to provide functions yourself for your class to do the job. This is a somewhat advanced topic and a detailed discussion of it is beyond the scope of this document, but the following example demonstrates:

   // julie.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   class Julian   // Julian (date by number of day in year) date class.
   {
       int day, year;
     public:
       Julian() {}
       Julian( int d, int y ) { day = d; year = y; }
       void display() { cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '-' &lt;&lt; day &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;; }
       int&amp; getday() { return day; }
   };

   class Date     // Month-day-year class.
   {
       int month, day, year;
     public:
       Date( int m, int d, int y ) { month = m; day = d; year = y; }
       operator Julian();  // Conversion function.
   };

   class Tester   // A class that is initialized to a Julian date.
   {
       Julian jd;
     public:
       Tester( Julian j ) { jd = j; }
       void display() { jd.display(); }
   };

   static int ndays[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };

   Date::operator Julian()   // Julian &lt;- Date conversion member function.
   {
     Julian jd( 0, year );
     for( int i = 0; i &lt; ( month - 1 ); i++ )
     {
       jd.getday() += ndays[i];
     };
     jd.getday() += day;
     return jd;
   };

   void dispdate( Julian jd )   // A function that expects a Julian date.
   {
     jd.display();
   };

   void main()   // Illustrate the different ways to perform the conversion.
   {
     Date dt( 03, 25, 95 );
     Julian jd;
     jd = dt;                // Convert Date to Julian by assigment.
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;assignment: &quot;;
     jd.display();
     jd = (Julian) dt;       // Convert Date to Julian by cast.
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;cast: &quot;;
     jd.display();
     jd = Julian( dt );      // Convert by calling conversion function.
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;function: &quot;;
     jd.display();
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;parameter: &quot;;
     dispdate( dt );         // Convert by using as function parameter.
     Tester ts( dt );        // Convert by initialization.
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;init: &quot;;
     ts.display();
   }

This example creates an &quot;operator&quot; function associated with the &quot;Date&quot; class:

   Date::operator Julian()

-- that takes an instance of the &quot;Date&quot; class and converts it to the &quot;Julian&quot; class. The C++ compiler is smart enough to figure out how to use this function in the appropriate circumstances.

One interesting point about this example is that it illustrates the properties of references. In accordance with the good principles of data hiding, the only access to the &quot;day&quot; member function of class &quot;Julian&quot; is through the &quot;getday()&quot; member function:

   int&amp; getday() { return day; }

This function returns a reference to the &quot;day&quot; member variable. This allows the function to be used on both sides of an equation, a concept quite alien to C:

   jd.getday() += ndays[i];

This is possible because &quot;jd.getday()&quot;, as a reference, is seen by the formula simply as the &quot;day&quot; member variable, so as far as the equation is concerned this is exactly comparable to:

   jd.day += ndays[i];

The example above converts from one class to another. The conversion could be from a to a simpler data type, such as a &quot;long&quot;, if desired.

While date hiding is an essential component of C++'s object-oriented philosophy, like all rules sometimes it is wiser to break it, and C++ actually provides a provision for breaking it in a controlled fashion.

One class can allow another class to access their private member functions by declaring the class as &quot;friend&quot;:

   // cpfriend.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   class Date;    // &quot;Prototype&quot; for Date class definition.

   class Julian   // Julian (date by number of day in year) date class.
   {
       int day, year;
     public:
       Julian() {}
       Julian( int d, int y ) { day = d; year = y; }
       void display() { cout &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '-' &lt;&lt; day; }
       friend Date;   // Date members have access to Julian private members.
   };

   class Date     // Month-day-year class.
   {
       int month, day, year;
     public:
       Date( int m, int d, int y ) { month = m; day = d; year = y; }
       operator Julian();  // Conversion function.
   };

   static int ndays[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };

   Date::operator Julian()   // Julian &lt;- Date conversion member function.
   {
     Julian jd( 0, year );
     for( int i = 0; i &lt; ( month - 1 ); i++ )
     {
       jd.day += ndays[i];   // This Date member function has access to
     }                       // Julian private variables.
     jd.day += day;
     return jd;
   }

   void main()
   {
     Date dt( 11, 17, 89 );
     Julian jd;
     jd = dt;
     jd.display();
   }

Since the &quot;Julian&quot; class definition refers to the &quot;Date&quot; class definition before it is defined in the program listing, the &quot;Date&quot; class is &quot;prototyped&quot; to keep the compiler from getting confused:

   class Date;

The &quot;Julian&quot; class defines &quot;Date&quot; as a &quot;friend&quot; function with:

   friend Date;

-- and so the &quot;Date&quot; conversion function can have access to a &quot;Julian&quot; private variable:

   jd.day += ndays[i];

Actually allowing an entire class access to another class is not recommended procedure, however, and it is just as easy to only allow access by one member function. In the example above, the &quot;Julian&quot; definition could be modified by adding the declaration:

   friend Date::Date( Julian );

You can declare an element of a class as &quot;static&quot;, in which case all instances of the class access one and the same element. For example, a static class variable is a &quot;global&quot; variable, if just for that particular class. You can also have &quot;static&quot; member functions, which are simply member functions that only access static member variables.

Another related C++ concept is the &quot;this&quot; pointer, which is just a pointer to the instance of an object that a member function is executing in. This may seem a little absurd. After all, if the member function is executing in one instance of a particular object, it obviously has access to that instance's member functions:

   void Date::dispmonth()
   {
     cout &lt;&lt; month;                      // Display the month.
     cout &lt;&lt; this-&gt;month;                // Display the month.
   }

-- but the trick is that the member function can return the pointer to let some other function know what object it is executing in:

   return *this;         // Return object pointed to by &quot;this&quot;.

=== C++ Operator Overloading ===

Along with the ability to overload functions, C++ provides the ability to overload operators. C itself actually has overloaded operators; &quot;+&quot;, for instance, can be used to add a variety of data types even though the addition operation is performed differently for each. C++ simply extends this concept to allow the user to define his or her own overloaded operators.

The following example overloads the &quot;+&quot; operator to allow an &quot;integer&quot; to be added to an instance of the &quot;Date&quot; class, returning an instance of the &quot;Date&quot; class:

   // overops.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   class Date     // Month-day-year class.
   {
       int month, day, year;
     public:
       Date( int m, int d, int y ) { month = m; day = d; year = y; }
       void display() { cout &lt;&lt; month &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; day &lt;&lt; '/' &lt;&lt; year; }
       Date operator+(int)       // Overloaded &quot;+&quot; operator.
   };

   static int ndays[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 };

   Date Date::operator+(int n)         // Overloaded &quot;+&quot; operator.
   {
     Date dt = *this;                  // Connect to current object instance.
     n += dt.day
     while( n &gt; ndays[dt.month - 1]    // Add integer number to date.
     {
       n -= ndays[dt.month - 1];
       {
         if( ++dt.month == 13 )
	 {
	   dt.month = 1;
	   dt.year++;
	 }
       }
       dt.day = n;
       return dt;                      // Return date object.
     }

   void main()
   {
     Date olddate( 5, 3, 95 );
     Date newdate;
     newdate = olddate + 21;           // Add integer to date.
     newdate.display();
   }

Notice the use of the &quot;this&quot; pointer to return the object so it can be assigned to &quot;newdate&quot;. This is an extremely important use of the &quot;this&quot; pointer.

Operator overloading can be performed by similar means for other binary arithmetic operations, for relational operations, increment and decrement operators, array subscripting, and so on. Be warned that operator overloading is tricky, can cause a lot of trouble, and must be done wisely. One C++ guru once noted that C++ programmers first learn to overload operators, and then they learn not to.

=== C++ Class Inheritance ===

One of the important features of classes is that, once you define a class, you can build, or &quot;derive&quot;, classes from it that are a superset of the original, or &quot;base&quot;, class's capabilities. This feature is known as &quot;class inheritance&quot;. This scheme allows you to define a general base class -- say, as an arbitrary silly example, a class to describe a bird -- and then derive new classes from it to define more specific types -- say, derived classes to describe hawks, owls, ducks, hummingbirds, and so on.

Let's consider a base class definition for a class named &quot;Time&quot; along with a derived class named &quot;Timezone&quot;:

   // derive.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   // *** Time class definition.  ****************************************

   class Time 
   {
     protected:
       int hours, minutes, seconds;
     public:
       Time( int hr, int min, int sec );
       void display();
   };

   Time::Time( int hr, int min, int sec )
   {
     hours = hr;
     minutes = min;
     seconds = sec;
   }

   void Time::display()
   {
     cout &lt;&lt; hours &lt;&lt; ':' &lt;&lt; minutes &lt;&lt; ':' &lt;&lt; seconds;
   } 

   enum timezone { gmt, est, cst, mst, pst };

   // *** TimeZone class definition.  ************************************

   class TimeZone : public Time
   {
       timezone zone;
     protected:
       const char *Zone();
     public:
       TimeZone( int h, int min, int sec, timezone zn );
       void display();
   };

   static const char *TZ[] = { &quot;GMT&quot;, &quot;EST&quot;, &quot;CST&quot;, &quot;MST&quot;, &quot;PST&quot; };

   TimeZone::TimeZone( int hr, int min, int sec, timezone zn )
              : Time( hr, min, sec )
   {
     zone = zn;
   }

   void TimeZone::display()
   {
     Time::display();
     cout &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; Zone();
   }

   const char *TimeZone::Zone()
   {
     return TZ[zone];
   } 

   // *** Main program. **************************************************

   void main()
   {
     Time tm( 10, 13, 30 );
     tm.display();
     cout &lt;&lt; '\n';
     TimeZone tz( 11, 14, 35, est );
     tz.display();
   }

There are several interesting features in this program. First, the &quot;protected&quot; keyword is used in the &quot;Time&quot; class definition. This is almost the same as the &quot;private&quot; keyword, but it allows classes derived from this base class to have access to that keyword, a privilege they don't get if it is are declared &quot;private&quot;.

The &quot;TimeZone&quot; class is derived from the &quot;Time&quot; class with the statement:

  class TimeZone : public Time { ... }

The derived class can declare the base class as &quot;private&quot;, &quot;public&quot;, or &quot;protected&quot;.

Calling a constructor function for a derived class implies calling the constructor function for the base class. You have to specify the relationship of the constructor's parameters between the two classes as follows:

   TimeZone::TimeZone( int hr, int min, int sec, timezone zn )
             : Time( hr, min, sec )

C++ class construction also allows a curious reversal of this relationship. A base class can have a &quot;virtual&quot; function, declared, say, as:

   virtual void display();

-- that, when invoked through a derived class, passes execution back to the overloaded function in the derived class.

Both the base and derived class have a function named &quot;display()&quot;. This implies function overloading on the part of the derived class, meaning its version of &quot;display()&quot; will be called rather than that of the base class.

It is possible of course to then derive further classes from the derived class, or derive a class from multiple classes (&quot;multiple inheritance&quot;).

=== C++ Input/Output Streams ===

Previous examples in this discussion have used the &quot;iostream&quot; capabilities of C++ for console I/O:

   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;What's your name? &quot;;
   cin &gt;&gt; name;

The &quot;iostream&quot; capabilities are actually defined by classes that permit general-purpose I/O. These classes are derived by a (mostly hidden) base class named &quot;ios&quot;.

These classes have much more functionality than has been used so for. For starters, C++ output is &quot;buffered&quot;, meaning that you can output from a program for some time before an output buffer is filled and the buffer is dumped to standard output. You can force the buffer to be dumped using the &quot;flush&quot; operator:

   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Danger, Will Robinson!\n&quot;&quot; &lt;&lt; flush;

Other useful new functions allow you to set fixed or format numeric output formats (the default is scientific), the output width, and the padding character used to fill out the field:

   // strsci.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     pi = 3.141;
     cout.setf( ios::fixed, ios::scientific ); // Set fixed, clear scientific.
     cout.width( 10 );                         // 10 character output width.
     cout.fill(&quot;*&quot;);                           // Set &quot;*&quot; as pad character.
     cout &lt;&lt; pi &lt;&lt; '\n';
   }

This prints:

   *****3.141

The &quot;iostream&quot; class also contains a number of member functions that duplicate the functionality of C console-I/O routines:

   // strcons.cpp

   #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
     char c, l[100], s[] = &quot;Banzai!&quot;;

     // Output a character.

     cout.put( 'X' ); 
     cout.put( '\n' );

     // Get a character.

     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Input a character, then press Enter: &quot;;
     cin.get( c );
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;You input: &quot; &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; '\n';
     cin.get( c );
     
     // Get a line of text terminated by a newline.

     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Type a line of text, then press Enter: &quot; &lt;&lt; &quot;\n\n&quot;;
     cin.getline( l, 100 );
     cout &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; &quot;You entered: &quot; &lt;&lt; l &lt;&lt; &quot;\n\n&quot;;

   }

Finally, you can use more or less the same operations for reading and writing files. This requires use of the &quot;fstream&quot; class (which is a superset of the &quot;iostream&quot; class and so supports its functionality). For example:

   // strfile.cpp

   #include &lt;fstream.h&gt; 

   void main()
   {
      int n;

      ofstream outfile( &quot;data.txt&quot; );      // Open output file.
      for( n = 1; n &lt;= 10; ++n )           // Dump text to it.
      {
        outfile &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; '\n';
      }
      outfile.close();                     // Close it.

      ifstream infile( &quot;data.txt&quot; );       // Open it again.
      while( 1 )                           // Read to EOF.
      {
        infile &gt;&gt; n;                       // Get number.
     	if( infile.eof())
     	{
     	  break;
     	}
     	cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; '\n';                 // Output it.
      }  
      infile.close();
   }

The &quot;get&quot; and &quot;getline&quot; functions work as well.

== What is calculus? ==

Calculus is the broad area of mathematics dealing with such topics as instantaneous rates of change, areas under curves, and sequences and series. Underlying all of these topics is the concept of a limit, which consists of analyzing the behavior of a function at points ever closer to a particular point, but without ever actually reaching that point. As a typical application of the methods of calculus, consider a moving car. It is possible to create a function describing the displacement of the car (where it is located in relation to a reference point) at any point in time as well as a function describing the velocity (speed and direction of movement) of the car at any point in time. If the car were traveling at a constant velocity, then algebra would be sufficient to determine the position of the car at any time; if the velocity is unknown but still constant, the position of the car could be used (along with the time) to find the velocity.

However, the velocity of a car cannot jump from zero to 35 miles per hour at the beginning of a trip, stay constant throughout, and then jump back to zero at the end.  As the accelerator is pressed down, the velocity rises gradually, and usually not at a constant ''rate'' (i.e., the driver may push on the gas pedal harder at the beginning, in order to speed up). Describing such motion and finding velocities and distances at particular times cannot be done using methods taught in pre-calculus, whereas it is not only possible but straightforward with calculus.

Calculus has two basic applications: [[Calculus/Differentiation/Contents|''differential calculus'']] and  [[Calculus/Integration/Contents|''integral calculus'']]. The simplest introduction to differential calculus involves an explicit series of numbers.  Given the series (42, 43, 3, 18, 34), the differential of this series would be (1, -40, 15, 16).  The new series is derived from the difference of successive numbers which gives rise to its name &quot;differential&quot;. Rarely, if ever, are differentials used on an explicit series of numbers as done here. Instead, they are derived from a continuous function in a manner which is described later.

Integral calculus, like differential calculus, can also be introduced via series of numbers. Notice that in the previous example, the original series can almost be derived solely from its differential. Instead of taking the difference, however, integration involves taking the sum. Given the first number of the original series, 42 in this case, the rest of the original series can be derived by adding each successive number in its differential (42+1, 43-40, 3+15, 18+16). Note that knowledge of the first number in the original series is crucial in deriving the integral.  As with differentials, integration is performed on continuous functions rather than explicit series of numbers, but the concept is still the same. Integral calculus allows us to calculate the area under a curve of almost any shape; in the car example, this enables you to find the displacement of the car based on the velocity curve. This is because the area under the curve is the total distance moved, as we will soon see.
Let's understand this section very carefully. Suppose we have to add the numbers in series which is continuously &quot;on&quot; like 23,25,24,25,34,45,46,47, and so on...at this type integral calculation is very useful instead of the typical mathematical formulas.

== Why learn calculus? ==

Calculus is essential for many areas of science and engineering. Both make heavy use of mathematical functions to describe and predict physical phenomena that are subject to continual change, and this requires the use of calculus. Take our car example: if you want to design cars, you need to know how to calculate forces, velocities, accelerations, and positions. All require calculus. Calculus is also necessary to study the motion of gases and particles, the interaction of forces, and the transfer of energy. It is also useful in business whenever rates are involved. For example, equations involving interest or supply and demand curves are grounded in the language of calculus.

Calculus also provides important tools in understanding functions and has led to the development of new areas of mathematics including real and complex analysis, topology, and non-euclidean geometry.
    
Notwithstanding calculus' ''functional'' utility (pun intended), many non-scientists and non-engineers have chosen to study calculus just for the challenge of doing so. A smaller number of persons  undertake such a challenge and then discover that calculus is beautiful in and of itself.

== What is involved in learning calculus? ==

Learning calculus, like much of mathematics, involves two parts:

* Understanding the concepts:  You must be able to explain what it means when you take a [[Wikipedia:derivative|derivative]] rather than merely apply the formulas for finding a derivative.  Otherwise, you will have no idea whether or not your solution is correct.  Drawing diagrams, for example, can help clarify abstract concepts.

* Symbolic manipulation:  Like other branches of mathematics, calculus is written in symbols that represent concepts.  You will learn what these symbols mean and how to use them.  A good working knowledge of [[trigonometry]] and [[algebra]] is a must, especially in integral calculus.  Sometimes you will need to manipulate expressions into a usable form before it is possible to perform operations in calculus.

== What you should know before using this text ==

There are some basic skills that you need before you can use this text.  Continuing with our example of a moving car:

* You will need to describe the motion of the car in symbols.  This involves understanding functions.  
* You need to manipulate these functions. This involves algebra.  
* You need to translate symbols into graphs and vice-versa. This involves understanding the graphing of functions.
* It also helps (although it isn't necessarily essential) if you understand the functions used in trigonometry since these functions appear frequently in science.

== Scope ==

The first four chapters of this textbook cover the topics taught in a typical high school or first year college course.  The first chapter, [[../Precalculus/]], reviews those aspects of functions most essential to the mastery of calculus. The second, [[../Limits/]], introduces the concept of the limit process. It also discusses some applications of limits and proposes using limits to examine slope and area of functions. The next two chapters, [[../Differentiation/]] and [[../Integration/]], apply limits to calculate derivatives and integrals. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is used, as are the essential formulae for computation of derivatives and integrals without resorting to the limit process.  The third and fourth chapters include articles that apply the concepts previously learned to calculating volumes, and so on as well as other important formulae.

The remainder of the central Calculus chapters cover topics taught in higher-level calculus topics: multivariable calculus, vectors, and series (Taylor, convergent, divergent).

Finally, the other chapters cover the same material, using formal notation.  They introduce the material at a much faster pace, and cover many more theorems than the other two sections.  They assume knowledge of some set theory and set notation.

I'm using windows 2000 here at work and I've not seen what you are talking about. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:23, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)
:It is apparently for the Wikipedia site but not on Wikibooks yet ... when will we get the updates huhmm. --~~

: I just found it - in Preferences - &quot;Show edit toolbar&quot;. I think. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 11:34, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)

==Redirects==
If you want to get rid of a redirect. Click on the link that says &quot;redirected from mainpage&quot; you will find that you can see the page you were redirected from. Edit the page and wipe the redirect. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 17:43, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Oh, yeah .. I guess I shoulda figured that one out .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]


Thanks for the tip and sorry bout fiddling with main page --[[User:Flonejek|Flonejek]] 05:35, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I guess you could help by extending the notes I've taken past highschool level. I'm trying to do this myself but the only areas where I have extensive knowledge are Physics,Chem,Calculus, and Applic.(I've yet too start working on Calculus and Applic). In other words if you know anyone good with humanities they could extend my economics and (soon to be) lit notes. As for others in my class helping out, well, I'm like one of 3 kids in the final year who knows the basics of html. By the way, I created the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] based on your physics textbook and the [[Humanities bookshelf]], and these themselves have shown me many shortcuts that wikicode has over html, so thanks a heap. I could probably get [http://cecid.sf.net Patrick] to help, but he's pretty involved in his anonymising software atm.

==Automatied TOC?==
I noticed on your page that you've stated that the Chemistry textbook has it's own automated Table of Contents, yet I can't seem to find such a TOC in the page's code.  I'd be very interested is such an automation, and would appriciate any help you can give me.  Thanks, [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:05, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:Thanks.  I'm not sure if it'd work for the cookbook, as we tend to put a hierarchy header rather than a TOC header for each page, but I'll keep it in mind for when I go work on something else.

==Hi==
*Thanks for the welcome! [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 07:43, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

* I want to say &quot;thanks&quot; for your work on [[General Biology]]. 

: I wonder if there is something that could be done to recruit mare people to help with Wikibooks. I doubt if anyone gets down to the last line of the Wikipedia [[en:Main Page|main page]]. Maybe the best thing to to is spend some time making more links from Wikipedia biology pages to Wikibooks. [[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 17:02, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== EvoWiki material ==
You're welcome to use evowiki as a source, and you're welcome to copy any article which is written entirely by me. If the page is written by a number of different authors you'd have to get permission from each one of them, because the evowiki license states that material should be for non-commercial use, and the GFDL doesn't! --[[EvoWiki:User:Steinsky]]/[[en:User:Steinsky]] 13:46, 3 Mar 2004 (GMT)

== Deleting an old version ==

I'm looking at the [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/wikipedia/phpwiki/newcodebase/docs/schema.doc?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/plain database schema] and I think this is what you need:

: DELETE FROM `old` WHERE `old_id` = 13692;

To check, do first:

: SELECT `old_user`, `old_text` FROM `old` WHERE `old_id` = 13692;

This should return a '''single''' row with the full article text in old_text. This should return no rows once the DELETE command has been executed. If it shows more than one row, ask me, I'll find out what's going on.

You can run these at [[Special:asksql]]. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 21:44, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:...yes? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 14:44, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I go to [[Special:asksql]] and paste

SELECT `old_user`, `old_text` FROM `old` WHERE `old_id` = 13692

into the box. When I press the &quot;submit query&quot; button another page comes up that says &quot;Query successful&quot; and has the code I just typed in still in a box, then below a big box that says old_user and old_text at the top and then has several thousands of words of text there (I believe the text that is to be eliminated. So my best guess is to paste

DELETE FROM `old` WHERE `old_id` = 13692

either with or without the previous code still in the box, and press the submit query button. But then it gives me an error message: 

&lt;&lt; A database query syntax error has occurred. This could be because of an illegal search query (see Searching Wikibooks), or it may indicate a bug in the software. The last attempted database query was: 

DELETE FROM `old` WHERE `old_id` = 13692
from within function &quot;SpecialAsksql::doSubmit&quot;. MySQL returned error &quot;1142: delete command denied to user: 'wikisql@isidore' for table 'old'&quot;. &gt;&gt;

So what am I doing wrong ?

==Dichotomous Key==
No problem, I made [[Dichotomous Key]] from a redirect to a list (at least for now, eventually I suppose it will be a title page and introduction), as I think the list at [[General Biology]] will quickly be too long.  Perhaps just a link to some of the major groups that people are likely to look up (not many people try to identify annelids using a dichotomous key, for example, but they do for snakes and birds and trees and such).

Synopsis and Disclaimer moved to [[LD Introduction]] - I'm not so sure about this.

== Organic Chemistry ==

I've made a minor addition to the alkenes section of the organic chemistry book.  I thought I'd let you know that I plan on adding more on the reactions of alkenes and I also hope to contribute to other parts of the organic chemistry book. I'm currently studying for my A-level Chemistry and so I'll make contribuions when I can. 

I'm also working on a section about Transition metals for the Inorganic Chemistry book.

Are you a bureaucrat in addition to being an admin? [[User:Perl|Perl]] 02:14, 21 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:Ummm ... bureaucrat? Not a word I'd like to use for myself in most contexts, as it conjures arbitrary rules and regulations, which is contrary to my freewheeling nature. I am the guy who started this site tho, and ready to assist if there is any organizational task that I can serve in. Except I am not a developer so do not have knowlege / ablility for certain tasks, such as making new admins. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::Well, Karl, get ready, cause I just nominated you for honorary developer status over at meta ([[m:Developer access]]).  This would give you bureaucrat level abilities at all wikimedia projects. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 07:44, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::Wow, cool ... there is something that is actually titled, &quot;bureaucrat&quot;? If it means a greater role in planning and implementing WikiMedia projects, thank you Genteen! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:::As I understand it, a &quot;bureaucrat&quot; is an admin who can create, and remove, other admins.  The &quot;Honorary developer&quot;, mostly being called &quot;stewards&quot; right now, would have this ability over ''all'' wikimedia projects.  The main use, I take it, would be to help set up new projects or languages until a ''local'' community was able to function properly. I think you'd be very good with such a responsibility, and so far, no one disagrees. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 21:08, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== Editing pages ==
Is there any other document which describes how to use the Wiki apart from the standard how to edit a document page?
I would like to do some stuff like equation numbering etc.
Thanks for the welcome BTW. --- [[User:Norman Weiner|Norman Weiner]]

:I found this page: [[en:Wikipedia:TeX_markup]] that details how to write up the code for equations if that helps ...

==Spanish==
I was thinking about the differences between the main varieties of Spanish. In Argentina tú is replaced by vos, and in Spain there is a special plural tú, which is vosotros, and both persons have different verb endings.

OTOH, there are other differences in the language. One of them (probably the best known) is coger (&quot;to take&quot; in Spain, &quot;to f***&quot; in Mexico). As it's used all the time in Spain it may be useful to add it to the list of verbs, but of course a warning is necessary.

What do you think about this? [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 21:02, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:The differences between Spanish in one place from another could be the subject of a chapter or appendix, such as [[Spanish/Slang]] (slang). As for the word you mention, I think that it can be used in an unoffensive context in Mexico although also as an offensive word.

The man you posted the comment to was the same Daniel Canaris you emailed. You needn't of called me 'sir'. Since you seem to be well versed in grammatical concepts (you contribute to the Spanish and English page) it will be greatly appreciated if you can offer me any tips on explaining grammatical concepts and editing my pages, even if you do not know Latin. Thanks :)

:Yeah, I kind of guessed that you were one in the same. I'll look over the pages to see what I can do. Thanks again for your excellent work. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

==Merit badges==
No, I'm not trying to earn any merit badges.  I'm an adult leader these days, and can't earn any anymore.  I'm hoping to develop a resource for scouts or merit badge counselors to use. Nobody can actually earn a merit badge with Wikibooks, but we can provide useful information to help. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 16:42, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
:It could make sense for a scout to write a book about something for his Eagle Scout project, couldn't it? That would be as helpful as many current projects, and fit a lower budget. Who will be the first? Who? - [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
::As I read the requirements, I don't think that would be accecptable.  An Eagle project is designed to benefit the whole community, not just the scouting community.  While I agree it would be a good project for scouts to undertake, I can't see [[en:Santa Clara County Council|my council]]'s advancement chair approving such an eagle project. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:31, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::A wikibook about Merit Badges would benefit only scouts, but a wikibook about [[First Aid]] or [[Underwater Basket Weaving]] could potentially benefit the whole community, so could be the subject of an Eagle project, no? BTW this is true that I am a steward now? Where was it announced? What does that mean for me? Thanks - [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:::I didn't think about it that way.  hrmm, yes, that might work.  Especially if he can demonstrate leadership by recruiting and organizing other editors, say from his troop and district, and then developed some type of publicity plan to let people know about the book.

:::About the steward election, I nominated you for that before you went to Mexico, but it was called &quot;developer access&quot; back then.  Basically, you now have the ability to make and remove sysops on all wikimedia projects.  The basic idea is that the stewards will help guide and patrol the new, smaller projects until they are large enough and established enough to govern themselves.  I don't know where the announcement was made, but the vote was at [[meta:Developer access]]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:57, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::::&lt;butting in after the fact&gt;The barrier to writing a module on earning a merit badge or three is that only one writer, the eagle candidate, writes.  An eagle project has to involve the candidate leading a group of people to complete a project of service to the community.  That it only helps the Boy Scout community is of no relevance -- people do eagle projects at Boy Scout camps and other Scouting-specific locations frequently.

I live in Spain. I found this website and try to collaborate, but I do not understand how can I do it. It is very strange for me. If you need a grammar... you buy it... If you need a word... you buy a dictionary...

How can I help you. I would like to write in Spanish. News. Articles. 

Best Regards,

:Hola Juani, gracis por tu interés en el sitio. Es fácil aprender a usar el sitio, es como Wikipedia pero Wikibooks tiene la meta de crear libros de texto en lugar de un diccionario o enciclopedia.

Congratulations to you, Karl, on your election to the position of Steward.  You've done a fantastic job on Wikibooks (where I'm just a lurker at present, but where I hope to make a contribution later), and I'm glad to see that your valuable skills are now of benefit to the Wikimedia project as a whole.

==Vocabulary Project==
Hi there,
I saw you contributed to the Spanish wikibook, so I thought it might be of interest to you that I have written a [http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444e1w/vokeng.htm program for learning vocabulary]. I think for this purpose a program is more useful than a website, although maybe one day we can make this a java project. 
It is based on the belief that it is best to learn foreign words by learning typical sentences. The program can also be used for learning other stuff that works with the question/answer scheme, e.g. the theory for the driving licence or anatomy. Unfortunately I wrote it in qbasic, which can be downloaded [http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/tool_s/1.0/W95/EN-US/olddos.exe here]. It also uses images and sound files for alternation and in order to work on the pronunciation. Let me know what you think about it. I currently have files in English, French (with sound), Spanish, and Portuguese. Catalan is in the planning. Corrections or additions are very welcome. The easiest thing to start with for improvements would be adding new vocabulary, sound files or images. A guide to the program will follow soon, although I think it is rather self-explanatory. In the long run the program should be rewritten in a better language. Afterwards it should be possible to switch languages within the program. Up to now there is a different version of the program for each language. [[User:Get-back-world-respect|Get-back-world-respect]] 23:21, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)
:That sounds like a great idea .. I have not been able to check it out yet b/c I use only my Mac at home and administrator-locked-down computers at the library etc. As far as I know at the moment the Wiki software is limited in its capability to do some things but with time more things should be possible. I'd work on an open source project apart from Wikibooks if it would contribute to the advancement of free language learning .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:43, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)
::Great, thank you very much for your interest. As I have already done some work on catalan here it will be easy to add to the program as well. Maybe the project could once be rewritten in Java and connected to something like wiki. I hope you will be able to try the program soon. [[User:Get-back-world-respect|Get-back-world-respect]] 23:05, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)
:::In the meantime, winamp and Stefan Peichl (LxPic) allowed me to include their programs in the package. Some guys from here suggested to rewrite the program in python. I do not know that language but I think this should become independent of Microsoft. [[User:Get-back-world-respect|Get-back-world-respect]] 21:28, 16 May 2004 (UTC)

==Interlanguage links==
Karl, I saw your edit summary at the cookbook.  I'm not sure, but I think the automatic interlanguage links seen at the top of wikipedia pages are a feature that have been turned off here.  I think the system needs every language to have its own domain name, like en.wikipedia.org, fr.wikipedia.org, ect.  Here, all languages are lumped together in one domain name, so it doesn't work.  More reason to push each language having its own domain, right? :) [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 20:48, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)

==Hola Karl==
Gracias por la bienvenida, me alegro de tener un compañero que habla español porque lo cierto es que no sé por donde empezar. Son tantas cosas sin hacer,... :) Quizá me puedes dar alguna idea. Vengo de la wikipedia en español.

:Wikibooks funciona basicamente igual que Wikipedia, solamente que la idea es escribir libros entonces es una forma mas organizada. Tambien el projecto esta en su infancia todavia entonces puedes exprimentar mas facilmente sin que nadie te haga problemas. Pero en terminos del funcionamento tecnico del sitio creo que es igual. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

==Clearing Wikibooks growth impediments==
Karl, Wikibooks is a marvelous undertaking.  But I am having a hard time buying into it because of the enormous disincentive to contributing I see as compared to Wikipedia.

== Gospel of John ==

Karl, I was wondering if you had any specific scope for the Gospel of John study guide?  Or were you just going to wait and see what happened when people of varying beliefs start posting? It could be quite interesting, probably frustrating, but hopefully something edifying will come out it. Thanks for the work, and you'll probably see me rooting around in this book. :-) [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 15:51, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:Hey Liblamb, my goal for the book is to start a free collaborative commentary of the whole Bible, mainly for the edification of believers but also for the evangelization of those who do not have faith in Christ. This maay be in conflict with the NPOV policy that is currently in use. Over time we will see how things work out and how to make exceptions or modifications for optimum use. Please feel free to contribute or modify anything there, I don't have any kind of advanced studies and am no expert. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 18:22, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:::&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Hope&lt;/font&gt; you get this. Planting mustard seeds. Take a look at [[Christianity]]. This was an abandoned book when I found it. Maybe my organization of the page defies category, but John 2 is up for deletion and could be deleted due to apathy. My three (4 if you count Uncle G, I took that as don't change Chapter 2, good enough) contributors haven't signed their names, but all made a difference. The other roving ambassadors could not delete Christianity evidently, just the unique Testament component. I think it would set a bad precedent to delete one chapter of a book, any book and especially the Bible, when the numbering or name system involved would be crippled when more contributors come on board. If a decent translation does not qualify as a book, I would respect your decision. I started the same book under annotated [[The New Testament]] while awaiting the decision. I can leave Christianity the way I found it. An Anglican priest is helping me with the project at [http://religion.wikicities.com/wiki/User:Athrash Wikicities], maybe the whole thing belongs there.

== Promoting free textbooks, how to change the world ==

Dear Karl (and anyone else),

This is great!  I am so happy to find Wikibooks, and to see it growing!  The down side is the way I found it:  After having a attending the &quot;home and school club&quot; (modern PTA) meeting for my son's elementary school and seeing the uphill battle of their fund-raising, I started thinking hard about how to cut costs in schools.  Something that floated to the surface rather quickly was the textbooks - textbooks are not cheap.  I very quickly thought, Open Source!  Open source textbooks, compiled online by teachers, students, whoever, is the answer.  Of course, getting these into elementary schools would be difficult (politics), but one might be able to break into community colleges and private schools...

So, as with any idea, I started searching the web to see if someone was already doing it.  There's the down side of Wikibooks - it took me a little while to find on Google (searching on &quot;free textbook&quot; and &quot;free college textbooks&quot; - I ended up here following a blog link).

So, here's the point of my writing:  This is a great project!  We can change the world!  Make education more affordable for everyone!  We need to promote the heck out of this!!!  But is what I'm describing part of Wikibooks' current vision?  If so, what promotion activities are underway already?  Who is the top Wikibooks Evangelist?  I want to help!  And if not, who do I have to convince?  Since printed books will be a staple of educational institutions for a long time to come (until every student has a laptop), a long term goal would be to either publish printed docs through a nonprofit, or minimally make Wikibooks available (which they sort of are already, through the copyleft license) for printing - but I think there will need to be a way to readily download whole books (as PDFs perhaps).

P.S.  I have just found the discussion on the main page, and believe that to also be an appropriate place for this discusion, so I am cross-posting.
:Hi Aerik and Hi Karl. Ijust wanted to let you know that the wikimedia foundation has  just received a grant from the Beck Foundation to produce 48 page booklets for children aged 7 to 12. These booklets would be very inexpensive, as wikmedia is not interested in making a profit, so the cost is to cover the cost of printing only. Developement of these books will naturally occur at wikibooks. Anyonw who is interested in this project should come to [[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikijunior wikijunior]] where we are discussing a number things before to cracking on with the first topic.

I am the most likely Wikibooks evangelist although I am living in Mexico right now and don't have constant access to the Internet (sorry for taking a bit to respond). Any ideas you have on how to promote the site are very welcome. I would love for the materials we develop here to be used at all levels of education, and motivate educators to dontate their materials and efforts here as well.

==California Standards==
Okay, here I go:

1.  I really have to say I'm not a fan of changing back the standards.  The California standard isn't very good.  The AP standard is approved by a much broader range of people.  The use of the California standard is a problem regionally also because newbies will think it's a regional project.  I don't mean to discourage contribution, but the AP standard is used elsewhere, such as in the European and U.S. history projects with success (also I changed the project out of the title for simplicity and I kind of kept the other ones as a kind of guiding hand -- see [[World History]], but honestly, I don't care if the project part is eliminated altogether).  And  furthermore, if there are so many willing contributors, where are they?  You are wasting my time by saying that these experts won't contribute under the AP World History standard (which I made the title up but it is the standard for AP World History) and anyway, ''what kind of &quot;experts&quot; don't know what AP is?  

2.  There have been no edits for almost 4 months by anyone but me.  It is ridiculous to demand that I bow to the demands of people who do not put forth any contribution for so long.  I will not simply start again from scratch.  I kept most the original articles and structure anyway, just changed the standard, and the California one isn't very good.  It's an overly simplistic and western-centered one.

3. I will be very surprised if we go with the California standard and  we see these &quot;expert's&quot; contributions pan out-you of all people must see that people lose focus after a while and abandon projects, like this one's former contributors.  I doubt very highly that you will see anyone doing anything substantial for free after such a reversion. (And also, anyone can just copy and paste their research paper into the project anyway).  I am avidly adding free material, and I welcome help, but what on earth is wrong with the AP standard anyway?  I don't know a soul who after even a casual glance at both would support the California (standard).  Also, since Wikibooks is so limited in its contributors anyway, we need to be accepting of other peoples ideas, and honestly the standards thing amounts to a bunch of bull anyway.  People are going to add what they want and ignore such things in the first place.  Very few of our projects have standards anyway.

4.  As for the parallel namespaces idea, there seems to be little point in such a duplication of effort and I oppose it even if I have to bow to these peoples' (whoever they are, it is not clear to me) wishes.  Also, I did come back and add to this comment, so I hope we don't cause misunderstandings with each other, and I apologize for the sloppy structure.  Yours, kindly--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 03:10, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Also, you'll note that I changed the standards on November 14, and actually it was a week before that, so you'll see that it took over a month for any of these &quot;contributors&quot; to notice the change anyway :(.  I hope you weigh this fact in your opinion of the merit of the statement that these people are just enthusiastically waiting to contribute.  My personal opinion is that it is a lie designed to get you on the side of reverting the standards, but I may be making a big error in judgement.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 03:29, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Naryathegreat, of course I understand that you are upset. Please try to overcome your emotion and remain polite, as I am sure that we can come to a conclusion that is convenient to everyone involved. Thankfully the wiki system makes reverts and changes relatively painless ... One of the first people to offer his help to the Wikibooks project is someone who has worked in the textbook industry for almost twenty years and has started his own not-for-profit with the goal of bringing open-content textbooks to the community, beginning in his native California. He in fact aggrees with you that the AP standards are superior, but as the person who originally started the World History Project as a trial is understandably upset to feel that other people have come in and taken over the project and changed the rules that were governing it.

I don't accuse you of breaking any rule, of course you put up notice of the proposed change of standards and gave time for any objectives to be brought forward, and neither he nor I objected at the time. I didn't know what he had in mind and I am living in Mexico right now with limited Internet access and am less active on the site for the moment. 

What I am asking is for your understanding and help to divide the project into two distinct books, one that follows the line that this individual started, and another that follows the direction and the edits that you have contributed.

For the moment I have to act as the representative for this person, who is on the verge of leaving Wikibooks/Wikipedia permanently and advising all of his many high-level contacts of the very negative experience he has had trying to get a textbook together on Wikibooks. This would be a big blow to Wikibooks and I believe to open source textbooks in general. 

All he wants is a place for his team of paid, professional textbook-writing history experts to continue the stub of a book that was begun on the World History Project page time back. At the moment these people were so enraged at the abandonment of the original standard that they refuse to continue with the project. I hope to negotiate with them to convince them to continue.

Narythegreat, I need your help. You have the power in your hands to help make this project and the whole site a greater success that will be used in actual classrooms, or to make things more difficult and set the whole site back. You of course are free to choose your course of action. And helping me does not mean that any of your changes have to be lost, because my plan is to make two books, one for each standard.

Please let me know what you think.
Karl

Karl, I understand your position and his.  I tend to agree that it is good to have the contributions of these colleagues of his, but I also think that two seperate World History books is a wasted effort.  It is hard for me to say that we should duplicate the project and continue to work on one while another receives contributions.  I would also like to know why these colleagues of his only like the California standard, which I understand from his point of view is necessary, and it's not a complaint, but I don't understand their concerns.  Also, I don't think being the only person to work on a project for four months qualifies as &quot;taking it over&quot;.

Also, is it possible for him to contact me directly?  I don't understand why he went to you first.  The only clue I had was an anonymous edit that deleted everything I had put into the project--which I propmptly reverted.  Yours, [[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 04:14, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Naryathegreat, they are all Californians and working to introduce open source textbooks in California. Thats why they want to use the Cali standards. When the book is mature we could make a derivative using other standards, but the folks who would work on it are only interested locally for the moment.

Email me your email through the site and I will forward it to him and maybe he could write you.

Thanks for your message! Talk to you later man,

== Wikibooks logo ==

Hi Karl,

mav told me that you designed the Wikibooks logo. I really like it a lot. Would you be interested in participating in the [[m:Wikinews/Logo|Wikinews logo contest]]? Also, could you add copyright information to [[m:Logos]]? As I understand it, the copyright for Wikimedia project logos should be transferred to the Foundation.--[[w:User:Eloquence|Eloquence]]

== Emergency Medicine ==

Hi,

Thanks kindly for your interest in the new [[Emergency Medicine|EM]] Wikibook. I'd really appreciate your involvement and help in the early phase. Particularly:

1. Making the *template* as attractive and functional as possible

2. Improving the way I've formatted the chapters (the chapters have to remain the same, but maybe the pages need to be moved or just the layout improved somewhat by someone who's done this before). I took all the empty chapters away and just left the section headings. Then I created a new page listing where chapters *can* go once someone has begun them.

3. I need a little tutoring about how to create tables, how to create dynamic footnotes/endnotes, how to include boilerplate/template text (text which appears on the bottom of every page in the textbook) without re-pasting it in every time.

:You can create links to boilerplate texts using the Template feature that is also used to create Tables of Contents. Create the page, Template:Boilerplate12, put your text there, and link to it by putting this code in your page: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:Boilerplate12}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; . Wherever you put that code, the text will come up in the page. Also, every time you modify that boilerplate text, the changes will come through to all of the pages containing the link.

:Dr. Lovett, I made a [[Template:EM|Emergency Medicine table of contents]] and first [[Template:EMDisclaimers|Emergency Med warnings and disclaimers boilerplate text page]] for you. 

4. Medical articles with an EM perspective are very needed!

Thanks,

Paris.

:I think it makes more sense to leave in the links to empty chapters, as this gives a clear direction to the next steps to take on the book, for other contributers.

== Books all jumbled together and not distinct ==

Can you fix this? Please do so, or find someone who can.

I've been working on the cookbook. Every recipie has a link to &quot;Catagories&quot;.
Oh my. I click on that, and I see...

* Abugida writing systems
* Ada 2005 feature
* Ada programming language
* Algebra
* Anthropology
* Arts

That's just the letter A. While algebra may be useful for modifying a recipie, it really does not belong in a cookbook. Catagories from unrelated wiki books should not be leaking into the cookbook. I suspect that the Ada programmers have no use for Albanian recipies, but they can always just go to the cookbook if they get hungry. They don't need to be tempted by delicious Argentine recipies while trying to learn about Ada 2005.

Catagories should work within the cookbook and ''only'' within the cookbook.

Strange non-cookbook stuff also leaks into the &quot;recent changes&quot; page. I also get it if I use the &quot;random module&quot; link, which really should be &quot;random recipie&quot; and &quot;random ingredient&quot;.

The only thing these wikis might reasonably share would be user accounts, and THAT is not working, at least between Wikipedia and the cookbook. Oh, the suffering. :-(

BTW, adding &quot;Cookbook:&quot; to all the links gets old fast. Because of this, and case-sensitivity being enabled, one is required to use the &quot;|&quot; to rename all links. This greatly detracts from the ease-of-use that wikis are known for. If the cookbook were more distinct, this prefix would not be needed.

I certainly do understand why things are the way they are. This does not change the simple fact that things are a great big mess.

The cookbook seriously does need a domain name for itself. Then some server-side bot can go through and rip out all the &quot;Cookbook:&quot; prefixes that are hurting usability.

The [[Special:Specialpages]] stuff is unusable too. For example, I look in the [[Special:Newimages|New Images gallery]] and see nothing about the cookbook. The cookbook gets drowned out by physics and biology. Everywhere I look, wiki features are unusable, with cookbook data being crowded out by unrelated stuff. Everywhere I look, there are links that take me to some generic place outside the cookbook. Even [[Main Page]] is misleading and wrong, and the reason why every cookbook recipe has to include an explicit link back to the main page of the cookbook.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:15, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:AlbertCalahan, I looked through the cookbook after reading your post and it looks like some great stuff going on there. I am not sure about making the [[Cookbook]] into its own domain, which would make things simpler for development. I think that if we can get enough people asking to have the subdomain feature enabled in the main Wikibooks wiki, maybe that would help the situation. Then, any pages in the cookbook linked from the main Cookbook page would just have to be /Brussels sprouts instead of Cookbook: Brussels sprouts, for example. Send an email to the textbook mailing list requesting the subdomain feature to be enabled, which I also did a couple of weeks ago. Not sure what else I can do beyond sympathize .... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 15:57, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::That is not a subdomain. A subdomain would be cookbook.wikibooks.org or similar. It's free, and can easily be switched over to a normal domain when someone sends in the $10 or so. The problem with /Fish is that the notation is backwards. Imagine an almost-UNIX system where usr/local/bin (no leading slash) and ./my-local-stuff (explicit &quot;./&quot;) are used. Imagine an almost-C++ language where Foo refers to the outside scope and ClassName::Foo must be used for the local scope. Wiki links ought to be just the text in most cases, so that when I write fish, I merely need to put it in double square brackets. (being case-insensitive is required for this, and also to help prevent duplicate work) The problem goes beyond naming too; remember that the special pages are not filtering out all the non-cookbook stuff.

Hi Karl, I have some specific concerns to share with someone with access to the actual coding behind Wikibooks- could you put me in contact with one?--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 01:46, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Please do something about [[User:Gumba gumba]] quickly.

He hit the main page, including templates and/or subtle changes to historical versions.
He's fast.

He also hit my user page and talk page. By the time you read this, probably your's too.

BTW, consider making me an admin so I could at least do a bit more. Probably a developer

== Organic Chemistry: Drawings ==

Karl,

You've done amazing work laying the foundations of the Organic Chemistry Wikibook.  I am eager to contribute, but I have a few questions:

1. What program were you using to create the clean, crisp molecule drawings as seen in the  [[Organic Chemistry/Haloalkanes|Haloalkanes / Alkyl Halides]] and [[Organic Chemistry/Alkanes and cycloalkanes/Cycloalkanes|Cycloalkanes]] chapters?  (some kind of chem-specific software, or just a drawing program?)

I'm a huge believer in visual consistency, so I ask because I would like to use the same style in drawings I plan to add to the book.  Could you send me the templates you are using (or really anything to start with would out help a lot.)

Cheers, [[User:Buxtor|Buxtor]] 18:05, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Thanks for the big compliments Buxor! I used Adobe Illustrator to create the initial images. I think what I did next was to take a screen cap or export or something, where I clipped the image and exported it for the web from Adobe Photoshop. Unfortunately those files are all in another country right now. I'll be up in a month or so and could send them to you. The main thing is to play with the line width I think, I don't know if there is any free software that can do the same thing. Best of luck and let me know if there is anything else I can do! BTW I don't know that much about organic, but took a course in it a year or two ago and got inspired to start a free textbook about it on Wikipedia, which was subsequently rejected, but as a restult we founded Wikibooks, with OChem as the first book started.--[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 01:43, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Book progress images ==

Hi! The team of Polish Wikibooks wants to put proper license tags in every image page. Could you put a license tag on xx% images? We need them to make our edition free of non-tagged and fair use images. Thanks in advance! [[User:Sblive|Sblive]] 14:42, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

== Transcendentalism Theology ==

Hi Karl. I've been in Germany for some time. I intended to do some editing on  Transcendentalism Theology &amp; noticed that it had been scheduled for deletion. Can I make corrections in order to avoid this? [[User:Kurt Kawohl|Kurt]]
:I think that some people are trying to delete all kinds of material. I think the problem might be that they want to institute the same Wikipedia policy here of the NPV, or neutral point of view. In my opinion books should be included on the site that are written from distinct points of view. However, the goal should be collaboration, or Wikibooks is just hosting. Your book is quite POV (oriented to one philosophical point of view), but given the topic, that only makes sense. However there are steps that we can take to make it more objective, such as stating &quot;transcendentalist philosphy states ...&quot;, phrasing things in terms that noone can disaggree with. BTW what are your goals with including your work here on the site, instead of just publishing or having it hosted on its own site? Thanks, --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 14:45, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

:My goal is to help build a library of wikibooks - free and open textbooks. Thanks for the advise; I will make the changes that you suggested. The notice that it had been scheduled for deletion was placed there by one person some time ago and I see no others agreeing with it, so can this notice be removed? Thanks again for your help, Karl. [[User:Kurt Kawohl|Kurt]]

== Proposal for policy overhaul ==

As the founder of Wikibooks, I thought you might be interested in the fact that I've started to think about changes to existing policy and project scope so that policies are more clearly defined (as suggested by [[User:Aya]], who claims existing policies to be ambiguous) and more open (as suggested by [[User:Robert Horning]] over the biography debacle).  I've made a post on textbook-l ([http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002415.html]) as a result, please reply to my talk page for feedback.

:In the VfD, you mentioned that you wanted to look over this book before it was deleted, and determine if the material there was salvagable. I am going through the VfD page, trying to clean up old business, and the vote is currently Keep:1, Delete:3, and the single keep vote says we should delete the blank stub pages accociated with this title.

You say on your userpage:
:''Designed stacked-books Wikibooks logo.''
Is this the current logo? [[User:Perl]] has made [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Miscellaneous_FAQ&amp;diff=352851&amp;oldid=313756 this edit]. Who designed what? [[User:Gerrit|Gerrit]] 19:55, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

I'm not sure what the other guys did to modify it, but the original Adobe Illustrator file was created by me on my old iMac, with the halo symbol and wikibooks words. I don't remember where the stacked books idea came from, maybe I took that stacked-book idea from one of the Wikipedia logos... Hope that helps...

== Recent edit to [[Template:Main Page introduction]] ==

The Main Page line &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Wikibooks:FAQ|FAQ]] | [[Main Page (table free)|Table-free]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; appears inside the &quot;Highlighted books&quot; box you created on [[Template:Main Page introduction]].  This appears to be unintended, but I don't know whether it's worth fixing.  On one hand it does not, at least currently, look bad.  On the other hand, the &quot;FAQ&quot; and &quot;Table-free&quot; links do not logically belong in the &quot;Highlighted books&quot; box, and it does affect the line breaks in the list of books.  At any rate, it's something to consider.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:20, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

:Really? On my Windows laptop (sorry!) those page elements show up outside the highlighted area. If it does not show up right on your computer you can play with the code to make it look better! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 01:29, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

The new template looks good. I could not edit the template so took the liberty of creating a page: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:PDF_Versions PDF Versions] to keep track of these.

One methane pic that I built a model for and everything I reincluded in [[Organic Chemistry]], another couple of public domain Civil War-era pics I dug up for the [[US History]] book I dunno why they got cut.

== Status of Wikibooks and my involvement + [[Organic Chemistry]] Wikibook ==

I got into a bit of a public disagreement with Jimmy Wales over the status of Wikibooks, and more importantly his involvement with the project.  I respect Jimmy and I think he has done some wonderful things in the past.  He is also a very good public face for the Wikimedia projects, and is doing some absolutely incredible PR work by traveling all over the world being a general goodwill ambassador and doing face to face meetings that are of critical importance.

My big objection is that he stopped by Wikibooks and saw only a mess of things, because we were still in the middle of trying to clean up quite a few problems that had been left alone in the past.  Jimbo was thinking more with the mentality of Wikipedia where articles are deleted at the drop of a hat and essentially wanted a few books removed that didn't seem to work out too well when he was doing his PR tours.  Most notably was the Jokebook and a book about Nudism, and he was also disappointed that some publicity came up over a Neo-Nazi propaganda book that was also here on Wikibooks.  Instead of trying to see what the admins and users who got up some effort to do cleanup were actually doing, he started to demand that these books be removed and granted himself adminship here on Wikibooks to help with removing those books.

My main argument was that if he wanted to start a VfD discussion on these books, he was certainly welcome, and that was an acceptable forum for that to happen.  Basically I said &quot;trust the community to get it right&quot;.  I still think that is true, and there is some strong relutance on the part of several board members to trust in the community concensus concept.  Instead Jimbo went and unilaterally deleted two of the three books, and only deleted the main &quot;front page&quot; of the book as well.  The rest of the modules for each book was still in place, just harder to get to.

BTW, each of the books he complained about went to a subsequent VfD and were deleted by the community without Jimbo doing anything directly.  His attitude about the content of them certainly influenced the opinion of what was said during the VfDs and significantly tipped the balance to remove that content.  The major after effect of this is a group of people have also come on since then with a more deletionist attitude to Wikibooks, notably with a significant effort to remove the Video Game guides (that appears to have failed or at least run out of steam).

Jimbo hasn't really been that active on Wikibooks lately, and the project has calmed down quite a bit in terms of mainly uncertainty over what was acceptable here and what was not.  His push toward textbooks instead of general non-fiction is an interesting approach, but I fail to see what general non-fiction non-textbooks are doing to Wikibooks that is damaging and indeed can bring in people to Wikibooks with skills that are needed even by textbook contributors.

I also issued a formal apology to Jimbo that was on Foundation-l, but I also feel that I have been shut out of any further involvement with the Wikimedia Foundation.  Perhaps I've stepped on too many toes.  That's OK for now, though, and I'm trying to do my part where I can here.

:First off, thank you for your complete reply to my questions.

:My philosophy leans to include the video game guides and other &quot;light&quot; or non-textbook material as well, although I respect Jimmy's organizational insight as well. As long as those books have a place to be developed I guess it's fine with me either way, and there could be benefit in a sharply defined focus.

:In fact, I have been thinking if it makes sense to divide Wikibooks by academic level, so that by subdomain or something all the materials will be for K-5, 6-8, 9-12, university level, adult vocational education, etc. But &quot;those wiser than me&quot; should be consulted to see if it makes sense to divide the current books by level later, after a critical mass of materials has already been developed, or do it now, before more work is done. If we were to to it right now, then a 3rd-grade teacher that wants to contribute could find a site that looked, smelled, and tasted like grade school, without the risk or confusion of age-inappropriate materials. Actually I'm thinking out loud and think I will suggest to Jimmy that he consult with Peter Drucker or someone who can give the wisest, most seasoned insight. What we should seek is what will follow tried principles, and not just what fits our own philosophies.

:I remember the example of Apple Computer, which back in the day apparently snubbed video game producers and said that the Mac would be for business use only, and it later bit them when that lucrative business was given to &quot;the competition.&quot; My personal philosophy would be to do everything and not turn anyone away, or at least give people a place to do what they want to do. I was originally turned away from Wikipedia when I started writing the [[Organic Chemistry]] textbook there, because &quot;Wikipedia is not a place for textbooks&quot;, but Jimmy very graciously helped us set up Wikibooks, to write textbooks here. 

:PS Sorry for the misunderstanding with Jimmy and the Wikimedia Foundation, but I would just guess that things should work out fine over time. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:47, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

==== Organic Chemistry Content ====

I consider this to be basically your baby and I'm not really going to care what you do to the content so much.  I saw that what is here is quite impressive as it is, and I created the &quot;print version&quot; based on what I saw was a good start in the various modules.  If there is content that is useful from Wikipedia, go for it and bring it in.  Keep in mind that it is going to be a fork of Wikipedia, but you should have some good judgement that way.

:It's not my baby or anything, and I am very grateful to those who have continued editing it. I am far from being an expert on the subject but would love for this to be a resource for other students and teachers of the subject. My fingers are in so many pots right now that there is no way for me to micro-manage anything.

I did a quick import of the Organic Chemistry Wikibook into Open Office to see how it might look and to perhaps do some preparation work before I made a PDF file out of the content.  Format changes (aka web to dead tree format in this case) does present some problems, and the MediaWiki software isn't always cooperative in terms of doing that sort of conversion.

Basically there is some heavy editing that needs to take place with this content.  Citing sources of information and in general making it &quot;sound&quot; consistant throughout the book.  There are at least five different writing styles, and these do sometimes clash in terms of making the content flow.  I also feel that there is some missing introductory material that might be useful in the beginning, although having as a prerequisite the [[General Chemistry]] Wikibook might be useful to point out as well.

The Appendix portion is really messed up, and some of that content perhaps should be moved to the main part of the Wikibook.  [[Organic Chemistry/Acetone peroxide synthesis]] in particular needs to find a better home.  I see it was moved to Wikibooks from Wikipedia, and has quite the interesting discussion on it, due to a high profile Wikipedia entry that has this module directly linked in a prominent location.  The [[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions]] group of pages is so complete that I would think it perhaps should be moved into the main-line part of the book as well.  It is practically its own Wikibook in its own right.

For some of this I wish I knew more about the topic.  I'm more of an engineer type myself, and familiar with electronics and software engineering principles.  This topic is really way out of my league, other than I happen to understand some of the basic chemistry terminology.  I still know enough that I can help with the navigation links and do some general page formatting, simply to give this book another shot in the arm to help make it more inviting and professional to somebody who knows the subject matter and may want to help contribute.  I hope I've done that at least with the material that is here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:19, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

::Re: the old [[Jokebook]].  I just restarted the page as essentially a soft redirect to the Lollerpedia, whose link in on the page here on Wikibooks.  I hope that doesn't get too many people upset over what I wrote there.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:01, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

For images like [[:Image:Martaplays.png]], maybe you could remember whether you drew the image yourself or obtained it from somewhere, then add a [[WB:ICT|copyright tag]].

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:45, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

:Thank you for your offer of help. [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] is experiencing the greatest problems at the moment. Although the vote is overwhelmingly in favour of enforcement the discussion makes it appear as if those who oppose are in the majority.

:[[Wikibooks:General voting rules]], proposed by Derbeth, also needs comment/support. It is the lack of any voting policy that has allowed so many proposed policies to be blocked. The losers in any vote can just claim that 100% consensus is required for a policy to be implemented!

==[[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]]==

This policy needs a few more people to take a look at it and vote. Any help would be most useful. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:25, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:47, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:S-orbital.png]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:S-orbital.png]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask them at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]]. Thank you. [[User:Jusjih|Jusjih]] 08:19, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

==OGG VS MP3==
I was reading your discussion regarding the differences between the two formats. While both are fairly popular, there is one main difference.  OGG is a free open source format, while MP3 is licsenced, so in this case, OGG would be the better choice for a wiki project.

== Welcome back! ==

The founder of Wikibooks is back!  I have to be honest, I didn't think you'd return here since you were last seen in October 2008; that's even before I came across this site myself.  That's quite some time to be gone.  There have been quite a few extensions installed and you may notice several new people and several that are missing.  Like the new main page?  Anything else tickle your fancy or give you pause?  I'm sure others would be interested in any comments you decide to write in the reading room and most of us could use an introduction as most are unfamiliar with Wikibooks' early history and yourself.  I'm not quite sure where you're going with [[Brain Rules for Baby]], else I'd see what I could do to help.  Glad to see you around again. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:53, 4 March 2011 (UTC)

==What functions are and how are they described ==

'''Note: This is an attempt at a rewrite of &quot;Classical understanding of functions&quot;. If others approve, consider deleting that section.'''

Whenever one quantity uniquely determines the value of another quantity, we have a function.

{  ---- comments ------

ie X uniquely determines Y
but Y is not uniquely determined by X

Let set X consists of x's and set Y consists of y's
 
two x's can have same y
ie one y can be determined by two x's 

but one x cannot have two y's

You can  think of a ''function'' as a kind of machine. You feed the machine raw materials, and the machine changes the raw materials into a finished product. 

{{ExampleRobox|theme=2|title=A function in everyday life}}
Think about dropping a ball from a bridge. At each moment in time, the ball is a 
height above the ground. The height of the ball is a function of time. It was the 
job of physicists to come up with a formula for this function. This type of function 
is called  ''real-valued'' since the &quot;finished product&quot; is a number (or, more specifically, a real number).
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|theme=2|title=A function in everyday life  (Preview of Multivariable Calculus)}}
Think about a wind storm. At different places, the wind can be blowing in different directions with different intensities. The direction and intensity of the wind can be thought of as a function of position. This is a function of two real variables (a location is described by two values - an  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) which results in a vector (which is something that  can be used to hold a direction and an intensity). These functions are studied in multivariable calculus (which is usually studied after a one year college level calculus course).This a vector-valued  function of two real variables.
{{Robox/Close}}

We will be looking at real-valued functions until studying multivariable calculus.
Think of a real-valued function as an ''input-output machine''; you give the function an input, and it 
gives you an output which is a number (more specifically, a real number). 
For example, the squaring function takes the input 4 and 
gives the output value 16.  The same squaring function takes the input 
-1 and gives the output value 1.

There are many ways which people describe functions. In the examples above, a verbal
descriptions is given (the height of the ball above the earth as a function of time).
Here is a list of ways to describe functions. The top three listed approaches
to describing functions are the most popular and you could skip the rest if you 
like.

#A function is given a name (such as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) and a formula for the function is also given. For example, &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt; describes a function. We refer to the input as the '''argument''' of the function (or the '''independent variable'''), and to the output as the '''value''' of the function at the given argument. 
#A function is described using an equation and two variables. One variable is for the input of the function and one is for the output of the function. The variable for the input is called the '''independent variable'''. The variable for the output is called the '''dependent variable'''. For example, &lt;math&gt; y = 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt; describes a function. The dependent variable appears by itself on the left hand side of equal sign.
#A verbal description of the function.

When a function is given a name (like in number 1 above), the name of the function is usually
a single letter of the alphabet (such as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;). Some functions
whose names are multiple letters (like the sine function &lt;math&gt;y=sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{ExampleRobox|theme=2|title=Plugging a value into a function}}
If we write &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3x+2 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then we know that

*The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*To evaluate the function at a certain number, replace the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with that number.
*Replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with that number in the right side of the function will produce the function's output for that certain input.
*In English, the definition of &lt;math&gt;f \ &lt;/math&gt; is interpreted, &quot;Given a number, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; will return ''two more than the triple of that number''.&quot;

How would we know the value of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at 3?
We would have the following three thoughts:

#&lt;math&gt;f(3) = 3(3) + 2&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; 3(3) + 2 = 9 + 2&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;9+2=11&lt;/math&gt;
and we would write

&lt;math&gt;f(3) = 3(3)+2 = 9+2 = 11&lt;/math&gt;.

The value of &lt;math&gt;f \ &lt;/math&gt; at 3 is 11.

Note that &lt;math&gt;f(3) \ &lt;/math&gt; means the value of the dependent variable when &lt;math&gt;x \ &lt;/math&gt; takes on the value of 3. So we see that the number ''11'' is the output of the function when we give the number ''3'' as the input. 
People often summarize the work above by writing 
&quot;the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at three is eleven&quot;, or simply &quot;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of three equals eleven&quot;.
{{Robox/Close}}

==Classical understanding of functions==
To provide the classical understanding of functions, think of a ''function'' as a kind of machine. You feed the machine raw materials, and the machine changes the raw materials into a finished product based on a specific set of instructions. The kinds of functions we consider here, for the most part, take in a real number, change it in a formulaic way, and give out a real number (possibly the same as the one it took in).  Think of this as an ''input-output machine''; you give the function an input, and it gives you an output. For example, the squaring function takes the input 4 and gives the output value 16.  The same squaring function takes the input &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and gives the output value 1.

A function is usually written as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, or something similar - although it doesn't have to be. A function is always defined as &quot;of a variable&quot; which tells us what to replace in the formula for the function. 

For example, &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3x+2 \ &lt;/math&gt; tells us:

*The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*To evaluate the function at a certain number, replace the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with that number.
*Replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with that number in the right side of the function will produce the function's output for that certain input.
*In English, the definition of &lt;math&gt;f \ &lt;/math&gt; is interpreted, &quot;Given a number, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; will return ''two more than the triple of that number''.&quot;

Thus, if we want to know the value (or output) of the function at 3: 

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3x+2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(3) = 3(3)+2 \ &lt;/math&gt; We evaluate the function at &lt;math&gt;x = 3&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;f(3) = 9+2 = 11 \ &lt;/math&gt; The value of &lt;math&gt;f \ &lt;/math&gt; at 3 is 11.

See? It's easy!

Note that &lt;math&gt;f(3) \ &lt;/math&gt; means the value of the dependent variable when &lt;math&gt;x \ &lt;/math&gt; takes on the value of 3. So we see that the number ''11'' is the output of the function when we give the number ''3'' as the input. We refer to the input as the '''argument''' of the function (or the '''independent variable'''), and to the output as the '''value''' of the function at the given argument (or the '''dependent variable'''). A good way to think of it is the dependent variable &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ &lt;/math&gt; 'depends' on the value of the independent variable &lt;math&gt;x \ &lt;/math&gt;.  This is read as &quot;the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at three is eleven&quot;, or simply &quot;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of three equals eleven&quot;.

==Notation==
Functions are used so much that there is a special notation for them. The notation is somewhat ambiguous, so familiarity with it is important in order to understand the intention of an equation or formula.

Though there are no strict rules for naming a function, it is standard practice to use the letters &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; to denote functions, and the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to denote an independent variable. &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is used for both dependent and independent variables.

When discussing or working with a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, it's important to know not only the function, but also its independent variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, when referring to a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, you usually do not write &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, but instead &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  The function is now referred to as &quot;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.  The name of the function is adjacent to the independent variable (in parentheses).  This is useful for indicating the value of the function at a particular value of the independent variable.  For instance, if

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=7x+1\,&lt;/math&gt;,

and if we want to use the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, then we would substitute 2 for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; on both sides of the definition above and write

:&lt;math&gt;f(2)=7(2)+1=14+1=15\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- The following sentence is confusing. The right side of the equation places a number inside the parens, in order to run the function with that variable. The number inside the parens IS being multiplied by the number next to it. YET the sentence below says the parens &quot;can be misinterpreted as multiplication.&quot; Misinterpreted as being the thing that they ARE? I'm not qualified to change much here (not being a good math student; I appreciate the fact that the raw material is here, but the text needs work). --&gt;

This notation is more informative than leaving off the independent variable and writing simply '&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;', but can be ambiguous since the parentheses can be misinterpreted as multiplication.

==Modern understanding of functions==
The formal definition of a function states that a function is actually a ''rule'' that associates elements of one set called the ''domain'' of the function, with the elements of another set called the ''range'' of the function. For each value we select from the domain of the function, there exists exactly one corresponding element in the range of the function. The definition of the function tells us which element in the range corresponds to the element we picked from the domain. Classically, the element picked from the domain is pictured as something that is fed into the function and the corresponding element in the range is pictured as the output. Since we &quot;pick&quot; the element in the domain whose corresponding element in the range we want to find, we have control over what element we pick and hence this element is also known as the &quot;independent variable&quot;. The element mapped in the range is beyond our control and is &quot;mapped to&quot; by the function. This element is hence also known as the &quot;dependent variable&quot;, for it depends on which independent variable we pick. Since the elementary idea of functions is better understood from the classical viewpoint, we shall use it hereafter. However, it is still important to remember the correct definition of functions  at all times.

To make it simple, for the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, all of the possible &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; values constitute the domain, and all of the values &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; on the x-y plane) constitute the range.

==Remarks==
The following arise as a direct consequence of the definition of functions:
#By definition, for each &quot;input&quot; a function returns only one &quot;output&quot;, corresponding to that input. While the same output may correspond to more than one input, one input cannot correspond to more than one output. This is expressed graphically as the ''vertical line test'': a line drawn parallel to the axis of the dependent variable (normally vertical) will intersect the graph of a function only once. However, a line drawn parallel to the axis of the independent variable (normally horizontal) may intersect the graph of a function as many times as it likes. Equivalently, this has an algebraic (or formula-based) interpretation.  We can always say if &lt;math&gt; a = b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(a) = f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, but if we only know that  &lt;math&gt;f(a) = f(b)&lt;/math&gt; then we can't be sure that  &lt;math&gt;a= b&lt;/math&gt;. 
#Each function has a set of values, the function's ''domain'', which it can accept as input. Perhaps this set is all positive real numbers; perhaps it is the set {pork, mutton, beef}. This set must be implicitly/explicitly defined in the definition of the function. You cannot feed the function an element that isn't in the domain, as the function is not defined for that input element.
#Each function has a set of values, the function's ''range'', which it can output. This may be the set of real numbers. It may be the set of positive integers or even the set {0,1}. This set, too, must be implicitly/explicitly defined in the definition of the function.

[[Image:Vertlinetest.png|thumb|This is an example of an expression which fails the vertical line test.]]

==The vertical line test==
The vertical line test, mentioned in the preceding paragraph, is a systematic test to find out if an equation involving &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can serve as a function (with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the independent variable and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; the dependent variable).  Simply graph the equation and draw a vertical line through each point of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis. If any vertical line ever touches the graph at more than one point, then the equation is not a function; if the line always touches at most one point of the graph, then the equation is a function.

(There are a lot of useful curves, like circles, that aren't functions (see picture).  Some people call these graphs with multiple intercepts, like our circle, &quot;multi-valued functions&quot;; they would refer to our &quot;functions&quot; as &quot;single-valued functions&quot;.)

==Important functions==

|Constant function
|&lt;math&gt;f(x)=c\,&lt;/math&gt;

:Gives 1 if input is positive, -1 if input is negative.  Note that the function only accepts negative and positive numbers, not &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  Mathematics describes this condition by saying &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is not in the domain of the function.

&lt;math&gt;g(z)=z^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
:Exactly the same function, rewritten with a different independent variable. This is perfectly legal and sometimes done to prevent confusion (e.g. when there are already too many uses of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the same paragraph.)

|&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\left\{\begin{matrix}5^{x^2},&amp;\mbox{if }x&gt;0\\0,&amp;\mbox{if }x\le0\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
:Note that we can define a function by a totally arbitrary rule.  Such functions are called piecewise functions.

It is possible to replace the independent variable with any mathematical expression, not just a number.  For instance, if the independent variable is itself a function of another variable, then it could be replaced with that function.  This is called composition, and is discussed later.

==Manipulating functions==

===Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division of functions===
For two real-valued functions, we can add the functions, multiply the functions, 
raised to a power, etc.   

{{ExampleRobox|theme=2|title=Example:  Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing functions which do not have a name}}
If we add the functions &lt;math&gt;y = 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt;.


If we subtract &lt;math&gt;y = 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;y =x^2 - (3 x + 2)&lt;/math&gt;. We can also write this as &lt;math&gt;y=x^2-3x-2&lt;/math&gt;.


If we multiply the function &lt;math&gt;y = 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt; and the function &lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;y = (3 x + 2) x^2&lt;/math&gt;. We can also write this as &lt;math&gt;y=3x^3 + 2 x^2&lt;/math&gt;.


If we divide the function &lt;math&gt;y = 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt; by the function &lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt;,
we obtain &lt;math&gt;y = (3 x + 2)/ x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

If a math problem wants you to add two functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, there are 
two ways that the problem will likely be worded:

# If you are told that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt;, that &lt;math&gt;g(x)  = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, that &lt;math&gt;h(x) = f(x)+g(x)&lt;/math&gt; and asked about &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, then you are being asked to add two functions. Your answer would be  &lt;math&gt;h(x) = x^2 + 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt;.
# If you are told that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt;, that &lt;math&gt;g(x)  = x^2&lt;/math&gt; and you are asked about &lt;math&gt;f+g&lt;/math&gt;, then you are being asked to add two functions. The addition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;f+g&lt;/math&gt;. Your answer would be &lt;math&gt;(f+g)(x) = x^2 + 3 x + 2&lt;/math&gt;.

Similar statements can be made for subtraction, multiplication and division.

{{ExampleRobox|theme=2|title=Example:  Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing functions which do have a name}}
Let  &lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x+2\,&lt;/math&gt; and:&lt;math&gt;g(x)=x^2\,&lt;/math&gt;. Let's add, subtract, multiply and divide.


:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(f+g)(x)
    &amp;= f(x)+g(x)\\
    &amp;= (3x+2)+(x^2)\\
    &amp;= x^2+3x+2\,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;,


:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(f-g)(x)
    &amp;= f(x)-g(x)\\
    &amp;= (3x+2)-(x^2)\\
    &amp;= -x^2+3x+2\,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;,


:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 (f\times g)(x)
          &amp;= f(x)\times g(x)\\
          &amp;= (3x+2)\times(x^2)\\
          &amp;= 3x^3+2x^2\,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;,


:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(x)
            &amp;= \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\
            &amp;= \frac{3x+2}{x^2}\\
            &amp;= \frac{3}{x}+\frac{2}{x^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Composition of functions===
We begin with a fun (and not too complicated) application of composition of 
functions before we talk about what composition of functions is.

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example:  Dropping a ball}}
If we drop a ball from a bridge which is 20 meters above the ground, then 
the height of our ball above the earth is a function of time.
The physicists tell us that if we measure time in seconds and distance in meters,
then the formula for height in terms of time 
is &lt;math&gt;h = -4.9t^2 + 20&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose we are tracking the 
ball with a camera and always want the ball to be in the center of our
picture. Suppose we have &lt;math&gt;\theta=f(h)&lt;/math&gt;
The angle will depend upon the height of the ball above
the ground and the height above the ground depends upon
time. So the angle will depend upon time. This can be written
as &lt;math&gt;\theta = f(-4.9t^2 + 20)&lt;/math&gt;.
We replace &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; with what it is equal to.
This is the essence of composition.
{{Robox/Close}}

Composition of functions is another way to combine functions which is different from addition,
subtraction, multiplication or division.  


The value of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; depends upon the value of another variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;;  however, that variable could be equal to another function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, so its value depends on the value of a third variable.  If this is the case, then the first variable is a function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; of the third variable;  this function (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;) is called the '''composition''' of the other two functions (&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;).  

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example:  Composing two functions}}
Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x+2\,&lt;/math&gt; and:&lt;math&gt;g(x)=x^2\,&lt;/math&gt;. The composition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;
is read  as either &quot;f composed with g&quot; or &quot;f of g of x.&quot; 

Let 

&lt;math&gt;h(x) = f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; 

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
h(x) &amp;= f(g(x))\\
     &amp;= f(x^2)\\
     &amp;= 3(x^2)+2\\
     &amp;= 3x^2+2\,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

Sometimes a math problem asks you compute &lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)(x)&lt;/math&gt;
when they want you to compute &lt;math&gt;f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;,

Here, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the composition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and 
we write &lt;math&gt;h=f\circ g&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that composition is not commutative:

:&lt;math&gt;f(g(x))=3x^2+2\,&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g(f(x)) &amp;= g(3x + 2)\\
        &amp;= (3x + 2)^2\\
        &amp;= 9x^2+12x+4\, .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:so &lt;math&gt;f(g(x))\ne g(f(x))\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Composition of functions is very common, mainly because functions themselves are common.  For instance, squaring and sine are both functions:


:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{square}(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sine}(x)=\sin x&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, the expression &lt;math&gt;\sin^2x&lt;/math&gt; is a composition of functions:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\sin^2x&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{square}(\sin x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{square}( \operatorname{sine}(x))&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

(Note that this is ''not'' the same as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sine}(\operatorname{square}(x))=\sin x^2&lt;/math&gt;.)
Since the function sine equals &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=\pi/6&lt;/math&gt;,


:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{square}(\operatorname{sine}(\pi/6))= \operatorname{square}(1/2)&lt;/math&gt;.


Since the function square equals &lt;math&gt;1/4&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=\pi/6&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 \pi/6=\operatorname{square}(\operatorname{sine}(\pi/6))=\operatorname{square}(1/2)
=1/4&lt;/math&gt;.

===Transformations===
Transformations are a type of function manipulation that are very common. They consist of multiplying, dividing, adding or subtracting constants to either the input or the output. Multiplying by a constant is called '''dilation''' and adding a constant is called '''translation'''. Here are a few examples:

:&lt;math&gt;f(2\times x) \,&lt;/math&gt; Dilation
:&lt;math&gt;f(x+2)\,&lt;/math&gt; Translation
:&lt;math&gt;2\times f(x) \,&lt;/math&gt; Dilation
:&lt;math&gt;2+f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; Translation

[[image:4_function_translations.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Examples of horizontal and vertical translations]]
[[image:4_function_dilations.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Examples of horizontal and vertical dilations]]
Translations and dilations can be either horizontal or vertical. Examples of both vertical and horizontal translations can be seen at right. The red graphs represent functions in their 'original' state, the solid blue graphs have been translated (shifted) horizontally, and the dashed graphs have been translated vertically.

Dilations are demonstrated in a similar fashion. The function

:&lt;math&gt;f(2\times x) \,&lt;/math&gt;

has had its input doubled. One way to think about this is that now any change in the input will be doubled. If I add one to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, I add two to the input of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, so it will now change twice as quickly. Thus, this is a horizontal dilation by '''&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;''' because the distance to the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axis has been '''halved'''. A vertical dilation, such as
:&lt;math&gt;2\times f(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;
is slightly more straightforward. In this case, you double the output of the function. The output represents the distance from the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis, so in effect, you have made the graph of the function 'taller'. Here are a few basic examples where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is any positive constant:

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|Original graph
|&lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|Rotation about origin
|&lt;math&gt;-f(-x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Horizontal translation by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; units '''left'''
|&lt;math&gt;f(x+a)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|Horizontal translation by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; units '''right'''
|&lt;math&gt;f(x-a)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Horizontal dilation by a factor of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;f(x\times \frac{1}{a}) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|Vertical dilation by a factor of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a\times f(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Vertical translation by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; units '''down'''
|&lt;math&gt;f(x)-a\,&lt;/math&gt;
|Vertical translation by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; units '''up'''
|&lt;math&gt;f(x)+a\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Reflection about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis
|&lt;math&gt;-f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|Reflection about &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axis
|&lt;math&gt;f(-x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Domain and Range==
===Domain===
[[Image:Domainofsemicirclefunction.png|thumb|The domain of the function is the interval from -1 to 1]] 
The '''domain''' of a function is the set of all points over which it is defined. More simply, it represents the set of x-values which the function can accept as input. For instance, if

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is only defined for values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, because the square root function is not defined (in real numbers) for negative values.  Thus, the domain, in interval notation, is &lt;math&gt;\left[-1,1\right]&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \mbox{is defined for } x\in [-1,1], \operatorname{ or } \{x:-1\le x\le 1\}&lt;/math&gt;.


[[Image:Rangeofsemicirclefunction.png|thumb|The range of the function is the interval from 0 to 1]]

===Range===
The '''range''' of a function is the set of all values which it attains (i.e. the y-values).  For instance, if:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; can only equal values in the interval from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the range of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left[0,1\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

===One-to-one Functions===
A function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is '''one-to-one''' (or less commonly '''injective''') if, for every value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, there is only one value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that corresponds to that value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  For instance, the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; is not one-to-one, because both &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt; result in &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  However, the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+2&lt;/math&gt; is one-to-one, because, for every possible value of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, there is exactly one corresponding value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Other examples of one-to-one functions are &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^3+ax&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a\in \left[0,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that if you have a one-to-one function and translate or dilate it, it remains one-to-one. (Of course you can't multiply &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by a zero factor).

====Horizontal Line Test====
If you know what the graph of a function looks like, it is easy to determine whether or not the function is one-to-one.  If every horizontal line intersects the graph in at most one point, then the function is one-to-one. This is known as the Horizontal Line Test.

====Algebraic 1-1 Test====
You can also show one-to-oneness algebraically by assuming that two inputs give the same output and then showing that the two inputs must have been equal.  For example,
Is &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1-2x}{1+x}\,&lt;/math&gt; a 1-1 function?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(a)=f(b)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1-2a}{1+a}=\frac{1-2b}{1+b} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1+b)(1-2a)=(1+a)(1-2b) \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1-2a+b-2ab=1-2b+a-2ab \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1-2a+b=1-2b+a \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1-2a+3b=1+a \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1+3b=1+3a \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a=b \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Therefore by the algebraic 1-1 test, the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; is 1-1.

You can show that a function is not one-to-one by finding two distinct inputs that give the same output.  For example,
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; is not one-to-one because &lt;math&gt;f(-1)=f(1)&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;-1\neq1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Inverse functions===
We call &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; the inverse function of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; if, for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;g(f(x)) = f(g(x)) = x\ &lt;/math&gt;.

A function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; has an inverse function if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is one-to-one.  For example, the inverse of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;g(x)=x-2&lt;/math&gt;.  The function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; has no inverse.

====Notation====
The inverse function of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the function that follows this rule

&lt;math&gt;f(f^{-1}(x))=f^{-1}(f(x)) = x&lt;/math&gt;:

To determine &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; when given a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, substitute &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and substitute &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then solve for &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;, provided that it is also a function.

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt; Given &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 2x - 7&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Substitute &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and substitute &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then solve for &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 2x - 7\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  x  = 2[f^{-1}(x)] - 7\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x + 7  = 2[f^{-1}(x)]\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x + 7}{2} = f^{-1}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

To check your work, confirm that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(f(x)) = x&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(f(x)) = &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(2x - 7) = {}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{(2x - 7) + 7}{2} = \frac{2x}{2} = x&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; isn't one-to-one, then, as we said before, it doesn't have an inverse. Then this method will fail.

'''Example:''' Given &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Substitute &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and substitute &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then solve for &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = (f^{-1}(x))^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x) = \pm\sqrt{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Since there are two possibilities for &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;, it's not a function. Thus &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have an inverse. Of course, we could also have found this out from the graph by applying the Horizontal Line Test. It's useful, though, to have lots of ways to solve a problem, since in a specific case some of them might be very difficult while others might be easy. For example, we might only know an algebraic expression for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; but not a graph.

'''Figure 1''': Displacement vectors in a plane. &lt;br /&gt; 
Vector '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A}&lt;/math&gt;''' represents the displacement of George from Mary, while vector '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;''' represents the displacement of Paul from George. Vector '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{C}&lt;/math&gt;''' represents the displacement of Paul from Mary and '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{C} = \mbox{A} + \mbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;'''. The quantities &lt;math&gt;A_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_y&lt;/math&gt;, etc., represent the Cartesian components of the vectors. 

Before we can proceed further we need to explore the idea of a ''vector''. A vector is a quantity which expresses both magnitude and direction. Graphically we represent a vector as an arrow. In typeset notation a vector is represented by a boldface character, while in handwriting an arrow is drawn over the character representing the vector.

Figure 1 shows some examples of ''displacement vectors'', i. e., vectors which represent the displacement of one object from another, and introduces the idea of vector addition. The tail of vector '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;''' is collocated with the head of vector '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A}&lt;/math&gt;''', and the vector which stretches from the tail of '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A}&lt;/math&gt;''' to the head of '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;''' is the sum of '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A}&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;''', called '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{C}&lt;/math&gt;''' in figure 1.

[[File:VectorIntro2.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''Figure 2''': Definition sketch for the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; representing the orientation of a two dimensional vector. &lt;/div&gt;

The quantities &lt;math&gt;A_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_y&lt;/math&gt;, etc., represent the Cartesian components of the vectors in figure 2. A vector can be represented either by its Cartesian components, which are just the projections of the vector onto the Cartesian coordinate axes, or by its direction and magnitude. The direction of a vector in two dimensions is generally represented by the counterclockwise angle of the vector relative to the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis, as shown in figure 2. Conversion from one form to the other is given by the equations

:&lt;math&gt; A = (A_x^2 + A_y^2)^{1/2} \qquad \theta = \tan^{-1} (A_y /A_x ) , &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A_x = A \cos ( \theta ) \qquad A_y = A \sin ( \theta ) , &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the vector. A vector magnitude is sometimes represented by absolute value notation: &lt;math&gt;A \equiv \vert \mbox{A} \vert&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that the inverse tangent gives a result which is ambiguous relative to adding or subtracting integer multiples of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the quadrant in which the angle lies must be resolved by independently examining the signs of &lt;math&gt;A_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_y&lt;/math&gt; and choosing the appropriate value of &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt;.

To add two vectors, '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A}&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;''', it is easiest to convert them to Cartesian component form. The components of the sum '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{C} = \mbox{A} + \mbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;''' are then just the sums of the components:

:&lt;math&gt; C_x = A_x + B_x \qquad C_y = A_y + B_y . &lt;/math&gt; 

Subtraction of vectors is done similarly, e. g., if '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A} = \mbox{C} - \mbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;''', then

:&lt;math&gt; A_x = C_x - B_x \qquad A_y = C_y - B_y . &lt;/math&gt; 

A unit vector is a vector of unit length. One can always construct a unit vector from an ordinary vector by dividing the vector by its length: '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{n} = \mbox{A} / \vert \mbox{A} \vert&lt;/math&gt;'''. This division operation is carried out by dividing each of the vector components by the number in the denominator. Alternatively, if the vector is expressed in terms of length and direction, the magnitude of the vector is divided by the denominator and the direction is unchanged.

Unit vectors can be used to define a Cartesian coordinate system. Conventionally, '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{i}&lt;/math&gt;''', '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{j}&lt;/math&gt;''', and '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{k}&lt;/math&gt;''' indicate the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axes of such a system. Note that '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{i}&lt;/math&gt;''', '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{j}&lt;/math&gt;''', and '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{k}&lt;/math&gt;''' are mutually perpendicular. Any vector can be represented in terms of unit vectors and its Cartesian components: '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A} = A_x \mbox{i} + A_y \mbox{j} + A_z \mbox{k}&lt;/math&gt;'''. An alternate way to represent a vector is as list of components: '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A} = ( A_x , A_y , A_z )&lt;/math&gt;'''. We tend to use the latter representation since it is somewhat more economical notation.

There are two ways to multiply two vectors, yielding respectively what are known as the dot product and the cross product. The cross product yields another vector while the dot product yields a number. Here we will discuss only the dot product.

[[File:VectorIntro3.png]]
'''Figure 3''': Definition sketch for dot product.

Given vectors '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A}&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;''', the dot product of the two is defined

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{A} \cdot \mbox{B} \equiv \vert \mbox{A} \vert \vert \mbox{B} \vert \cos \theta , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the two vectors. An alternate expression for the dot product exists in terms of the Cartesian components of the vectors:

:'''&lt;math&gt; \mbox{A} \cdot \mbox{B} = A_x B_x + A_y B_y . &lt;/math&gt;''' 

It is easy to show that this is equivalent to the cosine form of the dot product when the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis lies along one of the vectors, as in figure 3. Notice in particular that '''&lt;math&gt;A_x = \vert \mbox{A} \vert \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;''', while '''&lt;math&gt;B_x = \vert \mbox{B} \vert&lt;/math&gt;''' and &lt;math&gt;B_y = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{A} \cdot \mbox{B} = \vert \mbox{A} \vert \cos \theta \vert \mbox{B} \vert&lt;/math&gt;''' in this case, which is identical to the form given above.

By the law of cosines we can also see that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{2} \left(
|\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}|^2-|\mathbf{A}|^2-|\mathbf{B}|^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is an alternate coordinate-free expression for the dot product.

[[File:VectorIntro4.png]]
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Figure 4''': Definition figure for rotated coordinate system. The vector '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{R}&lt;/math&gt;''' has components &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in the unprimed coordinate system and components &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt; in the primed coordinate system. 

All that remains to be proven for equation (2.6) to hold in general is to show that it yields the same answer regardless of how the Cartesian coordinate system is oriented relative to the vectors. To do this, we must show that &lt;math&gt;A_x B_x + A_y B_y = A_x' B_x' + A_y' B_y'&lt;/math&gt;, where the primes indicate components in a coordinate system rotated from the original coordinate system.

This can be shown nearly instantly by applying the pythagorean theorem. Due to the fact that R is invariant and represents the hypotenuse for both triangles (X, X', Y and Y') we can conclude:

&lt;math&gt;|R|^2 = X^2 + Y^2 \mbox{ and }
|R|^2 = X'^2 + Y'^2 \Rightarrow
X^2 + Y^2 = X'^2 + Y'^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since the dot product can be written solely in terms of magnitudes, as we did above, if the magnitude of a vector is invariant the dot product of two vectors must also be invariant.

To deduce a general formula for X' and Y' you will have to do a bit more thinking:

Figure 2.4 shows the vector '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{R}&lt;/math&gt;''' resolved in two coordinate systems rotated with respect to each other. From this figure it is clear that &lt;math&gt;X' = A + B&lt;/math&gt;. Focusing on the shaded triangles, we see that &lt;math&gt;A = X \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = Y \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we find &lt;math&gt;X' = X \cos \theta + Y \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Similar reasoning shows that &lt;math&gt;Y' = -X \sin \theta + Y \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; (Just imagine to rotate the constructs in the image further 90° without changing the axis-names. You will instantly notice that in the second quadrant X is negative while Y positive). 

Thus, the new and old coordinates are related by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} X^\prime \\ Y^\prime \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} X \cos \theta + Y \sin \theta \\ -X \sin \theta + Y \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is true of the position vector. We can use it to extend the notion of vector to concepts other than position by stating that a pair of numbers is a vector ''if and only if'' its values change in exactly this way under rotation.

Substituting this relation into our earlier expression for the dot product and using the trigonometric identity &lt;math&gt;\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1&lt;/math&gt; results in

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
A_x' B_x' + A_y' B_y'  &amp; = &amp;  &amp; (A_x \cos \theta + A_y \sin \theta ) 
(B_x \cos \theta + B_y \sin \theta ) \\
 &amp; &amp;  + &amp; (-A_x \sin \theta + A_y \cos \theta ) 
(-B_x \sin \theta + B_y \cos \theta ) \\  &amp; = &amp; &amp; A_x B_x + A_y B_y 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which proves the complete equivalence of the two forms of the dot product quoted above. (Multiply out the above expression to verify this.)

A numerical quantity which doesn't depend on which coordinate system is being used is called a scalar. The dot product of two vectors is a scalar. However, the components of a vector, taken individually, are not scalars, since the components change as the coordinate system changes. Since the laws of physics cannot depend on the choice of coordinate system being used, we insist that physical laws be expressed in terms of scalars and vectors, but not in terms of the components of vectors.

In three dimensions the cosine form of the dot product remains the same, while the component form is
:'''&lt;math&gt; \mbox{A} \cdot \mbox{B} = A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z . &lt;/math&gt;'''</text>

== Reflection and Refraction ==

Most of what we need to know about geometrical optics can be summarized in two rules, the laws of reflection and refraction. These rules may both be inferred by considering what happens when a plane wave segment impinges on a flat surface. If the surface is polished metal, the wave is ''reflected'', whereas if the surface is an interface between two transparent media with differing indices of refraction, the wave is partially reflected and partially ''refracted''. Reflection means that the wave is turned back into the half-space from which it came, while refraction means that it passes through the interface, acquiring a different direction of motion from that which it had before reaching the interface.

[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.1.png|Figure 3.1: Sketch showing the reflection of a wave from a plane mirror]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.1''': Sketch showing the reflection of a wave from a plane mirror. The law of reflection states that &lt;math&gt;\theta _I = \theta _R&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 3.1 shows the wave vector and wave front of a wave being reflected from a plane mirror. The angles of incidence, &lt;math&gt;\theta _I&lt;/math&gt;, and reflection, &lt;math&gt;\theta _R&lt;/math&gt;, are defined to be the angles between the incoming and outgoing wave vectors respectively and the line normal to the mirror. The law of reflection states that &lt;math&gt;\theta_R = \theta_I&lt;/math&gt;. This is a consequence of the need for the incoming and outgoing wave fronts to be in phase with each other all along the mirror surface. This plus the equality of the incoming and outgoing wavelengths is sufficient to insure the above result.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.2.png|Figure 3.2: Sketch showing the refraction of a wave from an interface between two dielectric media]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.2''': Sketch showing the refraction of a wave from an interface between two dielectric media with &lt;math&gt;n_2 &gt; n_1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

Refraction, as illustrated in figure 3.2, is slightly more complicated. Since &lt;math&gt;n_R &gt; n_I&lt;/math&gt;, the speed of light in the right-hand medium is less than in the left-hand medium. (Recall that the speed of light in a medium with refractive index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;c_{medium} = c_{vac}/n&lt;/math&gt;.) The frequency of the wave packet doesn't change as it passes through the interface, so the wavelength of the light on the right side is less than the wavelength on the left side.

Let us examine the triangle ABC in figure 3.2. The side AC is equal to the side BC times &lt;math&gt;\sin ( \theta_I )&lt;/math&gt;. However, AC is also equal to &lt;math&gt;2 \lambda_I&lt;/math&gt;, or twice the wavelength of the wave to the left of the interface. Similar reasoning shows that &lt;math&gt;2 \lambda_R&lt;/math&gt;, twice the wavelength to the right of the interface, equals BC times &lt;math&gt;\sin ( \theta_R )&lt;/math&gt;. Since the interval BC is common to both triangles, we easily see that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\lambda_I}{\lambda_R} = \frac{\sin ( \theta_I )}{\sin ( \theta_R )} . &lt;/math&gt; (4.1)

Since &lt;math&gt;\lambda_I = c_I T = c_{vac} T/n_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_R = c_R T = c_{vac} T/n_R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_R&lt;/math&gt; are the wave speeds to the left and right of the interface, &lt;math&gt;c_{vac}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in a vacuum, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the (common) period, we can easily recast the above equation in the form
:&lt;math&gt; n_I \sin ( \theta_I ) = n_R \sin ( \theta_R ) . &lt;/math&gt; (4.2)

This is called ''Snell's law'', and it governs how a ray of light bends as it passes through a discontinuity in the index of refraction. The angle &lt;math&gt;\theta _I&lt;/math&gt; is called the incident angle and &lt;math&gt;\theta _R&lt;/math&gt; is called the refracted angle. Notice that these angles are measured from the normal to the surface, not the tangent.

==Derivation for Law of Reflection==

{{Wikipedia|Snell's Law}}

The derivation of Law of Reflection using Fermat's principle is straightforward. The Law of Reflection can be derived using elementary [[Calculus]] and [[Trigonometry]]. The generalization of the Law of Reflection is Snell's law, which is derived bellow using the same principle.

The medium that light travels through doesn't change. In order to minimize the time for light travel between to points, we should minimize the path taken.

[[Image:Lawofreflection.png|thumb|right|&amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection]]

1. Total path length of the light is given by

:&lt;math&gt;L=d_1+d_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

2. Using Pythagorean theorem from Euclidean Geometry we see that

:&lt;math&gt;d_1=\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_2=\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

3. When we substitute both values of d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for above, we get 

:&lt;math&gt;L=\sqrt{x^2 + a^2} + \sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}&lt;/math&gt;

4. In order to minimize the path traveled by light, we take the first derivative of L with respect to x. 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dL}{dx}=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} + \frac{-(l-x)}{\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

5. Set both sides equal to each other.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} = \frac{(l-x)}{\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

6. We can now tell that the left side is nothing but &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; and the right side &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_r&lt;/math&gt;  means

:&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_i=\sin\theta_r \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

7. Taking the inverse sine of both sides we see that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_i=\theta_r \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation for Snell's Law==

{{Wikipedia|Fermat's Principle}}

The derivation of Snell's Law using Fermat's Priciple is straightforward. Snell's Law can be derived using elementary [[calculus]] and [[trigonometry]]. Snell's Law is the generalization of the above in that it does not require the medium to be the same everywhere.

To mark the speed of light in different media refractive indices named n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are used. 
:&lt;math&gt;v_1=\frac{c}{n_1} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_2=\frac{c}{n_2}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Snellslaw_diagram.png|thumb|right|Snell's law relates n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

Here &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in the vacuum and &lt;math&gt;n_1,n_2 \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt; because all materials slow down light as it travels through them. 

1. Time for the trip equals distance traveled divided by the speed.

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{d_1}{v_1}+\frac{d_2}{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;

2. Using the  Pythagorean theorem from Euclidean Geometry we see that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d_1}{v_1}=\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{v_1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_2}{v_2}=\frac{\sqrt{b^2 + (l-x)^2}}{v_2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

3. Substituting this result into equation (1) we get 

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{v_1} + \frac{\sqrt{b^2 + (l-x)^2}}{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;

4. Differentiating and setting the derivative equal to zero gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dt}{dx}=\frac{x}{v_1\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} + \frac{-(l-x)}{v_2\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

5. After careful examination the above equation we see that it is nothing but

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dt}{dx}=\frac{\sin\theta_1}{v_1} - \frac{\sin\theta_2}{v_2}=0&lt;/math&gt;

6. Thus 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_1}{\sin\theta_1}=\frac{v_2}{\sin\theta_2}&lt;/math&gt;

7. Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_1\sin\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; we get

:&lt;math&gt;v_1\sin\theta_2=v_2\sin\theta_1 \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

8. Substituting &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{n_1}&lt;/math&gt; for v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{n_2}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{n_1}\sin\theta_2=\frac{c}{n_2}\sin\theta_1&lt;/math&gt;

9. Simplifying both sides we get our final result
:&lt;math&gt;n_1\sin\theta_1=n_2\sin\theta_2 \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

==The modern approach to relativity==

Although the special theory of relativity was first proposed by Einstein in 1905, the modern approach to the theory depends upon the concept of a four-dimensional universe, that was first proposed by Hermann Minkowski in 1908.

Minkowski's contribution appears complicated but is simply an extension of Pythagoras' Theorem:

In 2 dimensions:  &lt;math&gt;h^2 = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;

In 3 dimensions:  &lt;math&gt;h^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2&lt;/math&gt;

in 4 dimensions:  &lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + kt^2&lt;/math&gt;        

(where k = &lt;math&gt;-c^2&lt;/math&gt;)

The modern approach uses the concept of invariance to explore the types of coordinate systems that are required to provide a full physical description of the location and extent of things. The modern theory of special relativity begins with the concept of &quot;length&quot;.  In everyday experience, it seems that the length of objects remains the same no matter how they are rotated or moved from place to place.  We think that the simple length of a thing is &quot;invariant&quot;.  However, as is shown in the illustrations below, what we are actually suggesting is that length seems to be invariant in a three-dimensional coordinate system.

[[Image:Coord1b.gif]]

The length of a thing in a two-dimensional coordinate system is given by Pythagoras's theorem:

:&lt;math&gt; x^2 + y^2 = h^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This two-dimensional length is not invariant if the thing is tilted out of the two-dimensional plane.  In everyday life, a three-dimensional coordinate system seems to describe the length fully.  The length is given by the three-dimensional version of  Pythagoras's theorem:

:&lt;math&gt; h^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The derivation of this formula is shown in the illustration below.

[[image:Coord2.gif]]

It seems that, provided all the directions in which a thing can be tilted or arranged are represented within a coordinate system, then the coordinate system can fully represent the length of a thing. However, it is clear that things may also be changed over a period of time. Time is another direction in which things can be arranged.  This is shown in the following diagram:

[[image:Coord3.gif]]

The length of a straight line between two events in space and time is called a &quot;space-time interval&quot;.

In 1908 Hermann Minkowski pointed out that if things could be rearranged in time, then the universe might be four-dimensional. He boldly suggested that Einstein's recently-discovered theory of Special Relativity was a consequence of this four-dimensional universe. He proposed that the space-time interval might be related to space and time by Pythagoras' theorem in four dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt; s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (ict)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''i'' is the [[w: imaginary unit | imaginary unit]] (sometimes imprecisely called &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;), ''c'' is a constant, and ''t'' is the time interval spanned by the space-time interval, ''s''.  The symbols ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' represent displacements in space along the corresponding axes.  In this equation, the 'second' becomes just another unit of length. &lt;!-- see discussion --&gt; In the same way as centimetres and inches are both units of length related by centimetres = 'conversion constant' times inches, metres and seconds are related by metres = 'conversion constant' times seconds. The conversion constant, ''c'' has a value of about 300,000,000 meters per second. Now &lt;math&gt;i^2&lt;/math&gt; is equal to minus one, so the space-time interval is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Minkowski's use of the imaginary unit has been superseded by the use of advanced geometry that uses a tool known as the &quot;metric tensor&quot;.  The metric tensor permits the existence of &quot;real&quot; time and the negative sign in the expression for the square of the space-time interval originates in the way that distance changes with time when the curvature of spacetime is analysed (see advanced text). We now use real time but Minkowski's original equation for the square of the interval survives so that the space-time interval is still given by:

:&lt;math&gt; s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Space-time intervals are difficult to imagine; they extend between one place and time and another place and time, so the velocity of the thing that travels along the interval is already determined for a given observer.  

If the universe is four-dimensional, then the space-time interval will be invariant, rather than spatial length. Whoever measures a particular space-time interval will get the same value, no matter how fast they are travelling. In physical terminology the invariance of the spacetime interval is a type of '''Lorentz Invariance'''.  The invariance of the spacetime interval has some dramatic consequences.

The first consequence is the prediction that if a thing is travelling at a velocity of ''c'' metres per second, then all observers, no matter how fast they are travelling, will measure the same velocity for the thing.  The velocity ''c'' will be a universal constant. This is explained below.  

When an object is travelling at ''c'', the space time interval is '''zero''', this is shown below:

: The distance travelled by an object moving at velocity ''v'' in the ''x'' direction for ''t'' seconds is:  

: &lt;math&gt; x = vt &lt;/math&gt;

:If there is no motion in the ''y'' or ''z'' directions the space-time interval is  &lt;math&gt; s^2 = x^2 + 0 + 0 - (ct)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

: So: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = (vt)^2 - (ct)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

: But when the velocity ''v'' equals ''c'':

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = (ct)^2 - (ct)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:And hence the space time interval &lt;math&gt; s^2 = (ct)^2 - (ct)^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

A space-time interval of zero only occurs when the velocity is ''c'' (if x&gt;0). All observers observe the same space-time interval so when observers observe something with a space-time interval of zero, they all observe it to have a velocity of ''c'', no matter how fast they are moving themselves.  

The universal constant, ''c'', is known for historical reasons as the &quot;speed of light in a vacuum&quot;.  In the first decade or two after the formulation of Minkowski's approach many physicists, although supporting Special Relativity, expected that light might not travel at exactly ''c'', but might travel at very nearly ''c''. There are now few physicists who believe that light in a vacuum does not propagate at ''c''.

The second consequence of the invariance of the space-time interval is that clocks will appear to go slower on objects that are moving relative to you.  Suppose there are two people, Bill and John, on separate planets that are moving away from each other. John draws a graph of Bill's motion through space and time.  This is shown in the illustration below:

[[image:Coord5.gif]]
 
Being on planets, both Bill and John think they are stationary, and just moving through time.  John spots that Bill is moving through what John calls space, as well as time, when Bill thinks he is moving through time alone.  Bill would also draw the same conclusion about John's motion.  To John, it is as if Bill's time axis is leaning over in the direction of travel and to Bill, it is as if John's time axis leans over.

: John calculates the length of Bill's space-time interval as: 

: &lt;math&gt;s^2 = (vt)^2 - (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt; 

: whereas Bill doesn't think he has travelled in space, so writes: 

: &lt;math&gt;s^2 = (0)^2 - (cT)^2&lt;/math&gt; 

The space-time interval, &lt;math&gt;s^2&lt;/math&gt;, is invariant. It has the same value for all observers, no matter who measures it or how they are moving in a straight line. Bill's &lt;math&gt; s^2&lt;/math&gt; equals John's &lt;math&gt; s^2&lt;/math&gt; so:

: &lt;math&gt;(0)^2 - (cT)^2 = (vt)^2 - (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt; 

: and 

: &lt;math&gt;-(cT)^2 = (vt)^2 - (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt;  

: hence

: &lt;math&gt;t = T / \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

So, if John sees Bill measure a time interval of 1 second (&lt;math&gt;T = 1&lt;/math&gt;) between two ticks of a clock that is at rest in Bill's frame, John will find that his own clock measures between these same ticks an interval &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, called '''coordinate time''', which is greater than one second. It is said that clocks in motion slow down, relative to those on observers at rest. This is known as &quot;relativistic time dilation of a moving clock&quot;. The time that is measured in the rest frame of the clock (in Bill's frame) is called the '''proper time''' of the clock.

John will also observe measuring rods at rest on Bill's planet to be shorter than his own measuring rods, in the direction of motion. This is a prediction known as &quot;relativistic length contraction of a moving rod&quot;. If the length of a rod at rest on Bill's planet is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then we call this quantity the proper length of the rod. The length &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of that same rod as measured from John's planet, is called '''coordinate length''', and given by

:&lt;math&gt;x = X \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation can be derived directly and validly from the time dilation result with the assumption that the speed of light is constant.  

The last consequence is that clocks will appear to be out of phase with each other along the length of a moving object.  This means that if one observer sets up a line of clocks that are all synchronised so they all read the same time, then another observer who is moving along the line at high speed will see the clocks all reading different times.  In other words observers who are moving relative to each other see different events as '''simultaneous'''.  This effect is known as '''Relativistic Phase''' or the '''Relativity of Simultaneity'''. Relativistic phase is often overlooked by students of Special Relativity, but if it is understood then phenomena such as the twin paradox are easier to understand.

The way that clocks go out of phase along the line of travel can be calculated from the concepts of the invariance of the space-time interval and length contraction. 

[[Image:relphasesimple.gif]]

In the diagram above John is conventionally stationary. Distances between two points according to Bill are simple lengths in space (x) all at t=0 whereas John sees Bill's measurement of distance as a combination of a distance (X) and a time interval (T):

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = X^2 - (cT)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the quantities represented by capital letters are proper lengths and times and in this example refer to John's measurements.

Bill's distance, x, is the length that he would obtain for things that John believes to be X metres in length. For Bill it is John who has rods that contract in the direction of motion so Bill's determination &quot;x&quot; of John's distance &quot;X&quot; is given from:

:&lt;math&gt;x = X \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This relationship between proper and coordinate lengths was seen above to relate Bill's proper lengths to John's measurements.  It also applies to how Bill observes John's proper lengths. 

:&lt;math&gt;x = X \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; 

:Thus &lt;math&gt;x^2 = X^2 - (v^2/c^2)X^2&lt;/math&gt;

:So: &lt;math&gt;(cT)^2 = (v^2/c^2)X^2&lt;/math&gt;

:And &lt;math&gt;cT = (v/c)X&lt;/math&gt;

:So: &lt;B&gt;&lt;math&gt;T = (v/c^2)X &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/B&gt;

Clocks that are synchronised for one observer go out of phase along the line of travel for another observer moving at &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; metres per second by :&lt;math&gt;(v/c^2)&lt;/math&gt; seconds for every metre. This is one of the most important results of Special Relativity and should be thoroughly understood by students.

The net effect of the four-dimensional universe is that observers who are in motion relative to you seem to have time coordinates that lean over in the direction of motion and consider things to be simultaneous that are not simultaneous for you.  Spatial lengths in the direction of travel are shortened, because they tip upwards and downwards, relative to the time axis in the direction of travel, akin to a rotation out of three-dimensional space.

[[image:Coord6.gif]]

::[[File:Examp.jpg|right|300x300px|What velocity would cause events A and B to be simultaneous?]]'''Example'''

::An observer records an event A next to herself then an event B a millisecond later and 600 kilometres away.  How fast would another observer need to travel in the direction of event B to record it as simultaneous with event A?

::The phase difference between moving clocks is given by: &lt;math&gt;T = (v/c^2)X &lt;/math&gt;
::The velocity needed to create a phase difference of 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; secs is:

::&lt;math&gt;v =  \frac{10^{-3} \times 3 \times 10^8 \times c}{6 \times 10^{5}}&lt;/math&gt;

::This means that another observer who is travelling at 0.5c relative to the first observer in the direction of the line joining events A and B will consider that these events are simultaneous.

====Interpreting space-time diagrams====

Great care is needed when interpreting space-time diagrams.  Diagrams present data in two dimensions, and cannot show faithfully how, for instance, a zero length space-time interval appears.

[[image:Coord8.gif]]

When diagrams are used to show both space and time it is important to be alert to space and time being related by Minkowski's equation and not by simple Euclidean geometry. The diagrams are only aids to understanding the approximate relation between space and time and it must not be assumed, for instance, that simple trigonometric relationships can be used to relate lines that represent spatial displacements and lines that represent temporal displacements. 

It is sometimes mistakenly held that the time dilation and length contraction results only apply for observers at x=0 and t=0. This is untrue.  An inertial frame of reference is defined so that length and time comparisons can be made anywhere within a given reference frame. 

[[Image:relsimul.gif|frame|left|Time dilation applies to time measurements taken between corresponding planes of simultaneity]]
{{clear}}

Time differences in one inertial reference frame can be compared with time differences anywhere in another inertial reference frame provided it is remembered that these differences apply to corresponding pairs of lines or pairs of planes of simultaneous events.

===Spacetime===

[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 4.1.png|frame|Spacetime diagram showing an ''event'', a ''world line'', and a ''line of simultaneity''.]]

In order to gain an understanding of both Galilean and Special Relativity it is important to begin thinking of space and time as being different dimensions of a four-dimensional vector space called spacetime. Actually, since we can't visualize four dimensions very well, it is easiest to start with only one space dimension and the time dimension. The figure shows a graph with time plotted on the vertical axis and the one space dimension plotted on the horizontal axis. An ''event'' is something that occurs at a particular time and a particular point in space. (&quot;Julius X. wrecks his car in Lemitar, NM on 21 June at 6:17 PM.&quot;) A ''world line'' is a plot of the position of some object as a function of time (more properly, the time of the object as a function of position) on a spacetime diagram. Thus, a world line is really a line in spacetime, while an event is a point in spacetime. A horizontal line parallel to the position axis (x-axis) is a ''line of simultaneity''; in Galilean Relativity all events on this line occur simultaneously for all observers. It will be seen that the line of simultaneity differs between Galilean and Special Relativity; in Special Relativity the line of simultaneity depends on the state of motion of the observer.

In a spacetime diagram the slope of a world line has a special meaning. Notice that a vertical world line means that the object it represents does not move -- the velocity is zero. If the object moves to the right, then the world line tilts to the right, and the faster it moves, the more the world line tilts. Quantitatively, we say that
:&lt;math&gt;velocity = \frac{1}{slope~of~world~line} . &lt;/math&gt;(5.1)

Notice that this works for negative slopes and velocities as well as positive ones. If the object changes its velocity with time, then the world line is curved, and the instantaneous velocity at any time is the inverse of the slope of the tangent to the world line at that time.

The hardest thing to realize about spacetime diagrams is that they represent the past, present, and future all in one diagram. Thus, spacetime diagrams don't change with time -- the evolution of physical systems is represented by looking at successive horizontal slices in the diagram at successive times. Spacetime diagrams represent the evolution of events, but they don't evolve themselves.

==The lightcone==

Things that move at the speed of light in our four dimensional universe have surprising properties. If something travels at the speed of light along the x-axis and covers x meters from the origin in t seconds the space-time interval of its path is zero.

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 - (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt;

but &lt;math&gt; x = ct&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = (ct)^2 - (ct)^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Extending this result to the general case, if something travels at the speed of light in any direction into or out from the origin it has a space-time interval of 0:

&lt;math&gt;0 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is known as the Minkowski Light Cone Equation. If light were travelling towards the origin then the Light Cone Equation would describe the position and time of emission of all those photons that could be at the origin at a particular instant. If light were travelling away from the origin the equation would describe the position of the photons emitted at a particular instant at any future time 't'.

[[Image:rellightcone.gif]]

At the superficial level the light cone is easy to interpret. Its backward surface represents the path of light rays that strike a point observer at an instant and its forward surface represents the possible paths of rays emitted from the point observer. Things that travel along the surface of the light cone are said to be '''light- like''' and the path taken by such things is known as a '''null geodesic'''.

Events that lie outside the cones are said to be '''space-like''' or, better still '''space separated''' because their space time interval from the observer has the same sign as space (positive according to the convention used here). Events that lie within the cones are said to be '''time-like''' or '''time separated''' because their space-time interval has the same sign as time. 

However, there is more to the light cone than the propagation of light. If the added assumption is made that the speed of light is the maximum possible velocity then events that are space separated cannot affect the observer directly. Events within the backward cone can have affected the observer so the backward cone is known as the &quot;affective past&quot; and the observer can affect events in the forward cone hence the forward cone is known as the &quot;affective future&quot;. 

The assumption that the speed of light is the maximum velocity for all communications is neither inherent in nor required by four dimensional geometry although the speed of light is indeed the maximum velocity for objects if the principle of '''causality''' is to be preserved by physical theories (ie: that causes precede effects).

==The Lorentz transformation equations ==
The discussion so far has involved the comparison of interval measurements (time intervals and space intervals) between two observers. The observers might also want to compare more general sorts of measurement such as the time and position of a single event that is recorded by both of them. The equations that describe how each observer describes the other's recordings in this circumstance are known as the Lorentz Transformation Equations.  (Note that the symbols below signify coordinates.)

[[Image:rellorentz.gif]]

The table below shows the Lorentz Transformation Equations.

&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

See [[Special Relativity/Mathematical Appendix#Mathematics_of_the_Lorentz_Transformation_Equations|mathematical derivation of Lorentz transformation]].

Notice how the phase ( (&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt;v/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)x )&lt;/FONT&gt; is important and how these formulae for absolute time and position of a joint event differ from the formulae for intervals.

== A spacetime representation of the Lorentz Transformation ==

[[File:Rellorent.png|thumb|right|Spacetime representation of Lorentz Transformation for time]] Bill and John are moving at a relative velocity, v, and synchronise clocks when they pass each other. Both Bill and John observe an event along Bill's direction of motion. What times will Bill and John assign to the event? It was shown above that the relativistic phase was given by: &lt;math&gt;vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. This means that Bill will observe an extra amount of time elapsing on John's time axis due to the position of the event. Taking phase into account and using the time dilation equation Bill is going to observe that the amount of time his own clocks measure can be compared with John's clocks using:

&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {t - vx/c^2}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

This relationship between the times of a common event between reference frames is known as the Lorentz Transformation Equation for time.

I think that

is neater. It also allows to immediately identify that &amp;lambda; is the spatial period, and that its inverse, ''k'', together with the inverse of ''T'', f, are the spatial and temporal frequencies, respectively.

Along the same line the last equation (second line) in the page could read

:&lt;math&gt; 0=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\left(x - \frac{\lambda}{T} t\right) +\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

It direcly shows that the equiphase point moves with velocity ''c=&amp;lambda;/T''

I was reading the introduction, and I know from my textbooks that the electromagnetic and the weak nuclear force are considered as one force called the electroweak force.  So there are only three fundamental forces.  Just trying to help.

Actually, there are four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetic, weak nuclear and strong nuclear. The electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are unified, as electroweak, at energies greater than around 100 GeV. Many grand unified theories (GUTs) merge the electroweak with the strong nuclear force at higher energies. 27 Feb 2004

::Just a note: GeV = gigaElectronVolts.  Also: electricity and magnestism are two forces but because they unify at every energy level they are considered one.  Correct me if I'm wrong ... [[User:Dolphinn|Dolphinn!!]] 9:02 EST April 6 2007

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called LouI. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name LouI~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Hej/Miav/Hello/Meow/Aloha/?/Oi/Miado


Hey :) Thanks for picking up my arithmetic errors; my mental arithmetic is ''atrocious''! [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 21:10, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Hi, nice job with all the puzzles! I'll see if I can find some more good and challenging ones. Btw: previously we first posted solution ideas to the talk page of a puzzle, but maybe it's better the way you did it and post directly to the solution page (incorrect / unclear solutions can always be edited later I guess). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:Thanks. Only saw the talk pages with solution ideas, after making all the solution pages... Think the solutions are probably correct, although the elastic one may not exactly have been the intended solution... [[User:Cyp|Cyp]] 18:01, 18 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Hello, the changes you made to the recursion section of primes is incorrect. Maybe i didn't explain recursion properly, and i'll try again. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]]

:I'm suppose I'm not actually sure what the definition of recursion is exactly... But I don't understand what the difference between iteration, and the example given, is. [[User:Cyp|كсηפ Cyp]] 12:50, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)

::To define recursion, you first have to define recursion :) [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

*[[User:Cyp|Cyp]] - Oh well, why not... Not that I've actually had any need for admin stuff in the Wikibooks section yet, but maybe I will some day... [[User:Cyp|Cyp]] 16:27, 18 Oct 2003 (UTC)
** Support. Corrects my errors, adds good stuff :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:54, 19 Oct 2003 (UTC)
**Make it so! --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 22:46, 20 Oct 2003 (UTC)

You are now a Wikibooks admin. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Orbital_Mechanics and

I made a mistake in their creation.  One of them should have been under Aeropace Engineering, and actually there is already and astrodynamics one which is the same.

Hey, a lot of people are editing it wrong. Shouldn't you do something next time it happens? ( I took care of it.)--[[User:Nelson340|Nelson340]] 02:56, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== [[Programming:Windows Programming]] ==

This book is in pretty lousy condition, and I would like to start a project soonish (within the next few weeks) to try and expand this book. I have started a basic outline [[User:Whiteknight/Windows Programming|on my user page]] to try and lay out the things that (I think) this book should cover. I see that you have been a contributer to this book in the past, and I would therefore like to get your input on the current outline, and see if there is anything that i should add, or anything that I should remove from it.

The outline can be found at [[User:Whiteknight/Windows Programming]]. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:37, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

== De-Adminship vote. ==

A vote is being held to remove your sysop privileges.  The basis for this vote is lack of use of these privileges.  You may want to participate at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#Cyp_.28_talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.29]].  See also the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Removing_Sysop_Status]]. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:13, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Your De-Adminship ==

Hello. I would like to inform you that you will have your sysop rights removed here on 1 Nov 2006 due to inactivity. If you would like to discuss the matter, please see [[WB:RFA]]. You can re-apply for adminship at a later date if you wish. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:28, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

===Transverse and Longitudinal Waves===

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Tranlong.png|thumb|right|Example of displacements in transverse and longitudinal waves. The wave motion is to the right. The longitudinal and transverse waves are in phase.]] --&gt;

With the exception of light, waves are undulations in some material medium. For instance, waves on a slinky are either ''transverse'', in that the motion of the material of the slinky is perpendicular to the orientation of the slinky, if you vibrate the slinky like a rope, or they are ''longitudinal'', with material motion in the direction of the stretched slinky, if you treat it like a spring. (See image on right) Ocean waves are simultaneously transverse and longitudinal, the net effect being (nearly) circular undulations in the position of water parcels. The oscillations in neighboring parcels are phased such that a ''pattern'' moves across the ocean surface. Some media support only longitudinal waves, others support only transverse waves, while yet others support both types. Sound waves are purely longitudinal in gases and liquids, but can be either type in solids.

Mechanical transverse waves require a material medium and propogate by means of vibrations of the medium perpendicular to the direction of travel. Examples are water waves, ripples, seismic shear waves, and waves in stretched strings as above.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:Emwave.png|thumb|left|The periodic undulation of Electric and Magnetic field strengths in an EM wave]] --&gt;

Electromagnetic (EM) waves (such as light) are also transverse waves but they do not require a medium and thus can pass through a vacuum ([[Waves/Waves in one Dimension|see intro]]).They consist of oscillating electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields which are perpendicular to the direction of propogation while also being mutually perpendicular. EM waves are a disturbance of space itself, which can be thought of as being stretched and therefore being elastic and having a tension. The B and E fields are in phase as shown on the left.

The fundamental S.I. unit of length (meter) is defined in terms of the speed of light in vacuum and the definition of the unit of time, the second. The previous definition was in terms of the wavelength of a particular color of light in the line spectrum of Krypton 86. The modern definition is more accurate as well as being the same to all observers regardless of their relative velocity.

Longitudinal waves propogate by means of vibrations or disturbances in the medium that are in the same direction that the wave travels. Examples are sound (as above), seismic shock waves, slinky springs and part of the motion in ocean waves. Sound waves are a series of high-pressure compressions and low-pressure rarefaction (for this reason, sound is sometimes called a ''pressure wave''). While it might be convenient to think of individual molecules vibrating back and forth around an equilibrium position (producing areas of high and low pressure), the individual molecules in a gas generally move randomly, and it is only in large numbers that this pattern is visible. In longitudinal waves, the convention is to describe displacement in the direction the wave is going (the direction of propagation) as positive, and displacement against that direction as negative.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:dispress.png|thumb|600px|center|Graph of Displacement vs Pressure]] --&gt;

The pressure and displacement of a molecule at a point are &lt;math&gt;90^o&lt;/math&gt; out of phase, so that, for example, when a molecule is farthest displaced it is in a normal pressure area, while molecules in compressions or rarefactions have displacement close to zero.

Torsional waves consist of a twisting disturbance moving through a medium such as a wire or a rod.

===Sine Waves===

A particularly simple kind of wave, the sine wave, is illustrated in figure 1.2. This has the mathematical form:
:&lt;math&gt;h(x) = h_0 \sin ( 2 \pi x / \lambda ) ,&lt;/math&gt; (2.1)

where
:''h'' is the ''displacement'' (which can be either longitudinal or transverse),
:&lt;math&gt;h_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum displacement, sometimes called the amplitude of the wave,
:&amp;lambda; is the wavelength.tory Physics fig 1.2.png|Figure 1.2: Sine wave]] --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.2''': Definition sketch for a sine wave, showing the wavelength &amp;lambda; and the amplitude &lt;math&gt;h_0&lt;/math&gt; and the phase &amp;phi; at various points.
&lt;/div&gt;


So far we have only considered a sine wave as it appears at a particular time. All interesting waves move with time. The movement of a sine wave to the right a distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; may be accounted for by replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the above formula by &lt;math&gt;x - d&lt;/math&gt;. If this movement occurs in time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, then the wave moves at velocity &lt;math&gt;c = d/t&lt;/math&gt;. Solving this for &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and substituting yields a formula for the displacement of a sine wave as a function of both distance &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; h(x) = h_0 \sin [ 2 \pi (x - ct) / \lambda ] . &lt;/math&gt; (2.2)

The time for a wave to move one wavelength is called the period of the wave: &lt;math&gt;T = \lambda / c&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we can also write
:&lt;math&gt;h(x) = h_0 \sin [ 2 \pi ( x / \lambda - t / T ) ] . &lt;/math&gt;(2.3)

Physicists actually like to write the equation for a sine wave in a slightly simpler form. Defining the wavenumber as &lt;math&gt;k = 2 \pi / \lambda&lt;/math&gt; and the angular frequency as &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi / T&lt;/math&gt;, we write
:&lt;math&gt; h(x) = h_0 \sin (kx - \omega t) . &lt;/math&gt;(2.4)

We normally think of the frequency of oscillatory motion as the number of cycles completed per second and is given by &lt;math&gt;f = 1/T&lt;/math&gt;. It is related to the angular frequency omega by &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;. The angular frequency is used because it is directly analogous to the wavenumber, see above. Converting between the two is not difficult. Frequency is measured in units of hertz, abbreviated Hz; &lt;math&gt;1 \mbox{Hz} = 1 \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is in units of radians per second.
(Not converting between frequency and angular frequency is a common mistake in many calculations)


The argument of the sine function is by definition an angle. We refer to this angle as the phase of the wave, &lt;math&gt;\phi = kx - \omega t&lt;/math&gt;. The difference in the phase of a wave at fixed time over a distance of one wavelength is &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;, as is the difference in phase at fixed position over a time interval of one wave period.

As previously noted, we call &lt;math&gt;h_0&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum displacement of the wave, the amplitude. Often we are interested in the intensity of a wave, which is defined as the square of the amplitude, &lt;math&gt;I = h_0^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The wave speed we have defined above, &lt;math&gt;c = \lambda /T&lt;/math&gt;, is actually called the phase speed. Since &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 2 \pi /k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T = 2 \pi / \omega&lt;/math&gt;, we can write the phase speed in terms of the angular frequency and the wavenumber:
:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{\omega}{k} \mbox{(phase speed)} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.5)

=== Types of Waves ===

In order to make the above material more concrete, we now examine the characteristics of various types of waves which may be observed in the real world. 
==== Ocean Surface Waves ====

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.3.png|Figure 1.3: Wave on an ocean depth]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.3''': Wave on an ocean of depth &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. The wave is moving to the right and the particles of water at the surface move up and down as shown by the small vertical arrows. The particles move up, and gravity is the 'restoring' force. Water waves are also longitudinal, the water particles moving forward, then back.  The restoring forces are more complex, but involve the inertia of the mass of water surrounding. Think of water waves as superimposed transverse and longitudinal waves.  The net particle paths are nearly circular.  This is typical of waves that travel along the boundary (interface) between two substances, in this case water and air.
&lt;/div&gt;

These waves are manifested as undulations of the ocean surface as seen in figure 1.3. The speed of ocean waves is given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;v = \left( \frac{g \tanh (kH)}{k} \right)^{1/2} , &lt;/math&gt; (2.6)

where &lt;math&gt;g = 9.8 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant related to the strength of the Earth's gravity, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the ocean, and the hyperbolic tangent is defined as 2.7
:&lt;math&gt;\tanh (x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.7) &lt;!-- what is k? --&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.4.png|Figure 1.4: Plot of tanh(x)]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.4''': Plot of the function &lt;math&gt;\tanh (x)&lt;/math&gt;. The dashed line shows our approximation &lt;math&gt;\tanh (x) \approx x&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\vert x\vert &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

As figure 1.4 shows, for very small x, we can approximate the hyperbolic tangent by &lt;math&gt;\tanh (x) \approx x&lt;/math&gt;, while for very large x it is positive 1 for positive x and negative 1 for negative x. This leads to two limits: Since &lt;math&gt;x = k H&lt;/math&gt;, the ''shallow water'' limit, which occurs when &lt;math&gt;kH &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, yields a wave speed of
:&lt;math&gt;v \approx (gH)^{1/2} , \mbox{(shallow water waves)} , &lt;/math&gt; (2.8)

while the ''deep water'' limit, which occurs when &lt;math&gt;kH &gt;&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, yields
:&lt;math&gt;v \approx (g/k)^{1/2} , \mbox{(deep water waves)} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.9)

Notice that the speed of shallow water waves depends only on the depth of the water and on &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, all shallow water waves move at the same speed. 

On the other hand, deep water waves of longer wavelength (and hence smaller wavenumber) move more rapidly than those with shorter wavelength. Waves for which the wave speed varies with wavelength are called ''dispersive''. Thus, deep water waves are dispersive, while shallow water waves are non-dispersive.

For water waves with wavelengths of a few centimeters or less, surface tension becomes important to the dynamics of the waves. In the deep water case the wave speed at short wavelengths is actually given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt; c = (g/k + A k )^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt; (2.10)

where the constant &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is related to surface tension and depends on the surfaces involved. For an air-water interface near room temperature, &lt;math&gt;A \approx 74 \mbox{ cm}^3 \mbox{ s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Sound Waves ====

Sound is a longitudinal compression-expansion wave through matter. The wave speed is
:&lt;math&gt;c = ( \gamma R T_{abs} )^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt; (2.11)

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are constants and &lt;math&gt;T_{abs}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''absolute temperature''. The absolute temperature is measured in Kelvins and is numerically given by
:&lt;math&gt;T_{abs} = T_C + 273.16^{\circ} &lt;/math&gt; (2.12)

where &lt;math&gt;T_C&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature in Celsius degrees. The angular frequency of sound waves is thus given by
:&lt;math&gt; \omega = ck = ( \gamma R T_{abs} )^{1/2} k . &lt;/math&gt; (2.13)

The speed of sound in air at normal temperatures is about &lt;math&gt;340 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Light ====

Light moves in a vacuum at a speed of &lt;math&gt;c_{vac} = 3 \times 10^8 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. In transparent materials it moves at a speed less than &lt;math&gt;c_{vac}&lt;/math&gt; by a factor &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; which is called the ''refractive index'' of the material:
:&lt;math&gt;c = c_{vac} / n . &lt;/math&gt;

Often the refractive index takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;n^2 \approx 1 + \frac{A}{1 - (k/k_R )^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the wavenumber and &lt;math&gt;k_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are constants characteristic of the material. The angular frequency of light in a transparent medium is thus
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = kc = \frac{k c_{vac}}{n} \approx 
\frac{k c_{vac}}{\sqrt{1+A}}(1+ \frac{1}{2}\frac{A}{1+A}\frac{k^2}{k^2_R})&lt;/math&gt;

so the frequency increases slightly with increasing ''k''. Typically, when ''k'' is near ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, the material becomes opaque.

Ultimately, this is due to resonance between the light and the atoms of the materials.

=== Superposition Principle ===

It is found empirically that as long as the amplitudes of waves in most media are small, two waves in the same physical location don't interact with each other. Thus, for example, two waves moving in the opposite direction simply pass through each other without their shapes or amplitudes being changed. When superimposed, the total wave displacement is just the sum of the displacements of the individual waves. This is called the ''superposition principle''. At sufficiently large amplitude the superposition principle often breaks down -- interacting waves may scatter off of each other, lose amplitude, or change their form.

''Interference'' is a consequence of the superposition principle. When two or more waves are superimposed, the net wave displacement is just the algebraic sum of the displacements of the individual waves. Since these displacements can be positive or negative, the net displacement can either be greater or less than the individual wave displacements. The former case is called ''constructive interference'', while the latter is called ''destructive interference''. 

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.5.png|Figure 1.5: Superposition of two sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.5''': Superposition (lower panel) of two sine waves (shown individually in the upper panel) with equal amplitudes and wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Let us see what happens when we superimpose two sine waves with different wavenumbers. Figure 1.5 shows the superposition of two waves with wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 5&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the result is a wave with about the same wavelength as the two initial waves, but which varies in amplitude depending on whether the two sine waves are in or out of phase. When the waves are in phase, constructive interference is occurring, while destructive interference occurs where the waves are out of phase.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.6.png|Figure 1.6: Superposition of two sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.6''': Superposition of two sine waves with equal amplitudes and wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 11&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

What happens when the wavenumbers of the two sine waves are changed? Figure 1.6 shows the result when &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 11&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that though the wavelength of the resultant wave is decreased, the locations where the amplitude is maximum have the same separation in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as in figure 1.5.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.7.png|Figure 1.7: Superposition of two sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.7''': Superposition of two sine waves with equal amplitudes and wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 12&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

If we superimpose waves with &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 12&lt;/math&gt;, as is shown in figure 1.7, we see that the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; spacing of the regions of maximum amplitude has decreased by a factor of two. Thus, while the wavenumber of the resultant wave seems to be related to something like the ''average'' of the wavenumbers of the component waves, the spacing between regions of maximum wave amplitude appears to go inversely with the ''difference'' of the wavenumbers of the component waves. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; are close together, the amplitude maxima are far apart and vice versa.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.8.png|Figure 1.8: Representation of the wavenumbers and amplitudes of two superimposed sine waves.]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.8''': Representation of the wavenumbers and amplitudes of two superimposed sine waves.&lt;/div&gt;

We can symbolically represent the sine waves that make up figures 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 by a plot such as that shown in figure 1.8. The amplitudes and wavenumbers of each of the sine waves are indicated by vertical lines in this figure.

The regions of large wave amplitude are called wave packets. Wave packets will play a central role in what is to follow, so it is important that we acquire a good understanding of them. The wave packets produced by only two sine waves are not well separated along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis. However, if we superimpose many waves, we can produce an isolated wave packet. For example, figure 1.9 shows the results of superimposing &lt;math&gt;20&lt;/math&gt; sine waves with wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k = 0.4 m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m = 1,2, \ldots , 20&lt;/math&gt;, where the amplitudes of the waves are largest for wavenumbers near &lt;math&gt;k = 4&lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.9.png|Figure 1.9: Superposition of twenty sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.9''': Superposition of twenty sine waves with &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

In particular, we assume that the amplitude of each sine wave is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\exp [-(k - k_0)^2 / \Delta k^2 ]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The amplitudes of each of the sine waves making up the wave packet in figure 1.9 are shown schematically in figure 1.10.


&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.10.png|Figure 1.10: Superposition of twenty sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.10''': Representation of the wavenumbers and amplitudes of 20 superimposed sine waves with &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; controls the distribution of the sine waves being superimposed -- only those waves with a wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; within approximately &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; of the central wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; of the wave packet, i. e., for &lt;math&gt;3 \le k \le 5&lt;/math&gt; in this case, contribute significantly to the sum. If &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; is changed to &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, so that wavenumbers in the range &lt;math&gt;2 \le k \le 6&lt;/math&gt; contribute significantly, the wavepacket becomes narrower, as is shown in figures 1.11 and 1.12.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.11.png|Figure 1.11: Superposition of twenty sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.11''': Superposition of twenty sine waves with &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.12.png|Figure 1.12: Superposition of twenty sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.12''': Representation of the wavenumbers and amplitudes of 20 superimposed sine waves with &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; is called the wavenumber spread of the wave packet, and it evidently plays a role similar to the difference in wavenumbers in the superposition of two sine waves -- the larger the wavenumber spread, the smaller the physical size of the wave packet. Furthermore, the wavenumber of the oscillations within the wave packet is given approximately by the central wavenumber.

We can better understand how wave packets work by mathematically analyzing the simple case of the superposition of two sine waves. Let us define &lt;math&gt;k_0 = (k_1 + k_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; are the wavenumbers of the component waves. Furthermore let us set &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = (k_2 - k_1 )/2&lt;/math&gt;. The quantities &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; are graphically illustrated in figure 1.8. We can write &lt;math&gt;k_1 = k_0 - \Delta k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = k_0 + \Delta k&lt;/math&gt; and use the trigonometric identity &lt;math&gt;\sin (a + b) = \sin (a) \cos (b) + \cos (a) \sin (b)&lt;/math&gt; to find
&lt;math&gt;\sin (k_1 x) + \sin (k_2 x) = \sin [(k_0 - \Delta k)x] + \sin [(k_0 + \Delta k)x]&lt;/math&gt;  
&lt;math&gt; = \sin (k_0 x) \cos (\Delta k x) - \cos (k_0 x) \sin(\Delta k x) +&lt;/math&gt;  
&lt;math&gt;\sin (k_0 x) \cos (\Delta k x) + \cos (k_0 x) \sin(\Delta k x) = 2 \sin (k_0 x) \cos ( \Delta k x) .&lt;/math&gt; (2.17)

The sine factor on the bottom line of the above equation produces the oscillations within the wave packet, and as speculated earlier, this oscillation has a wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; equal to the average of the wavenumbers of the component waves. The cosine factor modulates this wave with a spacing between regions of maximum amplitude of
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \pi / \Delta k . &lt;/math&gt; (2.18)

Thus, as we observed in the earlier examples, the length of the wave packet &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is inversely related to the spread of the wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; (which in this case is just the difference between the two wavenumbers) of the component waves. This relationship is central to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.

Suppose two sound waves of different frequency impinge on your ear at the same time. The displacement perceived by your ear is the superposition of these two waves, with time dependence
&lt;math&gt; A(t) = \sin ( \omega_1 t) + \sin ( \omega_2 t) = 2 \sin ( \omega_0 t) \cos ( \Delta \omega t) , &lt;/math&gt; (2.19)

where we now have &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = ( \omega_1 + \omega_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega = ( \omega_2 - \omega_1 )/2&lt;/math&gt;. What you actually hear is a tone with angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; which fades in and out with period
&lt;math&gt;T_{beat} = \pi / \Delta \omega = 2 \pi / ( \omega_2 - \omega_1 ) = 1 / ( f_2 - f_1 ) . &lt;/math&gt; (2.20)

The ''beat frequency'' is simply
&lt;math&gt; f_{beat} = 1/T_{beat} = f_2 - f_1 . &lt;/math&gt; (2.21)

Note how beats are the time analog of wave packets -- the mathematics are the same except that frequency replaces wavenumber and time replaces space.

=== Interferometers ===

An interferometer is a device which splits a beam of light into two sub-beams, shifts the phase of one sub-beam with respect to the other, and then superimposes the sub-beams so that they interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the magnitude of the phase shift between them. In this section we study the Michelson interferometer and interferometric effects in thin films. 

==== The Michelson Interferometer ====

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.13.png|Figure 1.13: Sketch of a Michelson interferometer.]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.13''': Sketch of a Michelson interferometer.&lt;/div&gt;

The American physicist Albert Michelson invented the optical interferometer illustrated in figure 1.13. The incoming beam is split into two beams by the half-silvered mirror. Each sub-beam reflects off of another mirror which returns it to the half-silvered mirror, where the two sub-beams recombine as shown. One of the reflecting mirrors is movable by a sensitive micrometer device, allowing the path length of the corresponding sub-beam, and hence the phase relationship between the two sub-beams, to be altered. As figure 1.13 shows, the difference in path length between the two sub-beams is &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt; because the horizontal sub-beam traverses the path twice. Thus, constructive interference occurs when this path difference is an integral number of wavelengths, i. e.,
:&lt;math&gt; 2x = m \lambda , ~~ m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots \quad \mbox{(Michelson interferometer)} &lt;/math&gt; (2.22)

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of the light and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. Note that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of wavelengths that fits evenly into the distance &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Thin Films ===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.14.png|Figure 1.14: Plane light wave normally incident on a transparent thin film]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.14''': Plane light wave normally incident on a transparent thin film of thickness &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and index of refraction &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Partial reflection occurs at the front surface of the film, resulting in beam A, and at the rear surface, resulting in beam B. Much of the wave passes completely through the film, as with C.&lt;/div&gt;

One of the most revealing examples of interference occurs when light interacts with a thin film of transparent material such as a soap bubble. Figure 1.14 shows how a plane wave normally incident on the film is partially reflected by the front and rear surfaces. The waves reflected off the front and rear surfaces of the film interfere with each other. The interference can be either constructive or destructive depending on the phase difference between the two reflected waves.

If the wavelength of the incoming wave is &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt;, one would naively expect constructive interference to occur between the A and B beams if &lt;math&gt;2d&lt;/math&gt; were an integral multiple of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt;.

Two factors complicate this picture. First, the wavelength inside the film is not &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\lambda /n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of refraction of the film. Constructive interference would then occur if &lt;math&gt;2d = m \lambda /n&lt;/math&gt;. Second, it turns out that an additional phase shift of half a wavelength occurs upon reflection when the wave is incident on material with a higher index of refraction than the medium in which the incident beam is immersed. This phase shift doesn't occur when light is reflected from a region with lower index of refraction than felt by the incident beam. Thus beam B doesn't acquire any additional phase shift upon reflection. As a consequence, constructive interference actually occurs when
:&lt;math&gt; 2d = (m + 1/2) \lambda /n , ~~ m = 0,1,2, \ldots \quad \mbox{(constructive interference)} &lt;/math&gt; (2.23)

while destructive interference results when
:&lt;math&gt; 2d = m \lambda /n , ~~ m = 0,1,2, \ldots \quad \mbox{(destructive interference)} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.24)

When we look at a soap bubble, we see bands of colors reflected back from a light source. What is the origin of these bands? Light from ordinary sources is generally a mixture of wavelengths ranging from roughly &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 4.5 \times 10^{-7} \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt; (violet light) to &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 6.5 \times 10^{-7} \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt; (red light). In between violet and red we also have blue, green, and yellow light, in that order. Because of the different wavelengths associated with different colors, it is clear that for a mixed light source we will have some colors interfering constructively while others interfere destructively. Those undergoing constructive interference will be visible in reflection, while those undergoing destructive interference will not.

Another factor enters as well. If the light is not normally incident on the film, the difference in the distances traveled between beams reflected off of the front and rear faces of the film will not be just twice the thickness of the film. To understand this case quantitatively, we need the concept of refraction, which will be developed later in the context of geometrical optics. However, it should be clear that different wavelengths will undergo constructive interference for different angles of incidence of the incoming light. Different portions of the thin film will in general be viewed at different angles, and will therefore exhibit different colors under reflection, resulting in the colorful patterns normally seen in soap bubbles.

=== Math Tutorial -- Derivatives ===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.15.png|Figure 1.15: Estimation of the derivative]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.15''': Estimation of the derivative, which is the slope of the tangent line. When point B approaches point A, the slope of the line AB approaches the slope of the tangent to the curve at point A. &lt;/div&gt;

This section provides a quick introduction to the idea of the derivative. For a more detailed discussion and exploration of the differentiation and of Calculus, see [[Calculus]] and [[Calculus/Differentiation|Differentiation]]. 

Often we are interested in the slope of a line tangent to a function &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; at some value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This slope is called the derivative and is denoted &lt;math&gt;dy/dx&lt;/math&gt;. Since a tangent line to the function can be defined at any point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative itself is a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; g(x) = \frac{d y(x)}{dx} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.25)

As figure 1.15 illustrates, the slope of the tangent line at some point on the function may be approximated by the slope of a line connecting two points, A and B, set a finite distance apart on the curve:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} \approx \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.26)

As B is moved closer to A, the approximation becomes better. In the limit when B moves infinitely close to A, it is exact.

== Table of Derivatives ==

Derivatives of some common functions are now given. In each case &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

{{:Engineering Tables/Table of Derivatives}}

The product and chain rules are used to compute the derivatives of complex functions. For instance,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} ( \sin (x) \cos (x)) = \frac{d \sin (x)}{dx} \cos (x) + \sin (x) \frac{d \cos (x)}{dx} = \cos^2 (x) - \sin^2 (x) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \log ( \sin (x) ) = \frac{1}{\sin (x)} \frac{d \sin (x)}{dx} = \frac{\cos (x)}{\sin (x)} . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Group Velocity ===

We now ask the following question: How fast do wave packets move? Surprisingly, we often find that wave packets move at a speed very different from the phase speed, &lt;math&gt;c = \omega /k&lt;/math&gt;, of the wave composing the wave packet.

We shall find that the speed of motion of wave packets, referred to as the group velocity, is given by
: &lt;math&gt;u = \ 0.1 \mbox{m}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The phase speed of deep ocean waves is &lt;math&gt;c = (g/k)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;. However, since &lt;math&gt;c \equiv \omega /k&lt;/math&gt;, we find the frequency of deep ocean waves to be &lt;math&gt;\omega = (gk)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;. The group velocity is therefore &lt;math&gt;u \equiv d \omega / dk = (g/k)^{1/2} / 2 = c/2&lt;/math&gt;. For the specified central wavenumber, we find that &lt;math&gt;u \approx (9.8 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-2} / 0.1 \mbox{ m}^{-1} )^{1/2} / 2 \approx 5 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the phase speed of deep ocean waves with this wavelength is &lt;math&gt;c \approx 10 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dispersive waves are waves in which the phase speed varies with wavenumber. It is easy to show that dispersive waves have unequal phase and group velocities, while these velocities are equal for non-dispersive waves.

=== Derivation of Group Velocity Formula ===

We now derive equation (1.36). It is easiest to do this for the simplest wave packets, namely those constructed out of the superposition of just two sine waves. We will proceed by adding two waves with full space and time dependence:
:&lt;math&gt; A = \sin ( k_1 x - \omega_1 t ) + \sin ( k_2 x - \omega_2 t ) &lt;/math&gt; (2.37)

After algebraic and trigonometric manipulations familiar from earlier sections, we find
:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \sin ( k_0 x - \omega_0 t ) \cos ( \Delta k x - \Delta \omega t ) , &lt;/math&gt; (2.38)

where as before we have &lt;math&gt;k_0 = (k_1 + k_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = ( \omega_1 + \omega_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = (k_2 - k_1 )/2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega = ( \omega_2 - \omega_1 )/2&lt;/math&gt;. Again think of this as a sine wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; and wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; modulated by a cosine function. In this case the modulation pattern moves with a speed so as to keep the argument of the cosine function constant:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta k x - \Delta \omega t = const. &lt;/math&gt; (2.39)

Differentiating this with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; while holding &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega&lt;/math&gt; constant yields
:&lt;math&gt; u \equiv \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta k} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.40)

In the limit in which the deltas become very small, this reduces to the derivative
:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{d \omega}{d k} , &lt;/math&gt; (2.41)

which is the desired result.

=== Examples ===

We now illustrate some examples of phase speed and group velocity by showing the displacement resulting from the superposition of two sine waves, as given by equation (1.38), in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; plane. This is an example of a spacetime diagram, of which we will see many examples later on.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 1.16.png|Figure 1.16: Net displacement of two sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.16''': Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves plotted in the &lt;math&gt;x - t&lt;/math&gt; plane. The short vertical lines indicate where the displacement is large and positive, while the short horizontal lines indicate where it is large and negative. One wave has &lt;math&gt;k = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 4&lt;/math&gt;, while the other has &lt;math&gt;k = 5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 5&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 5 - 4 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega = 5 - 4 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and we have &lt;math&gt;u = \Delta \omega / \Delta k = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the phase speed for the first sine wave is &lt;math&gt;c_1 = 4/4 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and for the second wave is &lt;math&gt;c_2 = 5/5 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;c_1 = c_2 = u&lt;/math&gt; in this case.&lt;/div&gt;

Figure 1.16 shows a non-dispersive case in which the phase speed equals the group velocity. The regions with vertical and horizontal hatching (short vertical or horizontal lines) indicate where the wave displacement is large and positive or large and negative. Large displacements indicate the location of wave packets. The positions of waves and wave packets at any given time may therefore be determined by drawing a horizontal line across the graph at the desired time and examining the variations in wave displacement along this line. The crests of the waves are indicated by regions of short vertical lines. Notice that as time increases, the crests move to the right. This corresponds to the motion of the waves within the wave packets. Note also that the wave packets, i. e., the broad regions of large positive and negative amplitudes, move to the right with increasing time as well.

Since velocity is distance moved &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; divided by elapsed time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, the slope of a line in figure 1.16, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t / \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, is one over the velocity of whatever that line represents. The slopes of lines representing crests (the slanted lines, not the short horizontal and vertical lines) are the same as the slopes of lines representing wave packets in this case, which indicates that the two move at the same velocity. Since the speed of movement of wave crests is the phase speed and the speed of movement of wave packets is the group velocity, the two velocities are equal and the non-dispersive nature of this case is confirmed.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 1.17.png|Figure 1.17: Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.17''': Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves plotted in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; plane. One wave has &lt;math&gt;k = 4.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 4&lt;/math&gt;, while the other has &lt;math&gt;k = 5.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 6&lt;/math&gt;. In this case &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 5.5 - 4.5 = 1&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega = 6 - 4 = 2&lt;/math&gt;, so the group velocity is &lt;math&gt;u = \Delta \omega / \Delta k = 2/1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;. However, the phase speeds for the two waves are &lt;math&gt;c_1 = 4/4.5 = 0.889&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2 = 6/5.5 = 1.091&lt;/math&gt;. The average of the two phase speeds is about &lt;math&gt;0.989&lt;/math&gt;, so the group velocity is about twice the average phase speed in this case. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 1.18.png|Figure 1.18: Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.18''': Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves plotted in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; plane. One wave has &lt;math&gt;k = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 5&lt;/math&gt;, while the other has &lt;math&gt;k = 5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 4&lt;/math&gt;. Can you figure out the group velocity and the average phase speed in this case? Do these velocities match the apparent phase and group speeds in the figure? &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 1.17 shows a dispersive wave in which the group velocity is twice the phase speed, while figure 1.18 shows a case in which the group velocity is actually opposite in sign to the phase speed. See if you can confirm that the phase and group velocities seen in each figure correspond to the values for these quantities calculated from the specified frequencies and wavenumbers.

The wave is a physical phenomenon that is found in a variety of contexts, a perturbation in the medium. You undoubtedly know about ocean waves and have probably played with a stretched slinky toy, producing undulations which move rapidly along the slinky. Other examples of waves are sound, vibrations in solids, and light (photons have the particularity of sharing characteristics of both waves and particles).  

Despite the vast differences in these different types of waves, they all consist of a fluctuation around an equilibrium position caused by a restoring force, and can be described by the same types of mathematical equations.  Understanding these equations is a powerful tool because it will let you understand the basics of a wide variety of seemingly unrelated phenomena.  The purpose of this section is to describe the ''kinematics'' of waves, i.e., to provide tools for describing the form and motion of all waves irrespective of their underlying physical mechanisms.

In this chapter we learn first about the basic properties of waves and introduce the most common type of wave, called the sinusoidal(sine) wave. In fact just about any type of wave can be expressed as a combination of sine functions using a technique proposed by [[w:Joseph Fourier|Joseph Fourier]].  Examples of waves seen in the real world are presented. We then learn about the superposition principle, which allows us to construct complex wave patterns by superimposing sine waves. Using these ideas, we discuss the related ideas of beats and interferometry. Finally, the ideas of wave packets and group velocity are introduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!
I am glad someone filled in the things I was missing on the Calculus:Functions page, but I had a few questions about things I wasn't sure about.  I might have modified some of them, but I wasn't sure ''why'' you did what you did, so I thought I might ask first:

*In the definition of a function you referred to the formal definition of function (set of ordered pairs).  Most people would completely miss the point, unless we went in more detail, which I don't think is wise.  What do you think?
*&quot;in the world of real numbers&quot; is another (less) obscure reference.  Anyone familar with complex numbers would understand what was meant without the parenthetical clause, but someone who wasn't familar wouldn't care.  Of course, that is no reason not to be precise, so leaving it in would still be appropriate.
*In the example of adding, subtracting, etc. the functions f and g, you wrote &quot;def&quot; before the subtraction example.  Why?  What do you mean?
*I like the continuity section.  I was going to wait until limits to introduce it, but you tied it in with graphing effectively.
*I had left out a * 0 = 0 intentionally, since it is not an axiom of field theory (it can be proved easily).  Of course, I never titled the list as &quot;axioms of field theory&quot;, but rather as arithematic truths -- and a * 0 = 0 is certainly true.  Anyone reading it not familar with field theory would not notice one way or another.  So I am split in whether I think it should be included or not.  On second thought, the whole Algebra section is mostly redundant -- the only commonly missed fact is the distributive property (anyone who doesn't know a + 0 = a or a * 1 = a shouldn't be taking Calculus).

Conincidentally, my name happens to be Eric as well.

 -- [[User:IntMan|IntMan]]

Re: functions as ordered pairs -- Perhaps you're right. That little bit of information isn't necessary, as functions are rarely specified by giving a set of ordered pairs.

Re: complex numbers -- I hope people trying to take calculus have already been introduced to imaginary numbers in algebra or trig. Also, I remember that there is one method for solving differential equations that involves complex numbers (though I'm uncertain of the details), so if we think people won't know/remember them we should cover them in a review section (unless we are not covering that, but since there is a major section &quot;Advanced Calculus&quot; I assume we will be.)

Re: &quot;def&quot; -- It's just a typo. I meant nothing by it.

Re: continuity -- Thank you.

Re: a*0 -- Well, I thought a * 0 = 0 was an axiom, but apparently I misremembered. I definately agree that it should be removed.

[[User:Eric119|Eric119]] 20:47 22 Jul 2003 (UTC)

About the Hello, World! Page, Sorry, I was being rude.  Sometimes I do get carried away.  I was probably just in a bad mood at the time.  For example: using endl is just a preference because I don't like it when I write a program, and nothing shows up on the screen until the program exits.  The return 0, is the only thing I really have a problem with.  Point: You are right about the not having to return 0.  Counter-Point: But since it is standard pratice not to rely on the system to free all of your ram you've allocated, should it also be right to rely on the system to return the 0?

Josh:[[User:Mrquick|Mrquick]] 23:13 29 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Well, I suppose that's a style issue, too. The implicit &quot;return 0;&quot; is guaranteed according to the C++ standard. You could say it's better to explictly state that there were no errors. Or you could say that by default we assume the program did not encounter errors.

'''Methane''', CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the simplest organic molecule. It is a gas at [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/STP standard temperature and pressure] and is a carbon atom with four hydrogen atoms bonded to it in a tetrahedral shape.

This is a flattened, two-dimensional representation of methane that you will see commonly. The true three-dimensional form of methane does not have any 90 degree angles between bonded hydrogens. The bonds point to the four corners of a tetrahedron, forming cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(−1/3) ≈ 109.5 degree bond angles.

[[Ethane]] (/ˈɛθeɪn/ or /ˈiːθeɪn/) is a chemical compound, or hydrocarbon with a chemical formula of C2H6. At standard temperature and pressure, ethane is a colorless, odorless gas. Ethane is isolated on an industrial scale from natural gas, and as a byproduct of petroleum refining. Its chief use is as petrochemical feedstock for ethylene production. It could be described as two methane molecules attached to each other, less two hydrogens.

[[File:Ethane-3D-vdW.png|180px|thumbnail|Left|Ethane]]

===Number of hydrogens to carbons===
This equation describes the relationship between the number of hydrogen and carbon atoms in alkanes:

:'''H = 2C + 2'''

where &quot;C&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are used to represent the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms present in one molecule. If C = 2, then H = 6.

Many textbooks put this in the following format:

:'''C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2N+2&lt;/sub&gt;'''

where &quot;C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; and &quot;H&lt;sub&gt;2N+2&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; represent the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms present in one molecule. If C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; = 3, then H&lt;sub&gt;2N+2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2(3) + 2 = 8. (For this formula look to the &quot;N&quot; for the number, the &quot;C&quot; and the &quot;H&quot; letters themselves do not change.)

Welcome! It will be as soon as someone who knows Perl (not me) decides to write it.  Until that though, a link to Wikipedia would be acceptable; not a replacement though because a textbook is written differently than an encyclopedia. --Josh

:Ah - I see now. Good everything is self-contained within the single book - that's what I like to see. Oh and you could use the Wikipedia article to start such a chapter: just make sure to say &quot;From Wikipedia&quot; in the edit summary - a mention on the &quot;Authors page&quot; would also be nice (doing both of those combined with the fact that we are all part of the Wikimedia family should be good enough for the GFDL...). --mav

Re: [[programmingc:ch1_cpp]] (an impossible name to remember, btw) Are you using an automated HTML syntax coloring program? I &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;do&lt;/font&gt; not like the colors appearing in the &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;main&lt;/font&gt; text (not the programs); you shouldn't &lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;include&lt;/font&gt; that text in your syntax-colorer input.

Also, the namespace problem can be fixed by leaving out the .h from iostream. Only in ancient (nonstandard) compilers does &lt;iostream&gt; not exist (as opposed to &lt;iostream.h&gt;), and in all &lt;iostream&gt;-compatible compilers the file's contents are in std. If a compiler does not support the non-h syntax (and the other thirty-odd standard headers), it's not a good one to learn from. [[User:Geoffrey|Geoffrey]] 03:50 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)

I'll try that namespace thing... Yeah, that colored thing isn't that good.  I wrote something myself to do the conversion, having things colored in the text didn't bother me, as long as it was actually a command (but if the consensus is not to do it, I won't).  That &quot;do&quot; thing, I don't know why its not working?  Take, &quot;if&quot;, and &quot;while&quot;, they don't just turn blue in the text, my program searches for the accompaying paranthesis, but for some reason it won't do that for &quot;do&quot;.  I can't figure out why... Its probably due to some weird mistake I made when I programmed the parser at ultra high speed... so I'm writing a new parser... [[User:Mrquick|Mrquick]] 18:09 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)

I just wanted to call you attention to a discussion I hope I've started at the staff lounge regarding namespaces. No disrespect, but I'm recommending against your approach, and I think we ought to keep a record of the our reasoning, so the Lounge archive will do it. [[User:LouI|LouI]] 18:10 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Is there some way I can or an admin have the server email me my password now, instead of waiting for I think a half of a month.  I kind of forgot what it was :(. Josh

Lucky me, I figured it out, I didn't see the email myself a new password button. [[User:Mrquick|Mrquick]] 05:00, 15 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Hello :) Nice work in restructuring [[Computer programming]], but I disliked your choice of the suffix &quot;in programming&quot;, as it was very cumbersome for other titles.

By the way, if you've been active at the Wikipedia, the same syntax works here too. To create a tab indent, write a &lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;, to create bullets, use successive &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;s, if you have an article in the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Namespace:Article]], you can just write [[Namespace:Article|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it'll show up without the Namespace: part. Leaving a space as the first character of the line forces the rest of the line to be in fixed-width font, perfect for code.

Thanks :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:55, 20 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Hello, It seems I've dissappeared for a bit.  I just went off to college and the local college ethernet is down.  After one day viruses killed it.  Not fun.  I should become active again as soon as I have a permanent, or semi-permanent, internet solution.  Josh</text>

----
The following areas were [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2003-July/000164.html recently suggested in the mailing list] as important to resolve in regards to the [[Main_Page|textbook project]].

When applicable, list your username to vote for (a) particular opinion(s).
(This is a &quot;vote&quot; only in the sense of a show of support; no decision has been taken to count votes in any particular way, or even at all, to make final choices.)
Write arguments for your position after the list of options; also add more options if you like.
If there's not a list of options, but instead a list of points needing discussion, then you can list more points or give sublists of options for a particular point of discussion.
Et cetera.

== Name of the project ==
* &quot;Open Textbook Project&quot; -- http://www.opentextbook.org - [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
* &quot;Free Textbook Project&quot; --
* &quot;Wikimedia Textbooks&quot; -- [[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]]
* &quot;Wikipedia Textbooks&quot; --
* &quot;Wikibooks&quot; (mav owns the urls and plans to transfer them to Wikimedia) -- [[User:maveric149|mav]], [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]], [[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]], [[User:LouI|LouI]], [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]], [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]], [[User:Dhum Dhum|Dhum Dhum]]
* &quot;Wikitext&quot; -- [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]],

The URL could also be http://wikibooks.wikimedia.org/ (owned by the Foundation already). -- [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]] 08:14 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)

We should avoid entering the philosophical debate between &quot;open&quot; and &quot;free&quot; in our name. -- [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]] 08:14 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)

We should continue the tradition of having &quot;wiki&quot; in our name since that is what defines us the most - even more than the free license. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 19:44 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)
:I agree completely with that one. [[User:Dhum Dhum|Dhum Dhum]] 20:11 5 Aug 2003 (UTC) 

We should not limit ourselves to being a textbook-only shop - all non-fiction books should be allowed. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 19:44 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)
:Or even fiction books, that would be interesting [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]]
::If you are talking about stuff like Huck Finn with annotation and wikified words going to encyclopedia articles, then yes. But we should ''not'' be in the business of creating our own fictional worlds. That is a different project. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 17:24 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)

== Types of content that are to be covered ==
* Traditional textbook content -- Presumably everybody supports this!
** Do realize that the effort may be futile, no matter the resulting quality. One would need to make a snapshot for some unusually brave (solidly tenured) professors to try, then supply an errata list and print many copies. A live wiki is too unstable to teach a class from. --[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:29, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)
** ''Non traditional textbooks'', there are some subjects (especially in science on post-graduate levels) for which there are no traditional textbooks. In such a book its dynamics are not a problem. --[[User:Iztok.jeras|IzI]] 18:07, 25 August 2005 (UTC)
* Possible other book content:
** How-to directions like cookbooks -- [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]],
*** Well, the envisioned Wikibooks' Cookbook might turn out to be a general book about cooking in different cultures with historical background and some conscious consumerism threads
*** The Cookbook is doing very well. It does suffer from problems with: [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism deletionism], case-sensitivity and the Cookbook: prefix ruining normal wiki ease-of-use (&lt;nowiki&gt;normal [[easy linking]] is unusable&lt;/nowiki&gt;), lack of [[Special:Specialpages]] specific to the Cookbook, and a sidebar [[Main_Page]] link that doesn't go to the main page of the cookbook. --[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:29, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)
**Manuals to use certain things (such as a software program) 
***Should be textbook-oriented in presentation. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]
**A broad travel guide covering the entire world. -- [[User:Dhum Dhum|Dhum Dhum]]
***The people at http://www.wikitravel.org are going to fill that role. Our focus here should be in ''instructing'' students - travel guides are informative (like an encyclopedia), not instructive (like a textbook). --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]
**Other non-fiction works
**Fiction books. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]]
*** Something like a &quot;[[w:cliffs notes|Cliff's Notes]]&quot; possibly? --[[User:Neolux|Neolux]] 15:28 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)
***Absolutely ''not'' newly-created fiction (that is a different project; &quot;Wiktion&quot;). But we should have public domain fiction of already established works (with annotation; such as the works of Mark Twain). We can also have ''Cliff's Notes''-type extensive summaries of works. That would be neat. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 17:20 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)
***Fiction study that does not go very deeply into criticism.  Major themes that are universally accepted seem to be the order in textbooks I've dealt with. --[[User:Jdl32579|Jdl32579]] 12:57, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)
* Remixes and compilations of free content (Wikipedia, ...). Sometimes all the knowledge is already freely available, all it has to be done is to organize it into a book (thought its not that simple). --[[User:Iztok.jeras|IzI]] 18:07, 25 August 2005 (UTC)
* I really favor -footnotes-, similar to those found along with biblical texts; I find myself having the need to use 'symbols' [e.g. (†), (‡), and (*)] to use for reference-''like'' footnotes.[[User:RekonDog|RekonDog]] ([[User talk:RekonDog|talk]]) 10:10, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

== Key policies ==
* While a name hasn't been settled, we'll need a sort of &quot;Wiki&quot; policies for our developer interaction separate from any policies that affect the texts themselves:
* A proposed outline of [[Wikibooks:textbook considerations|textbook considerations]] is available for Wiki development and discussion.
* A short outline proposal for a description of processes is open for comment or update at [[Wikibooks:textbook development process|textbook development process]].

== Timetable for setting things up ==
* As it gets done
* Schedules are for proprietary encyclopedias. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]]

== Resources and techniques useful in creating educational content ==
* [[Textbook Figures and Diagrams]] -- I've created a page for the discussion of resources to support the creation of figures and diagrams for wiki textbooks. --[[User:StevenBrewer|StevenBrewer]] 14:11, 17 October 2005 (UTC)
* photographic images
* diagrams
* maps
* chemical/mathematical formulae
* Javascript quizzes
**Practise problems in traditional format
* Flash quizzes
** I could make some, however, Flash is [en:Proprietary]. It's something we should think about before we dive in head-first. [[User:KirbyMeister|KirbyMeister]] 20:14, 7 May 2004 (UTC)

== GNU GPL Server Software to draw ideas from==
* '''Moodle''' - PHP software that aims to make quality online courses (eg distance education) easy to develop and conduct. Learning and development are guided using a social constructionist philosophy. 
[http://moodle.org/sites Implemented on thousands of sites and in 30 languages].
See [http://moodle.org website] and [http://sourceforge.net/projects/moodle development site].

* [http://lon-capa.org/ lon-capa] might be a better model to support on-line courses.  You can create extremely rich interactive problems and easily integrate many different kinds of resources. --[[User:StevenBrewer|StevenBrewer]] 14:11, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

== Potential changes that need to be made to the software ==
* Compiling many pages into one large document:
** A standard book structure (sections) could be created that could be easily translated into LaTeX and further into PDF (with a table of contents and a cover picture). --[[User:Iztok.jeras|IzI]] 17:47, 25 August 2005 (UTC)
* Automating navigation links within textbooks:
** [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2003-July/000088.html Mav's suggestion] on the mailing list for modular URLs -- [[User:maveric149|mav]],
** It would be nice if when one comes to the end of a textbook page which one had accessed by clicking on a table of contents entry,  one could go on to the next page of the book without having to go back to the table of contents and select the next page from there. On other websites one often sees this done with ''NEXT'' buttons; or ''PREVIOUS'' for going backwards. -- rew 
**Mav's suggestion as [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2003-July/000099.html modified by Toby] -- [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]], [[User:Maveric149|mav]] (I very much like Toby's improvements)
**WikiGroups has already been developed with another php/GPL wiki; [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2003-July/000222.html] - this will allow us to have one TOC/Index per Wikibook but I think we can tweak that software to make it possible to have more than one TOC/Index per book (the trick would be to add the TOC/Index's name after a ? to every link on the TOC/Index page - then when you click on a link to a module, the WikiGroup code on that page will know which %trail% to dispaly. Those links in turn would have the TOC/Index's name after a ? but only for links in the %trail%). 
** Karl's idea to [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2003-July/000102.html nest URLs] in a way that reflects the structure of the book
** [[meta:Wikibooks extension|Yet another proposal]] from [[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]]
** In a related note an automatically generated index (cached!?) would make any textbook more useful [[User:m.linger|m.linger]]
* separation of books' contents from each other and from meta information (or rather a means to filter thing out) 
**This should be possible when categories are implemented for Wikipedia.
* Wikipedia namespace moved to Wikibooks: or something like that when the name is settled

== Proposal ==
The project '''wikibooks''' does not seem to be enjoying the same sort of growth that the original '''wikipedia''' did.  There are probably a number of reasons for this.  I shall give a few reasons I think are important and then follow up with some suggestions for the action that could be taken to remedy this.

1) Wikibooks requires a different logon to wikipedia.  IMHO it would be better for the project if existing wikipedia developers could be automatically part of wikibooks.  This would allow more free movement of labour from wikipedia to wikibooks.  A strong motivating factor for people developing in wikipedia is the racking up of credit in the form of edited articles.  Why not allow create a contributions page that gives credit to all material worked on in any wiki project?

2) Wikibooks is not interconnected in the same way that wikipedia is.  There is a clear need for a different structure to the books as they are meant to be (at least eventually) printed and should therefore have a linear style.  However, if links were made in such a way that they could deleted without interfering with the quality of the text then we could have the same interconnection that wikipedia has without that necessarily causing problems with the style of the books.

* We need a way to designate sections as being developer areas (but within the actual text itself) We could produce a special heading &quot;Developer's notes and links&quot; which has a template (to ensure consistent usage.

* We need a special link type that represents a temporary link for development purposes.  This would allow the developer links and comments necessary to speed up development.  But at the same time would allow these links to be removed with ease when the wikibook is downloaded.  (Of course links just to wikipedia should be fairly easy to remove automatically although it might help if they appeared in a different colour to remind developers that that material reffered to will not be available to the readers of printed versions.

3) Also links can be made from relevent pages of wikipedia to wikibooks.  This should draw in much more labour to liven up wikibooks.  This is one thing that I can implement on my own. So I shall start introducing a section on some selected wikipedia pages entitled &quot;relevent wikibooks&quot;.  I may also start links to wikibooks in the main text of some articles in wikipedia.  However, without 2) we may find that people learn to ignore links to wikibooks as they are deadends.

Please comment on these proposals.

At least one wikibook is interconnected in the same way that wikipedia is. The [[Cookbook]] is highly self-connected. If anything, some connections need to be severed. At the bottom of most recipes you will find a Categories link. This should list all the categories in the cookbook. Unfortunately, it lists all sorts of other random unrelated stuff. Cookbook info is drowned out by the noise. --[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:40, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Is #2 really the case?  I tend to think that Wikibooks should be created to best serve the user.  If that best way is by creating a non-linear book, so be it.  Let's use the medium we have and not be tied to an old communication medium. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 05:28, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Learning a new topic needs to be linear (at least to an extent). For example, learning about ionic bonding in chemistry before learning about the periodic table would be very difficult. Coming back to a topic you have already learnt is when non-linear content is generally more useful (which is where GOOD appendices and indices come in).
[[User:m.linger|m.linger]] 02:06, 06 Jul 2005 (UTC)

:Maybe the most important thing is increasing the ability for this 'free movement of labour' from wikipedia. There is vast untapped potential for all those experts to get interested in and excited about wikibooks. The two best ways, which I think have been floated around as nebulous proposals for some time, are as mentioned above - automatic or connected logon for existing wikipedia editors, and very simply, far more links to wikibooks for the click-happy wikipediholics! Is there anywhere on Wikipedia fairly heavily trafficked by people with the technical knowhow that could support or rubbish these suggestions? [[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 22:21, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Wikify==

Wikify is a program written by Josh Ferguson specifically designed to turn a standard text file into a html/wiki format.  It is being used to do the color syntax highlighting for the C++ code in the C++ section of this textbook.

Author's Statement:
Wikify can not yet wikify itself, due to the fact that it has html codes in it, which confuses itself.  I plan to rewrite it soon so it can wikify itself.  Right now though, it works good with simple code.  And it can be modified to work with other languages by changing the variables in it.  Later on I'll probably move all the important variables into text files so it will be more easy to change things for other languages (i.e. by changing the text files, or extension checks), etc...

The code was written really fast, so the code isn't perfect, even though the author stubbornly maintains that it is close.

Code Snapshot as of 7-22-03
----

The escape sequences in the code give the wikiscript problems, so here is a link to it.  Click on it, and it will take you to a page, where you can click on it, and it will come up.

This should be compilable by any standard C++ compiler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''BASIC''' was developed in 1963 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire as a teaching language. The acronym BASIC stands for '''B'''eginner's '''A'''ll-Purpose '''S'''ymbolic '''I'''nstruction '''C'''ode. In 1964, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz designed the original BASIC language at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.

== Programming Preliminaries ==
Anybody can write a program. A background in mathematics or science is not required. Patience, practice, and an interest in the subject matter should suffice, along with the required software and hardware.

Understanding programs can appear daunting at first, but their reliance on logical operations allow for easy learning of commands which you will commonly see in many programs.

A program itself is merely a series of commands in the order in which they are to be executed. That is to say, that the first line is the beginning of the program!

All programs a user uses from day to day, including browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.) and operating systems (Windows, *nix and MacOS) are separate sets of lines of code, which aim to fulfill tasks. the amount of code is dependent on how simple the task generally, and different types of code may be used for the advantages they give. BASIC is considered an excellent starting point for moving onto other languages, and can be useful for simple programs.

=== Programming Languages ===

Programming languages allow people to give instructions to a computer with commands that both the computer and the programmer can understand.  Different programming languages use different commands and different rules for entering those commands; similar to the way people speak different words to each other with the same meaning.  One person may say &quot;hello&quot;, while another says &quot;hola&quot;, which, although express the same thought, appear different.

Similarly other human languages, such as French and Spanish, are similar to each other, as computer programming languages can be also.  Programming languages that are similar are usually referred to as related languages.  Once a person learns a programming language, it is easier to then learn other programming languages especially those related to the first one, as many similarities in structure are shared between languages, especially those with a common ancestor.
 

The language taught here, BASIC, is easier to learn than others as its commands are similar to English and has a simple set of rules for entering them.

The '''octet rule''' refers to the tendency of atoms to prefer to have eight electrons in their valence shell.

The main exception to the rule is hydrogen, which is at lowest energy when it has two electrons in its valence shell. 

Other notable exceptions are aluminum and boron, which can function well with six valence electrons; and some atoms beyond group three on the periodic table that can have over 8 electrons, including sulfur.  Additionally, some noble gasses can form compounds when expanding their valence shell.

The other tendency of atoms with regard to their electrons is to maintain a neutral charge. Only the noble gasses have zero charge with filled valence octets. All of the other elements have a charge when they have eight electrons all to themselves. The result of these two guiding principles is the explanation for much of the reactivity and bonding that is observed within atoms; atoms seeking to share electrons in a way that minimizes charge while fulfilling an octet in the valence shell.

----
The first and earliest definition of acids and bases was proposed in the 1800's by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius, who said that an '''acid''' was anything that dissolved in water to give up '''H+ ions''',Such as hydrochloric acid and a '''base''' was anything that dissolved in water to give up '''OH- ions''' such a sodium hydroxide.

The '''Brønsted-Lowry definiton''' of 1923 broadened this idea a bit:

:an '''acid''' is any '''proton donor''', and a '''base''' is any '''proton acceptor'''.

The focus of this definition is on donating and accepting protons, and is not limited to aqueous solution.

The Brønsted-Lowry definiton of acids and bases is one of two definitions we commonly use. The second definition deals not with protons but with electrons, and has a slightly different emphasis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In organic chemistry we look at the hybridization of electron orbitals in to something called '''molecular orbitals'''. 

[[Image:Sp3.jpg]]

The '''s''' and '''p''' orbitals in a carbon atom combine into four hybridized orbitals that repel each other in a shape much like that of four balloons tied together.

Remember what a tetrahedron looks like ?

The final section about &quot;Algebraic manipulation&quot; is really strange , i think the author must assume that the reader of that advanced topic &quot;Calculus&quot; already have this very basic knowledge introduced in that section.
i suggest omitting it to make the book more concise and aiming

Would it be worth noting in the Graphing Functions section that graphs are usually of the form y=mx+b, rather than the example which used x=my+b? i.e.:

Functions may be graphed by finding the value of f for various y and plotting the points (y, f(y)) in a Cartesian plane...

------------------------------------------------

2(x+2)/2 = x+2. That's not incorrect. Maybe you meant 2x+2/2 ≠ 2 (x+2)/2 = x+2? 

Is a function considered a variable or a rule? f(z) doesn't vary with x; f(x) doesn't vary with z. f(x) may be a variable, but f by itself is a rule or a mapping (or a &quot;machine&quot;, as textbooks say). y is a dependent variable because it is understood to vary with x -- y(x) is never used.

What's the plus function doing? + is more common; plus(2,2) is almost never used except in Lisp or something. At least call them add, subtract, divide, multiply instead. Using plus(plus(x,y),z) is not the best way to show grouping because (x+y)+z is more common. Even you use 1/(x+2) at the bottom (instead of divide(1,plus(x,2))). --[[User:Geoffrey|Geoffrey]] 15:37 23 Jul 2003 (UTC)

== Points ==
You have some good points (and one misreading):

I did not write &quot;2(x+2)/2 = x + 2&quot;, but rather &quot;2(x+2)/2 = (x+2)/2&quot;, and the latter ''is'' incorrect.

As for the issue of a function being a variable or rule, I do not make a distinction in these informal pages between the 'rule' (i.e., function), or the result of the rule (i.e., the value of the function).  The value of the function is indeed a variable.  Making a big deal about distinguishing the two (very different) concepts may only confuse the matter, but an astute reader make take things 'too' literally and notice inconsistancies as you did.  The best way of teaching functions is a matter of opinion.  Arguably, one should teach functions in a nonstandard way to expose readers to different perspectives or methods, but also arguably, the standard way of teaching functions is standard because of its superiority.

The use of functions plus(x, y) and times(x, y) is to emphasize that the reader has already been doing functions for a long time, and to give the reader something firm to latch onto to relate abstract concepts of arbitrary functions to specific, familar functions.  In particular, the composition of functions is confusing, but most people can compose the 'plus' and 'times' functions with ease.  Of course, writing out 'plus' and 'times' is somewhat unnecessary.

At [[User Talk:Eric119]] is some more discussion about [[Calculus/Functions]].

If you see anything that needs modification, just go ahead and modify it!

------------------------------------------------
''A graph is a locus of points in the Cartesian plane''

I think that the majority of people who can understand the phrase &quot;locus of points in the Cartesian plane&quot; probably already know what a graph is. I think the fact that the majority of us have done maths to a university or higher level is causing us to use language that may be over-complex for our target audience.

Hey, why take out my Example section in basic Calculus??

: Reverted to get rid of the lines, but reverted too far. Sorry. [[User:129.94.6.30|129.94.6.30]] 22:17, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC) ([[User:Dysprosia]], logged out)

Ok, thanks :)  The lines aren't formatting ppl want?

: Horizontal rules aren't pretty, and should be used sparingly. Nice exercise, by the way... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 20:49, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)

-----------------
Could someone please clarify the following?:
:''For instance, say that f is the function whose domain contains all positive real numbers that give you a square root of the input.

&lt;hr&gt;
I had something written, but I retract the question.  It was a really dumb question.  I really did need to brush up my calculus.  GEez

don't know meaning of symbols:
I took algebra 2 not too long ago and i have no idea what some of these symbols mean. for example the last function in the table of examples that ends in &quot;Takes an input and uses it as boundary values for an integration.&quot; the thing that sort of looks like a sideways 8, and the exact meaning of these [] when in this form: (a,b];[a,b). Any chance of adding the meaning of these? or at least tell me a place where i can find them?--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 04:04, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

:I think the last function on the table will be explained later. The sideways 8 stands for infinity. (a,b] is interval notation (first hit on google: http://id.mind.net/~zona/mmts/miscellaneousMath/intervalNotation/intervalNotation.html). And for the Set Notation the funny R means real numbers, and the funny E means the thing on the left is an element of the set on the right (x is an element of the set of real numbers).

Hrmm... but what happens with:

|&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{x+3}&lt;/math&gt;

When x is -3?  Isn't the function undefined at that point?
----------------------------------------------------------
&quot;A function f(x) has an inverse function if and only if f(x) is one-to-one.&quot; Is this true? It has to be onto function as well, isn't it?

== ? ==

it seemse that wiki may have some problems... Look at the section on function manipulation. The formatting seems to have gone all wonky, and I have no idea why. THere is one part where it randomly substitutes a formula from the top of the page, instead of what is written there. If anyone has thoughts on how to fix, please do!

== Problem sets ==

If this is supposed to be a textbook, where are the problem sets? It can be difficult to just read this and remember it all. I have half a mind to write a problem set. In fact, here's a few problems to get started (I'll leave the finishin' of it to someone more qualified... unless I get fed up):

Find the inverse of the following functions:

:1. &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3x^{2} + 4x&lt;/math&gt;
:2. &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1+x}{2+x}&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluate:

:3.
::&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)&lt;/math&gt; where
:::&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; and
:::&lt;math&gt;g(x) = 2x^{2}+3&lt;/math&gt;

== Translation left/right ==

Reading this, I got kind of a headache:

Horizontal translation by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; units '''left''' : &lt;math&gt;f(x + a)&lt;/math&gt;

Horizontal translation by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; units '''right''': &lt;math&gt;f(x - a)&lt;/math&gt;

Is it possible that left and right have been interchanged? Please help me out ?

[[User:Andre anckaert|Andre anckaert]] ([[User talk:Andre anckaert|talk]]) 15:41, 15 January 2010 (UTC)
:It's a little tricky to get your head around. Take f(x) = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Now, translate it left (you'll see): f(x + 1). What does x have to equal for y to equal zero (for the function to return zero)? It has to be -1, meaning, when y = 0, x must be -1, so the function was translated left. That's the best way I can think to explain it, hope it helped if you were still confused. [[User:DrSturm|DrSturm]] ([[User talk:DrSturm|talk]]) 16:38, 26 May 2010 (UTC)

== important functions - quadratic ==

I am no mathematician and so will not consider editing this myself but the text as it is at present reads:

&quot; A polynomial of the second degree. Its graph is a parabola, unless a = 0. (Don't worry if you don't know what this is.) &quot;

I suspect the parenthesis text is reassuring the reader that knowledge of the parabola is not important, rather than not understanding when a=0 so it would be better written as: 

&quot;A polynomial of the second degree. Its graph is a parabola, (Don't worry if you don't know what a parabola is.) unless a = 0.&quot;

--[[User:JohnH99|JohnH99]] ([[User talk:JohnH99|talk]]) 19:37, 18 April 2010 (UTC)

:Your edit would be fine!  Trust yourself and be bold, there are very few mathematicians around here.  Nothing invalidates the mathematics you know and every editor here (or on any wikimedia project) is on equal footing. Holding a mathematics degree gains you no additional credit or influence.  People are supposed to be judged solely on the quality of their edits, and I have found many non-mathematicians do a really great job editing math articles.  It seems they still remember how to explain the confusing parts, where if you've been studying it for 20 years, you forget which parts were confusing.   And if you make a mistake then (hopefully) someone will fix and and be civil in doing so. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 20:09, 18 April 2010 (UTC)

== A function in everyday life has X, Y, and Z, not just X and Y ==

''This is a function of two real variables (a location is described by two values - an x and a y ) which results in a vector (which is something that can be used to hold a direction and an intensity).'' 

Real life is not 2 dimensional, therefore, in my mind anyway, a wind vector should have x, y and z parameters.

== Formal definition ==

Well, saying that a function can be formally defined as, or in terms of, a concept of a &quot;rule&quot; is simply wrong on several counts.

First, a formal definition can only use the term &quot;rule&quot; if this term has already been formally defined for denoting a mathematical 
object, and in a way which does not rely on the concept of a &quot;function&quot; already. E.g. you cannot rely on &quot;computation&quot;, since that
formal concept relies on Turing Machines, and these are built out of functions.

Second, the image is misleading. If two functions f and g from R to R are defined by f(x)=x+x and g(x)=2x, then f and g are defined
by different rules; one relies on the addition function, the other on the multiplication function. So if functions are the same as
rules, then these are distinct functions. However, this is not the view actually taken in mathematics; they are identical functions,
since their domains and ranges are identical, and f(x)=g(x) holds for all x in the common domain. Moreover, you will not be allowed
to say that the derivative of the function that maps x to x^2 is equal to either of x+x or 2x, since derivative is defined by yet 
another rule, which involves a limit of a differential quotient. 

It isn't intuitive either. When I stumble out of bed in the morning, find a pair of two identical looking socks, and master to put 
one on each foot, I know that in the end I will have successfully determined a function from the pair of socks to my pair of feet, 
and yet there is no rule whatsoever involved for determining this function. For similar reasons it doesn't even work well to explain
informally that a function is something like a &quot;rule&quot;. It blocks students from making any sense of the Choice Axiom, and this is not
fortunate for those who want to go on to study Analysis and measure theory. [[Special:Contributions/119.71.71.131|119.71.71.131]] ([[User talk:119.71.71.131|discuss]]) 06:02, 4 October 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|D programming language}}

The goal for this book is to create a complete, free, open-content, well-organized online book for the D programming language.

D is a programming language being designed as a successor to C++.  Until this page gets better written and more informative, the D home can be found [http://dlang.org here].

==Introduction==
This book aims at beginners learning D language. It will cover all the language basics and some design aspects. In addition it will introduce topics like multi-threading, GUI programming and standard library to get you started with real-world applications.

==Overview==
To quote [[w:Walter_Bright|Walter Bright]], the author of the D Programming Language:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
D is a general purpose systems and applications programming language. It is a higher level language than [[w:C++|C++]], but retains the ability to write high performance code and interface directly with the [[w:operating system|operating system]] [[w:API|API's]] and with [[w:hardware|hardware]]. D is well suited to writing medium to large scale million line programs with teams of developers. D is easy to learn, provides many capabilities to aid the programmer, and is well suited to [[w:aggressive compiler optimization technology|aggressive compiler optimization technology]]. 

D is not a [[w:scripting language|scripting language]], nor an [[w:interpreted language|interpreted language]]. It doesn't come with a VM, a religion, or an overriding philosophy. It's a practical language for practical programmers who need to get the job done quickly, reliably, and leave behind maintainable, easy to understand code. 

D is the culmination of decades of experience implementing compilers for many diverse languages, and attempting to construct large projects using those languages. D draws inspiration from those other languages (most especially C++) and tempers it with experience and real world practicality.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


D is a [[w:Strongly-typed programming language|statically-typed]], [[w:multiparadigm programming language|multi-paradigm]] language supporting [[w:imperative programming|imperative programming]], [[w:object-oriented programming|object-oriented programming]], and [[w:Template metaprogramming|template metaprogramming]]. It also supports [[w:generic programming|generics]] and [[w:Design by contract|design by contract]].

{{sectstub}}

==Main features of D==

D has many features not seen in C++, implementing [[w:design by contract|design by contract]], [[w:unit testing|unit testing]], true [[w:module (programming)|modules]], [[w:garbage collection (computer science)|automatic memory management]] (garbage collection), first class [[w:array|array]]s, [[w:associative array|associative array]]s, [[w:dynamic array|dynamic array]]s, [[w:array slicing|array slicing]], [[w:nested function|nested function]]s, [[w:inner class|inner class]]es, [[w:Closure (computer science)|closure]]s (anonymous functions), and has a reengineered [[w:Template (programming)|template]] syntax. D retains C++'s ability to do [[w:Low-level programming language|low-level coding]], and adds to it with support for an integrated [[w:inline assembler|inline assembler]]. C++ [[w:multiple inheritance|multiple inheritance]] is replaced by [[w:single inheritance|single inheritance]] with [[w:Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] and [[w:mixin|mixin]]s. D's declaration, statement and expression [[w:syntax|syntax]] closely matches that of C++.

The [[w:inline assembler|inline assembler]] typifies the differentiation between D and application languages like Java and C#. An inline assembler allows a programmer to enter machine-specific [[w:assembly|assembly]] code alongside standard D code&amp;mdash;a technique often used by systems programmers to access the low-level features of the [[w:central processing unit|processor]] needed to run programs that interface directly with the underlying [[w:computer hardware|hardware]], such as [[w:operating system|operating system]]s and [[w:device driver|device driver]]s.

Built into the language is a [[w:documentation generator|documentation generator]] called [[w:Ddoc|Ddoc]].

===Memory management===
Memory is usually managed with [[w:garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], but specific objects can be finalized immediately when they go out of scope. Explicit memory management is possible using the [[w:Operator overloading|overloaded operators]] new and delete, as well as simply calling [[w:C programming language|C]]'s [[w:malloc|malloc]] and free directly. It is also possible to disable garbage collection for individual objects, or even for the entire program if more control over memory management is desired.

===Interaction with other systems===
[[w:C programming language|C]]'s [[w:Application binary interface|ABI (Application Binary Interface)]] is supported as well as all of C's fundamental and derived types, enabling direct access
to existing C code and libraries. C's standard [[w:library (computer science)|library]] is part of standard D.

In D 1.0, C++'s ABI is not supported, although it can access C++ code that is written to the C ABI, and can access C++ [[w:Component Object Model|COM (Component Object Model)]] code. D 2 already supports some interaction with the C++ ABI.

===Implementation===
Current D implementations [[w:compile|compile]] directly into [[w:native code|native code]] for efficient execution.

==Getting and installing D==
The Digital Mars D compiler can be obtained from the digital mars website. http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html You will need the two files dmd.zip and dmc.zip.  According to the manual both files should be extracted into a root directory or one without spaces or other special characters.  The location of link.exe should then be added to the path.  D programs can now be compiled by calling 'dmd'.

===Win32: Example of configuration 1 (dmd)===

Create a batch file &quot;dmd_vars.bat&quot; and move it to a directory that is included in the path:

&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
@echo off

echo Setting up a dmd environment...

set PATH=c:\dm\bin;c:\dmd\bin
rem ;%SystemRoot%\System32
set LIB=c:\dmd\lib;c:\dm\lib

echo PATH set to %PATH%
&lt;/source&gt;

Then:

*Open a Command Window (cmd.exe)
*Call &quot;dmd_vars.bat&quot; before compiling something
*Call &quot;dmd hello.d -ofhello_world&quot; for example, which creates &quot;hello_world.exe&quot;

Note: This works well, even if you have other compilers/tools installed (which might also have link.exe/make.exe etc.)

==Your first D programs==

[[/First Program Examples/]]

With Tango library the classic hello world program is:

 &lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
 import tango.io.Console;
 void main() 
 { 
  Cout(&quot;Hello, World&quot;).newline;
 }
 &lt;/source&gt;

[[/Alternate Program Examples/]]

With the Phobos library the classic hello world program is:
 &lt;source lang=&quot;D&quot;&gt;
 import std.stdio;
 void main() 
 { 
  writefln(&quot;Hello, World&quot;);
 }
 &lt;/source&gt;

==Compilation==

Compiling hello world:

===dmd===

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
dmd hello.d -ofhello
&lt;/source&gt;

===gdc===

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
gdc hello.d -o hello
&lt;/source&gt;

----
Many more linear alkanes can be formed by adding one additional carbon to the end of a chain of carbons. Ethane is the shortest chain with two carbons but DNA is known to have carbon chains containing millions of linked carbons.

Alkanes are named based on the number of carbons in their longest chain:

===Naming carbon chains up to ten===
*[[Organic Chemistry/Alkanes/Methane|methane]] (1 carbon)
*[[Organic Chemistry/Alkanes/Ethane|ethane]] (2 carbons)
*propane (3 carbons)
*butane (4 carbons)
*pentane (5 carbons)
*hexane (6 carbons)
*heptane (7 carbons)
*octane (8 carbons)
*nonane (9 carbons)
*decane (10 carbons)

The prefixes on the first four are from an obscure system but you should be familiar with the rest.

'''Propane''' and '''butane''' are gases at standard temperature and pressure and are used commonly in lighters. '''Pentane''' on down the list are liquids at STP. '''Octane''' is the same as the octane in your gas tank.

You may also want to name hydrocarbon chains of more then ten carbons. Here is a list for your reference:

===Naming longer carbon chains===
*undecane (11 carbons)
*dodecane (12 carbons)
*tridecane (13 carbons)
*tetradecane (14 carbons)
*pentadecane (15 carbons)
*hexadecane (16 carbons)
*heptadecane (17 carbons)
*octadecane (18 carbons)
*nonadecane (19 carbons)
*icosane (20 carbons)
*henicosane (21 carbons)
*docosane (22 carbons)
*tricosane (23 carbons)
........
*triacontane (30 carbons)
*tetracontane (40 carbons)
*pentacontane (50 carbons)

etc...

As the carbon chains get longer, molecules get relatively heavier and tend to move from being gases at [[Standard Temperature and Pressure|STP]] to liquids to waxy solids.

Alkanes are the simplest organic molecules, consisting of only carbon and hydrogen and with only single bonds between carbon atoms. Alkanes are used as the basis for naming the majority of organic compounds (their '''nomenclature''').  Alkanes have the general formula C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;.  

=Introduction=

[[image:Dimethylpropane.png|thumb|2,2-dimethylpropane or neopentane.&lt;br /&gt;An example of an alkane]]
Alkanes are the simplest and least reactive [[w:hydrocarbon|hydrocarbon]] species containing only carbons and hydrogens.  They are commercially very important, being the principal constituent of gasoline and lubricating oils and are extensively employed in organic chemistry; though the role of pure alkanes (such as hexanes) is delegated mostly to solvents.

The distinguishing feature of an alkane, making it distinct from other compounds that also exclusively contain carbon and hydrogen, is its lack of [[w:unsaturation|unsaturation]].  That is to say, it contains no double or triple bonds, which are highly reactive in organic chemistry.

Though not totally devoid of reactivity, their lack of reactivity under most laboratory conditions makes them a relatively uninteresting, though very important component of organic chemistry.  As you will learn about later, the energy confined within the carbon-carbon bond and the carbon-hydrogen bond is quite high and their rapid oxidation produces a large amount of heat, typically in the form of fire.

As said it is important, not considered very important component in the chemistry.

== Introductory Definitions ==
'''Organic compounds''' contain '''carbon''' and '''hydrogen''' by definition and usually other elements (e.g. '''nitrogen''' and '''oxygen''') as well. (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not an organic compound because it has no hydrogen).

'''Hydrocarbons''' are organic compounds that contain carbon and hydrogen only.

'''Alkanes''' are hydrocarbons or organic compounds made up of only carbon-carbon single bonds (as opposed to double and triple bonds).  The simplest alkane is '''[[w:methane|methane]].'''

==Methane==
&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' &lt;br&gt; [[w:Alkane#Molecular_geometry|Alkanes]]
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Methane, (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, one carbon bonded to four hydrogens) is the simplest organic molecule. It is a gas at [[w:Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure|standard temperature and pressure (STP)]].

| Methane
|}

This is a flattened, two-dimensional representation of methane that you will see commonly. The true three-dimensional form of methane does not have any 90 degree angles between bonded hydrogens. The bonds point to the four corners of a [[w:Tetrahedron|tetrahedron]], forming cos&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(-1/3) ≈ 109.5 degree bond angles.
[[Image:Sp3.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A balloon model of the electron clouds repelling each other in a molecule of methane.]]

==Ethane==
Two carbons singly bonded to each other with six hydrogens is called '''[[w:Ethane|ethane]]'''.

[[Image:Ethane-flat.png|80px]]

Ethane is the second simplest hydrocarbon molecule. It can be thought of as two methane molecules attached to each other, but with two fewer hydrogen atoms.

There are several common methods to draw organic molecules. You will use them interchangeably although sometimes one will work better for one situation or another.

=Drawing alkanes=
When writing out the alkane structures, you can use different levels of shorthand depending on the needs at hand in hand. For example, pentane can be written out. Its formula is C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:Pentane.svg|150px]],

or CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,

or CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,

or minimized to [[File:Pentane-2D-Skeletal.svg|100px]]

==Line drawing shorthand==
Although non-cyclic alkanes are called straight-chain alkanes they are technically made of kinked chains. This is reflected in the line-drawing method. Each ending point and bend in the line represents one carbon atom and each short line represents one single carbon-carbon bond. Every carbon is assumed to be surrounded with a maximum number of hydrogen atoms unless shown otherwise.

|-
| ''Propane, butane, pentane''
|}

Structures drawn without explicitly showing all carbon atoms are often called &quot;skeletal&quot; structures, since they represent the skeleton or the backbone of the molecule. In organic chemistry, carbon is very frequently used, so chemists know that there is a carbon atom at the endpoints of every line that is not specifically labeled.

=Conformations=

'''Conformers''', also called '''conformational isomers''', or '''rotational isomers''', are arrangements of the same molecule made transiently different by the rotation in space about one or more single bonds.

Other types of isomer can only be converted from one form to another by ''breaking'' bonds, but conformational isomers can be made simply by ''rotating'' bonds.

==Newman projections==

Newman projections are drawings used to represent different positions of parts of molecules relative to each other in space. Remember that single bonds can rotate in space if not impeded. Newman projections represent different positions of rotating molecule parts.

{|
|-
| Conformers interconvert readily, normally thousands of times a second as parts of molecules spin.

| In the following drawings, methyl groups are on the front and back ends of the molecule and a circle represents all that lies between.
| &lt;div align=center&gt;[[Image:Methylnewman.png]]&lt;small&gt; ''Note: This is how methyl groups are represented in Newman projections'' &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
|}
&lt;center&gt;

|-

|
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Eclipsednewmanprojection.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|
&lt;center&gt;'''Staggered conformation'''&lt;/center&gt;
|
&lt;center&gt;'''Eclipsed conformation'''&lt;br&gt; (front end overlaps the back)&lt;/center&gt;
|}&lt;/center&gt;

==Conformations and energy==
Different conformations have different potential energies. The staggered conformation is at a lower potential energy than the eclipsed conformation, and is favored. In ethane, the barrier to rotation is approximately 25 kJ/mol, indicating that each pair of eclipsed hydrogens raises the energy by about 8 kJ/mol. This number also applies to other organic compounds which have hydrogen atoms at similar distances from each other. At very low temperatures all conformations revert to the stabler, lower energy staggered conformation.

==Steric effects==
Steric effects have to do with size. Two bulky objects run into each other and invade each others space. If we replace one or more hydrogen atoms on the above Newman projections with a methyl or other group, the potential energy goes up especially for the eclipsed conformations.

Lets look at a Newman projection of butane as it rotates counterclockwise around its axes.

&lt;center&gt;

|
 || &lt;center&gt;Gauche&lt;/center&gt; ||
 || &lt;center&gt;Eclipsed&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;


When the larger groups overlap they repel each other more strongly than do hydrogen, and the potential energy goes up.

==Entropy==
Entropy, represented as a '''&amp;Delta;S''', is a mathematical construct that represents disorder or probability. Natural systems want to find the lowest energy or organization possible, which translates to the highest entropy.

''A note about potential energy: If you are rusty on this, remember the analogy of a big rock pushed to the top of a hill. At the top it has a maximum of potential energy. When you push it and allow it to roll down the hill the potential energy stored in it is transformed into kinetic energy that can be used to generate heat or smash something. ''

Notice that statistically, the ethane molecule has twice as many opportunities to be in the gauche conformation as in the anti conformation. However, because the Gauche configuration brings the methyl groups closer together in space, this generates high energy steric interactions and do not occur without the input of energy. Thus, the butane molecules shown will almost never be found in such unfavorable conformations.

===Wurtz reaction===
Wurtz reaction is coupling of haloalkanes using sodium metal in solvent like dry ether&lt;p&gt; 

&lt;B&gt; 2R-X + 2Na →  R-R + 2Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;p&gt;
=====Mechanism=====

The reaction consists of a halogen-metal exchange involving the free radical species R• (in a similar fashion to the formation of a Grignard reagent and then the carbon-carbon bond formation in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.)

One electron from the metal is transferred to the halogen to produce a metal halide and an alkyl radical.
:R-X + M → R• + M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The alkyl radical then accepts an electron from another metal atom to form an alkyl anion and the metal becomes cationic. This intermediate has been isolated in a several cases.
:R• + M → R&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

The nucleophilic carbon of the alkyl anion then displaces the halide in an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction, forming a new carbon-carbon covalent bond.
:R&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + R-X → R-R + M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

===Clemmensen reduction===
Clemmensen reduction is a reduction of ketones (or aldehydes) to alkanes using zinc amalgam and hydrochloric acid
[[Image:Clemmensen Reduction Scheme.png|center|300px|The Clemmensen reduction]]
The Clemmensen reduction is particularly effective at reducing aryl-alkyl ketones. With aliphatic or cyclic ketones, zinc metal reduction is much more effective&lt;p&gt;
The substrate must be stable in the strongly acidic conditions of the Clemmensen reduction. Acid sensitive substrates should be reacted in the Wolff-Kishner reduction, which utilizes strongly basic conditions; a further, milder method is the Mozingo reduction. As a result of Clemmensen Reduction, the carbon of the carbonyl group involved is converted from sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridisation to sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridisation. The oxygen atom is lost in the form of one molecule of water.
===Wolff-Kishner reduction===
[[Image:Wolff-Kishner Summary V.1.svg|center|400px|The Wolff-Kishner reduction]]
The Wolff–Kishner reduction is a chemical reaction that fully reduces a ketone (or aldehyde) to an alkane. Condensation of the carbonyl compound with hydrazine forms the hydrazone, and treatment with base induces the reduction of the carbon coupled with oxidation of the hydrazine to gaseous nitrogen, to yield the corresponding alkane.
=====Mechanism=====

[[Image:Wolff-Kishner-Huang Reduction.png|center|600px|The mechanism of the Wolff-Kishner reduction]]

The mechanism first involves the formation of the hydrazone in a mechanism that is probably analogous to the formation of an imine. Successive deprotonations eventually result in the evolution of nitrogen. The mechanism can be justified by the evolution of nitrogen as the thermodynamic driving force. This reaction is also used to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones.

===Mozingo Reduction===
A thioketal is first produced by reaction of the ketone with an appropriate thiol. The product is then hydrogenolyzed to the alkane, using Raney nickel

= Properties of Alkanes =
&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' &lt;br&gt; [[w:Alkane#Properties|Alkane properties]]
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Alkanes are '''not very reactive''' when compared with other chemical species. This is because the backbone carbon atoms in alkanes have attained their octet of electrons through forming four covalent bonds (the maximum allowed number of bonds under the octet rule; which is why carbon's valence number is 4). These four bonds formed by carbon in alkanes are sigma bonds, which are more stable than other types of bond because of the greater overlap of carbon's atomic orbitals with neighboring atoms' atomic orbitals. To make alkanes react, the input of additional energy is needed; either through heat or radiation.

Gasoline is a mixture of the alkanes and unlike many chemicals, can be stored for long periods and transported without problem. It is only when ignited that it has enough energy to continue reacting. This property makes it difficult for alkanes to be converted into other types of organic molecules. (There are only a few ways to do this).  Alkanes are also '''less dense than water''', as one can observe, oil, an alkane, floats on water.

Alkanes are '''non-polar solvents'''. Since only C and H atoms are present, alkanes are nonpolar. Alkanes are [[w:Miscible|immiscible]] in water but freely miscible in other non-polar solvents.

Because alkanes contain only carbon and hydrogen, combustion produces compounds that contain only carbon, hydrogen, and/or oxygen. Like other hydrocarbons, combustion under most circumstances produces mainly carbon dioxide and water. However, alkanes require more heat to combust and do not release as much heat when they combust as other classes of hydrocarbons. Therefore, combustion of alkanes produces higher concentrations of organic compounds containing oxygen, such as aldehydes and ketones, when combusting at the same temperature as other hydrocarbons.

The general formula for alkanes is C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2N+2&lt;/sub&gt;; the simplest possible alkane is therefore methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The next simplest is ethane, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;; the series continues indefinitely. Each carbon atom in an alkane has sp³ hybridization.

Alkanes are also known as paraffins, or collectively as the paraffin series. These terms are also used for alkanes whose carbon atoms form a single, unbranched chain. Branched-chain alkanes are called isoparaffins.

'''Methane''' through '''Butane''' are very flammable gases at standard temperature and pressure (STP). '''Pentane''' is an extremely flammable liquid boiling at 36 °C and boiling points and melting points steadily increase from there; octadecane is the first alkane which is solid at room temperature. Longer alkanes are waxy solids; candle wax generally has between C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; chains. As chain length increases ultimately we reach polyethylene, which consists of carbon chains of indefinite length, which is generally a hard white solid.

== Chemical properties ==
Alkanes react only very poorly with ionic or other polar substances. The pKa values of all alkanes are above 50, and so they are practically inert to acids and bases. This inertness is the source of the term paraffins (Latin para + affinis, with the meaning here of &quot;lacking affinity&quot;). In crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

However redox reactions of alkanes, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon (−4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen leads to combustion without any smoke; with halogens, substitution. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes.

Free radicals, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.

In highly branched alkanes and cycloalkanes, the bond angles may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5°) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as steric hinderance, and can substantially increase the reactivity.

=Introduction to Nomenclature=

Before we can understand reactions in organic chemistry, we must begin with a basic knowledge of naming the compounds. The [[w:IUPAC|IUPAC]] [[wikt:nomenclature|nomenclature]] is a system on which most organic chemists have agreed to provide guidelines to allow them to learn from each others' works. Nomenclature, in other words, provides a foundation of language for organic chemistry.

The names of all alkanes end with ''-ane''.  Whether or not the carbons are linked together end-to-end in a ring (called ''cyclic alkanes'' or ''cycloalkanes'') or whether they contain side chains and branches, the name of every carbon-hydrogen chain that lacks any double bonds or functional groups will end with the suffix ''-ane''.

Alkanes with unbranched carbon chains are simply named by the number of carbons in the chain.  The first four members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:
# CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = '''methane''' = one hydrogen-saturated carbon
# C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = '''ethane''' = two hydrogen-saturated carbons
# C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = '''propane''' = three hydrogen-saturated carbons
# C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = '''butane''' = four hydrogen-saturated carbons

Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ''-ane'' to the appropriate numerical multiplier, except the terminal ''-a'' is removed from the basic numerical term. Hence, C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is called ''pentane'', C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; is called ''hexane'', C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; is called ''heptane'' and so forth. 

Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix ''n-'' (for normal) to distinguish them from branched-chain alkanes having the same number of carbon atoms. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers: e.g. ''n-hexane'' is a neurotoxin while its branched-chain isomers are not.

==Number of hydrogens to carbons==
This equation describes the relationship between the number of hydrogen and carbon atoms in alkanes:

:'''H = 2C + 2'''

where &quot;C&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are used to represent the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms present in one molecule. If C = 2, then H = 6.

Many textbooks put this in the following format:

:'''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;'''

where &quot;C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; and &quot;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; represent the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms present in one molecule. If C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 3, then H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2(3) + 2 = 8. (For this formula look to the &quot;n&quot; for the number, the &quot;C&quot; and the &quot;H&quot; letters themselves do not change.)

Progressively longer hydrocarbon chains can be made and are named systematically, depending on the number of carbons in the longest chain.

==Naming carbon chains up to twelve==
*methane (1 carbon)
*ethane (2 carbons)
*propane (3 carbons)
*butane (4 carbons)
*pentane (5 carbons)
*hexane (6 carbons)
*heptane (7 carbons)
*octane (8 carbons)
*nonane (9 carbons)
*decane (10 carbons)
*undecane (11 carbons)
*dodecane (12 carbons)

The prefixes of the first three are the contribution of a German Chemist, August Wilhelm Hoffman, who also suggested the name quartane for 4 carbons in 1866. However, the but- prefix had already been in use since the 1820s and the name quartane never caught on. He also recommended the endings to use the vowels, a, e, i (or y), o, and u, or -ane, -ene, -ine or -yne, -one, and -une. Again, only the first three caught on for single, double, and triple bonds and -one was already in use for ketones. Pent, hex, hept, oct, and dec all come from the ancient Greek numbers (penta, hex, hepta, octa, deka) and oddly, non, from the Latin novem. For longer-chained alkanes we use the special IUPAC multiplying affixes. For example, pentadecane signifies an alkane with 5+10 = 15 carbon atoms. For chains of length 30, 40, 50, and so on the basic prefix is added to -contane. For example, C&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;116&lt;/sub&gt; is named as heptapentacontane. When the chain contains 20-29 atoms we have an exception. C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; is known as icosane, and then we have, e.g. tetracosane (eliding the &quot;i&quot; when necessary). For the length 100 we have &quot;hecta&quot; but for 200, 300 ... 900 we have &quot;dicta&quot;, &quot;tricta&quot;, and so on, eliding the &quot;i&quot; on &quot;icta&quot; when necessary; for 1000 we have &quot;kilia&quot; but for 2000 and so on, &quot;dilia&quot;, &quot;trilia&quot;, and so on, eliding the &quot;i&quot; on &quot;ilia&quot; when necessary.

We then put all of the prefixes together in reverse order. The alkane with 9236 carbon atoms is then hexatridinoniliane.

== Isomerism ==
The atoms in alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in many ways, leading to a large number of potential different configurations (isomers). So-called &quot;normal&quot; alkanes have a linear, unbranched configuration, but the ''n-'' isomer of any given alkane is only one of potentially hundreds or even possibly millions of configurations for that number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in some sort of chain arrangement.&lt;br&gt;Isomerism is defined as the compound having same moleculer formula the formula which present the different moleculer formula arrangement are called as Isomerism.&lt;br&gt;e.g.- The molecular formula for butane is C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.

The number of isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms in a given alkane molecule; for alkanes with as few as 12 carbon atoms, there are over three hundred and fifty-five possible forms the molecule can take!

==Branched chains==
Carbon is able to bond in all four directions and easily forms strong bonds with other carbon atoms. When one carbon is bonded to more than two other carbons it forms a branch. 
{|

|}

Above you see a carbon bonded to three and four other carbons. 

:Note: a methane group is called a '''methyl''' group when it is bonded to another carbon instead of a fourth hydrogen. &amp;ndash;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The common system has naming convention for carbon chains as they relate to branching. 

:'''n-alkanes''' are linear
:'''iso-alkanes''' have one branch R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH—
:'''neo-alkanes''' have two branches R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C—

''Note: &quot;R&quot; in organic chemistry is a placeholder that can represent any carbon group.

==Constitutional isomers==

One of the most important characteristics of carbon is its ability to form '''several relatively strong bonds''' per atom. It is for this reason that many scientists believe that carbon is the only element that could be the basis for the many complicated molecules needed to support a living being.

One carbon atom can have attached to it not just the one or two other carbons needed to form a single chain but can bond to up to four other carbons. It is this ability to bond multiply that allows isomerism.

'''Isomers''' are two molecules with the same molecular formula but different physical arrangements. '''Constitutional isomers'''  have their atoms arranged in a different order. A constitutional isomer of butane has a main chain that is forked at the end and one carbon shorter in its main chain than butane.

== Naming Alkanes ==
There are several ways or systems for the '''nomenclature''', or naming, of organic molecules, but just two main ones.

#The traditional, non-systematic names. Many of these linger on, especially for simpler or more common molecules.
#The systematic '''[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC IUPAC]''' (''eye-YOU-pack (International Union of Pure And Applied Chemistry)'') names.

The IUPAC system is necessary for complicated organic compounds. It gives a series of unified rules for naming a large compound by conceptually dividing it up into smaller, more manageable nameable units.

Many traditional (non-IUPAC) names are still commonly used in industry, especially for simpler and more common chemicals, as the traditional names were already entrenched.

==IUPAC naming rules==
&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gold; background:cornsilk; padding: 4px; text-align: center; float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''On WP:'' &lt;br&gt; [[w:IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC naming]]
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
#Find the longest carbon chain, identify the end near which the most [[Wikipedia:substituent|substituents]] are located, and number the carbons sequentially from that end. This will be the parent chain.
#Consider all other carbon groups as substituents.
#Alphabetize the substituents.
#Number the substituents according to the carbon to which they are attached. If numbering can be done in more than one way, use the numbering system that results in the smallest numbers.

Substituents are named like a parent, and replacing the ''-ane'' ending with ''-yl''.

===Numbering===
[[Image:237trimethyloctanelines.png]]

The above molecule is numbered as follows:

[[Image:237trimethyloctane.png]]

2,3,7-Trimethyloctane

[[Image:267trimethyloctane.png]]

'''Not''' 2,6,7-Trimethyloctane.
Remember, number so as to give the smallest numbers to the substituents.

===Alphabetizing===
[[Image:3ethyl3methylpentane.png]]

3-Ethyl-3-methylpentane

''Ethyl'' is listed before ''methyl'' for alphabetizing purposes.

== Branched Substituents ==
===Naming branched substituents===
[[Image:3-(1-methylethyl)-2,4-dimet.png]]

3-(1-methylethyl)-2,4-dimethylpentane

The main chain in the drawing is numbered 1-5. The main part of the branched substituent, an ethyl group, is numbered 1' and 2'. The methyl substituent off of the ethyl substituent is not numbered in the drawing.

To name the compound, put the whole branched substituent name in parentheses and then number and alphabetize as if a simple substituent.

== Common system ==
Some prefixes from the common system are accepted in the IUPAC system.

For alphabetization purposes, '''iso-''' and '''neo-''' are considered part of the name, and alphabetized. '''Sec-''' and '''tert-''' are not considered an alphabetizable part of the name.

(In the following images, the '''R-''' represents any carbon structure.)

=== Iso- ===


'''Iso-''' can be used for substituents that branch at the second-to-last carbon and end with two methyls. An isobutyl has four carbons total:

[[Image:Isobutyl.png]] ''Isobutyl''

=== Sec- ===

[[Image:Sec-.png]]

'''Sec-''' can be used for substituents that branch at the first carbon .

=== Neo- ===

'''Neo-''' refers to a substituent whose second-to-last carbon of the chain is trisubstituted (has three methyl groups attached to it). A neo-pentyl has five carbons total.

[[Image:Neopentyl.png]] ''Neopentyl''

=== Tert- ===

[[Image:Tert-.png]]

'''Tert-''' is short for '''tertiary''' and refers to a substituent whose first carbon has three other carbon groups attached to it.

To measure acid strength of a compound, scientist typically use a quantity called '''pKa'''. It is defined as

&lt;math&gt; pKa = -log(Ka)&lt;/math&gt;

where Ka is the acid dissocation constant.  Stronger acids have small pKa values, where as weaker acids have higher pKa values.

= Stereoisomers =

'''Stereoisomers''' are a type of isomer where the order of the atoms in the two molecules is the same but their arrangement in space is different.

To understand this we need to take a look at the ways that organic molecules can and cannot move. Again, usingthree-dimensional models is a great tool to visualize this and almost essential for most people to grasp these concepts clearly. 

With cyclo-alkanes, we observe that a group placed on one side of a ring stays on that same side. Except in very large rings (13+ carbons) the carbons are not free to rotate all of the way around their axes. This means that a group that is axial will not move into an equatorial position, and vice versa.

'''Stereoisomerism''' is the arrangement of atoms in molecules whose connectivity remains the same but their arrangement in space is different in each isomer.

The two main types of stereoisomerism are:
* DiaStereomerism (including 'cis-trans isomerism')
* Optical Isomerism (also known as 'enantiomerism' and 'chirality')

== Cis-trans Isomerism ==
''Main article:'' [[Organic_Chemistry/Chirality/Diastereomers|Diastereomers]]

Cis/trans isomerism occurs when a double bond is present, because the pi bond involved prevents that bond from being &quot;twisted&quot; the same way that a single bond can be.  A good example is 1,2-dichloroethene: C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Consider the two examples below:
[[Image:Dichloroethene.png|center|200px|Dichloroethene isomers]]
The two molecules shown above are ''cis''-1,2-dichloroethene and ''trans''-1,2-dichloroethene.

This is more specifically an example of diastereomerism. These two molecules are stereoisomers because the two carbon atoms cannot be rotated relative to each other, due to the rigidity caused by the pi bond between them. Therefore, they are not &quot;superimposeable&quot; - they are not identical, and cannot take each other's place. However, the isomers are not mirror images of one another, so they are not enantiomers; therefore they must be diastereomers.

Diastereomers usually have different chemical and physical properties and can exhibit dramatically different biological activity.

[[Image:Cis-2-butene.PNG|right|frame|Cis-2-butene]][[Image:Trans-2-butene.PNG|right|frame|Trans-2-butene]]

There are two forms of these isomers; the ''cis'' and ''trans'' versions. The form in which the substituent hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the bond that doesn't allow rotation is called ''cis''; the form in which the hydrogens are on opposite sides of the bond is called ''trans''. An example of a small hydrocarbon displaying cis-trans isomerism is 2-butene.

Alicyclic compounds can also display cis-trans isomerism. As an example of a geometric isomer due to a ring structure, consider 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane:

== Optical Isomerism ==

''Main article:'' [[Organic_Chemistry/Chirality|Chirality]]

Optical isomers are stereoisomers formed when asymmetric centers are present, for example, a carbon with four different groups bonded to it. Enantiomers are two optical isomers (i.e. isomers that are reflections of each other). Every stereocenter in one isomer has the opposite configuration in the other.

Compounds that are enantiomers of each other have the same physical properties, except for the direction in which they rotate polarized light and how they interact with different optical isomers of other compounds.

In nature, most biological compounds, such as amino acids, occur as single enantiomers. As a result, different enantiomers of a compound may have substantially different biological effects.

When a molecule has more than one source of asymmetry, two optical isomers may be neither perfect reflections of each other nor superimposeable: some but not all stereocenters are inverted. These molecules are diastereomers, not enantiomers. Diastereomers seldom have the same physical properties.

[[Image:Chiral molecures example.svg|right|thumbnail|300px|The two enantiomers of bromochlorofluoromethane and their relationship.]]
Optical isomerism is a form of isomerism (specifically stereoisomerism) where the two different isomers are the same in every way except being non-superposable [1] mirror images of each other. Optical isomers are known as chiral molecules (pronounced ki-rall) .

'''Cycloalkanes''' are hydrocarbons containing one or more rings. (Alkanes without rings are referred to as '''aliphatic'''.)

[[File:Propan Keilstrich.svg|130px]] → [[File:Cyklopropan.svg|110px]] + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Under certain reaction conditions, propane can be transformed into cyclopropane. (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes off as a sideproduct.)

[[Image:Cyclopropaneline.png]] Cyclopropane (unstable, lots of ring strain)

[[Image:Cyclobutaneline.png]] Cyclobutane (ring strain)

[[Image:Cyclopentaneline.png]] Cyclopentane (little ring strain)

[[Image:Cyclohexaneline.png]] Cyclohexane (Next to no ring strain)

[[Image:Cyclodecaneline.png]] Cyclodecane

Rings with thirteen or more carbons have virtually no ring strain.

==Naming cycloalkanes==
Cycloalkanes are named similarly to their straight-chain counterparts. Simply add the root &quot;cyclo-&quot; before the alkane part of the name. 

Example: Propane &gt;&gt; Cyclopropane

When naming cycloalkanes, the '''cyclo''' prefix is used for alphabetization.

==Substituents==
If a cycloalkane has only one substituent, it is not necessary to assign that substituent a number. If there is more than one substituent, then it is necessary to number the carbons and specify which substituent is on which carbon.

[[Image:Ethylcyclopentane.png]] Methylcyclopentane

[[Image:1,1-dimethylcyclopentane.png]] 1,1-dimethylcyclopentane

[[Image:1,2-dimethylcyclopentane.png]] 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane

[[Image:1,3-dimethylcyclopentane.png]] 1,3-dimethylcyclopentane

The organic compound

[[Image:cyclopropylethylmethylcyclo.png]] 

could be named and numbered

[[Image:1-cyclopropyl-5-ethyl-2-met.png]] 1-cyclopropyl-5-ethyl-2-methylcyclohexane

and  should be named

[[Image:2-cyclopropyl-4-ethyl-1-met.png]] 2-cyclopropyl-4-ethyl-1-methylcyclohexane

because it produces a lower numbered name (1+5+2=8 vs. 2+4+1=7).

In the following example, notice that the longer chain is the parent and the cycloalkane is the substituent.

[[Image:2-cyclopropylbutane.png]] 2-Cyclopropylbutane

[[Image:1,3-dicyclopropylpropane.png]] 1,3-dicyclopropylpropane

==Multicyclic alkanes==
'''Multicyclic alkanes''' are hydrocarbons that have ''more than one bonded cyclic ring''. These abound in biology as all kinds of hormones, steroids, cholesterol,carbohydrates, etc. 

They are named as bicycloalkanes, tricycloalkanes, etc. 

They are named slightly differently than singularly cyclic alkanes. 

[[Image:bicyclo2.1.0pentane.png]] Bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane

Multicyclic alkanes are found frequently in living beings:

[[Image:Steran2.svg|75px]] Part of Cholesterol

We will get to some of the most interesting multicyclic rings later on when we study benzene and aromaticity.

==Stereochemistry==

Because the C-C bonds in cycles cannot rotate through 360 degrees, substituted cycloalkanes and similar compounds can exhibit [[Organic Chemistry/Chirality/Diastereomers|diastereomerism]]. This is comparable to alkenes which show cis/trans (or E/Z) isomerism. The isomers can be named using [[Organic_Chemistry/Chirality/Diastereomers#Cis-trans_Isomerism|cis/trans notation]], or more rigorously using [[Organic Chemistry/Chirality/R-S notational system|R-S notation]].

'''Conformers''', or conformational isomers, are different arrangements of the same molecule in space. Do not confuse them with any kind of true isomer as they are in every way the same molecule. The difference is in how the molecule is bent or twisted is space in any one instant of time.

The first molecule that is generally presented in a discussion of cycloalkane conformers is cyclohexane. It comes in several flavors; the main ones are the chair conformation and the boat conformation.

&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Consider getting a good molecular model set if you do not yet have one. They are not as inexpensive as you would hope but they help most people immensely to understand the way molecules look in three dimensions. [[../../Places to buy organic chemistry models|Follow this link]] to places you can buy a molecular model kit.

The chair conformation (can you see how it looks like a chair?) is lower in energy than the boat conformation. This is because the two ends of the molecule are farther apart and avoid steric hinderance.

Hydrogen atoms in a cyclohexane can be divided into two types:
#'''Axial''', that point towards the top and bottom, and
#'''Equitorial''', that point out away from the edge of the molecule


When hydrogens are replaced with other, bulkier groups, it becomes apparent that the axial positions are less energetically favored than the equitorial positions. That means that, if given a choice, bulkier groups will tend to bond to cyclohexane in equitoral positions, as this reduces their steric hinderance and potential energy.

==Other cycloalkanes==
'''Cyclopentane''' flips between slightly different conformers as well.

Main article: [[Organic Chemistry/Chirality|Chirality]]

In chemistry, two stereoisomers are said to be '''enantiomers''' if they are mirror images of each other.  Much as a left and right hand are different but one is the mirror image of the other, enantiomers are stereoisomers whose molecules are nonsuperposable mirror images of each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical project page}}

The page is intended as a guideline for contributors and editors.
As of July, 2003 it is very much a proposal, for editing and update.

==Textbook Defined==

A textbook is an organized body of material useful for the formal study of a subject area. A good textbook is distinguished by:
*A discrete, well-bounded scope: all the material should relate to a solid understanding of the subject, usually mixing theory and practice for each topic as it covers the subject domain.
*Use of examples and problems: the student should be able to better grasp each presented concept by following examples, and then applying the concept in structured exercises or problems.
*An internally consistent style: after the first few sections, there should be little or no surprises for the student in terms of layout and presentation of material. The text's user can get comfortable with the layout, the tempo of presentation, and the pattern of figures, illustrations, examples and exercises.
*Utility for future reference: once reviewed, the textbook should isolate material that is useful to the future application of subject knowledge in well organized appendices and tables.
*A structure that makes sense: the textbook is not just a collection of useful material, it is a guide to the student for an order of review which will aid in mastering the subject area.

==Textbook Structure==
Topics are presented in major parts, chapters, sections and subsections that ore organized in a way that facilitates understanding.
This means that the text's organization is based on the intersection of two requirements.
The first of these are the requirements of the subject domain.
Since most textbooks are developed by, or based on the contributions of subject matter experts, this requirement is usually well attended to.

The second requirement is defined by the limits of the student's mind.
Cognition is a common human ability, but its needs and limits are frequently ignored by those who have already mastered a subject area.
To make the best use of the student's abilities, some rules can be spelled out for the structuring and presentation of ideas, concepts, and material. These rule should include:

* '''Rule of Frameworks:''' Memory and understanding are promoted by the use of a structure that mimics the structures we all use within our minds to store information. Before we can use or master a subject, we have to have a mental roadmap that allows us to navigate within and through the subject domain. The text can best aid understanding by making this framework visible early on within each section or topic. The extent to which the student understands that they are using a framework, and knows what that framework is, is important as they internalize and make use of the material presented.

* '''Rule of Meaningful Names:''' Everything we know is tagged with an index or a title. These indices are critical to the ability to recall or retrieve the things we know and remember. Each concept, process, technique or fact presented should aid the student to assign a meaningful name for it in their own mental organization of the material. To be most useful, these names shouldn't  have to be relearned at higher levels of study. The names assigned by the text should be useful in that they support some future activities: communication with other practitioners, reference within the text to earlier mastered material, and conformity to the framework used for the subject. Each unique element of the subject domain should have a unique name, and each name should be used for only one element.

* '''Rule of Manageable Numbers:''' When we learn from an outline, an illustration, or an example; most of us are limited in our ability to absorb new material. As we become familiar with part of a subject domain this number expands, but for new material four to six new elements is a reasonable limit. If a chapter outline contains 12 items, the student will have forgotten the outline before getting to the last item. When a text fails to support this rule, it requires even a diligent student to needlessly repeat material.

* '''Rule of Hierarchy:''' Our mental frameworks are hierarchical. Learning is aided by using the student's ability to couple or link new material with that already mastered. When presenting new domains for hierarchical understanding, the rules for ''meaningful names'' and ''manageable numbers'' have increased importance and more limited application. A maximum of three levels of hierarchy should e presented at one time. The root should be already mastered, the current element under consideration clearly examined, and lower levels outlined only to the extent that they help the student understand the scope or importance of the current element. This area is supplemented by two more rules within this rule: thoseof Connectivity and Cohesion. Connectivity requires consideration of what the student likely knows at this point. The more already mastered elements that one can connect with a new element, the easier it is to retain. Cohesion requires that the characteristics of new elements as they are presented be tightly coupled.

* '''Rule of Repetition:''' Most people learn by repetition, and only a few with native genius can achieve mastery without it. There is a pattern of repetition that aids in promoting the elements of a subject from short-term to long-term memory. Implementations of this rule may mean that frameworks and important hierarchies are repeated as many as five or six times, while frequently used elements are repeated three or four times, and elements of lesser utility may not be repeated at all. The first repetition should normally occur within a day of first presentation, followed by a gradually decreasing frequency.  Exercises and review sections are ideally contribute a designed repetition pattern.

----
Hey Jimregan, I tweaked the navigation of the first subpage on the first chapter. I think the new way is a little bit better, and would like to see all of the pages linked this way. What do you think ? [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 20:43 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)
:What I think is, it'd be best if we get the sub-page editing that's just come onto the english wikipedia; you can edit the whole page or just a particular section, and it generates a hideable table of contents. -- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 00:49 29 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:Sub page editing is a very cool feature. My preference is still smaller pages but I am not actively working on the book and the way with the TOC works too.--[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 03:52 29 Jul 2003 (UTC)

== Navigation ==

I went through and standardized all the navigation on these pages, as well as the rest of the book. Every page now begins with a {{tl|ModernPhysicsNav}} template, that provides a back-link to the main page, and to this section. Also, every page has--at top and at bottom--one of the individual navigation templates for use within that particular progression:

*[[Template:1DWavesTOC]]
*[[Template:2-3DWavesTOC]]
*[[Template:GopticsTOC]]

All of these templates add pages to the [[:Category:Waves]] category.

==A Little Well Earned Praise==
From just a quick overview, this book looks like an excellent primer for modern physics regarding the applied mathematics of waves.  I have linked to it from several places.   Please keep up the good work!  mirwin @ Wikiversity.

______________________________________________________________________________

I agree. Thankyou very much for this wonderful resource, it has helped me immensely at school and I can understand it better than my school textbook!

== Stubs ==

== Thoughts on Merger ==

This wave article is off to a very good start. Work to do, lots of work to do, but still good work indeed. 

The proposal to Merge it with optics, which I removed, has been in place since 7 August 2006 (for over 8 months) without a single comment. I normally discuss before I remove - but if no one supports for 8 months.... 

As to why I removed, I fully agree that wave mechanics is important to optics, just as it is to:
* Mechanical vibrations - from the violin string to fatigue damage 
* Quantum mechanics - wave particle duality, neutrinos, x-rays, gamma rays, etc.,  
* Electrodynamics - radio waves, microwaves &amp; all of Maxwell's Equations implications 
* Hydraulics - already discussed although much more to say - for example solitons 
* Sounds waves - the phonons in solids (lattice oscillations) make a perfectly interesting wave phenomena - supersonic shock waves - atmoshperic waves (or perhaps they belong in hydrodynamics)-  blast waves 
* Seismic waves - earthquake waves are different enough to warrant their own discussion - you'll never get a Rayleigh Wave (surface acoustic waves) in optics 
* Graviational waves - Einstein's and Wheeler's contribution of gravitational physics, with some elegant tensor waves, shouldn't be completely neglected. 
* Chemical reactions front - for example the wave effect of the propagation for a deflgration to a detonation is very much a wave phenomena 
* Plasma physics includes a complex set of wave phenomena - e.g., the Alfvén wave in a plasma is a traveling oscillation of the ions and the magnetic field. 
* Other wave phenomena - e.g., the Fir wave - alternating bands of fir trees in sequential stages of development, observed in forests on exposed mountain slopes - are subject to analytic prediction as well 

So yes optics is best understood by understanding wave phenomena, but no - we should '''NOT''' merge Waves with Optics. If we do, we wind up merging 80% of all physics with wave phenomena.

== Don't make waves ==

Greetings,

Hope this message finds all of you well.

Adding wave theory to optics is jumping the gun.

To understand waves you need to know Calculus and some basic Differential Equations.

When working on my B.S. in Imaging Science at R.I.T., we first had optics.  To take geometrical optics it was assumed that we first finished 3/4 of University Calculus(though very little or no Calc. came into play).
Then, to take Wave Theory we needed to have completed Calculus and a basic working knowledge of Differential Equations.

For those not familiar with these courses, you have to finish Calulus before taking Differential Equations.

I believe the above to be true in other schools.  I've confirmed this by checking out some of the opencourse-ware at M.I.T.

Introducing wave theory to optics will likely serve to confuse and frustrate the casual user(which is learning on their own) and school student that's using this site to better understand their classes. 

Enjoy the day,
ChambersburgWill````</text>

I archived all the topics on this page.  Some of the topics may still be relevant, but it is difficult to be sure since the content and organization of this page and the whole book have changed significantly since many of those topics were written.  If you are looking for suggestions to improve this page, you may want to have a look in the archive.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 17:55, 3 June 2011 (UTC)

== Removed material ==

I removed the following material from this page:&lt;hr/&gt;
[[Image:Fundamental-theorem-1.png|thumb|300px|right|Figure 5:  The area spanned by &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;.]]

====A geometrical proof that anti-derivative gives the area====
Suppose we have a function F(x) which returns the area between x and some unknown point u.  We don't even know if something like F exists or not, but we're going to assume it does and investigate the implications.

We can use F to calculate the area between a and b, for instance, which is obviously F(b)-F(a). F is something general. Now, consider a rather peculiar situation, the area bounded at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; (see [[:File:Fundamental-theorem-1.png|Figure 5]]), in the limit of &lt;math&gt;\Delta x \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. Of course it can be calculated by using F, but we're looking for another solution this time. As the right border approaches the left one, the shape seems to be an infinitesimal rectangle, with the height of f(x) and width of &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. So, the area reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Infinitesimal area} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(x) \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

Of course, we could use F to calculate this area as well:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Infinitesimal area} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} F(x + \Delta x) - F(x)&lt;/math&gt;

By combining these equations, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} F(x + \Delta x) - F(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(x) \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

If we divide both sides by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{F(x + \Delta x) - F(x)}{\Delta x} = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

which is an interesting result, because the left-hand side is the derivative of F with respect to x. This remarkable result doesn't tell us what F itself is, however it tells us what the ''derivative of F'' is, and it is &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;hr/&gt;
This material was originally on this page, and this page was originally after [[Calculus/Indefinite integral|Indefinite Integrals]] and the [[Calculus/Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]].  After reordering, I wanted to remove mention of antiderivatives until they were introduced in the [[Calculus/Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]].  I planned to add it to one of those two later pages.  However, the argument is basically just the same proof given at the [[Calculus/Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]], just not as rigorous.  So I decided to leave it out altogether.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 18:46, 3 June 2011 (UTC)</text>

It looks like some new links to protect and deprotect pages .. is that the only difference between being a contributor and an administrator ? Thanks, [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 20:41 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:No - in general you don't have to do anything differently unless a problem arises (such as vandalism). If that happens you can block a vandal's IP address. I don't think page protection will be needed much if at all here for a very long time. It is used sparingly on en.wiki as a last resort in edit wars so that people get some time to cool down. Oh, and it is ''very'' bad for an Admin to use sysop powers in order to leverage their opinion on an article. For more see [[en:Wikipedia:Administrators]]. --mav

I agree with your intent to move the Wikiversity discussion to Meta. But, do you plan to move or merge any other material when you move it? If not, I will add a bit of history or outline at the top to promote discission of the WikiU as a project. We ought to make it look a little better, right?

==Icons for navigation==
Hi Mav, thanks for your replies to my questions in the emails. I think I understood your comment regarding the use of an icon with a redirect link to the contents page. You tell me how to do it, but say that you do not feel that it is a good idea. I appreciate your willingness to answer my question. I am going to try the concept out on my page for a while and see if I can make it work. Maybe hackish but sometimes hacks are useful. I can see the advantages in having no page-to-page navigational links as I have wasted considerable time making and remaking those links. I just view then as a convenience for the reader, but maybe I will rethink my spending so much time on them. Best wishes,

I've just started working on Wikibooks in Simple English. We need to make someone an administrator. With very few other users (at the moment!) how can I become one and so start getting the project started? Any help would be great. Cheers [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 14:18, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Ido Wikibooks ==

Hi Mav, this is mithridates from the Ido wikipedia and wiktionary - I put up a request to have a wikibooks created a bit over a month ago but still nothing; has it simply been forgotten? It doesn't look like that's the best page to write on to get noticed.

== De-Adminship vote ==

A vote is being held to remove your sysop privileges.  The basis for this vote is lack of use of these privileges.  You may want to participate at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#Maveric149_.28_talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.29]].  See also the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Removing_Sysop_Status]]. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:47, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:29, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Your De-Adminship ==

Hello. I would like to inform you that you will have your sysop rights removed here on 1 Nov 2006 due to inactivity. If you would like to discuss the matter, please see [[WB:RFA]]. You can re-apply for adminship at a later date if you wish. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:30, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">My goal for this page was to start what I hope will become out guideline for creating editions, updates, and open texts as collaborative projects. There has been a lot of discussion in the mail list, but most of it intermixes the mechanics with the concepts. The intent now is for everyone to adjust and expand what little I've started with in terms of concepts to reach a consensus on how we want it to work. Mechanics are important, a we should remember that they may impose limits, but those come after the goals.

What's here as of today is very sketchy, but I don't feel comfortable going much further without input. So, I'm posting it ''as is''. I expect to improve it, and hope you'll join in that effort. Thanks for your patience .... [[User:LouI|LouI]] 20:01 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</text>

''This is still very much of a proposed set of Guidelines. As Wikitext gains some experience and material, they will become better organized, more explicit, and clearer. You can help with that process by '''editing this page'''.''
-----
The development and maintenance of a useful textbook can be an open and collaborative process. The applied use made of the resulting book can also be open and unrestricted. But the book itself cannot be. Even an on-line or electronic book must have stability to be useful. It must present a complete and structured view of the subject domain, with an instructive pattern that exposes the elements of that domain to the reader.
This can only happen within a Wiki kind of project if there is more of a structure on book projects than there is on the Wikipedia itself. This guideline is intended to provide an overview of that structure.
-----
Each book is treated as an ongoing project, whose goal is to produce the next version of a useful text. To accomplish this there are ultimately up to three concurrent versions of a book:
#The static or completed or released book (an edition).
#The structured and edited (but incomplete) next edition (Beta or alpha version).
#The scratchpad or draft version of element revisions, new elements, etc. destined for a future edition.
==Wikitext Projects==
A new text, or a major revision, starts with a definition of the book to be produced. The first step to creating a wikitext is to create this definition. The definition includes the:
* '''Scope''' defines of the domain to be covered.
* '''Audience''' defines the target reader or user and also implies the level of material included.
* '''Textbook Methodology''' defines any specific technique to be used throughout (e.g. Interactive Programmed Instruction or Classroom Supplement with Exercises).
* '''Prerequisites''' defines any preliminary material that is generally to be excluded or given only summary treatment. For example, a book on ''Modeling and Simulation in Physics'' could include or exclude topics on ''Linear Programming'' or ''Distributed Multiprocessing''.
===Table of Contents===
The next step is to create the Table of Contents. This is much more important in texts than in the Encyclopedia because it lets anyone working on a topic know what has come before them. Ideally, this is firmed up and adjusted in an iterative process before too much detail work on elements.
The suggested way to do this is to create the first shell for each element (Part, Chapter, Section) next by writing the introduction for that element. A good introduction tells the student what will be covered, how it relates to what has gone before, and any specific prerequisite knowledge. Seeing how these fit together may cause changes to the TOC, etc.
===Templates=== 
Next, or concurrent with the TOC, the writers and editors will develop a set of templates for Parts, Chapters, Sections, Exercises, etc.

Templates that are created for one book should be mentioned in that book's [[WB:LMOS#Templates | local manual of style]].
(Eventually those templates will be categorized in the [[:Category:Book specific templates]] hierarchy).

You may also find some general-purpose templates useful.
For example, many books use the {{tl|prerequisite}} template, the {{tl|Wikiversity}} template, the many [[:category:box Templates]], various [[:category:page formatting templates]] -- especially the various [[:category:quotation templates]].

===Glossary and Appendices ===
If the text contains these they should be started early so that format and type of content are visible to everyone working on any element.

== The Promotion Process ==
When an area or section of the text becomes both complete and stable enough, it is promoted to a frozen level, with a status of 'alpha'. While it may still be altered in the development area, the only changes expected  here are those to integrate pages with each other. Any changes needed should be made to the working area page and then it is re-promoted.
When an edition is virtually completed at Alpha, its primary developers will plan on a date for release and begin its preparation as Beta status material. This phase is marked by some unique handling of the material, analogous to proofreading in the paper publishing world or quality assurance in software development.
*Changes might be needed here but excluded from the active (Wiki) pages. These will be mostly in the areas of internal links, examples, glossary, etc.
*A unique edition is being created. So emphasis shifts to internal flow, cohesion, completeness. There should be no open internal links.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Toby:
You seem to gave endorsed both Wikitext and Wikibooks as name options.
I'd like to argue in favor of Wikibooks.
I've used Wikitext in writing some things, and I get myself confused (probably a personal problem, but there might be someone else just as stupid.. ;-) ).
I think we should use Wikitext when we speak of the markup language, or any material that uses it.
That would include 'pedia, 'quote, etc.
Wikibook is an accurate description and allows the distinction between Wikitext and Wikibooks.
[[User:LouI|LouI]] 11:26 29 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Yeah -- I use WikiText to describe wiki-editable text.
--[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 11:29 29 Jul 2003 (UTC)

I do think that &quot;Wikibooks&quot; is probably better.
(See my URL suggestion -- it uses that.)
I just believe that &quot;Wikitext&quot; is also OK.
I could well change my vote strategically to emphasise this if necessary.

Some of the good news about organic chemistry is that it focuses on a subset of the periodic table, so there are fewer elements to worry about. These are the main elements with which we must concern ourselves, although occasionally a few others will be used in reactions.

==Intuitive Look==

A limit looks at what happens to a function when the input approaches a certain value.  The general notation for a limit is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to a} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

This is read as &quot;The limit of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.  We'll take up later the question of how we can determine whether a limit exists for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and, if so, what it is.  For now, we'll look at it from an intuitive standpoint.

Let's say that the function that we're interested in is &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, and that we're interested in its limit as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.  Using the above notation, we can write the limit that we're interested in as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to 2} x^2&lt;/math&gt;

One way to try to evaluate what this limit is would be to choose values near 2, compute &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for each, and see what happens as they get closer to 2.  This is implemented as follows:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
| 1.7
| 1.8
| 1.9
| 1.95
| 1.99
| 1.999
|- 
! &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| 2.89
| 3.24
| 3.61
| 3.8025
| 3.9601
| 3.996001
|}

Here we chose numbers smaller than 2, and approached 2 from below.  We can also choose numbers larger than 2, and approach 2 from above:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
| 2.3
| 2.2
| 2.1
| 2.05
| 2.01
| 2.001
|- 
! &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| 5.29
| 4.84
| 4.41
| 4.2025
| 4.0401
| 4.004001
|}

We can see from the tables that as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; grows closer and closer to 2, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; seems to get closer and closer to 4, regardless of whether &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 2 from above or from below.  For this reason, we feel reasonably confident that the limit of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 2 is 4, or, written in limit notation,

:&lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to 2} x^2=4.&lt;/math&gt;

We could have also just substituted 2 into &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; and evaluated: &lt;math&gt;(2)^2=4&lt;/math&gt;. However, this will not work with all limits.

Now let's look at another example.  Suppose we're interested in the behavior of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 2.  Here's the limit in limit notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to 2} \frac{1}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Just as before, we can compute function values as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 2 from below and from above.  Here's a table, approaching from below:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
| 1.7
| 1.8
| 1.9
| 1.95
| 1.99
| 1.999
|- 
! &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt;
| -3.333
| -5
| -10
| -20
| -100
| -1000
|}

And here from above:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
| 2.3
| 2.2
| 2.1
| 2.05
| 2.01
| 2.001
|- 
! &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt;
| 3.333
| 5
| 10
| 20
| 100
| 1000
|}

In this case, the function doesn't seem to be approaching a single value as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 2, but instead becomes an extremely large positive or negative number (depending on the direction of approach).  This is known as an infinite limit. Note that we cannot just substitute 2 into &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt; and evaluate as we could with the first example, since we would be dividing by 0.

Both of these examples may seem trivial, but consider the following function:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{x^2(x-2)}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt;

This function is the same as

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) =\left\{\begin{matrix} x^2 &amp; \mbox{if }  x \neq 2 \\
\mbox{undefined} &amp; \mbox{if } x=2\end{matrix}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that these functions are really completely identical; not just &quot;almost the same,&quot; but actually, in terms of the definition of a function, completely the same; they give exactly the same output for every input.

In elementary algebra, a typical approach is to simply say that we can cancel the term &lt;math&gt;(x-2)&lt;/math&gt;, and then we have the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;. However, that would be inaccurate; the function that we have now is not really the same as the one we started with, because it is defined when &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;, and our original function was specifically not defined when &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;. This may seem like a minor point, but from making this kind of assumptions we can easily derive absurd results, such that &lt;math&gt;0=1&lt;/math&gt; (see [[w:Mathematical Fallacy#All numbers equal all other numbers|Mathematical Fallacy §&amp;nbsp;All numbers equal all other numbers]] in Wikipedia for a complete example). Even without calculus we can avoid this error by stating that:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{x^2(x-2)}{x-2}=x^2\text{ when }x\neq 2&lt;/math&gt;

In calculus, we can introduce a more intuitive and also correct way of looking at this type of function. What we want is to be able to say that, although the function isn't defined when &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;, it works almost as if it was. It may not get there, but it gets really, really close. For instance, &lt;math&gt;f(1.99999)=3.99996&lt;/math&gt;. The only question that we have is: what do we mean by &quot;close&quot;?

==Informal Definition of a Limit==

As the precise definition of a limit is a bit technical, it is easier to start with an informal definition; we'll explain the formal definition later.

We suppose that a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; (but we do not require that it be defined when &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt;).

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (Informal definition of a limit)
|text=
We call &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; the '''limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;''' if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; becomes  close to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is close (but not equal) to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and if there is no other value &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; with the same property..

When this holds we write
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \to L \quad \mbox{as} \quad x \to c.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Notice that the definition of a limit is not concerned with the value of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; (which may exist or may not).  All we care about are the values of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, on either the left or the right (i.e. less or greater).

==Limit Rules==
Now that we have defined, informally, what a limit is, we will list some rules that are useful for working with and computing limits. You will be able to prove all these once we formally define the fundamental concept of the limit of a function.

First, the '''constant rule''' states that if &lt;math&gt;f(x)=b&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) then the limit as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; must be equal to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. In other words

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Constant Rule for Limits '''&lt;br/&gt;
:If ''b'' and ''c'' are constants then &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} b = b&lt;/math&gt;.}}
:'''Example''': &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 6} 5=5&lt;/math&gt;

Second, the '''identity rule''' states that if &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; just gives back whatever number you put in) then the limit of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.  That is,

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Identity Rule for Limits '''&lt;br/&gt;
:If ''c'' is a constant then &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} x = c&lt;/math&gt;.}}
:'''Example''': &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 6}x=6&lt;/math&gt;

The next few rules tell us how, given the values of some limits, to compute others. 

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Operational Identities for Limits '''&lt;br/&gt;
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}g(x)=M&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is constant. Then

*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}k\cdot f(x) = k\cdot \lim_{x\to c}f(x) =  k\cdot L&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}[f(x) + g(x)] = \lim_{x\to c}f(x) + \lim_{x\to c}g(x) = L + M&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}[f(x) - g(x)] = \lim_{x\to c}f(x) - \lim_{x\to c}g(x) = L - M&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}[f(x)\cdot g(x)] = \lim_{x\to c}f(x) \cdot \lim_{x\to c}g(x) = L\cdot M &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)}{\lim\limits_{x\to c}g(x)} = \frac{L}{M} \quad \mbox{ provided } M\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Notice that in the last rule we need to require that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to zero (otherwise we would be dividing by zero which is an undefined operation).

These rules are known as '''identities'''; they are the scalar product, sum, difference, product, and quotient rules for limits. (A scalar is a constant, and, when you multiply a function by a constant, we say that you are performing '''scalar multiplication'''.)

Using these rules we can deduce another. Namely, using the rule for products many times we get that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x)^n = \left(\lim_{x\to c}f(x)\right)^n = L^n&lt;/math&gt; for a positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

This is called the '''power rule'''.

===Examples===
;Example 1

Find the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}4x^3&lt;/math&gt;.

We need to simplify the problem, since we have no rules about this expression by itself. We know from the identity rule above that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}x = 2&lt;/math&gt;. By the power rule, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}x^3 = \left(\lim_{x\to 2}x\right)^3 = 2^3 = 8&lt;/math&gt;. Lastly, by the scalar multiplication rule, we get &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}4x^3 = 4\cdot \lim_{x\to 2}x^3=4\cdot 8=32&lt;/math&gt;.

;Example 2

Find the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}[4x^3 + 5x +7]&lt;/math&gt;.

To do this informally, we split up the expression, once again, into its components.  As above,&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}4x^3=32&lt;/math&gt;.

Also &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}5x = 5\cdot \lim_{x\to 2}x = 5\cdot 2=10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}7 =7&lt;/math&gt;. Adding these together gives

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}[4x^3+5x+7] = \lim_{x\to 2}4x^3 + \lim_{x\to 2}5x + \lim_{x\to 2}7 = 32+10+7 =49&lt;/math&gt;.

;Example 3

Find the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{4x^3+5x+7}{(x-4)(x+10)}&lt;/math&gt;.

From the previous example the limit of the numerator is &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}[4x^3+5x+7] =49&lt;/math&gt;. The limit of the denominator is
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}(x-4)(x+10) = \lim_{x\to 2}[x-4] \cdot \lim_{x\to 2}[x+10] = (2-4)\cdot(2+10)=-24.&lt;/math&gt;
As the limit of the denominator is not equal to zero we can divide. This gives
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{4x^3+5x+7}{(x-4)(x+10)} = -\frac{49}{24}&lt;/math&gt;.

;Example 4

Find the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 4}\frac{x^4-16x+7}{4x-5}&lt;/math&gt;.

We apply the same process here as we did in the previous set of examples;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 4}\frac{x^4-16x+7}{4x-5} = \frac{\lim\limits_{x\to 4}[x^4-16x+7]}{\lim\limits_{x\to 4}[4x-5]} = \frac{\lim\limits_{x\to 4}x^4 - \lim\limits_{x\to 4}16x + \lim\limits_{x\to 4}7}{\lim\limits_{x\to 4}4x - \lim\limits_{x\to 4}5}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can evaluate each of these;
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 4}(x^4) = 256,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 4} (16x) = 64,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 4}(7) = 7,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 4}(4x) = 16&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 4}(5) = 5.&lt;/math&gt; Thus, the answer is &lt;math&gt;\frac{199}{11}&lt;/math&gt;.

;Example 5
Find the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

In this example, evaluating the result directly will result in a division by zero.  While you can determine the answer experimentally, a mathematical solution is possible as well.

First, the numerator is a polynomial that may be factored: 
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, you can divide both the numerator and denominator by (x-2):  
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2}(x-1) = (2-1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;


;Example 6 
&lt;!-- I thought this example would be a good practice of the limit multiplication rule and also act as a good refresher for trigonometric identities. !--&gt;

Find the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1-\cos(x)}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

To evaluate this seemingly complex limit, we will need to recall some sine and cosine identities. We will also have to use two new facts. First, if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a trigonometric function (that is, one of sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant or cosecant) and is defined at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Second, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  This may be determined experimentally, or by applying [[Calculus/L'Hôpital's Rule|L'Hôpital's rule]], described later in the book. 

To evaluate the limit, recognize that &lt;math&gt;1-\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be multiplied by &lt;math&gt; 1+\cos x&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;1-\cos^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; which, by our trig identities, is &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;. So, multiply the top and bottom by &lt;math&gt;1+\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;. (This is allowed because it is identical to multiplying by one.) This is a standard trick for evaluating limits of fractions; multiply the numerator and the denominator by a carefully chosen expression which will make the expression simplify somehow.  In this case, we should end up with:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1-\cos(x)}{x} &amp;=&amp; \lim_{x\to 0}\left(\frac{1-\cos(x)}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{1}\right) \\
&amp;=&amp; \lim_{x\to 0}\left(\frac{1-\cos(x)}{x} \cdot \frac{1+\cos(x)}{1+\cos(x)}\right) \\
&amp;=&amp; \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{[1-\cos(x)]\cdot 1+[1-\cos(x)]\cdot \cos(x)}{x\cdot [1+\cos(x)]} \\
&amp;=&amp; \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1-\cos(x)+\cos(x)-\cos^2(x)}{x\cdot [1+\cos(x)]} \\
&amp;=&amp; \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1-\cos^2(x)}{x\cdot [1+\cos(x)]} \\
&amp;=&amp; \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin^2(x)}{x\cdot [1+\cos(x)]} \\
&amp;=&amp; \lim_{x\to 0}\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \cdot \frac{\sin(x)}{1+\cos(x)}\right)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

Our next step should be to break this up into &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \cdot \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(x)}{1+\cos(x)}&lt;/math&gt; by the product rule. As mentioned above, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Next,
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(x)}{1+\cos(x)} = \frac{\lim\limits_{x\to 0}[\sin(x)]}{\lim\limits_{x\to 0}[1+\cos(x)]} = \frac{0}{1+\cos(0)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, by multiplying these two results, we obtain 0.



We will now present an amazingly useful result, even though we cannot prove it yet. We can find the limit at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of any polynomial or rational function, as long as that rational function is defined at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; (so we are not dividing by zero). That is, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; must be in the domain of the function.

|text=
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial or rational function that is defined at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = f(c)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;}}

&lt;!-- exercises needed --&gt;

We already learned this for trigonometric functions, so we see that it is easy to find limits of polynomial, rational or trigonometric functions wherever they are defined. In fact, this is true even for combinations of these functions; thus, for example, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 1}\bigg[\sin(x^2) + 4\cos^3(3x-1)\bigg] = \sin(1^2) + 4\cos^3(3\cdot 1-1)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- a bunch more stuff about finding limits, until we arrive at... --&gt;

===The Squeeze Theorem===
[[Image:Squeeze_theorem_example.svg|thumb|200px|right|Graph showing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (blue) being squeezed between &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; (red) and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; (green)]]
The Squeeze Theorem is very important in calculus, where it is typically used to find the limit of a function by comparison with two other functions whose limits are known.

It is called the Squeeze Theorem because it refers to a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; whose values are squeezed between the values of two other functions &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, both of which have the same limit &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. If the value of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is trapped between the values of the two functions &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, the values of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must also approach &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

Expressed more precisely:

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Theorem: (Squeeze Theorem)
|text=Suppose that &lt;math&gt;g(x)\le f(x)\le h(x)&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in some open interval containing &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, except possibly at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; itself. Suppose also that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}g(x)=\lim_{x\to c}h(x)=L&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=L&lt;/math&gt; also.

[[Image:Xsin1_x.PNG|thumb|250px|Plot of &lt;math&gt;x\cdot \sin\bigg(\frac1{x}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;-0.5 &lt; x &lt; 0.5&lt;/math&gt;]]

'''Example''': Compute &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}x\cdot \sin\bigg(\frac1{x}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the sine of any real number is in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;-1 \le \sin(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;-1\le \sin\bigg(\frac1{x}\bigg) \le 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is positive, we can multiply these inequalities by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and get &lt;math&gt;-x \le x\cdot \sin\bigg(\frac1{x}\bigg) \le x&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is negative, we can similarly multiply the inequalities by the positive number &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; and get &lt;math&gt;x \le x\cdot \sin\bigg(\frac1{x}\bigg) \le -x&lt;/math&gt;. Putting these together, we can see that, for all nonzero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-|x| \le x\cdot \sin\bigg(\frac1{x}\bigg) \le |x|&lt;/math&gt;. But it's easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}-|x| = \lim_{x\to 0}|x| = 0&lt;/math&gt;. So, by the Squeeze Theorem, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}x\cdot \sin\bigg(\frac1{x}\bigg) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Finding Limits==

Now, we will discuss how, in practice, to find limits. First, if the function can be built out of rational, trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions, then if a number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is in the domain of the function, then the limit at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is simply the value of the function at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is not in the domain of the function, then in many cases (as with rational functions) the domain of the function includes all the points near &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, but not &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; itself. An example would be if we wanted to find &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, where the domain includes all numbers besides 0. 

In that case, in order to find &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x)&lt;/math&gt; we want to find a function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; similar to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, except with the hole at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; filled in. The limits of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; will be the same, as can be seen from the definition of a limit. By definition, the limit depends on &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; only at the points where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; but not equal to it, so the limit at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the value of the function at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, if &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} g(x)=L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt; also. And since the domain of our new function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; includes &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, we can now (assuming &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is still built out of rational, trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions) just evaluate it at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; as before. Thus we have &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = g(c)&lt;/math&gt;.

In our example, this is easy; canceling the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'s gives &lt;math&gt;g(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;, which equals &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x/x&lt;/math&gt; at all points except 0. Thus, we have &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x}{x} = \lim_{x\to 0} 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. In general, when computing limits of rational functions, it's a good idea to look for common factors in the numerator and denominator.

Lastly, note that the limit might not exist at all. There are a number of ways in which this can occur:

&lt;!-- Graphs definitely needed here. Need a good method to generate them. --&gt;

[[File:Gap example.png|200px|thumb|right|&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 - 16}&lt;/math&gt;]]
;&quot;Gap&quot;: There is a gap (not just a single point) where the function is not defined. As an example, in

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 - 16}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist when &lt;math&gt;-4\le c\le4&lt;/math&gt;. There is no way to &quot;approach&quot; the middle of the graph. Note that the function also has no limit at the endpoints of the two curves generated (at &lt;math&gt;c=-4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c=4&lt;/math&gt;). For the limit to exist, the point must be approachable from ''both'' the left and the right.

:Note also that there is no limit at a totally isolated point on a graph.

;&quot;Jump&quot;: If the graph suddenly jumps to a different level, there is no limit at the point of the jump. For example, let &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the greatest integer &lt;math&gt;\le x&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; from the right &lt;math&gt;f(x)=c&lt;/math&gt;, while when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; from the left &lt;math&gt;f(x)=c-1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; will not exist.

[[File:Graph of x^-2.svg|300px|thumb|right|A graph of 1/(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) on the interval [-2,2].]]
;Vertical asymptote: In

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = {1 \over x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:the graph gets arbitrarily high as it approaches 0, so there is no limit.  (In this case we sometimes say the limit is infinite; see the next section.)

[[File:Graph of sin(x^-1).svg|300px|thumb|right|A graph of sin(1/''x'') on the interval (0,1/π].]]
;Infinite oscillation: These next two can be tricky to visualize. In this one, we mean that a graph continually rises above and falls below a horizontal line. In fact, it does this infinitely often as you approach a certain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-value. This often means that there is no limit, as the graph never approaches a particular value. However, if the height (and depth) of each oscillation diminishes as the graph approaches the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-value, so that the oscillations get arbitrarily smaller, then there might actually be a limit.

:The use of oscillation naturally calls to mind the trigonometric functions. An example of a trigonometric function that does not have a limit as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0 is

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin {1 \over x}.&lt;/math&gt;

:As &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gets closer to 0 the function keeps oscillating between &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and 1. In fact, &lt;math&gt;\sin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt; oscillates an infinite number of times on the interval between 0 and any positive value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The sine function is equal to zero whenever &lt;math&gt;x=k\pi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer. Between every two integers &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin x&lt;/math&gt; goes back and forth between 0 and &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; or 0 and 1. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\sin(1/x)=0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x=1/(k\pi)&lt;/math&gt;. In between consecutive pairs of these values, &lt;math&gt;1/(k\pi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1/[(k+1)\pi]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt; goes back and forth from 0, to either &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; or 1 and back to 0. We may also observe that there are an infinite number of such pairs, and they are all between 0 and &lt;math&gt;1/\pi&lt;/math&gt;. There are a finite number of such pairs between any positive value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1/\pi&lt;/math&gt;, so there must be infinitely many between any positive value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and 0. From our reasoning we may conclude that, as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0 from the right, the function &lt;math&gt;\sin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt; does not approach any specific value. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} \sin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.

==Using Limit Notation to Describe Asymptotes==

Now consider the function

:&lt;math&gt; g(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

What is the limit as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero? The value of &lt;math&gt;g(0)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist; it is not defined.

Notice, also, that we can make &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; as large as we like, by choosing a small &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, as long as &lt;math&gt;x\ne0&lt;/math&gt;. For example, to make &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;10^{12}&lt;/math&gt;, we choose &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.

However, we ''do'' know something about what happens to &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gets close to 0 without reaching it. We want to say we can make &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; arbitrarily large (as large as we like) by taking &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be sufficiently close to zero, but not equal to zero. We express this symbolically as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} g(x) = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1}{x^2} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the limit does not exist at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;; for a limit, being &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is a special kind of not existing. In general, we make the following definition.

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: Informal definition of a limit being &lt;math&gt;\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;
|text=
We say the '''limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is infinity''' if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; becomes very big (as big as we like) when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is close (but not equal) to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case we write
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = \infty&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)\to\infty\quad\mbox{as}\quad x\to c&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, we say the '''limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is negative infinity''' if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; becomes very negative when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is close (but not equal) to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case we write
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)\to-\infty\quad\mbox{as}\quad x\to c&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

An example of the second half of the definition would be that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} -\frac{1}{x^2} = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

==Key Application of Limits==

To see the power of the concept of the limit, let's consider a moving car. Suppose we have a car whose position is linear with respect to time (that is, a graph plotting the position with respect to time will show a straight line).  We want to find the velocity.  This is easy to do from algebra; we just take the slope, and that's our velocity.

But unfortunately, things in the real world don't always travel in nice straight lines.  Cars speed up, slow down, and generally behave in ways that make it difficult to calculate their velocities.

Now what we really want to do is to find the velocity at a given moment (the instantaneous velocity).  The trouble is that in order to find the velocity we need two points, while at any given time, we only have one point.  We can, of course, always find the average speed of the car, given two points in time, but we want to find the speed of the car at one precise moment.

This is the basic trick of differential calculus, the first of the two main subjects of this book.  We take the average speed at two moments in time, and then make those two moments in time closer and closer together.  We then see what the limit of the slope is as these two moments in time are closer and closer, and say that this limit is the slope at a single instant.

We will study this process in much greater depth later in the book. First, however, we will need to study limits more carefully.

| text = As of July 15, 2009 Wikibooks has moved to a dual-licensing system that supersedes the previous GFDL only licensing.  In short, this means that text licensed under the GFDL only can no longer be imported to Wikibooks, retroactive to 1 November 2008.  Additionally, Wikibooks text might or might not now be exportable under the GFDL depending on whether or not any content was added and not removed since July 15.

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

==0. PREAMBLE==

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

==1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS==

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The &quot;publisher&quot; means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

==2. VERBATIM COPYING==

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

==3. COPYING IN QUANTITY==

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

==4. MODIFICATIONS==

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

&lt;ol type=&quot;A&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include an unaltered copy of this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

==5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS==

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

==6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS==

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

==7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS==

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

==8. TRANSLATION==

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

==9. TERMINATION==

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

==10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE==

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

==11. RELICENSING==

&quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&quot; (or &quot;MMC Site&quot;) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A &quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&quot; (or &quot;MMC&quot;) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

&quot;CC-BY-SA&quot; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

&quot;Incorporate&quot; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is &quot;eligible for relicensing&quot; if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
= How to use this License for your documents =

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

: Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
: Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
: under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
: or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
: with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
: A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
: Free Documentation License&quot;.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:

: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
: Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.&lt;noinclude&gt;

&lt;AUTHOR | WEBMASTER&gt;,

I really liked your &lt;CONTENT&gt;! I found it very informative and useful. I would love to use it in a project I'm involved with called Wikibooks, so I'm seeking your permission.

Wikibooks http://wikibooks.org is a collection of free non-fiction books (only textbooks) that is collaboratively-edited by volunteers from around the world.  You might have heard of our sister project, Wikipedia ( http://wikipedia.org ), which is a very large online encyclopedia that, in less than four years' time, amassed well over 2 million articles - just in the English language version. However, the Wikibooks project is just starting to write our first textbooks and we hope to duplicate Wikipedia's success in the realm of collaboratively-edited textbooks.

I'd like to include your materials in this Wikibook http://wikibooks.org/wiki/&lt;RELEVANT_WIKIBOOK_START_PAGE/TOC&gt;. To get a sense of the freedom of Wikibooks, you could even edit this without registration right now.

However, we can only use your materials if you are willing to grant permission for us to use your above referenced work under terms of the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0. This means anybody will have the right to share your materials and update them: for example, to keep up with new information. You can read this license in full at:
&lt;br /&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License

The license also expressly protects authors &quot;from being considered responsible for modifications made by others&quot; while ensuring that authors get credit for their work. There is more information on our copyright policy at:&lt;br /&gt;
http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Copyrights

If you agree, we will credit you for your work in the resulting Wikibook's author's page. We would also state that your work is being used with your express permission and we will provide a web link back to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;URL OF SOURCE&gt;

Thank you for your time.

Kindly,

&lt;WIKIBOOKS USER&gt;

== What is a talk page? ==
A '''talk page''' is a special page containing discussion about the contents of its associated &quot;subject&quot; page. To view the talk page of a [[Help:Glossary#module|module]] (or any other page in Wikibooks), click on the &quot;Discuss this page&quot; link in the sidebar or at the bottom of the screen. When you are in the talk page, clicking on &quot;View module&quot; will take you back to the main module.

Inevitably, there will arise situations in which collaborators on a module can benefit mutually from discussing the module--thus we have designated a [[WB:NS|namespace]] specifically for such discussions.

== What is it used for? ==
On Wikibooks, the purpose of a talk page is to help to improve the contents of the main page, from an [[Wikibooks:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]. Questions, challenges, excised text (due to truly egregious confusion or bias, for example), arguments relevant to changing the text, and commentary on the main page is all fair play.

[[WB:SOAP|Wikibooks is not a soapbox]], it's a collection of non-fiction books. In other words, talk about the module, not about the subject. It's only the habits we encourage that keeps Wikibooks from turning into another [[w:H2G2|H2G2]] or [[w:Everything2|Everything2]]. See also: [[Wikibooks:Etiquette|Wikipetiquette]]

That said, [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians]] are fallible creatures, so it's entirely natural that a bit of partisan wrangling takes place on talk pages - and occasionally this even leads to improvements in the module! So there's a fair degree of tolerance, and most Wikibookians succumb to a bit of wrangling from time to time.

== User talk pages ==
Your user page has a talk page as well. There is a link to it in the header next to your name (if you use a &quot;skin&quot; other than the default it may be somewhere else). Also, if edits are made to it by others, the text '''You have new messages''' will appear at the top of the page. These pages can be used for occasional personal communication among users; but note that these pages are public. If you want to communicate privately, use e-mail.

To write in another user's talk page, click the ''Discuss this page'' link on your sidebar when you view the user page (which you can do by clicking on a user's nickname). On the list of recent changes and on your watchlist, you can directly access a user's talk page by following the (Talk) link behind the user's name / [[w:IP address|IP address]].

==&quot;Post a comment&quot; feature==
For editing a talk page, one can optionally use the &quot;Post a comment&quot; feature, but only for a new thread and for a reply to be put at the bottom of the last thread.

*For a new thread, fill in the &quot;Subject/headline&quot; box. Then the [[Help:Glossary#edit summary|edit summary]] is automatically the same as the new [[Help:Glossary#section|section]] header.

*For a reply to be put at the bottom of the last thread, do not fill in the &quot;Subject/headline&quot; box. In this case it is not possible to supply an edit summary. Instead, edit the previous thread.

When using &quot;Post a comment&quot;, an edit conflict is impossible. However, in the case that you are not starting a new thread but replying to an existing one, your response may be appended to a newly created post that was added while you wrote yours. It is therefore generally recommended to use [[Help:Glossary#section|section editing]] to respond, and &quot;Post a comment&quot; to start new threads. If your comment is accidentally misplaced, just edit the page and move it.

== Standards and conventions of writing and layout ==
A few community standards do apply to talk pages, these are not to be taken strictly as &quot;rules&quot; but were evolved by users to make the talk pages more useful and easier to read. Often the talk pages of controversial topics can be very heavily used. 

* '''Sign your posts:''' To sign a post, type three tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and they will be replaced with your username after saving, like this: [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]. Type four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and they will be replaced with your username and time stamp, like this: [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 03:44 Jul 10, 2003 (UTC). On Wikibooks we recommend that you try to always sign your posts on talk pages. You can also use a pseudonym, or just &quot;--anon&quot;.

*'''Use indenting to keep the conversation straight:'''  The first contributor is all the way to the left, the next person starts with one colon (:), the next person starts with two colons.  Then, when the first contributor responds, she starts at the left margin again, and the second and third persons continue to mark themselves with one and two colons respectively,  In that way, who is saying what is clear.

*'''Separate discussion topics:''' Put each new topic under a different headline (&lt;nowiki&gt;== Subject ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;). The &quot;Post a comment&quot; feature accomplishes this automatically when you enter a subject line. The [[Help:Glossary#edit summary|edit summary]] is automatically the same as this header. Thus every thread is a section. This allows section editing of the thread in question. You can also use horizontal lines (----), although some users strongly dislike them.

*'''Proceed vertically:''' The further down the contribution to talk, the later it was made.

*'''Feel free to ignore typographical conventions:'''  Do as you please to make your points clear.  The [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] is for just modules and Wikibooks.  

*'''Make links freely''':  Links to modules are as useful on talk pages as anywhere else, and links to non-existent modules can help get them onto the [[Special:Wantedpages|most wanted pages]] list.

*'''Don't edit other people's words:'''  Please don't ever do this (except for obvious typing errors) but editing or deleting your own words is up to you.  (but contrast this with suggestions on refactoring below - this could be considered a simplistic approach)

*'''Archive rather than delete:''' When a talk page's content has become extremely large or the discussion of the issue in hand has simply died down and no one has a reasonable chance of adding to it. Then create a new page. (See [[Help:How to contribute]] for details.) Place the page in a talk or Wikibooks namespace. Give it an explanatory name. Often people simply add &quot;archive&quot; to the original name. Explain on the archive page where the text you plan to archive will come from and provide a link. Cut the relevant content from the original page and paste it into the new page. Replace the text on the original page with a link to the archive.

*'''Summarize discussion''' (or '''refactor'''): After a discussion on a page has died down for several weeks or the discussion has become heated and long, you (if you can be smart and respectful at the same time) might replace the discussion with a summary of major points, as though you were (!) writing an encyclopedia module about the discussion. If the discussion entailed opposing arguments, present the arguments from an unbiased point of view. Where possible, distinguish the common ground from the points of contention. See '''''Refactoring talk pages''''' below.

*'''Keep to the topic:'''  Not layout, but worth keeping in mind.  Talk page discussions can be much more humorous and POV than the typical module, but [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks|personal attacks]] don't do much to make modules better.

== Example ==
This module is great.  [[User:Maveric149|mav]] 18:20 Jul 30, 2003 (UTC)

:No it isn't! --fish

::Yes it is!  --wojahowicz

:I was talking to mav! --fish

== Refactoring talk pages ==
''from [[Wikibooks:editing policy|editing policy]]''

A point of terminology: the notion of [[w:refactoring|refactoring]], in the context of a wiki, means basically cleaning up and reorganizing a page such that all the useful information on the page is preserved and made more accessible. It's relatively rare that one needs to entirely refactor a Wikibooks module--usually, edits and additions are what is necessary.

The purpose of talk pages is to assist in creating better modules.
Therefore, the purpose of refactoring talk page discussions is to help create good textbook modules, at least in the long run.
A short-run purpose is to channel a discussion in a useful direction, that is, to help aim it at the future time when it can be used in an textbook module.

There are a number of talk or other discussion oriented pages which could use a bit of traditional Wiki refactoring. There's useful content there, sometimes, that can be transferred to the module itself. Sometimes large chunks of old talk pages can be completely wiped out with no harm done--feel free to do so, unless you think there's some value in preserving the discussion. In refactoring a talk page, one solid recommendation is to use the traditional wiki refactoring technique of adding a summary with whatever consensus we've arrived at the top, grouping separate discussion items together, and placing them towards the bottom.

I say we make this an official guideline (because it doesnt need the weight of an enforced policy). --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:56, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

:Wouldn't this be better as a Help page in the help namespace rather than as a policy? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:19, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

A guideline at best. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

== Move To Reject, and include in Help Namespace ==

I think we all have the gist of this one. It doesnt need to be an actual policy, however the information here is certainly valuable enough to keep around. I am motioning to '''Reject''' this proposal, and move the information here to the help namespace. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:43, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

: Agreed. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

:: Agreed, just another thing why ''Archive rather than delete'', the talk history is a safer (a restricted number can edit it) and takes less resources (as in space, navigation),work consuming (no need to be managed) place to keep the, herr, history of the page. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

::: The search feature only allows you to search existing pages, not their histories. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:22, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Done'''. I have moved this page to {{tl|rejected}}. I will work on moving the relevant text from this policy to the help namespace. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:26, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

== Is it permissible to copy the contents of the  existing books whose copyrights have expired verbatim ==

I am looking at few books in the http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=shabda . 
As per the site, the content is in public domain.  However, I am not sure if we can re-type the content to create an wiki book.

The reason why I want to recreate the book instead of using the scanned versions specified are
a. they are scanned versions and are not being searchable
b. since the books specified are quite old, sometimes the content is not very clear.

Please let me know, if wikbooks discourages recreation of books whose copyrights have expired. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ksrikanth gen|Ksrikanth gen]] ([[User talk:Ksrikanth gen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ksrikanth gen|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:For books that have actually been published and which are now in the public domain, [[s:|Wikisource]] is your best bet.  There, source documents are preserved with few changes other than proofreading.  Wikibooks is good if you plan to create a new textbook from scratch. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:44, 5 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Wikibook about Artificial Intelligence. 

==Book Contents==

The following is a first proposal for a basic layout. This is not yet complete, ideas are welcome. Discuss on the talk page or just add them here.

The book is laid out into 5 sections, with increasing detail and complexity. Each section contains a number of chapters. In addition to regular chapters, there are case-study chapters that investigate full and complex AI systems using several techniques from the regular chapters (as well as perhaps some new ones).

* [[/Probability|Probability]]: Describing the basics (philosophical and mathematical) of probability theory inference.

===Basic AI topics===

* '''Planning, Decision making and Problem Solving''': Expanding on the search chapter to show how simple agents and simple intelligent behavior can be created. Examples are solving a puzzle, navigating a small maze (with pits and monsters) or planning a trip to the supermarket.
* '''Uncertainty''': Introduction to reasoning, planning and decision making with uncertainty.
* ''Case Study'' - '''Building a (relatively) strong game AI''': Building a strong AI for some game (to be chosen) that combines techniques from the planning and uncertainty chapters. This should go deeper than the simplified algorithms that most books describe and actually produce a strong playing AI.

* '''Inference in Logic''': Backward and Forward chaining, Resolution and Logic Programming.
* '''Knowledge Engineering''': Ways to describe and store complicated knowledge. Databases, OO concepts, knowledge bases, representing space and time, inference from large datasets, diagnosis system etc.

* '''Natural Language''': Stuff like Markov models, POS taggers and CFG's.
* '''Machine Learning (ML)''': The basic idea of Machine Learning is to study pattern recognition, make predictions, improve predictions based on examples or data. Example of Machine Learning concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning.
* ''Case Study'' - '''Artificial Life''': Describes an environment with several evolving agents and some different techniques to construct agents. This should be able to draw on and compare pretty much all the chapters from section 2 (including the natural language chapter).
* ''Philosophical Issues for Artificial Intelligence'': Discusses AI problems typically dealt with by philosophers, such as what is theoretically possible to achieve with AI, whether programs can be conscious, or feel pain, intentionality, and symbol grounding.

===More advanced topics and techniques in AI===

* [[/Bayesian Decision Theory/]]
* {{stage short|50%|25-Nov-2006}} '''[[/Neural Networks/Introduction|Neural Networks]] and related models'''
** [[/Neural Networks/Natural Neural Networks|Natural Neural Networks]] and modeling of the Brain
** [[/Neural Networks/Distributed Processing|Distributed Processing]] and other advanced Networks

* '''Advanced Expert Systems''': Expands on the basic expert systems explained in ''Knowledge Engineering'' in section 2. Includes more in depth explanation of Bayesian Networks than in the ''Machine Learning'' section.

* ''Case Study'' - '''Data Mining''': Describes mining a large dataset (perhaps some part of the wikipedia database) using machine learning algorithms, using software like Weka. 

* '''Advanced Natural Language''': A description of the various techniques for dealing with tenses, sentence focus, presuppositions, etc. in NLP and NLG. This focuses mostly on the underlying structure of language and how to translate into some logical language, rather than statistical methods and models.
* '''Natural Language Learning''': Deals with more advanced statistical models for learning to understand language.

* ''Case Study'' - '''Dialogue System''': Building system that can communicate (intelligently) in written natural language. In a nutshell, trying to pass the Turing test. Three basic paradigms; case based reasoning (like ALICE), Logic based (translating everything to and from some extended version of predicate logic) and some machine learning based solution.

===Highly specific AI topics and techniques===

* '''Machine Vision''': Interpreting visual data. Face recognition, 3d reconstruction etc. 
* Bayesian Decision Theory
* Linear Discriminants and Perceptron
* Support Vector Machines
* Parameteric Techniques
* Non-parametric Techniques
* '''Speech Recognition, Text to Speech and OCR'''
* '''Advanced Logics''': Advanced logic systems.
* '''Reinforcement Learning'''
* '''Robotics''': Detailed and technical introduction to the three basic paradigms of robotics. Deals with software and hardware. (Define: [[w:situated robotics|situated robotics]].)

===AI Circuits and algorithms===

* [[/Boolean Intelligence|Theory of boolean intelligence]]
* [[/1 - Bit Learner/]]
* N-bit learning circuit
* [[/Circuit encoded in Java|Circuit encoded in Java]]
* [[/My research results|My research results...]]

===The Future of Artificial Intelligence===
* [[/The Singularity|The Singularity]]: Will AIs ever have a greater intelligence than human beings?
* [[/Spiritual Machines|Spiritual Machines]] Will AIs ever crack spirituality?

There are several ways to explore Wikibooks:

# Follow [[WB:LINK|links]] from page to page.
# [[#Searching|Search]] for something specific using the search box that appears on every page.
# [[WB:CCO|Browse]] through our books by [[Subject:Books by subject|subject]], by [[:Category:Books by completion status|completion status]], [[:Category:Books by reading level|reading level]], or by [[WB:ABC|title]].
# Explore a [[Special:Randompage|random page]], or from the navigation bar a random book.
# View what [[WB:RC|recent changes]] people have been making, or only to pages [[WB:WATCHLIST|you're watching]].
# From any page you can find out [[#What links here|what links there]].
# From any page you can click [[Special:SpecialPages|Special pages]] to access [[Special:Newpages|Newly created pages]] and [[Special:Allpages|All pages by title]]
# Use [[#Keyboard shortcuts|keyboard shortcuts]] to move around even more quickly.

{{TOC|float=none|limit=2}}

==Searching==
{{shortcut|WB:SEARCH}}

Wikibooks has an extremely powerful search engine built in, which can be used to locate material on Wikibooks more easily and more precisely than well known external [[w:web search engine|web search engine]]s such as [[w:Google|Google]] and [[w:Yahoo!|Yahoo!]].

The search box is located at the top right on every page on the standard Wikibooks skin (Vector). It will take you to the page which matches your query, otherwise it displays the search results. To display the full search results, click on the last item in drop-down list (which says «{{int:vector-simplesearch-containing}}»), or perform an empty search. The direct link for the standard interface is [[Special:Search]] and this for [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;profile=advanced advanced search].

===Search results page===
The default search only applies to the Mainspace (where most books are stored) and [[Subject:Books by subject|subjects]] (topic portals).  Other types of content pages can be searched by selecting an option from the grey search types box below the search input box. 

If ''Multimedia'' is selected, you can search images, videos, and audio stored on Wikibooks or our shared media repository, [[w:Wikimedia Commons|Wikimedia Commons]]. This option will search their file names and descriptions.

If ''Help and Project pages'' is selected, you can search the &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Wikibooks&quot; [[WB:NS|namespaces]]. These namespaces contain help pages, Wikibooks guidelines and policies, and all pages used for administration and maintenance of the site.

If ''Everything'' is selected, you can search all namespaces.

To search in any subset of namespaces, click ''Advanced'' on the search form. A quicker way to search a single namespace is to type the namespace, a colon, then the search term in the search box, for example {{search link|Wikibooks:Categories}} returns search results for catetgories in the Wikibooks namespace. 

[[Wikibooks:Registered users|Registered users]] can modify the default namespace to search in [[WB:PREFS|&quot;My Preferences&quot;]]. They can also choose how much context and how many hits per page to display when viewing search results.

===Navigation pages===
Navigation pages will attempt to guide you to the correct book.  You may encounter two types of these pages when searching for a topic. 

; Subjects: You may type in something like [[Languages]], that takes you to a list of the many things that you could mean by it . This type of page is called a subject page, and it's there to make things easier for you. Such a page prevents you from having to guess the exact phrase used to identify each book.
; Redirection: Some things can be referred to by many names. The [[United Kingdom History]], for instance, could be called the [[History of the United Kingdom]], the [[History of the UK]], or many similar things. Searching is set up so that if you search for any of those terms, you will be &quot;redirected&quot; to the proper place. If instead of being redirected you are taken to a search menu, then you have searched for a phrase that has not been set up to redirect to a book. In such a case, you may look through the search results for an appropriate topic, try searching for an alternative spelling or name for the term, or try something related like [[History]]. Once you have found what you were looking for, consider adding [[WB:REDIRECT|redirect pages]] for the expressions that you tried that did not lead to a book or subject because chances are that you are not the only one thinking about the topic in this way. Thus, in doing so you will make life easier for those who later search for the term.

===Search engine features===
The internal search engine can search for parts of page titles or page title prefixes, and in specific [[Help:Categories|categories]] and [[WB:NS|namespaces]]. It can also limit a search to pages with specific words in the title or located in specific categories or namespaces. It can handle parameters an order of magnitude more sophisticated than most external search engines, including user-specified words with variable endings and similar spellings. When presenting results, the internal search understands and will link to relevant sections of a page (although to a limited degree some other search engines may do this as well).

The internal search is also able to search all pages for project purposes, whereas external search engines cannot be used on any talk page, a large part of project space, and any page tagged with &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; (usually used on [[Wikibooks:User pages|user pages]].

The source text (what one sees in the edit box) is searched. This distinction is relevant for [[Help:Editing#Piped links|piped links]], for [[Help:Editing#Interlanguage links|interlanguage links]] (to find links to Chinese books, search for zh, not for Zhongwen), special characters (if ê is coded as &amp;amp;ecirc; it is found searching for ecirc), etc.

Upper and lower case as well as some [[w:Trema (diacritic)|umlauts]] and [[w:Diacritic|accents]] are disregarded in search. For example, a search for ''citroen'' will find pages containing the word ''Citroën'' (c = C, e = ë). Some [[w:Typographic ligature|ligatures]] match the separate letters. For example, a search for ''aeroskobing'' will find pages containing ''Ærøskøbing'' (ae = Æ).

The following features can be used to refine searches:

* '''Phrases in double quotes''' - A phrase can be searched by enclosing it in double quotes. For example, ''{{Search link|&quot;holly dolly&quot;|&quot;holly dolly&quot;}}'' returns fewer few results as opposed to ''{{Search link|holly dolly|holly dolly}}'' (two standalone words). This technique also allows one to find all occurrences of a word or name across Wikibooks rather than being directed automatically to a book or a subject page.
* '''Boolean search''' - By default logical AND is applied to all search terms, just as on all major search engines. Parentheses and &quot;OR&quot; can also be used. For example ''{{Search link|windows OR system}}'' and combined: ''{{Search link|microsoft (windows OR system)}}'' (note the uppercase OR).
* '''Exclusion''' - Terms can be excluded with -, for example ''{{Search link|windows&amp;nbsp; -system}}'' (note ''there is no space'' between &quot;-&quot; and the excluded term)
* '''Wildcard search''' - Wildcards (characters taking the place of any other character or string that is not known or specified) can be prefixed and suffixed, for example, the query ''{{search link|&quot;*stan&quot;}}'' would match books like ''Kazakhstan'' and ''Afghanistan''.
* '''Fuzzy search''' - Adding a tilde (~) at the end of a search word matches words with similar spelling. For example, searching for ''{{search link|james~ watt~}}'' would identify ''James Watt'', ''James Wyatt'', and ''James Watts'' as the first three search results.
* '''intitle:''' - using the ''intitle:'' parameter, query results can be narrowed by title. The search '''word'''(s) given to ''intitle:'' can be anywhere in the title.  Example searches using ''intitle:''

::{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  Query
!  Result
|-
|  ''{{search link|intitle:airport}}''
|  All books with airport in their title.
|-
|  ''{{search link|intitle:international airport}}''
|  Books containing international and airport in their title.
|-
|  ''{{search link|parking intitle:airport}}''
|  Books with &quot;airport&quot; in their title and &quot;parking&quot; in their text
|-
|  ''{{search link|intitle:&quot;international airport&quot;}}''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  Books containing the exact expression &quot;international airport&quot; in their title.
|}

* '''prefix:''' - use the ''prefix:'' parameter to limit the results to book titles starting with the given '''characters'''.  If a namespace is also given to ''prefix:'', that page name will override any and all other namespace searches. ''Prefix:'' should be the last parameter in the query.  Example searches using ''prefix:''

::{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
!  Query
!  Result
|-
|  ''{{search link|Salvage wreck prefix:USS}}''
|  Books containing the words ''salvage'' and ''wreck'' whose title starts with the characters &quot;USS&quot;.
|-
|  ''{{search link|prefix:Wikibooks:Reading room/}}''
|  [[Help:Editing#Subpage links|Subpages]] of [[Wikibooks:Reading room]].
|-
|  ''{{search link|&quot;subject namespace&quot;  readers prefix:Wikibooks talk:}}''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  Discussions of any page in the Wikibooks namespace page having the word ''readers'' and the phrase ''portal namespace''.
|-
|  ''{{search link|ocean heat reservoir prefix:Talk:Main Page/Archive}}''
|  Any archived discussion with the words ''heat'' and ''ocean'' and ''reservoir''.
|-
|  ''{{search link|language prefix:Subject:Languages}}''
|  Subject namespace page names that begin with &quot;Subject:Languages&quot; and have the word ''language'' in the page.
|}

====Using the search to directly get to a page====
When using the search to directly get to a page, it doesn't matter whether you enter capitals or lower case letters (unless there are two book titles which differ only in capitalization). [[w:Trema (diacritic)|Umlauts]] and [[w:Diacritic|accents]] are also disregarded, but [[w:Typographic ligature|ligatures]] do not match the separate letters.

Specialized uses of the search to directly get to a page include the following:
*To navigate to a [[WB:SECTION|section]] of a page using anchor notation. For example, '''Poland#History'''. 
*To navigate to a [[Special:SpecialPages|special page]], including one with a parameter following a slash. For example, '''Special:Log/Example'''.
*To navigate directly to a page on another language Wikipedia or Wikimedia project, using the appropriate [[Help:Editing#Interwiki links|interwiki]] prefix; some [[meta:Interwiki map|other prefixes]] work too. For example, enter '''fr:France''' to go to the book &quot;France&quot; on French Wikibooks, or '''wikt:help''' to see the Wiktionary entry for the word &quot;help&quot;. 
*To go quickly to the [[WB:CONTRIBS|user contributions]] of an IP address – just enter the address. For example,  '''123.45.56.89'''.

==What links here==
{{shortcut|WB:WLH}}

Within the Toolbox section on the left-hand side of every page is a link labeled &quot;'''What links here'''&quot;. This is used to see a list of the pages that [[WB:LINK|link]] to (or [[WB:REDIRECT|redirect]] to, or are included on the current page. These are sometimes referred to as ''backlinks''.

To use the tool, click [[Special:WhatLinksHere]] and type in the page title.

===Overview===
The &quot;What links here&quot; facility lists the pages on the same site (English Wikibooks) which link to (or redirect to, or [[#Transclusions|transclude]]) a given page. It is possible to limit the search to pages in a specified [[WB:NS|namespace]]. To see this information, click the &quot;What links here&quot; link while looking at any page. The list is sorted by date of creation of the page.

Pages redirected to the given page are marked &quot;redirect&quot;. Pages transcluding the given page are marked &quot;transclusion&quot;; for these pages it is not shown whether they also ''link'' to the given page. For image and other file pages, the pages using the image or file appear on the list and are marked &quot;image link&quot;. 

The list of links to a page is useful in a number of ways:
* The number of incoming links gives a rough indication of how important or popular a page is.
* Where the intended subject material of a page is unclear, the list of pages linking to it might provide useful context.

The function works even for a page title that does not exist (recording [[Help:Glossary#redlink|redlinks]] to that title). The &quot;What links here&quot; link appears on the edit page on which one arrives when following a broken link.

To invoke a &quot;What links here&quot; list directly (in the search box, browser address bar, or wikilinks) use the syntax [[Special:WhatLinksHere/John Smith]] (replacing &quot;John Smith&quot; with the desired target page title).

It is also possible to make a wikilink to the &quot;What links here&quot; list for a particular page; to do this type &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Special:WhatLinksHere/&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Page&amp;nbsp;name'']]&lt;/tt&gt;, replacing ''Page name'' with the title of the target page.

===Limitations===
The following links are ''not'' listed at &quot;What links here&quot;:
*automatically generated links from [[Help:Categories|categories]] to their subcategories and member pages (and vice versa)
*automatically generated links from [[Help:Editing#Subpage links|subpages]] to their parent pages
*links in [[WB:ES|edit summaries]]

In the case of links to [[WB:SECTION|sections]], the precise target is not shown. &quot;What links here&quot; cannot list the backlinks of a specific section only. (It may be possible to work around this by making a new title that redirects to a particular section, and encouraging people to make links to the redirect rather than the section.

Also note that if a page's links change due to a change in a [[Help:Templates|template]], the backlinks for that page are not updated immediately.

===Redirects===
The backlinks feature shows which backlinks are [[WB:REDIRECT|redirects]]. The backlinks of the redirect are also shown, and if they include a redirect, the backlinks of that also (not more). This makes it a useful tool for finding [[Help:Glossary#double redirect|double redirects]], which should generally be replaced by redirects to the final target. There are options to hide redirects, or to show only redirects (by hiding links and transclusions).

===Transclusions===
The backlinks list includes pages that include the current page using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SOMEPAGE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It also includes links which exist on certain pages due to the transclusion of other pages (usually [[Help:Templates|templates]]). For example, if page A contains a transclusion of template B, and B contains a link to C, then the link to C will appear on page A, and A will be listed among the backlinks of C.

[[File:Transclusion-multiple-foo.svg|Tranclusion of template B onto pages A, P, and Q to display B's content, &quot;foo&quot; on each.]]

{{Wikibooks help}} {{TOC|limit=2}}

Media files such as images, audio, or video often provide an excellent compliment to brilliant prose. Just as with any content that you upload, the copyright status must be compatible for use at Wikibooks.  Please see [[Wikibooks:Media]] for our official licensing restrictions.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

=={{anchor|Uploading}}Uploading files==
{{shortcut|WB:UPLOAD}}

Typically the [[commons:First steps|first step]] in using an image or other media file is to [[Commons:Special:Upload|upload]] it to [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]. All files that qualify for use at Wikibooks are uploaded to Commons, with the exception of [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free_use|fair use]] files, which must be [[Special:Upload|uploaded]] to the English Wikibooks instead. Many media files are copyrighted without permission to redistribute, and cannot be uploaded to either location. See [[Wikibooks:Media]] for details about which media files can be uploaded.  Files on Commons are available for any language version of any [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia]] project.

The preferred image formats are [[w:SVG|SVG]], [[w:Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[w:JPEG|JPEG]], and [[w:XCF (file format)|XCF]]. The preferred sound formats are [[w:Ogg|Ogg]] (using [[w:FLAC|FLAC]], [[w:Speex|Speex]], and [[w:Vorbis|Vorbis]] codecs) and [[w:MIDI|MIDI]]. Videos must be Ogg files using the [[w:Theora|Theora]] video codec.

Choose a good name for the media file before you upload it, as you cannot rename it later. Once the file is uploaded you should be able to read and make sense of its [[#File pages|file page]], which describes the file and lets readers see images in their original size.

Uploading a file to Commons is as simple as clicking ''upload file'' in the toolbox towards the bottom of the left-hand side menu (below the Wikibooks logo).

If you plan to upload to Wikibooks, follow the steps below. You must be [[Special:Userlogin|logged in]] and [[Wikibooks:Uploaders|have permission]] to upload files to Wikibooks.

# Visit [[Special:Upload|the local upload page]].
# Browse to the file's location on your computer by clicking the ''Browse'' button.
# Provide a name for the file if it is to be different than the name of the file as stored on your computer.
# Copy and paste the {{tl|information}} template and fill it in:
## Describe your file.
## Give the source of the file (preferably a [[w:URL|URL]]). If you took a screenshot, say so and indicate the software or website the screenshot represents.
## Provide the date the copyrighted work depicted was created or the date the copyrighted file itself was created.  If you are uploading a screenshot, this will be today's date instead.
## Provide the author of the work.  If the file is a screenshot of a copyrighted piece of software or website, provide the copyright owner.  '''This cannot be 
# Copy and paste the {{tl|non-free use rationale}} template and fill it in with:
## The page name where the file will be used.  A non-free file must have justification for '''each''' of its uses through separate non-free use templates.
## The copyright holder for the work depicted or the file itself.
## The source for the file; this will match the source in the information template above.
## Justification for why this non-free file must be used rather than any freely licensed alternatives.
## The purpose of this file and why it must be used for the book it is intended to illustrate.
# Choose the correct type of non-free media from the menu. This automatically inserts a [[Wikibooks:Templates/Files|tag]] such as {{tl|non-free&amp;nbsp;art}} or {{tl|non-free&amp;nbsp;stamp}}.

=={{anchor|File page}}File pages==
When a file such as an image, video, or sound clip is [[#Uploading files|uploaded]] to Wikibooks or the Wikimedia Commons an associated '''file page''' is created. The purpose of these pages is to provide information about the file, such as the author, date of creation, who uploaded the file, any modifications that may have been made, an extended description about the file's subject or context, where the file is used, and copyright information. In the case of an image, the file page shows a higher resolution version of the image, if available. To view the file page for an image or video, click on the image itself. For a sound file, click on the information icon, [[File:CrystalClearInfoIcon.png|link=]], near the sound clip link.

The description page consists of five parts:
*The file itself
*&quot;File summary&quot; - what the image is and is about as well as its origins. 
*&quot;File history&quot; - when a new version of a file is uploaded with the same name, the existing file is replaced and becomes available via file history. See [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|page history]].
*&quot;File links&quot; - a list of pages that embed the file, either directly or through a [[Help:Templates|template]].
*&quot;Metadata&quot; (images only) - technical information about the file and the equipment used to create it (camera model etc.)

The following are example pages for different types of files:
*[[:File:Leucospermum cultivar Edit.jpg|Images]]
*[[:File:Russian national anthem at Medvedev inauguration 2008.ogg|Video]]
*[[:File:Edison cylinder Lost Chord.ogg|Sound]]
*[[:File:Abroad - 1882.djvu|Mixed content (DjVu or PDF)]]

==Using files==
This section explains how to insert pictures into Wikibooks pages using wikitext. It describes options for specifying placement, alternate text for screen readers, captions, sizes, and links, and contains advice about panoramas and avoiding image stackups.  The same syntax is used regardless of whether a file is from Wikibooks or Wikimedia Commons.

=== Thumbnails ===
A typical picture can be inserted with a line &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:...|thumb|...]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; as shown below. Using &quot;&lt;code&gt;thumb&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates a thumbnail, a picture that is typically sized differently from the original image. Several options can affect a thumbnail's placement and size.

==== On the left ====
By default a thumbnail is floated to the right of the page, with the text flowing around it. However, the tall &quot;Wikibooks Help&quot; box on the right of this page might collide with a right-floating picture, so our first example specifies &quot;&lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, and just below it you can see what the resulting picture looks like:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]

The above text gives the image file name &quot;Wikipedesketch1.png&quot;, the image type &quot;thumb&quot; and alignment &quot;left&quot;, the alternative text &quot;A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.&quot;, and the caption &quot;The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.&quot; A Wikibooks reader can click on the thumbnail, or on the small double-rectangle icon [[File:Magnify-clip.png|link=|alt=]] below it, to see the corresponding file page which will let the user see the image in its original size.

Although the above text may appear in multiple lines for formatting purposes, the actual image text is on one line, as it uses spaces without any line breaks. The &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and the first &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot; must be on the same line; other spaces and line breaks are ignored if they are next to &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot; characters or just inside the brackets. Some parts of the image syntax, such as the &quot;&lt;code&gt;alt=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, do not allow spaces or line breaks, and the easiest way to get it right is to omit unnecessary spaces and line breaks.

Alternative text (alt text) is intended for visually impaired readers. Often the caption or page will describe the image inadequately, and where this is the case you can write '''alt=caption''' or '''alt=see adjacent text'''. If additional alt text is added, it should be a succinct description. Unlike alt text, a caption can contain wiki markup like &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''[[Using Wikibooks]]''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. The caption text is placed underneath the picture. 

Here's the same example again, this time in the context of some colored [[w:lorem ipsum|lorem ipsum]] dummy text with asterisks (*) showing where the image syntax appears in the text:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{-}}

==== On the right ====
The default placement for a thumbnail is on the right:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Without flowing text ====
Although most thumbnails are combined with flowing text and are placed to the right or left, you can also place a thumbnail without text flowing around it. One way is to center it, using &quot;&lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt;&quot;:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|center|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|center|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;

You can also place the picture to the left, without flowing text, using &quot;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;&quot;:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|none|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|none|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;

==== Thumbnail sizes ====
Normally a thumbnail has a width of 220 [[w:pixels|pixels]] (px). This width is used by typical readers, who have not logged in or who have not changed their preferences. You can set a different default width for yourself in ''[[Special:Preferences|My preferences]]'' under &quot;Appearance:Files&quot;. The options are 120px, 150px, 180px, 200px, 220px, 250px, and 300px. Any image narrower than the preferred width is displayed at the narrower width.

The default behavior can make a tall, thin picture come out too large. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|4}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

; Upright images
The &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option can help fix this by informing the Wikibooks layout system that the image should have a narrower width than usual:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|upright|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|upright|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|4}}&lt;/span&gt;

The &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option normally creates an image that is about 75% of the width of the default. The exact width is computed by starting with the default thumbnail width, multiplying it by 0.75, and rounding to the nearest multiple of 10. Normally the default width is 220px so an upright image is 170px wide; changing one's default width within the range from 120px to 300px results in upright image widths ranging from 90px to 230px.
{{clear}}

; Shrinking upright images further
If the upright factor 0.75 is too large or too small, it can be specified explicitly. A factor of 1.0 uses the default thumbnail width, which is the same as not specifying &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright&lt;/code&gt;&quot; at all; a factor less than or greater than 1.0 creates an image smaller or larger than the default. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|upright=0.56|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|upright=0.56|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|3}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

; Short, wide images
Short, wide images sometimes benefit from &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright&lt;/code&gt;&quot; factors greater than 1.0. Factors greater than about 2.5 can generate large images that cause problems with some browsers. Although many image types, such as [[w:JPEG|JPEG]] and [[w:Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], do not handle enlargement well, [[w:SVG|SVG]] images have no problem with it. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Köppen-vereinfacht.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Map of the world. A tan band stretches from northern Africa through central China; most of Australia and parts of south Africa and the western Americas are also tan. Dark greens dominate the northern hemisphere. Lighter greens cover much land near the equator. Polar areas are white, the north fringed with light blue.|Macroclimates of the earth. Tans represent desert, dark greens humid continental, and light green tropical rainforest. Light blue and white represent tundra and ice cap.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Köppen-vereinfacht.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Map of the world. A tan band stretches from northern Africa through central China; most of Australia and parts of south Africa and the western Americas are also tan. Dark greens dominate the northern hemisphere. Lighter greens cover much land near the equator. Polar areas are white, the north fringed with light blue.|Macroclimates of the earth. Tans represent desert, dark greens humid continental, and light green tropical rainforest. Light blue and white represent tundra and ice cap.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

; Width in pixels
You can also display an image of a specified width. Typically, if you specify a width in pixels, it should be at least 300px. Widths greater than about 550px may cause problems with some browsers, as stated above.

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Köppen-vereinfacht.svg|thumb|center|400px|alt=Map of the world. A tan band stretches from northern Africa through central China; most of Australia and parts of south Africa and the western Americas are also tan. Dark greens dominate the northern hemisphere. Lighter greens cover much land near the equator. Polar areas are white, the north fringed with light blue.|Macroclimates of the earth. Tans represent desert, dark greens humid continental, and light green tropical rainforest. Light blue and white represent tundra and ice cap.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
[[File:Köppen-vereinfacht.svg|thumb|center|400px|alt=Map of the world. A tan band stretches from northern Africa through central China; most of Australia and parts of south Africa and the western Americas are also tan. Dark greens dominate the northern hemisphere. Lighter greens cover much land near the equator. Polar areas are white, the north fringed with light blue.|Macroclimates of the earth. Tans represent desert, dark greens humid continental, and light green tropical rainforest. Light blue and white represent tundra and ice cap.]]

; Height in pixels
To specify the exact height of a picture, letting the width scale to match, prefix the height with &quot;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. The following example resizes the image to a height of 60px:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|center|x60px|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|center|x60px|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]

; Width or height in pixels, whichever makes the image smaller

If you specify both width and height of a picture, it is sized to whichever value would make it smaller. This will cause a picture to fit in a certain area, regardless of the image's actual size. Since the proportions of [[:File:Flag of Scotland.svg]] are 5×3, specifying a width of 120px generates a 120×72px image, and specifying a height of 60px generates a 100×60px image, so a size field of &quot;&lt;code&gt;120x60px&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates the smaller of the two, namely, the 100×60px image:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|center|120x60px|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|center|120x60px|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]

; Pixel counts vs. upright factors

Although pixel counts are easier to understand than upright factors, they adjust less well to user preferences. For example, suppose a picture contains some detail and by default is a bit too small, and you want to grow it by about 10%. Although &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright=1.1&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;240px&lt;/code&gt;&quot; do the job equally well for the common case where the default width is 220 pixels, many of the users who set the default width to 300 pixels to work better with their high-resolution screens will be annoyed with &quot;&lt;code&gt;200px&lt;/code&gt;&quot; because it will make the picture a third smaller than their preferred size. In contrast, &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright=1.1&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will display the picture to them with a width of 330 pixels, and this is more likely to work well on their displays.

Pixel counts are typically better than upright factors for displaying combinations of pictures, some of which have known and limited sizes, and for displaying tiny icons that are intended to be combined with text.

; Native size
Replacing &quot;&lt;code&gt;thumb&lt;/code&gt;&quot; with &quot;&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&quot; causes the image to be displayed in its native size, that is, the size that it was originally uploaded with. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|frame|center|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|frame|center|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]

==== Panoramas ====
Very large pictures should not be put directly into books, as they cause problems in some browser environments. Images wider than 550px or so are often better treated as a panorama, which can be created with the {{tl|wide image}} template. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{wide image|Helsinki z00.jpg|1800px|alt=Panorama of city with mixture of five- to ten-story buildings|Helsinki has many buildings.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{wide image|Helsinki z00.jpg|1800px|alt=Panorama of city with mixture of five- to ten-story buildings|Helsinki has many buildings.}}

==== DjVu and PDF files ====
[[File:Abroad - 1882.djvu|thumb|right|150px|By Thomas Crane|page=13]]
[[File:Cinderella (1865).pdf|thumb|left|150px|This is page 2|page=2]]

Images can be excerpted from [[w:DjVu|DjVu]] or [[w:Portable Document Format|PDF]] files, with an optional ''page'' parameter. For example:
: &lt;small&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Abroad - 1882.djvu|thumb|right|150px|By Thomas Crane|page=13]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;small&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Cinderella (1865).pdf|thumb|left|150px|This is page 2|page=2]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Avoiding stack-ups ===
One of the problems many users of floating pictures hit is that multiple pictures sometimes stack up vertically, particularly with large screens and wide images. For example, in many browsers the two pictures at the right of this text stack up awkwardly.

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

Often the best solution to this is simply to add more text, as is done below, but this sometimes is not possible. The following subsections show some other possible solutions to the problem.

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|3}}&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Alternating left and right ====
Perhaps the easiest way is to handle multiple floating pictures is to alternate them left then right; this way they do not come into contact with one another, and so cannot stack up in an unattractive way. This has a disadvantage, though: people with very low [[w:screen resolution|screen resolution]]s (such as those using [[w:PDA|PDA]]s or [[w:netbook|netbook]]s) may find the result too awkward, albeit still readable.

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Myriapoda]]''.]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|left|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Co-aligning ====
It is common to have two pictures that logically should be grouped together. The {{tl|multiple image}} template is one way to do this. For example:

{{multiple image
 | width     = 100
 | footer    = Two cards used by football referees
 | image1    = Yellow card.svg
 | alt1      = Yellow card
 | caption1  = Caution
 | image2    = Red card.svg
 | alt2      = Red card
 | caption2  = Ejection
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
  {{multiple image
   | width     = 100
   | footer    = Two cards used by football referees
   | image1    = Yellow card.svg
   | alt1      = Yellow card
   | caption1  = Caution
   | image2    = Red card.svg
   | alt2      = Red card
   | caption2  = Ejection
  }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{clear}}

The same template can also align pictures vertically:

{{multiple image
 | direction = vertical
 | width     = 100
 | footer    = Two cards used by football referees
 | image1    = Yellow card.svg
 | alt1      = Yellow card
 | caption1  = Caution
 | image2    = Red card.svg
 | alt2      = Red card
 | caption2  = Ejection
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
  {{multiple image
   | direction = vertical
   | width     = 100
   | footer    = Two cards used by football referees
   | image1    = Yellow card.svg
   | alt1      = Yellow card
   | caption1  = Caution
   | image2    = Red card.svg
   | alt2      = Red card
   | caption2  = Ejection
  }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Galleries ====
A gallery displays several pictures in an array or similar layout.  Perhaps the most flexible method is [[Help:Tables|table syntax]]. For example:

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{|
| [[File:Philipp Veit 008.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robed woman, seated, with sword on her lap|Philipp Veit, ''Germania'', 1834–36]]
| [[File:Image Germania (painting).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robed woman, standing, holding a sword|Philipp Veit, ''Germania'', 1848]]
| [[File:Niederwald memorial 2.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Monument of robed woman, standing, holding a crown in one hand and a partly sheathed sword in another|Johannes Schilling, ''Germania'', 1871–83]]
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{|
| [[File:Philipp Veit 008.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robed woman, seated, with sword on her lap|Philipp Veit, ''Germania'', 1834–36]]
| [[File:Image Germania (painting).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robed woman, standing, holding a sword|Philipp Veit, ''Germania'', 1848]]
| [[File:Niederwald memorial 2.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Monument of robed woman, standing, holding a crown in one hand and a partly sheathed sword in another|Johannes Schilling, ''Germania'', 1871–83]]
|}

There are other ways to make a gallery. One simple way is the {{tag|gallery}} tag using the [[File:Vector toolbar insert picture gallery button.png|alt=gallery button|link=]] button in the [[Help:Editing#Edit toolbar|edit toolbar]] above the editing text box. 


&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|Captioned
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|[[Help:Editing#Links|Links]] can be put in captions.
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|Full [[MediaWiki]]&lt;br /&gt;''syntax'' may be used&amp;hellip;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which produces:

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|Captioned
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|[[Help:Editing#Links|Links]] can be put in captions.
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|Full [[MediaWiki]]&lt;br /&gt;''syntax'' may be used&amp;hellip;  
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The extended syntax is (see ''[[m:Help:Images and other uploaded files#Gallery|gallery tag help]]'' and below for full list of parameters):

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;gallery caption=&quot;Sample gallery&quot; widths=&quot;180px&quot; heights=&quot;120px&quot; perrow=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
File:Wiki.png|Caption text.
[...]
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

* Images are separated by new lines.
* Captions are optional.
* Notice that there are no brackets except for links within captions.
* The default width and height is 120px.


Unfortunately, the gallery tag does not support alternate text, so it generates pages that are not accessible to visually impaired and other readers who cannot see the images.  This can be overcome with the {{tl|gallery}} template:

{{pre|scroll|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{gallery

}}

==== Forcing a break ====
As a final resort, you can force the browser to insert a break, making all text and pictures appear below the bottom of the first picture using {{tl|clear}}. This can produce rather unattractive gaps, particularly in the accompanying text. Remember that text will flow and wrap differently for other users, based on their chosen browser, screen resolution, default font size, accessibility options, number of toolbars and sidebars (such as instant messaging panes) and more. Do not force page design just so that it looks pretty on ''your'' display. Hack only where absolutely necessary. Wherever possible, just use the simplest logical page flow.

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}
[[Image:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb||alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Plain pictures ===
Most pictures in pages are thumbnails, but sometimes more specialized needs require finer grained control. A plain picture with no formatting can be inserted with:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

In this plain picture the text &quot;&lt;code&gt;A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is not visible as a caption. Instead, it appears as the title text of the image, commonly displayed as a [[w:tooltip|tooltip]] during a [[w:mouseover|mouseover]]. In a thumbnail the alt text defaults to empty, but a plain picture's alt text defaults to its title text if given and to the picture's file name if not; this default can be overridden with an explicit &quot;&lt;code&gt;alt=''Alt text''&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option. Title text, like alt text, will ignore any Wiki markup.

A plain picture can be placed anywhere in the page, and acts as a big character in the text, so that nearby text does not float or wrap around it. For example:

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;

* ''Note:'' To achieve a plain image with a caption, one can use {{tl|plain image with caption}}. The caption is automatically added as the image's title and alt text, and any wiki markup used on it will be correctly displayed on the caption, but will be automatically stripped down from the alt and title text. See an example [[w:Jeremias Falck|here]].
{{clear}}

==== Plain picture sizes ====
A plain picture defaults to the image's native size. This can be overridden with an explicit size. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Wikipedesketch1.png|50px|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|50px|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

The &quot;&lt;code&gt;frameless&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option causes a plain picture to default to the same size as a thumbnail. [[#Thumbnail sizes|As with thumbnails]], the default can be adjusted with the &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright=''factor''&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option. If you use the common default of 220 pixels for thumbnail widths, the following example image's width will be 220 × 0.2 pixels, which rounds to 40 pixels:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Amun.svg|frameless|upright=0.2|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Amun.svg|frameless|upright=0.2|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;

The &quot;&lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option adds a one-pixel border, which can be useful when it is important to distinguish image from background. Here is the same picture with and without a border.

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Japan.svg|border|30px|White flag containing solid red circle]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Japan.svg|30px|White flag containing solid red circle]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This generates {{nowrap|&quot;[[File:Flag of Japan.svg|border|30px|White flag containing solid red circle]] [[File:Flag of Japan.svg|30px|White flag containing solid red circle]]&quot;}}.

==== Horizontal placement ====
Like thumbnails, plain pictures can be floated left or right with text flowing around them; or centered or put left without text flow. The only difference is that the &quot;&lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;&quot; parameter is required to float a plain picture to the right, whereas floating right is the default for thumbnails. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|right|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|right|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Vertical alignment ====
When a plain picture appears in text, it is aligned so that its vertical middle is roughly where the center of a lower-case &quot;x&quot; would be; if the image is larger than the line is tall, it sticks out both above and below. The vertical alignment syntax provides several options to adjust this. For example, the &quot;&lt;code&gt;baseline&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;X[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|baseline|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]X&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

generates &quot;{{nowrap|X[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|baseline|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]X}}&quot; instead of the default &quot;{{nowrap|X[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]X}}&quot;. Available options for vertical alignment, next to the output that they generate, are
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;baseline[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|baseline|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;middle[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|middle|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}} (the default),
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;sub[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|sub|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;super[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|super|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;text-top[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|text-top|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;text-bottom[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|text-bottom|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;top[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|top|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}}, and
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;bottom[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|bottom|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}}.

===={{anchor|Link}}Links ====
Normally a picture links to its image page, which describes the image, who created it, and links to the original image at full resolution. You can create a plain picture that links to some other location by using the &quot;&lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option.

To link to some other page, specify its name in the link option along with an appropriate caption that hints to readers what will happen if they click on the link. This caption serves both as title text for the tooltip, and as alt text for visually disabled readers. For example, &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of France.svg|20px|link=French|France]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates a flag [[File:Flag of France.svg|20px|link=French|France]] that links to the book ''[[French]]''.

To link to an external site, specify its URL in the link option along with an appropriate caption. For example, &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Belgium.svg|20px|link=http://www.belgium.be/en/|Belgium government portal]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates a flag [[File:Flag of Belgium.svg|20px|link=http://www.belgium.be/en/|Belgium government portal]] that links to the English-language portal of the Belgian government.

A purely decorative image, which conveys no information and does nothing when it is clicked on, can be specified with an empty alt attribute. For example &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of the United States.svg|20px|link=|alt=]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates a flag [[File:Flag of the United States.svg|20px|link=|alt=]] that is purely decorative.

==== Image maps ====
&lt;imagemap&gt;
File:Bryan-Sewall.jpg|300px|right|alt=1896 Democratic campaign poster with nominees William J. Bryan of Nebraska for President and Arthur Sewall of Maine for Vice President
circle 950 850 700 [[w:William Jennings Bryan|William J. Bryan]]
circle 2950 850 700 [[w:Arthur Sewall|Arthur Sewall]]
default [http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/democrats.html 1896 Democrats]
&lt;/imagemap&gt;
You can link different parts of an image to different locations using an [[mw:Extension:ImageMap|image map]]. For example, in the image at right, clicking a circle roughly corresponding to the left portrait takes the reader to ''[[w:William Jennings Bryan|William Jennings Bryan]]'', clicking the right portrait goes to ''[[w:Arthur Sewall|Arthur Sewall]]'', and clicking anywhere else goes to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/democrats.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This image is generated by the following markup:

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;imagemap&gt;
File:Bryan-Sewall.jpg|300px|right|alt=1896 Democratic campaign poster with nominees William J. Bryan of Nebraska for President and Arthur Sewall of Maine for Vice President
circle 950 850 700 [[w:William Jennings Bryan|William J. Bryan]]
circle 2950 850 700 [[w:Arthur Sewall|Arthur Sewall]]
default [http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/democrats.html 1896 Democrats]
&lt;/imagemap&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This imagemap markup specifies that the title text (tooltips) for the three regions are &quot;William J. Bryan&quot;, &quot;Arthur Sewall&quot;, and &quot;1896 Democrats&quot;, respectively. The alt text for an imagemap region is always the same as its title text; the alt text for the overall image is given in the first line of the imagemap's markup. The underlying image's native dimensions are 3916×1980, and the coordinates are given in these dimensions rather than in the 300px resizing. As described in the [[mw:Extension:ImageMap|image map documentation]], regions can be specified as circles, rectangles, and arbitrary polygons, and the blue &quot;i&quot; icon [[File:Desc-20.png|x14px|link=|alt=]] can be moved or suppressed. Also, the image can be specified as a &quot;&lt;code&gt;thumb&lt;/code&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, which means it has alt text and a caption in the usual way, with a double-rectangle icon [[File:Magnify-clip.png|link=|alt=]] instead of the blue &quot;i&quot; icon [[File:Desc-20.png|x14px|link=|alt=]].

=== Linking without displaying ===
Let us say you want to link to the picture without displaying it. You can take the reader to the image page, where it tells them who uploaded it, when, what the copyright status is, etc.:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:Wikipedesketch1.png]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: [[:File:Wikipedesketch1.png]]

You can make the link say anything you want.

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: [[:File:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]

When the link is clicked the image is displayed with other text information at a reasonable size. The user can click through the resulting medium-sized image to get to the full size highest resolution image.

You can also send the user directly to the image:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:Wikipedesketch1.png]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: [[Media:Wikipedesketch1.png]]

This says &quot;&lt;code&gt;Media:&lt;/code&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;code&gt;File:&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. When the user clicks on the link, the browser goes directly to the image. As before, you can change the text so it says anything you want.

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: [[Media:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]

This can be awkward if the image is quite large, for the full size image will be displayed when the user clicks the link.

Finally, you can link to one image from a thumbnail's small double-rectangle icon [[File:Magnify-clip.png|link=|alt=]], but display another image using &quot;{{para|thumb|&lt;var&gt;Displayed image name&lt;/var&gt;}}&quot;. This is intended for the rare cases when the Wikibooks software that reduces images to thumbnails does a poor job, and you want to provide your own thumbnail. In the following example, the double-rectangle links to ''[[:File:Anime stub.svg]]'' but the image displayed is ''[[:File:Anime stub.png]]'':

[[File:Anime stub.svg|thumb=Anime stub.png|alt=Head of cute girl, manga-style, with blue hair, big eyes and smile, and gray puzzle pieces below and around her hair|Putting the puzzle together]]
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Anime stub.svg|thumb=Anime stub.png|alt=Head of cute girl, manga-style, with blue hair, big eyes and smile, and gray puzzle pieces below and around her hair|Putting the puzzle together]]

Although I'm not a bureaucrat here, I've made [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] a sysop using my [[m:steward|steward]] access. This is because your only bureaucrat is away and a request was made at [[m:requests for permissions|requests for permissions]] following a successful vote for Gentgeen here.  [[User:Angela|Angela]] 00:25, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

User:Dysprosia seems to be following an agenda of occasional time wasting by deleting material or suggesting material for deletion that is being developed or serves a useful though minority interest. What is the process for limiting or curtailing his nonsense? Surely he can be encouraged to do more useful and constructive work which he is clearly capable of? [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 20:44, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I feel that I am being harassed by [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] for quite a number of reasons. For the first reason, please see my entry on VfU.

My IP was blocked by Gentgeen with no warning and no citation of policy, and for no apparent reason. When I asked him why, he said &quot;Because you, editing anonymously at the time, deleted an anonymous user's nomination on VfD&quot;. Last time I checked this is not a violation of Wikibooks policy. He was also initially hesitant to remove the block, until I made it clear I wasn't going to just give it a rest until it expired hours later (I wanted to add to a VfD debate, which was to end just hours later, the same VfD debate Gentgeen's decision regarding which I have mentioned at VfU I find irresponsible). I even asked him for other policy justifications, and he could give me none.

I also object to his unnessecarily hostile attitude towards me, beginning at VfD, and most recently on IRC (after a while, I couldn't take it anymore and I exploded and was extremely hostile for perhaps 30 seconds.), during which I said &quot;your mother is a policy&quot; which he later gave as one of two reasons for not continuing discussion with me. In fact, he said his mother is an ISO expert and has authored plenty of policies, and at the time did not appear to take offence to my attempt to let anger out without being unnessecarily agressive (which later failed, as I noted above).

In addition, I believe he has no respect for the fact that experienced users don't just appear, they start as newcomers. He repeatedly said hostile things to me about how Wikibooks is not Wikipedia (which is extremely obvious), how Wikibooks policy differs from Wikipedia policy (why wouldn't it?), and how Wikipedians are to be 'handled' more rashly than Wikibooksians.

In fact, regarding what he said about validity of the &quot;kenbuloga&quot; recipe (my existing response nonwithstanding), I have this to say: In a Google for &quot;Wikibooks is not Wikipedia&quot;, a policy which was unilaterally written, voted on, and implemented by him and only him, turns up only a handful of pages, all of which are Gentgeen telling others (sometimes hostily) that &quot;Wikibooks is not Wikipedia&quot;.

While I would hesitate to say that Gentgeen is a bad admin or a &quot;rogue sysop&quot; (in fact, since the latter is used almost exclusively by known trolls and banned users, chances are I'd not use it at all in serious discourse), I do not think his conduct in these situations was appropriate and I would like to see it rectified.

--[[User:Node ue|Node ue]] 22:55, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)

* In fact, the &quot;keep&quot; votes for [[Cookbook:Special brownies]] (a debate in which I didn't much participate) greatly outnumbered the votes for &quot;delete&quot;, 9-4. It was extremely irresponsible of Gentgeen to 1. remove it from this page and 2. delete the article, without further discussion of which votes should be counted, and which should not, especially since he himself had voted &quot;delete&quot;. --[[User:Node ue|Node ue]] 23:15, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)

* I agree, I believe gentgeen has abused his adminship.  He deletes pages with a total disregard for wikibooks policy and calls vital anon members of the wikibooks community &quot;sockpuppets&quot; and declares their votes null.  He puts his own agenda over the people's, and deletes pages with 20 Keep - 6 delete votes.  Also, in order to make groups look bad, he will spam pages (see the main page's history).  He used an anon account to make the keep side of a book look bad.  This is absolutely unacceptable for an admin that everyone looks up too, and should be dealt with accordingly.  Revoke his adminship. [[User:Jm51|Jm51]] 22:04, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
: Gentgeen did ''not'' delete Beating Season. I did. Check the logs, please. I counted the votes 8 delete to 2 keep, amongst logged in users. It is Wikipedia policy to disregard anonymous votes in VfD and I have implemented this policy here also. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:06, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::it wasn't in the logs.  This is wikibooks, not wikipedia.  Nowhere in the wikibooks policy does it say anon users votes are null.  Furthermore, he spammed and vandalized the main page to make the &quot;keep&quot; side look bad.  That's just plain wrong.  [[User:Jm51|Jm51]] 23:30, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::: You aren't looking hard enough[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Dysprosia&amp;page=Beating+Season]. Provide some diffs, that is, some actual evidence to support your claims against Gentgeen. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 00:43, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::: I shouldn't have to look hard.  In fact, all, I should have to do is go to [[Wikibooks:Deletion log]] and search for Beating Season, but it's nowhere to be found.  Apparently the admins around here disregard policy for to make life harder for the normal users or sockpuppets, as you'd rather call us.  As for genteen.  See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion&amp;oldid=84881 here].  He made the name &quot;thetruth&quot; to make the keep side look bad.  later, when helpful anonymous user 67.118.3.163 accused gentgeen of posting that (&quot;Oh, that's real productive. Gentgreen. stop posting that crap annon. to make the &quot;KEEP&quot; side look bad. pathetic.&quot;) gentgeen had no defense.  Despite's gentgeen's strong effort to make the keep side look bad, they were still garnering enough votes to justify keeping the book (22 - 4 or something?), gentgeen realized he had to really make the book look bad.  Enter his new ip 67.115.107.84.  In order for wikibookians to be so outraged to vote against beating season, gentgeen made the main page look something like [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=85507 this].  Also, as 67.115.107.84, he vandalized a bunch of user pages, added some rambling &quot;keep side arguments&quot; (to make others see the keep side is destructive) and even his own (to make reinforce the impression it was a wacko on the keep side) (see his [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=67.115.107.84 trail of destruction]).  When confronted with this in the [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]], gentgeen dodges the issue, just like when 67.118.3.163 confronted him.  Coincidence?  No way.  Gentgeen has a total disregard for policy and will stop at nothing to delete a page he believes should be deleted and will stop at nothing - disfranchising anon voters, spamming and vandalising the main page, faking votes.  He is risky at best as a regular user, and downright dangerous as an admin.  Revoke '''now!!!''' [[User:Jm51|Jm51]] 23:47, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::::: Firstly, you're not even looking in the right place. Go look at the link. [[Wikibooks:Deletion log]] is obsolete since we're running 1.4.
:::::: It doesn't say that, in fact there are deletions less than a month old.  Maybe a friendly reminder at the top would help users not familiar with version of mediawiki wikibooks is using?
::::: Secondly, you have no real proof whatsoever that Gentgeen created that user.

== Counting VFD votes? ==

I have a procedural question for the more seasoned administrators: Which votes should be counted for VfD? For example, would an unlogged in user (just recorded as an IP) count? This would seem undesirable because someone could repeatedly use a dial-in account to get dozens of different IPs. Further, there's the sock-puppet problem when user accounts are made that have no signifigant contributions behind them.

(Obviously if a non-logged in user provides cogent, compelling arguments in favor for or against deleting that could help persuade people, so such users are not completely left out of the process.)

Thanks, --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:38, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC).
:I think anon users with different ip ranges are valid.  for example if the ips are from different netblocks, etc. they are obviously different people.
::Obviously? Someone could use dial-up, plus DSL, plus work or school to get plenty of IPs. Or, ask friends to do so. (But I guess you know all about this?) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:24, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::Standard procedure on many Wikimedia projects is that only logged in users may vote.  If a user wants to participate in community processes, they should join the community. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:28, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::: I agree, though I'd like to see this properly codified in Wikibooks deletion policy to avoid such silly arguments. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 00:43, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::::Mshonle's situation is possible, but not probable.  Nobody really cares that much to go out of their way to fake votes.  Why should a user who surfs wikibooks occasionaly be forced to give up private information in order to vote?  (your still in self-denial.  beating season had 22 legititmate votes that disagreed with you, and your still in shock.  get over it, and get over yourself.) [[User:Jm51|Jm51]] 23:50, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Thanks Gentgeen and Dysprosia! Is it proper to remove non logged-in user votes from the list (or to indent them to the side?) so that there is no confusion in counting? [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:47, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:I wouldn't delete a vote, but feel free to comment about the non-standard nature of the vote.  If the user brings up good points in their vote, other logged in users should take their points in mind when they vote. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:29, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::Thanks! That makes sense. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:33, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Time limits for Admins==

This is a request for a policy change here on Wikibooks, and I am starting this discussion to make this &quot;official&quot;, as suggested by Aya on [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]].

The argument I'm trying to make is that being an admin on Wikibooks is not something to take lightly.  If you want to serve as an admin, you should be active not only as an editor/author here on Wikibooks, but also well versed and understanding of the policies here as well.  The admin is an enforcement position that the primary power is the ability to delete content from the public side of the Wikimedia project they have been appointed to oversee, as well as the power to &quot;protect&quot; pages from being edited, mainly to avoid vandalism and to &quot;cool off&quot; edit wars.

I am requesting to establish a &quot;time limit&quot; for how long an admin can be formally listed as an admin if they are no longer active in either their duties as an admin or even as an editor/author here on Wikibooks.  Essentially the wording should be something such as the following:

::''Being appointed as a Wikibooks administrator is not a lifetime appointment.  If you are not actively involved with being an author/editor of Wikibooks for more than one full calendar year, it will be assumed that you no longer want to be involved directly with Wikibooks as an administrator.  Circumstances in life may make it difficult to be as actively involved in Wikibooks as you may have been when you were nominated as an admin, and don't take the fact that you have been removed from administration status as a personal insult.  If you have your administrator status removed in this manner, you are still free to become an admin again in the future if you become active again, but it would have to go through a formal nomination/voting process like the first time you were nominated.  If you see that you are going to be gone from Wikibooks for an extended period of time, it is also encouraged that you voluntarily request that your admin status be removed.  Your Wikibooks user account will still be active, and this does not affect your ability to come back and edit content.''

I can think of a number of reasons why administrators in this circumstance should be removed.  The #1 reason above all is in the unfortunate circumstance when the user password database is compromised and some vandal decides that normal screwing up Wikibooks is not sufficient.  Instead they go on a wild rampage and start vandalising/protecting the vandalism, deleting random content, and otherwise making a mess of an admin account (including banning other admins or other forms of mischief).  It could get really ugly if one of these inactive admins has their account compromised.  Active administrators are much more likely to catch it if somebody else is using their account.

:This requires a definition of &quot;active&quot; that is something like &quot;edited in the last 48 hours&quot;. For anything else, the wild rampage will be stopped by a developer (via ssh into the server -- the other admins would be blocked) long before the admin discovers that his account has been abused. Since the admin wouldn't have access to his own account anyway, the only advantage of a (very) active admin would be that he might quickly send an email to the mailing list. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:59, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

The other issue is that ordinary Wikibookians need to know who to turn to for assistance to help protect/unprotect modules for various reasons, or even to know who some &quot;experienced users&quot; are that can be trusted to give advise in terms of editorial content.  Nothing is more frustrating than trying to contact an administrator and getting no answer.  If this apathy is simply because the admin hasn't been showing up to read the requests, they are not doing their job that they have offered.  If you don't want the pressures of being an administrator, it should be simple to request that your status as an admin be removed.  You are still able to edit content and help build Wikibooks, and there are many roles that people can take on (including mentoring) that don't require administrator status.

If you are looking for precedence, why don't you [[meta:Meta:Administrators|look at the policies on Meta]] for admins ''on'' Meta.  This was more along the lines of what I thought we ought to adopt here, but I don't think we need to be quite so harsh.  They have a specific requirement for a number of edits that I don't think is so reasonable, as it will encourage somebody to do a whole bunch of meaningless edits just to inflate the numbers.  I would rather that somebody show that they have done some meaningful contributions to Wikibooks, but that determination is a part of the voting process and the evaluation that each user voting for/against the admin.

Yes, Wikipedia has the following statement:
:There have also been a number of policy proposals to revoke adminship from user accounts of people who no longer participate in the project. These proposals have lacked widespread support.

An interesting alternative to look at [[wikisource:Wikisource:Administrator|is on Wikisource]], where they list the inactive admins more as admins Emeritus.  They still have &quot;sysop&quot; privileges, but it is clear that they are not active users and that anybody asking them for help should go elsewhere.

:Rather than splitting the list in two, simply order the list. Ordering by most recent edit is reasonable, though something predictive of future edits would be better. (example: an admin who edits every weekend should rise in rank as the weekend approaches) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:59, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

::I don't think that kind of level of information is really needed. It sure is a lot of bits of information, but all we really need is 1-bit (2 bits max) instead of a moving log-n number of bits. I.e., we just need to know &quot;active/not active&quot;. After that, it's not a popularity contest. If Alice has 315 edits per week, she's in the same class as Bob who has 400 edits per week. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:07, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::: Erm. I case you hadn't noticed, I'd already split the lists when I added in Albert. I've just arbitrarily defined anyone who hasn't made an edit for over a month to be inactive. Anything more complex ought to be written in software. We can file a feature request to bugzilla.wikimedia.org if need be, but I think that ought to suffice for now. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:13, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

[[wikt:Wiktionary:Administrators/Former|Wikitionary has another interesting policy]] that is also somewhat similar to what I'm proposing, and had two admins that were de-sysop'd.

[[commons:Commons:Administrators#Inactive admins|Commons has still another policy]] that in this case is modeled after Meta, and has a 6 month inactivity period instead.

[[wikiquote:Wikiquote:Administrators|WIkiquote is another one]] that lists all admins, but has an Emeritus status of sorts for inactive admins.

I know this isn't a &quot;burning&quot; issue, but for Wikibooks in particular there has been an issue with a perception that all is well because there were a bunch of admins that were able to take care of everything, and that no more were needed.  I know that you broke that logjam, Aya, but at the same time arguments for/against creating new admins were based on the number of admins already on Wikibooks.  A policy of removing sysop status due to inactivity can show that there is a more &quot;pressing need&quot; for admins if (heaven forbid) we get into a situation like we had earlier when nobody seemed to become an admin no matter how positive and glowing the voting record was for the request.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:47, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

:I sure didn't feel that there were enough admins. The last time I thought about the issue, I figured that 8 bureaucrats and 120 admins would be about right. (roughly; it's been a few months since I made the estimate) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:59, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

:I think we should follow the wikipedia lead and list active, semi-active, and inactive admins. Thus, instead of revoking the privileges it'll be much more clear to users that only the top list (or top two lists) should be considered. That should solve the perception problem. However, I do like the idea of encouraging people to request a deadmin if they know they won't be putting any time into it in the foreseeable future. And perhaps if someone is not active for a year, we could email them and ask, under no pressure, if they are still interested. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:59, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

:: That's more what I had in mind, purely because it's simple.

== infinite IP blocks ==

Could we please stop doing this? IP addresses do not permanently map to humans. The fight agains email spam has seen the creation of infinite IP blocks too, leaving many innocent companies and individuals with difficulty in sending email. IP address usage changes for many reasons:

*new PC purchased, eliminating spam zombie software (months or a year or two)
*student assigned to a new dorm room for the next semester (months)
*cable company reassigns addresses (days or months)
*dial-up connection (hours)
*apartment lease ends and tenant moves on (months)
*nasty person loses their job with the net connection (months)
*death, perhaps from old age

Monday I get a new IP address. Who knows? Maybe I'll be blocked because somebody misbehaved years ago.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:22, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

: Problem is, most of those IP addresses are either hacked or misconfigured open HTTP proxy servers which spammers use to vandalize pages. There are lists of these open proxies published in the internet underground. Until these dodgy proxies are fixed, we have no other means to prevent repeated, scripted vandalism attacks from these addresses. You'll notice some of them are set by a user called &quot;User:&quot; which is an automatic script that the server admins use to mass-block those addresses on '''all''' Wikimedia wikis. If you have a better suggestion on how to prevent vandalism, suggest it here. We generally don't bother blocking the casual vandal at all. If they become a real nuisance, then I suggest a warning and short block (say 24h), increasing in duration if they persist. I haven't had to do that yet. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:37, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::I think any vandal that would qualify as &quot;a real nuisance&quot; should be blocked for much longer than a day. A week at least. Further, any spam should be blocked immediately. An IP with a familiar vandalism couldn't possibly count as &quot;a newbie experiment,&quot; as we sometimes charitably call vandalism, so even one page being edited might call for a block. We can try to psychoanalyze vandals and argue that &quot;maybe if we don't block them, they'd get less of a thrill out of doing it,&quot; but sometimes it's just a judgement call. Very little is lost with short term blocks... and I don't even think it needs to escalate to real nuisance before doing something other than just reverting. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::BTW, I like the idea of death from old age being a cause for a vandal to stop. I can just picture the 95 year olds writing &quot;iron my shirt&quot; everywhere. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::That an IP address has a hacked or misconfigured open HTTP proxy server doesn't change things. Suppose Bob has one. After a couple months, Bob's cable company assigns a new IP address. A few months later, Bob moves into his new house in the next town over and gets DSL. Meanwhile, the old IP address gets assigned to Joe. It's many months later, and Joe discovers the wiki... nah, of course you can't edit live web pages. They were just kidding, surely. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:38, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::I don't object to the concept of blocking by IP address. (not that I love it, but I haven't a better idea) I only object to extremely long blocks. A year might be a reasonable upper limit. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:38, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I think I may have to agree with Albert here.  Even a &quot;five year&quot; IP block would be close to a death penalty here, and it would be interesting to see what kind of &quot;attacks&quot; against this or any Wikimedia server have happened (even attempts) by any IP address that has been listed as a blocked IP address for more than 1 year.  I know that is a question for developers rather than anything any admin can request, but IP address blocks that have a more definite &quot;probation&quot; period would be preferable.&lt;p&gt;As far as hacked, misconfigured, or open HTTP proxy servers is concerned, there is (or should be) some lists of servers that could accomplish this task.  IMHO this is something that should be occuring not just within this particular Wikibooks project but rather something that is system-wide across all Wikimedia projects, and that an admin (or even any registered user) should be able to &quot;suggest&quot; an IP address to be &quot;checked&quot; and verified that it is an open HTTP proxy.  There are technical means to verify that issue and IP addresses of this nature can and should be blocked across all Wikimedia projects.  This in particular would help protect smaller communities (like the Finnish Wikibooks) where a single admin simply can't keep up with everything that is happening.  As far as trying to slow down or stop vandals with a known IP address, a policy of ever increasing peanalties ought to be adopted instead, with harshness to repeat abusers.  Even this perhaps should be applied to a range of IP addresses, as dynamic IP address assignment is fairly routine even in a corporate setting where static IP addresses perhaps could be managed but for a lazy IT techie. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:24, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

== user's manual for sysop ==

I'm wondering if there is a user's manual somewhere for new admins? for instance, how specifically can pages be protected/deleted, how can they be unprotected/undeleted? how do we go about blocking an IP address? how do we specify an infinate block (which is bad), from a timed block (which is not so bad)? I would like to see some sort of source for this information. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 17:18, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

:There is no specific &quot;sysop's guide&quot; at the moment, although several sysops have talked about the possibility in the past. Current sysop &quot;policies&quot; are scattered throughout the policy pages linked to from [[WB:PAG]], and on other random pages scattered around the pages in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=&amp;namespace=4 Wikibooks namespace]. Collating all this into a single &quot;sysop's guide&quot; would indeed be a noble goal, but no-one has taken on the task to date.

== Official Admin Policy ==

I am working on a draft of an official policy concerning admins, bcrats, and checkusers. I personally feel that wikibooks needs such a policy, but i want to entertain some discussion and see what the community thinks on the matter. The draft of my new proposal is located at:
:[[Wikibooks:Administrators/Proposal]]
I dont want to start active discussion on this really until we finalize the voting policy. but I do want users to come take a look at it, and see if there are any glaring problems with this draft. I have intentionally kept parts of this draft vague and open to interpretation, because I dont want to put too many rigid restrictions and guidelines on admins. I do make special note that admins can be removed if they are inactive, or if they violate policy. Alot of the points here were lifted from [[Help:Administrators]], but it is my opinion that we need an official policy on this matter, and not just a limp help file. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Perfection not required; or, the joy of editing ==

It is a wonderful thing when someone adds a complete, well-written, final draft to Wikibooks. This should always be encouraged.

However, one of the great advantages of the [[w:wiki|wiki]] system is that incomplete, poorly-written first drafts of textbooks can evolve into polished, presentable masterpieces through the process of collaborative editing. This gives our approach an advantage over other ways of producing similar end-products. Hence, the submission of rough drafts (but not too rough) should also be encouraged.

One person can start off with an overview or a few random facts. Another person can add a minority opinion. Someone else can round off the content with additional perspectives. Yet another can play up an angle that has been neglected, or reword the earlier opinions to a more [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]. A following person might have facts and figures or a graphic to include.

As all this material is added, anyone can jump in and refactor to turn it into a more cohesive whole. Then more text will be added, then more refactoring, and the module will gradually evolve ever-closer to the ultimate final draft.

During this process, the module might look like a first draft—or worse, a random collection of notes and factoids. Rather than being horrified by this ugliness, we should rejoice in its potential, and have faith that the editing process will turn it into brilliant prose.

Of course, we don't have to like it; we even, occasionally, criticize really substandard work, in addition to simply correcting it. The most important thing, though, is to correct it if it can be corrected. For text that is beyond hope, we have gotten into the habit of removing the offending content to the corresponding [[WB:TALK|talk page]], or, in cases where the content obviously has no redeeming merit whatsoever, deleting it outright. The latter action should not be done lightly, however.

== On editing styles ==
Generally, different people here have different editing &quot;styles&quot;. Some people edit lightly, and focus on contributing new content. Others prefer to greatly expand existing &quot;stubs&quot; and improve content. Some like to make relatively small copy-editing, linking, and page-naming changes. There's room for all of these on Wikibooks.

There are also different editing styles in the sense of how bold people are willing to be. Generally, most of us think we should [[Wikibooks:Be bold|be bold in updating pages]]. Virtually no one behaves as though previous authors need to be consulted before making changes; if we thought that, we'd make rather little progress. Quite to the contrary, some of us think you should not beat around the bush at all—simply change a page immediately, when you see something problematic, rather than to discuss changes that need to be made. Discussion, from this point of view, is a last resort. Then there is a more intermediate view, according to which dialogue ''qua'' dialogue should be respected, but at the same time a minor tweak early on can avoid a flame war. In this view, to edit radically or not will often depend on the context—which seems reasonable enough.

Again, there is a place for all of these attitudes on Wikibooks.

With large deletions or replacements, it might be better to suggest changes in a discussion, lest the original author get discouraged and quit posting.
One person's improvement is another's desecration, and nobody likes to see their work just flushed without warning.

So, whatever you do, try to preserve information. Reasons for removing bits of a module include:

*factual errors
*duplication
*irrelevancy
*patent nonsense
*[[Wikibooks:Copyrights|copyright violations]]

Alternatives include:

*rephrasing while keeping the content
*moving text within a page or to another page (existing or new)
*adding more of what you think is important to make a page more balanced

If, in your considered judgment, a page simply needs to be rewritten or changed substantially, go ahead and do that. But preserve any old contents you think might have some discussion value on the talk page, along with a comment about ''why'' you made the change. Even if you delete something that's just plain wrong, odds are that it got there because someone believed it was true, so preserve a comment that it is in fact wrong to inform later editors.

In any event, whether you decide to edit very boldly or to make inquiries on talk page first, please bear in mind that Wikibooks is not a discussion forum. Wikibooks can be a very energetic place, and it's best for the project as a whole if we concentrate our energies on improving modules rather than defending our pet theories, ideologies, religions, etc. Some consideration of [[Wikibooks:Etiquette|Etiquette]] wouldn't hurt.

==Further suggestions for the etiquette and method of editing==

* Perhaps use the discussion page to first preserve content that could be added back in error and explain why the content is being altered. Use your browser's back button to copy-paste the content to be quoted, or to reduce mistakes use two browser windows or tabs.
*: Since discussion pages can get lengthy and all content is preserved in the history, one paragraph on what is wrong and why is probably all that is needed most of the time. The exception might be when someone drastically refactors a page, in which case use a subpage of the discussion page and link to it from the discussion page.
* Use the top of discussion pages to help organize and plan collaboration efforts. For example use an outline of what still needs to be done (a to-do list for example) and who is currently working on what parts of the model. Also include links to other related discussion pages, categories or any important notices at the top so people don't accidentally delete them by mistake. 
*: As the top of discussions pages or any discussion section gets long, archive old business and discussions. ''This helps keep discussion pages current, relevant and understandable'', which is most important for keeping discussion pages usable and readable. Use archive names with the same name as a section name whenever possible so people can find discussions later on.
* Summarize long discussions and retain conclusions of long discussions, so that others can get involved later or get up to speed quickly. While this isn't required per se, doing so goes a long way towards keeping collaboration with others pleasant and discussions fresh so everyone can keep up with developments.
*Last, but not least, some numbering scheme ought to prefix all sections below the fixed sections (i.e. all are categorized as 'temporary topics' even though most of each are eventually separated and archived.) The section ordinal number prefix serves notice when something no longer appears in the ordinal list of sections as it contains only expired discussions, and pertinent information is retained.

Comments? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:23, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== snippet-01 ==

re:So, whatever you do, try to preserve information. Reasons for removing bits of an module include:
*List is missing the obvious: ''Factual error'' or ''error in context'', A is 'wrong', and ''C goes with B, but B doesn't apply in the context so neither does C. (''One hopes these sophmoric gaffs happen less here than at Wikipedia! &lt;G&gt;) [[User:Fabartus|FrankB]]-&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User talk:Fabartus]] 06:17, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

== snippet-02 ==

''If, in your considered judgment, a page simply needs to be rewritten or changed substantially, go ahead and do that. But preserve any old contents you think might have some discussion value on the talk page, along with a comment about why you made the change. Even if you delete something that's just plain wrong, odds are that it got there because someone believed it was true, so preserve a comment that it is in fact wrong to inform later editors.''
*I'd suggest exporting only the parts most likely to be duplicated as an error to the talk, with comments, before altering content. It's easy to do from within the edit window by backspacing, cutting, moving to the talk, pasting with comment. Even easier with two browser windows open, or two tabs. One useful 'safeguard' is to edit in one type browser and browse, check, monitor, extract, compare in the other. For the latter use, one of the Tabbed browsers is best. Firefox and Netscape both fail to search into the edit window, whereas IE6 does, so that is the better browser for copyedits, spelling and minor grammer corrections.
:*Since the talks can get lengthy with too much, and all content is preserved in history pages, so a paragraph on what is wrong, and a paragraph why is probably the only need 98% of the time. The histories solve the odd 2% where large recoveries are in order. The exception might be when someone attempts a drastic refactoring, but cutting that into a 'temp page' (Sandbox) rather than the talk, with a link to it in the talk (one of those 'organized common resources' mentioned in the below&amp;mdash; information is a resource!) page.
*Using the top of talk pages as a Organized Project page is a good idea. By that I mean place project resources, including ToDo lists, lists of who is taking on what sub-part, perhaps an outline, etc. RobinH asked me for comments herein, but I don't know enough specifics of how you all work together to get specific myself. But taking the Heading with a Roster, ToDo's, and some resources as an example, the top section would be a general precise on the aims of that module, followed by the roster which should probably include when someone generally works, Third I'd place resources such as links to other modules, categories (if you use them here) and links to outside references, etc. each to their own sub-section. Fourth, the ToDo list, which people would strike out as items get finished with signature (I like to use #, and ## items in such&amp;mdash; helps in planning and organization, as the numbers can be referred to in talk sections following obviating confusion (of terms or task). 
:*As this list or any talk section gets long, it can be archived to 'clean' the page into the archive page which matches title sections, thus archiving old business and old discussions et. al by archiving just part of a section or many sections is quite easy to do. ''Such tidiness also helps in keeping the obfusticating clutter away from ongoing business'', it's most important feature. 
*Do retain a conclusion of a long discussion linking to the archived long parts, so others can get involved later or get back up to speed after a time away, as may pertain.
:*While this 'exercise in verbosity' is not 'On Policy' per se, it goes a long way to keeping collaboration with others ameniable and pleasant, so it might be considered as a 'potential guideline' as to how to keep talks fresh enough for everyone to keep up with developments.

This guideline mentions ''&quot;... Firefox and Netscape both fail to search into the edit window ...&quot;'', which is incorrect.
I'm using Firefox now, and it seems to search and find text in the edit window (textarea) just fine.
How do I fix this without getting sidetracked into yet another overly detailed &quot;Software A vs Software B&quot; flamefest?

== Proposal for major policy overhaul ==

Original e-mail from [[User:KelvSYC]] at: http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002415.html

Reply from [[User:Robert Horning]] at: http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002416.html

My original plan was to try to get all 'policy' pages such as [[WB:WIN]], etc., onto Meta, but I don't think it's going to be practical. The alternative is that each Wikimedia project remains autonomous, and has its own policy pages. It just seems a shame that many (at least en.wikipedia.org and en.wikibooks.org) shared common policies (such as [[w:WP:NPOV]] and [[WB:NPOV]]) which become desychronized over time. One of the keys rules for a DBA (database administrator) is that each datum should have one, and only one, canonical location, otherwise you end up with contradictary data. But how did things end up so confusing?

; A brief history of Wikimedia

First of all, I haven't been around that long, so some of this is guesswork.

It all started with the project now hosted at en.wikipedia.org. The idea being to collaboratively create a generalized encyclopedia with no (apparent) limitation on its scope. That is to say, entries in any natural language were considered 'fair game', and some users felt it was appropriate to create extensive entries such as 'How to play chess', and the like. The scope also allowed entries pertaining to concepts which were very specific to Wikipedia, its users, and their culture.

At some point, someone (perhaps Jimbo?) decided this was going to get in the way of creating an encyclopedia, so a number of other Wikimedia projects were set up, in the hopes that this data could be transferred to a more appropriate location.

The Wikipedia project was split up into different language codes. This was probably a good idea. It would be impossible to administer a site containing text in a dozen languages you don't understand. I realize that some people speak multiple languages, but I doubt anyone speaks all of the languages for which a Wikipedia current exists.

Meta-Wiki was put in place to take on all the Wikipedia-specific concepts, including policy, but it was only used for a short while, after which it all moved back to Wikipedia. The only roles it now serves are as a host to pages about the myriad 'associations of &lt;something&gt; Wikipedians', and as a place to post news about, and arrange translations between, projects. It also ended up as a dumping ground for content that users were told was 'inappropriate for Wikipedia'.

Wikibooks was created for the much larger articles which had enough text to constitute a whole book on the subject, but has also ended up as a dumping ground for encyclopedia-length articles.

Wiktionary was created for the shorter, dictionary-length entries, which were felt to be inappropriate for Wikipedia. This project has actually worked quite nicely, although it will always have minor scope overlap with Wikipedia, since the first sentence of a Wikipedia article is generally a dictionary-length definition, and where multiple meanings exist for the same word, they generally exist as both a Wiktionary entry, and a Wikipedia disambiguation page.

Over time, some content was transferred, while some was not. Since each project had its own 'what &lt;project&gt; is/isn't' page, users changed its scope over time as well. The endless cycle continues today:

# Create a new wiki
# Create a badly-defined scope
# Fill it with inappropriate content
# When it becomes unmanagable, goto 1

What the projects need is centralized management, but with the flexibilty and freedom to post what you like, where you like, combined with the fact that there's a negligable amount of responsibility as to who should be sorting it out, I don't think it's ever going to work.

; But what is a wiki anyway?

I guess at its most basic, it's a mapping of key/value pairs. The key is the name of a page, and the value is the text on that page. For some wikis it's pretty obvious how this mapping should work. The page named 'Programming' on Wiktionary and Wikipedia are fairly obvious, but what about Wikibooks? Should it be a book on programming? Or should that data fall into a subpage of a book on computers? e.g. 'Computers/Programming'. The point is that the MediaWiki software is a poor choice for a project intending to create books.

; Back on topic

First of all, using a 'What &lt;project&gt; is not' page as a means to determine scope is a rather strange idea. See the paragraph starting with 'The asymmetry of not' at http://abelard.org/category/category.htm#zero_error for an explanation. Personally, I think something along the lines of [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#The goal of Wikibooks]] might be better, which is really just an elaboration of the fundamental policy that 'Wikibooks is a collection of open-content textbooks'. That's all you really need. I don't know where you got the phrase 'instructional material' from, but looking in a dictionary, the word 'instructional' would not preclude biographical material. Creating more pages such as [[WB:IM]] and [[WB:RM]] in addition to [[WB:WIN]] may just make things worse, as there is always the possibility that a user will find one of these pages, and not the other.

My own view is to throw away the page [[WB:WIN]], and use the page [[Wikibooks:About]] to define the scope in a more positive fashion. The exclusions listed in [[WB:WIN]] could still be a part of this page. The advantage of the page [[Wikibooks:About]] is that it's highly visible (just click on the word 'Wikibooks' on the [[Main page]] to get there). Most new users will probably just read that, not bother reading anything else, and just get on with their editing. Meta uses the page [[m:Meta:About]] for this purpose.

[[WB:HNS]] should be merged into [[WB:NC]], and the colon separator should perhaps be dropped completely, since many users are too lazy to provide backlinks to their book's main pain. As for [[WB:MOS]], that doesn't even exist. I don't recommend creating it, since it will be a fork of [[w:WP:MOS]]. Remember forks are evil. My own view is that any parts of Wikipedia's version which are relevant to all Wikimedia projects (most of it in fact) should be moved to Meta, and a new section added which pertains only to Wikibooks.

I noticed a lot of people are creating their own standards (MOSs) for individual book projects, and including the standards in subpages of the books. This is perhaps a better idea than having one big MOS containing everything.

I could go on for ages, but I'll stop here for now, to put a bit more thought into the problems. I still believe that the 'all policy should be on Meta' is right (just read [[m:Meta:About]]). I think what I need to do to fix it, is to get admin privs on meta, and tidy up the whole damn thing. I've made a start ([[m:Directory]] and [[m:Policy]]), but I'll need to make changes to [[m:Main page]] to make it much clearer as to what the hell it's all about. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:36, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

:I agree that it is time for some more organization and policy review. &quot;What Wikibooks is not&quot; also seems kind of strange to me and I like the idea of simply stating it in positive terms in the &quot;about&quot; page. I was thinking about an organizational division between 
:* textbooks, 
:* study guides,
:* non-textbook books and how-to's, including non-serious material,
:* lesson plans and other didactic materials.

:I might mention that it always seemed to make more sense to me to house everything on the same website, the encyclopedia, dictionary and textbook materials at least. Maybe someday it will all move to Wikipedia and we can just click a tab to switch between the different sister projects. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 22:07, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

::We certainly need a more clear cut definition of what Wikibooks is, and hence what it is not. The current definition has been causing problems on VfD. But, that's part of a wider problem with VfD, whereby some people vote to keep or delete a book depending only on how much they like it. Our most important polices (permitted content, naming conventions, rules of conduct, etc.) should be more visible, and presented in a concise form for newcomers. Neglecting to complete edit summaries seems to be the rule, maybe we need to apply some pressure to change that. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 05:20, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

:::Personally, empty edit summaries don't bother me for the most part, since I don't necessarily trust that they match the actual edit. That is to say, I will always check the diff. The only time they're important is when the edit is contentious, especially when removing content from a page. I will almost always revert an unexplained deletion. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:15, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

== Categorization of policies ==

All those pages about policies should be categorized, and those categories should be subcategories of another category like [[:Category:Wikibooks policies and guidelines]]. Maybe we can get some ideas from Wikipedia, for example the [[w:Category:Wikipedia policies and guidelines]] is also a subcategory of [[w:Category:Wikipedia]]. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 11:32, August 9, 2005 (UTC)

: If you read [[WB:PAG]], you will notice that the following categories already exist:

:* [[:Category:Wikibooks enforced policies]]
:* [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed policies]]
:* [[:Category:Wikibooks obsolete policies]]
:* [[:Category:Wikibooks rejected policies]]

: Pages are automatically added to those categories when you include the appropriate template in the page. I have made all those a subcategory of [[:Category:Wikibooks policies]]. That should suffice for now. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:52, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== Behavioral policies ==

After seeing a [[Wikibooks:No offensive usernames|three-year old version of a Wikipedia policy]] be revived and reading the above comments, I propose that: 

Wikibooks should treat the behavioral policies listed on [[w:Wikipedia:List of policies]] as one entity, and vote on whether to enact them all and use the next versions of those policies, created on Wikipedia (provided that they aren't radically different, sort of like agreeing to license your work under the next GFDL version).

Benefits:
#All behavioral policies are written in the same spirit, and with the same goal in mind
#Wikipedia's policies have had  several years of field-testing and corrections
#Behavioral policies are general, all-purpose rules that are not unqiue to any wiki
--[[User:Hagindaz|अagin]]·[[User talk:Hagindaz|ძaz]] 10:37, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

: This is a very good idea, I agree with you. We should not waste time trying to invent something that is ready on Wikipedia. I don't think wikietiquette should be different on Wikibooks and Wikipedia. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:03, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

::Eleven new, somewhat verbose policies taken from a sister wiki that is not noted for its friendliness? I really hope not. What about one single concise behaviour policy (if we really need to have something formal). After all, what do we really need to say? My thoughts are:

:::Rule 1: Be nice.
:::Rule 2: If you break rule 1 then other wikibookians will take appropriate action to encourage you to be nice.
:::Rule 3: If you really do refuse to be nice, you will end up being blocked (though may be unblocked later if you offer credible evidence that you will abide by Rule 1).

::Ok, we might need a bit more than this, but probably not too much, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:04, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

:::One single policy is also a good idea. Really anything is better than having a dozen various policies, with half being enforced and half only proposed. But a simple three-rule policy runs the risk of [[m:instruction creep|growing longer and longer]] to handle upcoming circumstances. Of course we may be able to keep it simple, but there's a reason Wikipedia has all those policies. Assuming Wikibooks is eventually going to become as large as Wikipedia, we need to be prepared for the future. And a reasonable set of time-tested policies already happens to exist. --[[Special:Emailuser/Hagindaz|✉]][[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Hagindaz|t]]&lt;/sub&gt;\&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Hagindaz|c]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:55, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

''there's a reason Wikipedia has all those policies.'' Yes, but what is that reason? People like me suspect that reason is apathy: old policies tend accumulate like barnacles long after they become irrelevant, and there is no pressure to get rid of them. --[[User:70.189.77.59|70.189.77.59]] 14:56, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

== Reorganising this page ==

I'd like to reorganise this page quite dramatically and, therefore, have deceided not to be too bold and consult with the community beforehand.

I think the page would be more sensible for the user if the page grouped policies and guidelines according to their status, rather than treating them one after the other (in its present form, we might as well split the page in two).

I'm thinking:
# Definition of terms.
# Procedures
## Formulating policies and guidelines
## Enforcing policies
# Enforced policies.
# Accepted guidelines.
# Proposals
# Obsolete
# Rejected

* I'd like to polish the Definition of terms section to include the should/must definitions.
* I think Proposals should perhaps transclude [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed policies]] and [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed guidelines]] rather than duplicate the content, possibly (probably?) causing inconsistencies.
--[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

:Sounds good to me, this page always has been a bit of an eyesore, in my opinion. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:37, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

=== Definition of terms ===

I've cleaned this up for clarity. I commented the &quot;Wikibooks * ...&quot; parts out since I don't really think they are necessary. Their meaning is simply so obvious. As for the must/should, these have a subtle difference which is good to clarify. I'd still like to slim that section down a bit.

I'm still not sure how to word the official/obsolete/rejected/proposed definitions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 00:01, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

I've also acted on my slimming down on the must/should definitions as threatened earlier. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

=== Change to categorization ===

Currently, we have several categories which I'd like to see changed/merged. See table:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Category !! Template !! New category !! New template
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks enforced policies]] || {{tl|enforced}}
| [[:Category:Wikibooks policies]] || {{tl|policy}}
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks guidelines]] || {{tl|guideline}} || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | same both
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks obsolete policies]] || {{tl1|obsolete|&lt;new one&gt;}} || [[:Category:Wikibooks obsolete policies and guidelines]] || same
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks rejected policies]] || {{tl|rejected}}
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | [[:Category:Wikibooks rejected policies and guidelines]] || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | {{tl|rejected}}
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks rejected guidelines]] || {{tl|rejected guideline}}
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed policies]] || {{tl|proposed}}
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed policies and guidelines]] || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | {{tl|proposed}}
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed guidelines]] || {{tl|proposed guideline}}
|}

The rationale for merging the proposed policy and guideline categories is that, at least recently, proposals have been switched between the two, and being able to discuss which it should be would be a useful option without much beurocracy. The category page could also be used to coordinate which PAG proposal was currently being discussed. As for the rest of them, I think seperating them into seperate categories serves little purpose (except in the current official ones).

The names begin to sound a little odd, though, so I've been wondering if there is a nice collective term for &quot;policies and guidelines&quot; (and even essays?). The best I've come up with is &quot;principles&quot;, but that might just confuse and complicate. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

: This is now mostly done. There is now an over-arching category, [[:Category:Wikibooks policies and guidelines]], for all PAG matters. It should contain everything.
: The only two outstanding issues are to run through everything and make sure there aren't any typos, mistakes and inconsistancies, and to make sure everything is categorized properly (pipe what needs to be piped so that it appeas at the correct place in lists etc.) --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== Enforced and Official ==

I'm inlcined to start using &quot;official&quot; instead of &quot;enforced&quot; when referring to a policy or guideline. It seems odd that a policy should be enforced without being official and vice versa.

Essentially, there are some policies that are simply &quot;generally accepted&quot; without having been voted on (these would be enforced, but not official; though the page makes it seem that these aren't labelled as enforced). I'd say, we brand these as &quot;official&quot; as well (and, if need be, vote on them).

Using the term enforced for guidelines (as is currently done) also seems a little odd. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 00:01, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

: Done. {{tl|Policy}} and {{tl|Guideline}} now use &quot;official&quot;. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:53, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== these need some explanation ==

Under style guidelines, there is listed

 # Use color sparingly
 # Use subheads sparingly

why?? I'm not going to follow arbitrary guidelines for no reason whatsoever. Subheadings provide structure. Colour can be very illuminating. Why not do what works? Other similar 'one liners' are also owed some explanation. --[[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 02:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:Good point. The color one, i think, just makes things more readable, especially for people who are colorblind, or who need high-contrast settins in their browser. Sometimes manually setting the colors using HTML directives can override the disability settings on the person's browser. Perhaps it's a small reason (and possibly contrived), but it's something to consider before you turn your page into a terrible rainbow. 
:As to the subheadings one, I think the point is to use &quot;deeply nested&quot; subheadings sparingly. High-level subheadings can actually be smaller then the surrounding body text, and pages with so many levels of sub-headings should probably be broken into sub-pages instead. Also, pages with dozens of headings and subheadings will have an obnoxiously long TOC on the page, which can be annoying. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:13, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== Merging Policies and guidelines sections ==

I'd like to merge the policies and guidelines sections. They are topically identical and only differ in how strict they are. I suggest the following structure (sublists contain which current sections should go where):

Official policies and guidelines
* Copyrights policies
** Don't infringe on copyrights
* Project scope
** Wikibooks is an instructional resource
* Structure
** Wikibooks structure
* Content
** Wikibooks content
** Content guidelines
** Style guidelines
** General guidelines: [[Wikibooks:Editing guideline]]
* Behaviour
** Respect other contributors
** Behavior guidelines
* Maintainance
** Administrators
** General guidelines: [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]

Comments appreciated. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 23:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:The word &quot;guideline&quot; usually means a weaker form of policy. So, yes, gudielines are less strict policies. The reason policies are separated from guidelines in general is to highlight the fact that the policies are strict rules. I am happy with the current division - it draws a clear line in the sand: on one side are guidance notes and on the other side there are rules. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

== Merging policies and guidelines into one category ==

Currently, our policies and guidelines are seperated only by strictness. Some are policies actually have some parts that have &quot;should&quot;s in them and some guidelines might have some &quot;must&quot;s (haven't checked the latter). Anyway, given the definitions given at the top of the page, we really don't need to distinguish between policies and guidelines; a policy can contain both requirements and recommendations.

I'd really appreciate a discussion on this as it would be quite a drastic move. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 01:58, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

== Objections to Merging policies ==

As I have stated elsewhere, I personally prefer several smaller policies that are short and to the point as opposed to a single monolithic policy.  Here are some reason why:

Individual Policies are....

*Easier to reach a concensus.  If the topic is focused, you can usually get a number of people to agree to individual points.
*Easier to change.  If a policy contains just a few words and the justifications for the policy are weak, it is easier to change a single small policy instead of a huge monolithic policy document.
*Easier to write.  By keeping a policy to a specific point where there have been issues raised in the past, you can usually come up with come very clear wording that doesn't try to be everything for every situation.

This IMHO is where [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]] is falling apart as it is trying to become a single monolithic policy for a whole bunch of things at the same time.  My experience is that such policies rarely gain community concensus and often languish for years before acceptance, if ever.

My comments I made earlier with [[Wikibooks talk:Policies and guidelines/Proposed reform#Style over Substance]] still apply here.  It is possible (and it works rather well) to ammend policies one section at a time, making overall very minor modifications.  That precludes such massive overhauls such as what is being done with the What is Wikibooks, which really need to have stronger attention by the Wikibooks community for such a massive change.  Smaller changes, while significant over time, can also be reversed easily.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:56, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
:I fully agree that it would be far easier to get acceptance of smaller policies. Indeed all three points of Rob's seem entirely valid to me.  The sheer content of a single (or small number) all embracing policy is quite worrying never mind being all things to all people --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:I think you may have misunderstood Swift's suggestion (if thats what this is in response to). Swift was suggesting only the merging of categories and I think getting rid of the distinction between policy and guideline. Not about merging any current policy/guideline. I agree with your pointers, but disagree with your use WIW/Unstable as an example. It has a focused topic, what contents of Wikibooks consists of. Its about the same size as the current WIW. It does address problems now and in the past. It doesn't try to be everything to everyone. Before I did some major editing of it, the proposal was a lot longer and I think a lot less focused and didn't really address a specific point. It tries to be a more general policy (or guideline if you prefer) to address some confusion over what Wikibooks is for. I do admit its a major change in approach and probably the best solution which has already been suggested on its talk page is to discussion and deal with each section one at a time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:I'm in agreement with Rob here, and even though I appreciate your vision, Darklama, I don't think it's a method that's going to work in the long term. There are two options that I would like to consider:
:#A small number of policy documents, reasonably large, but vague. These documents would be supported by a number of smaller ancillary guideline pages, that would detail the specifics of the policy, as needed.
:#A large number of small policy documents, specific to their own topics, and not requiring external supporting documents.
:WIW is an important policy I think, but if we try to make it the only resource, or the only policy document, we are going to fail. I say we make it more simple, and use guidelines to fill in the details. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:35, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== Jimbo ==

I've removed the following text from this page:

:''In extreme and unusual cases, [[en:user:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] has stepped in to ban a user who has proven to be unusually disruptive. Jimbo has also declared certain policies to be, essentially, official [[en:Wikimedia|Wikimedia]] policies; see [http://www.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2002-November/000083.html this Wikien-l post].''

I did this for a few reasons:
#Jimbo has never really been as big an authority here as he has been at wikipedia (although many people, myself included, highly value Jimbo's opinions)
#Jimbo is generally less active in WMF things then he used to be.
#If anybody has the ability to dictate policy, it is likely the WMF board as a whole, not just Jimbo.
#To the best of my knowledge, Jimbo or the WMF has never dictated a policy to us that we must obey.
I'm hoping that this removal won't upset anybody. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:32, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

:I think the key aspect here is that Jimbo is not really active with WMF projects (although I've seen some recent posts by him on Foundation-l).  Part of this is (I think) to give Florance the chance to take the helm of the WMF as the current chair and not overshadow her.  Jimbo does maintain a seat on the board of trustees, but is concentrating most of his efforts on Wikia, in terms of making policy decisions and such.

:As far as the WMF or Jimbo &quot;dictating policy&quot;, I'll leave that subject alone.  I've spilled far too much ink on that subject.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:34, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

: Mm, not me.  I like the occasional improvement of this document, and wish to see more.  :-)  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 00:48, 3 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==
This is the very first lesson in learning a second language, the Spanish Language!

This lesson begins with simple greetings, and covers important ideas of the Spanish Language. Throughout education, methods of teaching Spanish have changed greatly. Years ago, the Spanish Language was taught simply by memory. Today, however, the Spanish Language is taught by moving more slowly and covering grammar and spelling rules.

Again, this is an introduction. If this is the first time you are attempting to learn Spanish, do not become discouraged if you cannot understand, pronounce, or memorize some of the things discussed here.

In addition, learning a second language requires a basic understanding of your own language.  You may find, as you study Spanish, that you learn a lot about English as well.  At their core, all languages share some simple components like verbs, nouns, adjectives, and plurals.  English, as your first language, comes naturally to you and you don't think about things like subject-verb agreement, verb conjugation, or usage of the various tenses; yet, you use these concepts on a daily basis.

While English is described as a very complicated language to learn, many of the distinguishing grammar structures have been simplified over the years.  This is not true for many other languages.  Following the grammatical conventions of Spanish will be very important, and can actually change the meaning of phrases.  You'll see what is meant by this as you learn your first verbs &lt;i&gt;ser&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;estar&lt;/i&gt;.

Do not become discouraged!  You can do it.

==Dialogue 1==
Two good friends - Carmen and Roberto - are meeting:

==Grammar: Personal Pronouns==
Spanish has six different types of pronouns.

{{Spanish Grammar|1=Los Pronombres|2=

{| border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|- style=&quot;background: #F0F0FF&quot;
| width=&quot;20%&quot; | '''Person'''
| width=&quot;30%&quot; | '''English equivalent'''
| width=&quot;40%&quot; | '''Spanish equivalent'''
|-
| '''1st person singular (1)''' || I || yo
|-
| '''2nd person singular (2)''' || ''singular'' you (informal)
| tú
|-
| '''3rd person singular (3)''' || he, she, you (formal)
| él, ella, usted
|-
| '''1st person plural (4)''' || we || nosotros, nosotras
|-
| '''2nd person plural (5)''' || ''plural'' you (informal)
| vosotros, vosotras
|-
| '''3rd person plural (6)''' || they, you (formal)
| ellos, ellas, ustedes
|}
}}
&lt;/br&gt;

'''A few things to keep in mind:'''
* It is normal in Spanish to omit the personal pronoun (i.e. you seldom say '''yo estoy bien''', but '''estoy bien''', and you ask '''¿Cómo se llama?''' instead of '''¿Cómo se llama usted?''') because the specific conjugation of a verb usually indicates which person is the subject. However, usted, él and ella all use the same verb form so if you choose to drop the pronoun in this case it must be clear in the situational context which pronoun is being referenced.
* In most of Spain the vosotros form can be used to address a group of familiar people (e.g. friends), and ustedes is used with more formality (e.g. recent acquaintances). In all Latin American countries and parts of Spain ustedes is used also for a familiar group of people; in these countries the &quot;vosotros&quot; form is almost never used.
* In Argentina, parts of Uruguay, and some other countries, the ''tú'' form is replaced with ''vos.''
* ''Usted'' and ''ustedes'' can be abbreviated as ''Ud.'' and ''Uds.'', respectively.

==Grammar: Verbs ser and estar==

Spanish has two different words that can be translated with &quot;''to be''&quot;.
'''Ser''' is used more for more permanent characteristics (&quot;''Soy Luis''&quot;) whereas '''estar''' is used for more temporary or changeable conditions, such as location (&quot;''La papelera está al lado del escritorio''&quot;, &quot;The trash can is beside the desk&quot;) and  feeling (&quot;''Estoy bien''&quot;). A good way to remember when to use &quot;estar&quot; is by using the rhyme, &quot;To tell how you feel or where you are, always use the verb estar.&quot; In future lessons we will come back to the uses of ser and estar. 

Here we will look at the conjugations in the ''present indicative''.

Note: *This use of '''estar''' is the Spanish ''present progressive'' which is
used for actions in progress. More about the ''present progressive'' in
[[Spanish/Lesson 4|Lesson 4]]

Dialect Note: Spanish which uses the ''vos'' form conjugates ser with the following irregular form: ''sos''.

==Hay==

Spanish uses a different verb ('''haber''') to express &quot;''there is ''&quot; and &quot;''there are''&quot;. The form of '''haber''' used for this purpose is '''hay,''' for both singular (&quot;''there is''&quot;) and plural (&quot;''there are''&quot;).

!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CFEBBE&quot;|Notes about ''Ñ'' and ''RR''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
''N'' and ''Ñ'' are considered two different letters, as are ''RR'' and ''R'' (though no words begin with ''RR'').  They are alphabetized as separate letters, so ''Ñ'' always comes after ''N'', regardless of where it appears in the word.  Ex: ''muñeca'' comes after ''municipal'', and ''carro'' comes after ''carta''.
|-
!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|Notes about ''CH'' and ''LL''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F3F5DE&quot;|
''CH'' and ''LL'' used to be considered as distinct letters of the alphabet, but in 1994, the Real Academia Española (Spanish Royal Academy) declared that ''CH'' and ''LL'' were not letters but [[w:Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. Accordingly, words beginning with ''CH'' and ''LL'' are now alphabetized under ''C'' and ''L'', respectively.
|-
!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;|Notes about ''K'' and ''W''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
''K'' and ''W'' are part of the alphabet but are mostly seen in foreign derived words and names, such as karate and whisky. For instances, kilo is commonly used in Latin America to refer to a kilogram.

Although the above will help you understand, proper pronunciation of Spanish consonants is a bit more complicated:

Most of the consonants are pronounced as they are in American English with these exceptions:
*'''b''' like the English ''b'' at the start of a word and after ''m'' or ''n''; otherwise is pronounced like a cross between a ''v'' and a ''b'' (in Spanish there's no distinction for '''b''' and '''v''')
*'''c''' before '''a''', '''o''', '''u''' and other consonants, like English ''k''
*'''c''' before '''i''' and '''e''' like English ''th'' in “think” (in Latin America is like English ''s'')
*'''ch''' like ''ch'' in “cheese”
*'''d''' between vowels (even if it starts a word following a word ending in a vowel) or at the end of a word, like English ''d'' in dental
*'''g''' before '''e''' or '''i''' like the Scottish pronunciation of ''ch'' in “loch”, except that it is voiced
*'''g''' before '''a''' or '''o''' like ''g'' in “get”
*'''h''' is always silent (except in the digraph ''ch'')
*'''j''' like the Scottish pronunciation of ''ch'' in “loch”, except that it is voiced
*'''ll''' traditionally pronounced like lli in “million”, it is now pronounced like English y in “yes”, except that it is more voiced
*'''ñ''' like ni in “onion” (or gn in French cognac)
*'''q''' like the English ''k''
*'''r''' slighty trilled; like a soft ''d'' except at the beginning of a word or after '''l''', '''n''' or '''s''' where it is trilled
*'''rr''' should be trilled longer than a single ''r''
*'''v''' like the English ''b'' at the start of a word and after ''m'' or ''n''; otherwise is pronounced like a cross between a ''v'' and a ''b'' (in Spanish there's no distinction for '''b''' and '''v''')
*'''z''' like the English ''th'' (in Latin America, like English ''s'')

==Vowel pronunciation==
The pronunciation of vowels is as follows:

*'''a''' [a] &quot;''La Mano''&quot; as in &quot;'''a'''rea&quot;          (ah)
*'''e''' [e] &quot;''Mente''&quot; as in &quot;m'''e'''low&quot;  (e)
*'''i''' [i] &quot;''Sin''&quot; as in &quot;'''i'''nto&quot;   (i)
*'''o''' [o] &quot;''Como''&quot; as in &quot;'''o'''pera&quot;. (short o)
*'''u''' [u] &quot;''Lunes''&quot; as in &quot;l'''u'''natic&quot;  (oo)
The &quot;u&quot; is always silent after '''q''' (as in &quot;qué&quot; pronounced kā). 

Spanish also uses the ¨ (diaeresis) diacritic mark over the vowel u to indicate that it is pronounced separately in places where it would normally be silent. For example, in words such as ''vergüenza'' (&quot;shame&quot;) or ''pingüino'' (&quot;penguin&quot;), the &quot;u&quot; (sounds the same as the &quot;u&quot; in &quot;ultra&quot;) is pronounced similarly but with more strength to the English &quot;w&quot; forming a diphthong with the following vowel: [we] and [wi] respectively. It is also used to preserve sound in stem changes and in commands.

==Semi-Vowels==

*'''y''' [ʝ] &quot;''Reyes''&quot; similar to the y of &quot;yet&quot;, but more voiced (in some parts of Latin America it is pronounced as s in &quot;vision&quot; [ʒ] or sh in &quot;flash&quot; [ʃ])

At the end of a word or when it means &quot;and&quot; (&quot;''y''&quot;) it is pronounced like '''i'''.

==Acute accents==
Spanish uses the ´ (Acute) diacritic mark over vowels to indicate a vocal stress on a word that would normally be stressed on another syllable; Stress is contrastive. For example, the word ''ánimo'' is normally stressed on ''a'', meaning &quot;mood, spirit.&quot; While ''animo'' is stressed on ''ni'' meaning &quot;I cheer.&quot; And ''animó'' is stressed on ''mó'' meaning &quot;he cheered.&quot; 

Additionally the acute mark is used to disambiguate certain words which would otherwise be homographs. It's used in various question word or relative pronoun pairs such as ''cómo'' (how?)&amp; ''como'' (as), ''dónde''(where?) &amp; ''donde'' (where), and some other words such as ''tú'' (you) &amp; ''tu'' (your), ''él'' (he/him) &amp; ''el'' (the).

|-bgcolor=&quot;#DEE7F5&quot; valign=top align=&quot;center&quot;

|}

==Emphasis==

The rules of stress in Spanish are:

1. When the word ends in a vowel or in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot; the emphasis falls on the second to last syllable.

Eg: Mañana, Como, Dedos, Hablan.

2. When the word ends in a consonant other than &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, the emphasis falls on the last syllable.

Eg: Ciudad, Comer, Reptil.

3. If the above two rules don't apply, there will be an accent to show the stress.

Eg: Fíjate, Inglés, Teléfono.

4. '''SPECIAL CASE''': Adverbs ending in ''-mente'', which are derived from adjectives, have two stresses. The first stress occurs in the ''adjective part'' of the adverb, on the syllable where the adjective would normally be stressed. The second stress occurs on the ''-men-'' syllable.

Eg: Solamente, Felizmente, Cortésmente.

== Which pages should we still link to? ==

I assume all the pages of the old help hierarchy that we no longer link to should be deleted in the future. (I've included &lt;tt&gt;Help:Introduction 2&lt;/tt&gt; in them in order to mark them.) Should we still link to [[Wikibooks:Welcome|Help:Introduction]]? Doesn't [[Wikibooks:Welcome]] and [[Wikibooks:Welcome|Wikibooks:About]] cover the same information and more? I would like to keep a link to [[Help:Contributing|Help:Contributing to Wikibooks]] for a while because this was my primary source of information about editing (or at least of links to the corresponding pages). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:49, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

Should we include a link to [[Wikibooks:Templates]]? I think it is about the only useful directory of templates. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 15:54, 23 December 2008 (UTC)

==PDF Books==
I have spent the last 4-6 months working on the Commons Category:Pdf files and have created several subcategories. Many of the saves and deletions are books, University theses, manuals etc in Pdf format. It was suggested on a discussion page at one time that Pdf books and Theses go in wikibooks. If so how do I go about linking or moving these book files to here? [[User:WayneRay|WayneRay]] ([[User talk:WayneRay|talk]]) 15:50, 30 December 2008 (UTC)WayneRay

:You might want to discuss this question at [[WB:RR]]. I think University theses don't belong in Wikibooks because (at least in the Universities I know) they usually include original research, which should not be published at Wikibooks ([[WB:NOR]]). Moreover, you would have to convert the PDF files to the wiki markup language, as the hosting of existing books (in the PDF format) is discouraged ([[WB:SOURCE]] and [[WB:HOST]]). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 16:41, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

:Last I heard in a recent reform of Commons' inclusion policy, PDF files are still allowed on Commons. I don't see any reason why they would need to be moved anywhere. They can be accessed from any project where they might be appropriate. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:14, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

== Help cleanup ==

Some clean up effort has been going on for some time now, on and off again, to make Wikibooks' help more useful. I propose that Wikibooks' help space be treated like a book. By formatting pages like is done within our books, people unfamiliar with Wikibooks' style can quickly become familiar with how things are done differently on Wikibooks. Using this approach the help space can teach and help people understand how to do things on Wikibooks by following its own example. To this end, I think some requirements are a must: each page must include a 2 level heading with the page/chapter title; additional headings must use 3 level heading or greater; text must not come before the first level 2 heading; and the help space must have a consistent style, which means discussion needs to happen to develop a style guide for the help namespace.

I also think the help space could be made more useful by including more media, diagrams, illustrations, etc. However media should be used to compliment rather than substitute for missing information, in order to make Wikibooks' help accessible to more people, such as the blind.

Any thoughts, ideas, opinions, or any other suggestions? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:41, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

: I don't have any objections as such to treating the Help name-space as a book, but would caution against forcing it into that mold. First of all, I don't foresee anyone really reading this cover to cover. It should, therefore, be treated more as a handbook with a strong emphasis on structure to help readers quickly locate useful information.
: Linear navigation aids will not necessarily be of much use for such a book. As for other Wikibooks conventions, I would think it more useful to point to various featured books for examples as there often exist multiple approaches to similar issues.
: Whiteknight wants to take the book-approach a step further and deprecate the Help name-space all together. I'm not sure which approach is the best. I've so far just been trying to wrap my head around the sprawling set of pages that we have here. For the time begin, I think it would be best to implement changes in increments, first organising the available contents and then molding it into whatever we deem best. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:49, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
:: Your saying what I really meant anyways. I was trying to suggest a strong emphases on structure, as well as a strong emphases on consistent style. I wasn't suggesting that there necessarily be a specific reading order or navigation aids. I guess I'm a bit ahead of you in that regard, I've already wrapped my head around the help pages, years ago. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:01, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
::: Great! It sounds like we have a similar enough a vision. Let's get to work! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:48, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

:So, how will the redesigned help space be different from [[Using Wikibooks]]? One of the major differences between the current help pages and [[Using Wikibooks]] is probably that help pages are full of links (and should be in my opinion) while the pages in [[Using Wikibooks]] have less links (since they should be self-contained as in a good textbook). Do you intend to keep this difference? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:40, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

::Well I guess to me the most obvious differences will be in presentation and audience. I think Using Wikibooks is intended to be read in a certain order and is intended to be read by an audience already familiar with most wiki concepts, while the help space is likely to depend less on a specific reading order and should be intended to be read by people not familiar with most wiki concepts. I would like to make the help space more self-contained and limit links to important things explained in greater detail that don't quite fit the beginner audience, by linking only to Using Wikibooks and to the [[mw:|MediaWiki website]] if I can. I think links should be used more sparingly than they currently are. Does that answer your questions?

::: It does, thanks. I wasn't aware that Using Wikibooks is intended for an audience who is already familiar with most wiki concepts. Since I'm rather new I often read help pages and in fact I'm often missing links. In particular, I often know that I have read some information but don't find the page to read it again. The most recent case was [[Help:Category]] which didn't link to the Wikibooks-specific information at [[Wikibooks:Categories]] (I added that link); thus, I was searching quite a bit for that page. Thus, at least currently I think links to the Wikibooks namespace should also be included. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 14:22, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

:::: I could be wrong about the intended audience or what assumptions Using Wikibooks makes. Even if there is some overlap, I don't think that is going to be a problem. I think linking to related Wikibooks policies like with your example is fine. Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting that links be blindly deleted. I just think the help space relies too much on external links in an attempt to make up for what is missing or what is lacking, rather than expanding the available help. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:00, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

== Deleting non-Wikibooks-specific pages ==

I've mentioned this to Darklama, but I figured I'd add this here in case others would like to comment.

We have a number of help pages that explain how to use markup. The problem is that they are unmaintained versions of content that rather belongs at Meta and the MediaWiki wiki. I've gone through these and have found nothing of use to describe Wikibooks related syntax. I propose that the following be deleted:

*{{bad link|Help:EasyTimeline syntax}} (See [[mw:Extension:EasyTimeline/syntax]])
*{{bad link|Help:HTML in wikitext}} (See [[meta:Help:HTML in wikitext]])
*{{bad link|Help:List}} (See [[meta:Help:List]])
*{{bad link|Help:Variable}}, {{bad link|Help:Magic words}} (See: [[mw:Help:Magic words]])
*{{bad link|Help:Navigational image}} (See [[meta:Help:Navigational image]])
*{{bad link|Help:Special characters}}, {{bad link|Help:Special characters/Part 2}}, [[Help:Turkish characters}} (See: [[meta:Help:Special characters]]).
*{{bad link|Help:TeX markup}}, {{bad link|Help:Formula}} (See [[meta:Help:Displaying a formula]]
*{{bad link|Help:URL}} redirect to [[Help:Editing]]?

The parenthesised links indicate where I believe we should point users who might be looking for this sort of content. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:11, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

Oh, and this one too:
* [[Help:ISBN links]] (See [[mw:Manual:ISBN]])
--[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:29, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

: I don't think these pages are needed because the majority of the markup is described already in [[Help:Editing]] or should be described there. I think [[Help:Templates]] should also discuss variables and magic words. I don't think there will really be a need to point users to content on the other projects.

: Also I think a lot of the help on Meta is in the process of being moved to MediaWiki, because its not specific to Wikimedia projects. I think there also has been some talk of using Wikibooks to aid in improving the mediawiki documentation. In either case the lack of stability is one more reason not to rely on Meta or MediaWiki much. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:58, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:: As far as I know, the transfer from Meta to MediaWiki to the help namespace was abandoned after the MediaWiki Help namespace was put in the public domain (the manual and extension namespace are still transwikied). The MediaWiki Help namespace has since been built from scratch. It is steadily improving and I recommend that we help direct our non-Wikibooks specific documentation efforts there. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:22, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

::: I think it may still be happening. I have tried to improve some help on Meta for instance only to go back to it to find that the page had moved to MediaWiki. I have also occasionally went to a help page to double check something only to find that that its been marked to be moved to MediaWiki or a notice that updates should now be done at MediaWiki. I think Wikibooks needs to maintain some local documentation, because linking to Meta and MediaWiki doesn't seem to be enough for most users. I just think that these pages are unneeded because local documentation is either already present on another page or should be. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:08, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Yes_check.svg|15px| ]] '''Done''' Whew! I've updated a bunch of links, but left most of those on pages in the help namespace as we'll have to go through those anyway. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:17, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

== Page headings ==
: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;''The following discussion was moved here from [[Help talk:Tracking changes#Page title]] after it moved on to a more general discussion about the sectioning of content in the help namespace. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:06, 11 February 2009 (UTC)''&lt;/span&gt;
I've just [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Revision_review&amp;diff=1395613&amp;oldid=1395393 reverted] part of an earlier edit. I removed a section header titled &quot;Stable revisions&quot; that spanned the entire page, and bumped the sub-section headers. If a section really spans the entire page, then the page should probably be renamed to its title.

I wasn't sure what the most proper page name would be so I checked [[mw:Help:FlaggedRevs]] which states that stable revisions are only revisions of a certain limit. On Wikibooks that limit is currently at the lowest (sighting). It might be more useful to keep a more general title for this page in line with the help page currently being developed over at MediaWiki.org. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:57, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

: Don't think of it as a section heading, but as a page heading. Books do that all the time, its considered part of Wikibooks' style. This goes back to my suggestion on [[Help talk:Contents]] to make the help pages follow some basic book style guidelines. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:47, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Oh. But we already have page headings: the page titles. I'd agree that designating the help pages with a certain look could be useful. Instead of a &quot;page heading&quot; we could adda navigation bar with a nice, helpful looking icon. The {{tl|useful}} template helps with creating a standard look, but, ironically, isn't very useful itself. I'd be rather opposed to adding these page headings. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:09, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

::: I disagree. A page's title isn't a heading. The page title doesn't even show up in the TOC that is generated. Why would you be rather opposed to using page headings? I've been trying to add them to every help page I've edited for awhile now. I don't think a page's title is very useful on paper. I'd like the help pages to eventually be printed as a way of attracting more contributors to Wikibooks. Also I thought we had already agreed on [[Help talk:Contents]] that navigational templates shouldn't be used? I guess you could say I'd be rather opposed to not using page headings. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:57, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: The page title is a h1-heading. That isn't just technical hair-splitting as that's how it's rendered both on screen and in print. I remember reading in some W3C document on HTML recommending that pages have only a single h1 level heading each, but be sectioned up with h2 and higher. A single section for the entire page just seems redundant.
:::: I consider it a feature that this doesn't show up in the generated TOC. The &quot;Stable Revisions&quot; heading in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Revision_review&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=1395613 this version] serves little purpose on that page and forces every other section to be pushed down one level. I, furthermore, prefer having the h2 level headings to section pages up into logical parts as they render by default with that line underneith and the higher level headings as rather small and similar.
:::: If you'd like this type of page-wide sections to make it easier to stich them together in a print version, how about adding h1 level headings on the print version page (which I'd consider the the most logical approach) or create a collection?
:::: I think I misunderstood you a bit in the [[Help talk:Contents#Help cleanup|Help cleanup]] discussion. I think we shouldn't necessarily conform to a ''linear'' navigation, but consider a template with an overview of useful pages, well ... useful. It might be useful to move these two topics to [[Help talk:Contents]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:34, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

::::: First off I was using a h2 heading, not a h1 heading, so there was only a single h1 level heading on the page. I think h1 headings should correlate to the sections of the help (like Introduction, Browsing Wikibooks, etc) and h2 headings should be used to divide the help into &quot;chapters&quot;. I think this is what books do, although the separation tends to depend on whether a book merely has chapters or needs to be divided further than that. From there h3 level headings and higher are used to further divide content. This still is in line with W3C's recommendation, so I don't see the problem.
::::: As I'm sure you know, modules are often chapters or parts of a chapter. I think if a module is a chapter it should only have one h2 heading, or if a module is part of a chapter it should only have one h3 heading. I think doing this does serve a purpose beyond ''pushing page sections down''. I think how the help is divided should be reflected in the use of different heading levels, and should reflect more than just how a module is divided, so that readers and writers understand how a book is divided. Plus I don't think there should be any text above a page's generated TOC. I think having text above a page's generated TOC interferes with or interrupts the flow of reading the page.
::::: Some printed books don't require that they be read from front to back in a liner order. I think this could be considered that type of book, so that's why I don't see a problem with not using navigational aids. Feel free to move this discussion there. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 08:51, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:::::: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;I've just moved the discussion here: [[Help talk:Contents]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:06, 11 February 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

:::::: I know you used a h2 heading. I thought that was clear from the first paragraph of my previous comment: &quot;''[Pages should be] sectioned up with h2 and higher. A single section for the entire page just seems redundant.''&quot; I do realise that you had a useful purpose in mind with your edits. I never said that &quot;''pushing page sections down''&quot; was the purpose, but noted it as the effect.
:::::: I think we may have been mis-reading each others comments a bit lately on issues where we don't see eye to eye. Do you see how I think you've misinterpreted my previous comment? Do you find that I'm misunderstanding you as well? I'd appreciate it if we could sort that out as I feel like we're talking in two different dialects and not progressing much because of it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:30, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

(reset)

I still don't understand what you're trying to say or why you disagree with my approach. Whatever you were trying to explain wasn't clear to me from the context. I guess I don't understand your reference to h1 and W3C's recommendations. To me what you said suggested that you think I wasn't following W3C's recommendation because I was using h1 headings, which wasn't apparently what you meant.

I only see that I must have misunderstood your previous comment, but not how I misunderstood it because you haven't provided any further explanation. I can't tell yet if you've misunderstood me as well. What have I said that you think you've misunderstood? If I understand you right, you seem to think the purpose of section headings is to separate a module into sections. I on the other hand think section heads are for separating a book into sections and subsections. I guess you see each help page as standing on it own, and I see the each help page as being part of a book where each chapter can be read independently. Other than trying to explain in our own words what we each think the other person is saying and trying to clarify what is misunderstood, I'm not sure what else we can do to reduce any misunderstandings, without knowing what is misunderstood. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:24, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

: Sorry for the late reply. What I disagree with is your use of a single section to encompass the entire page. I was concerned that you ''might'' think my approach didn't tie the sections of the page together tightly enough. Rather than ''just'' saying that I disagreed with the use of only a single h2 heading per page, I therefore lead into it with the reference to the W3C's recommendation. My aim was to clarify that I didn't think the sections should just dangle unconnected, and that the h1 section (the title) should &amp;mdash; and already does &amp;mdash; do this.
: I don't, actually, think that I'm misunderstanding you a lot, but figured I'd still ask.
: I think we have fairly similar ideas of what to do with these pages, but differ mostly on formatting (well, and that I want to &quot;outsource&quot; simple syntax stuff to [[mw:]]; but that's a different topic). I don't think the help pages shouldn't form a whole, but feel (like you) that it's important that they be able to stand on their own. I'm less interested in printing these out, than in having them accessible and organised for users. Would you be willing to accept the compromise to place h1 headings between page inclusions on print versions? I don't think we should be formatting individual pages in for how they should come out on print and should focus on how they display to online users of Wikibookians. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:58, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

Agree on deletion of them all.  I had never seen them before you pointed them out, so how would they be useful to anyone who might need to see them if regulars don't even come across them?  Plus, they are either lacking in meaningful content or the results of over-importing from other projects without regard to redundancy with other help pages. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:26, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Yes check.svg|15px]] '''Done''' Those interested can browse [[User:Swift/Help pages]] to see a (once full) list of help pages. I'm trying to merge, refactor or rewrite these to make our support pages more accessible. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:16, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

== Good point people for WikiBooks to help new editors from Wikipedia? ==
Hi everyone. I'm looking to gather 1-3 contacts for WikiBooks who would be interested in serving as point people for new editors from Wikipedia. I don't expect that it'll be too time consuming, but, just in case we have a new editor stop by the [[w:en:Wikipedia:Teahouse|Teahouse]] who expresses interest in participating in media contributions and you can be friendly and welcome them and perhaps direct them to an area that might interest them. You're welcome to respond here, or even better, on my talk page if you're interested in being added to [[:w:en:Wikipedia:Teahouse/Host_lounge/Project_contacts#Sister_projects|this list]]. Thanks :D [[User:SarahStierch|SarahStierch]] ([[User talk:SarahStierch|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SarahStierch|contribs]]) 15:53, 1 March 2012 (UTC)
:I've copied your post to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]] due to a likely lack of attention to this page; I linked to this discussion so that responses can be seen here by yourself, though posting to your talk page will be preferable, of course. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:47, 2 March 2012 (UTC)

== Díalogo 1: El Salón de Clase ==
''La profesora entra en el salón.''

''Profesora'': Buenos días alumnos.  Hoy estudiamos los objetos en el salón de clase. ¿Cuántos libros hay?

''Carlos'': Hay catorce estudiantes.  Hay catorce libros.

''Profesora'': Bien Carlos.  Marianela, ¿Hay un mapa en el salón?

''Marianela'': Sí, señora.  Hay un mapa a la izquierda de la pizarra.  Está en la pared.

''Profesora'': Bien Marianela.  ¿De qué color es el mapa?

''Carlos'': El mapa es verde y azul.  Es el mapa de México.

''Marianela'': ¿Profesora, porqué está el mapa en la pared y no está en la pizarra?

''Profesora'': La pizarra es para escribir con la tiza.  Tengo un borrador aquí.  ¿Quieres escribir la capital de México en la pizarra?

''Marianela'': No sé la capital de México.

''Carlos'': Marianela, mira el mapa.

''Marianela'': Ay, gracias Carlos.  La capital es  Ciudad de México.

''Profesora'': Bien.

== Vocabulario: El Salón de Clase ==
All vocabulary will be given with the appropriate definite article; however, the article will not be translated. In addition, note that all nouns have a gender.  This will be important in later lessons when you begin to learn adjectives.

== Grammar: The Definite Article ==

Like in English, Spanish has definite articles that serve to identify the location of the noun in the sentence.  These are commonly called &quot;noun markers&quot;.  These articles have a gender that is equivalent to the gender of the noun they modify.  However, sometimes pronunciation requires the article to be different than the gender of the word.  In these situations, the gender of the noun will always be indicated.  Otherwise, you can use the article to determine the gender of the noun.

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDDAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 50%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''The Definite Article'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''La Gramática''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&quot;The&quot;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;el&lt;br&gt;

|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;the (masculine singular)&lt;br&gt;
the (feminine singular)&lt;br&gt;
the (masculine plural)&lt;br&gt;
the (feminine plural)&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Examples:&lt;/b&gt; The following examples come from the vocabulary of the first dialogue.  Note that no matter whether the word is singular or plural, the meaning of the definite article does not change.
&lt;br&gt;
{|align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:yellow&quot;
|-
|la pizarra
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt; chalkboard&lt;/i&gt;
|-

|-

|-
|las mesas
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt; desks&lt;/i&gt;
|}

== The Indefinite Article ==

In English the indefinite articles are ''a'' and ''an'' (singular) or ''some'' (plural).
In Spanish there are different forms for masculine-gender, feminine-gender, singular or plural.

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 50%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''The Indefinite Article'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''La Grammática''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&quot;A&quot; or &quot;Some&quot;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;un&lt;br&gt;
una&lt;br&gt;
unos&lt;br&gt;
unas&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;a (masculine singular)&lt;br&gt;
a (feminine singular)&lt;br&gt;
some (masculine plural)&lt;br&gt;
some (feminine plural)&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Examples:'''
&lt;br&gt;
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:gold&quot;
|-
|un niño
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; boy&lt;/i&gt;
|-
|una niña
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; girl&lt;/i&gt;
|-
|unos niños
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;some&lt;/b&gt; boys&lt;/i&gt;
|-
|unas niñas
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;some&lt;/b&gt; girls&lt;/i&gt;
|}
&lt;br&gt;
For phonetic reasons some words beginning with accented '''a''' may have the article '''un''': un ave blanca ''(a white bird),'' las aves blancas ''(the white birds)''. This is basically the same idea as '''el ave blanca''' ''(the white bird)''.

Remember, do not confuse uno ''(one)'' with un ''(a or an)''.&lt;br&gt;
Also, do not confuse una ''(a or an)'' with uña ''(fingernail)''.

'''Exercise''': [[Spanish/Exercises/Articles]]

== The Colors ==

The colors in Spanish are adjectives.  As adjectives, their endings will vary according to the nouns they modify, but these are styled in the masculine singular form.  Most adjectives will be presented to you in this form.

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 50%;&quot; valign=top

|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;
white&lt;br&gt;blue&lt;br&gt;black&lt;br&gt;red&lt;br&gt;orange&lt;br&gt;yellow&lt;br&gt;green&lt;br&gt;purple&lt;br&gt;pink&lt;br&gt;gray&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Examples:'''
&lt;br&gt;
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:gold&quot;
|-
|un papel blanco
|
''a white paper''
|-
|un mapa rojo 
|''a red map''
|-
|un lápiz amarillo
|''a yellow pencil''

The numbers 16 through 29 can be formed in two ways: (1) using the preposition &quot;y&quot; like
veinte y uno - 21, or (2) as one complete word, changing the spelling of the word like dieciocho (18) or veintiséis (26).

Most general discussion takes place on-wiki in the reading rooms. See '''[[Wikibooks:Reading room]]''' for an overview of these.

If your question or comment is about a particular page, then use the ''[[Help:Talk page|Discussion]]'' link that is displayed when you are viewing that page (it is by default in one of the tabs near the top-left of the page). 

If you are the ''owner of content'' that is being used on Wikibooks without your permission, please read our [[Wikibooks:Copyrights#Copyright infringements|copyrights policy]] for information about how to have the issue resolved.

== IRC ==
Real-time conversation takes place on several [[Internet Technologies/IRC|IRC]] channels at [[w:Freenode|Freenode]]. This is often the fastest way to contact other contributors.  Keep in mind that IRC conversations aren't archived. Consider discussing things that need consensus on-wiki so that others can read up on and understand the rationale for decisions made.

Connect to &lt;tt&gt;irc.freenode.net&lt;/tt&gt; with your IRC client and &lt;tt&gt;/join&lt;/tt&gt; one or more of the channels listed below. If you don't already have one, consider [http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup registering a freenode nickname]. Opera users can simply click on the link which will then open the integrated IRC client. Firefox users can try [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/rt-messaging/chatzilla/ ChatZilla]. Wikipedia has a large [[w:comparison of IRC clients|comparison of IRC clients]].  If you're behind a proxy or want to connect within any browser, you can use freenode's [http://webchat.freenode.net/ web chat] page.

Learn more by reading the [[Internet Technologies/IRC|IRC]] chapter in our very own [[Internet Technologies]] book.

* '''[[freenode:wikibooks|#wikibooks]]''' is the main channel.

== Mailing Lists ==
The Wikimedia Foundation maintains several mailing lists that can be used to discuss the Wikibooks projects and other issues.

Reporters and others who wish to get in touch with the project are encouraged to send an email to our mailing list. Many people subscribe to the mailing lists who do not check messages on Wikibooks regularly. You must be subscribed to the mailing list if you wish to send emails to it.

Wikibooks has two mailing lists for general users and administrators. Mailing lists are available in a number of formats: via a web archive, by email, or by [[w:NNTP|NNTP]] using the mail-to-news gateway [[w:GMANE|GMANE]]. Mailing list posts are indexed by search engines such as [[w:Google|Google]].

Offsite archives of Wikibooks's mailing lists can be found at [http://www.gmane.org/ GMANE] and [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com MARC].

* [[mail:textbook-l|textbook-l]] ([[mailarchive:textbook-l|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org/gmane.org.wikimedia.textbook via NNTP]) - for discussing Wikibooks in general
* [[mail:foundation-l|foundation-l]] ([[mailarchive:foundation-l|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org.wikimedia.foundation via NNTP]) - for high-traffic discussions concerning the Wikimedia Foundation and all the projects.


;Technical mailing lists

* [[mail:wikitech-l|wikitech-l]] ([[mailarchive:wikitech-l|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.technical via NNTP]) - for software development and Wikimedia maintenance
* [[mail:mediawiki-announce|mediawiki-announce]] ([[mailarchive:mediawiki-announce|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org.wikimedia.mediawiki.announce via NNTP]) - for low-traffic announcements of new MediaWiki releases and security updates. (read-only)
* [[mail:mediawiki-l|mediawiki-l]] ([[mailarchive:mediawiki-l|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org.wikimedia.mediawiki via NNTP]) - for announcement and help for people using the software to run other wikis


The Wikimedia Foundation operates a number of other mailing lists as well: http://mail.wikipedia.org

== Email ==
You can send questions, notifications of copyright problems, and other issues to info{{@}}wikibooks.org.

== Bug Reports and Feature Requests ==
You should first [[MediaZilla:query.cgi|search existing entries]] to get started. You can then [[MediaZilla:|report bugs and suggest features]] related to the [[mw:|MediaWiki software]]. MediaWiki uses a customized version of [[w:Phabricator|Phabricator]] to track bug reports ([[w:Wikipedia:Bug reports and feature requests|learn more]]). Bugs and feature requests not directly related to the MediaWiki software should be discussed in the [[WB:TECH|technical reading room]].

Note that unlike before, you do not have to create a new account to file a bug report at Phabricator; just use your Wikibooks (or your unified Wikimedia) account at Phabricator.

Just a note, I am very excited to get an open content Spanish textbook started because it is a big need worldwide to teach people new languages, and you have just started the first of many language textbooks. I am almost as excited about the book you started as the [[organic chemistry]] one that I started to kick off the new site. Welcome aboard de todos modos y estoy muy contento de tenerlo aca. (Perdon, me considero bilingue pero ya tengo un rato de no estar hablando cada dia y se me esta echando a perder el espanol ... ) --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 03:12 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Hey Thomas, what do you think of this page: [[Spanish contents]] ? Its a compact alternative I created of the main [[Spanish]] page .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----

Hey Thomas, you are the one uploading [[Mariela Riva]]'s stuff for her, right ? I ask because some people were talking about this sound file format, the ogg. Have you heard of it ? Do you have the capability to produce that kind of file ? It is all the same to me but they did have some good arguments on why to use that particular format .... -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 03:00 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)

----

I applied the contents page to the [[Spanish]] page. If this was unexpected or unwelcome to you I will defer to your preference. A revert is quick and easy. By the way, check out how you were a trendsetter and led the way with the language textbooks, now there is a [[Japanese]] one that started up! Oh yeah, what do you think of the pictures ? With time we can match pictures to textbook topics, I jsut uploaded a couple I had of Mexican friends .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----

I created an [[Spanish/Contributors|authors]] page for the book and included my name on it per your suggestion. [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I really appreciate all the work you are doing man, I think it is great. I am now officially more excited about the [[Spanish]] book than I am about my own [[Organic Chemistry]] one. -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----

Thomas, I have created a few Spanish grammar comments. You can see it in [[User:Wintermute/drafts|here]]. I'm not very sure where it should go in the textbook, but these are very basical stuff. Tell me if you want that I paste that in any place or fell free of pick up that yourself. My English is not the best at world, so, maybe (well.. sure) there are errors in the sentences. Regards.

I was just thinking about how to get some good photos of hispanic people to liven up the pages .. huh so you studied a bit of French too ? I always wanted to visit Africa and thought French would be a good tool. So you speak English, some French and Spanish, and German ? It sounds like you've got the memory of two men. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Just an idea. I see you have created &quot;Web resources&quot; in the Spanish course, how
about creating &quot;software resources&quot; ? I guess, there are downloadable (free) dictionaries and conjugators.&lt;br&gt;Kpjas

----

Thomas, I have written [[User:Wintermute/drafts|two pronouns exercices]] for lesson 1 but I don't see clear where it should be paste. Is there one exercice page for every concept? for every lesson?.
Tell me where it should be or fell free yourself for paste it.

Thanks for keeping tabs on the German.  I've not used it in about 20 years. I thought that ''mit mein Brudder''  needed a different case, but had not tracked it down in the grammer book. Hope it comes back to mind soon! Also, I left off the definite articles on that first intro page because they (articles) are not introduced until lesson 1. Although not exactly grammatically correct, the point there was just to show word comparisons, and not &quot;translate&quot; words. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 07:33, 24 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:I agree with your reasoning on the inclusion of articles in the introduction page.  As long as you do not think they will confuse the first-time reader - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 01:29, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Man, you were right there with the alphabet tape! Great addition. Did you already have it in the wings waiting for the text to appear? Is it dialect or my ear, but the 'B' and 'E' sound a bit English to me - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 08:58, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)
----

Thomas. How did you make those tables in the Spanish Book that are laid out nicely, and appear as if enclosed in &amp;LT;pre&amp;GT;&amp;LT;/pre&amp;GT; tags, but are not (no tags of anykind evident in edit mode)? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 01:22, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Learning Project==
Hej Thomas,
I saw you contributed to the Spanish and German wikibooks, so I thought you might be interested in this. I have written a [http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444e1w/vokeng.htm program for learning vocabulary]. I think for this purpose a program is more useful than a website, although maybe one day we can make this a java project.
It is based on the belief that it is best to learn foreign words by learning typical sentences. The program can also be used for learning other stuff that works with the question/answer scheme, e.g. the theory for the driving licence or anatomy. Unfortunately I wrote it in qbasic, which can be downloaded [http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/tool_s/1.0/W95/EN-US/olddos.exe here]. It also uses images and sound files for alternation and in order to work on the pronunciation. Let me know what you think about it. I currently have files in English, French (with sound), Spanish, and [[Portugiesisch:_numerais|Portuguese]]. Catalan is in the planning. Corrections or additions are very welcome. The easiest thing to start with for improvements would be adding new vocabulary, sound files or images. A guide to the program will follow soon, although I think it is rather self-explanatory. In the long run the program should be rewritten in a better language. Afterwards it should be possible to switch languages within the program. Up to now there is a different version of the program for each language. [[User:Get-back-world-respect|Get-back-world-respect]] 23:15, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Wikibookians have different backgrounds and hold widely different views. When interacting with respect, users can cooperate effectively to develop free educational textbooks.  In the vast majority of cases, people seem to get along, but occasionally people bump up against one another.

Like any community, Wikibookians have developed among themselves a certain etiquette 
to facilitate productive cooperation.

== The community ==

Wikibooks is divided into a large number of books.  Many of these have no active editors and most never see more than a single active contributor at any given time.  There are, however, instances where multiple users find themselves working on the same book.  In most cases the team-work that grows out of the interaction leads to better content as they bounce ideas off each other.

Given the open nature of the wiki, anyone is free (and encouraged) to start editing any page in any book they think is worth contributing to. In some cases a contributor will start editing pages that one or more editors had until then been alone with. As new ideas can rock the status quo, disagreements can arise.

While the community isn't the goal of the project, a well functioning one helps. Don't limit interactions to the negative: If you see people doing good work, let them know. Do your best to avoid conflicts and resolve those that arise. Don't hold grudges, bury the hatchet and give people a chance to redeem themselves.

Tread softly around your fellow Wikibookians. Contributors have often put a considerably amount of work into the content they have uploaded and can become offended when it is subjected to criticism. [[Help:Pages#Deleting]] has some advice on how to properly approach contributors to pages that are out of scope.

== Conflict avoidance and resolution ==

;[[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|Assume good faith]]
: This is an extremely useful principle. Rather than assume that other users are out to get you or &quot;your&quot; content, understand that the content [[Wikibooks:Ownership|isn't yours]] and they are editing the book out of a desire to help. Listen to what they have to say, communicate your thoughts and start a dialogue to figure out the best way forward.
;Ask questions
: Rather than just trying to convince your counterpart(s), ask them questions of their views and invite them to convince you. You cannot argue against a viewpoint you don't fully understand. Furthermore, there might well be something useful in their position.
;Leave your pride at the door
: No matter how long you've been at Wikibooks or editing a specific book, you're going to make mistakes. Acknowledge any mistakes and make apologies when you are wrong or being unfair. Don't get offended.
;[[Wikibooks:Staying cool when the editing gets hot|Stay calm]] or take a break
: Most edits are easily reversible. If you're not making progress, just take a break for a while to calm yourself and let the dust settle.

Initial text adapted from [[en:Wikipedia:Wikiquette]]. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 10:00 2 Aug 2003 (UTC)


...And as such, it is out of date (and not even recommended here as a guideline). I recommend resurrecting this guideline, as I think it is core to working in a cooperative environment like a wiki.

[[w:Wikipedia:Etiquette]] is a guideline on Wikipedia, whereas [[w:Wikipedia:Civility]] is a policy - I don't exactly know why. My guess is that, in a Wikimedia context, etiquette is about particular instances of niceness or rudeness, whereas civility is about a whole attitude which is based on etiquette, no personal attacks, and so on. Perhaps the distinction is a pragmatic one; we can ''enforce'' a policy of civility (ie ban someone if they are generally repeatedly uncivil), but we can ''suggest'' a guideline of etiquette. I'm suggesting we do the same here on Wikibooks - enforce a civil environment, but in general, simply suggest getting everyone to cooperate. It's the softest way, but it is strong if needs be (ie if someone is really kicking up a fuss).

This page here is missing a few things, I think. It is generally concerned with refraining from being offensive, and being nice if possible. But fundamentally, as it says right at the top, etiquette is about treating people with respect. There isn't really any explicit mention of this (or certain aspects of this) in the breakdown of what etiquette is. Specifically, I'm referring to things like listening to other people, trying to see where they are coming from, answering questions politely (even answering questions in the first place and not deleting them), and acknowledging and apologising when you're wrong or being unfair. I think these are absolutely basic to working with other people, and I think we need to be clear about this with all participants, especially newcomers.

Sure, i'll &quot;just fix&quot; this policy. But I'd also like to raise its profile in the project in general. What do other people think? [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 09:57, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

: I suggest that we abandon this page (unless someone volunteers to completely replace it) and instead add a brief paragraph to [[WB:WIW]], indicating that Wikibooks is not for bad behaviour against users. One wiki does this with &quot;WikiFur is not intended to hurt anyone&quot;, [[Wikicities:c:Furry:WikiFur:What_WikiFur_is_not|WikiFur:What_WikiFur_is_not]].

: I dislike having all these extra pages copied from Wikipedia (where I am not familiar with most of the policies). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:21, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

::I strongly disagree with abandoning this page - I have already volunteered to do work on it and I've already started. I can't see how this would be usefully integrated into [[WB:WIW]], without destroying all its meaning - you need to spell it out for some people, and even on the example you give, that part of their policy is a red link, meaning they intend on expanding it there. But we have a perfectly good ''start'', at least, of a policy here. Also, it ''was'' originally copied from Wikipedia (back in 2003), but that doesn't make it irrelevant to Wikibooks. Of course, it doesn't automatically make it relevant either, but I think it is very relevant, fundamental even - for the very simple reason that this is a collaborative site and in order to get along here, we need to be nice to each other. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 21:47, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

::For what it's worth, that policy was intended to apply to the people that WikiFur talked about, as well as its users. [[User:68.40.114.223|68.40.114.223]] 17:27, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

: The reason that I wanted to abandon the page, was because I thought it was a bad way to establish a policy against aggravating users. I now believe that it can work as a non-policy page, if we do not abandon it. Actually, I did some work on [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]] earlier, even though that page is also marked as a proposed policy. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:34, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

== Policy or guideline? ==
I really don't see this as policy material.  Proposed policies are or should be intended to become enforced eventually.  I can just see the future arbitrations: &quot;He wasn't say something nice when he could have&quot;, &quot;No I couldn't, there just wasn't anything nice to say.&quot;  Yikes!  It's not that &quot;Say nice things when you can&quot; is a bad idea or that it shouldn't be included or that it should be changed.  Rather, it's that much of good etiquette just can't be made sufficiently precise and objective to enshrine into a policy.  I suggest making this a guideline. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] ([[User talk:JMRyan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|contribs]]) 00:15, 22 March 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: I agree. I think though, we need to make civility a policy (across all projects), and then to specify what that is in &quot;sub&quot; policies or guidelines, like no personal attacks and etiquette. I've also opened this discussion on the foundation-l mailing list. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 14:16, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

== Use of the Idiom, &quot;bury the hatchet&quot; ==

Is it appropriate to use the phrase, &quot;bury the hatchet&quot; as it's an idiom that may not be used or understood in every region/culture of English speakers?

Wikibookians are expected to follow this policy when performing deletion-related activities (including undeletion requests).

Only [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] can delete and restore pages. Deletion removes access and undeletion restores access to a page's content and revision history. Keeping track of deletions can be hard if done too casually. Deletion decisions are not to be taken lightly.

Deletion are not be confused with page blanking which adds an entry in the page's history and anyone can undo.  Page blanking might be vandalism, an attempt to deal with vandalism, or an attempt to delete a page for whatever reasons.  The first two can be fixed by restoring a revision free of vandalism.  The last may qualify for speedy deletion depending on the situation; if you want a second opinion, you may make a [[#Requests for deletion|request for deletion]].

== General guidelines ==
* In general, '''keep stubs''' that can be improved on, but delete stubs that are too narrowly defined or do not have a decent definition of what they are about.
* In general, '''keep''' modules that need heavy editing, but delete pages with no ''meaningful content''.
* In general, '''delete''' modules that will simply never become educational resource modules. This includes idiosyncratic non-topics such as &quot;Teaching 100 monkeys to type the works of Shakespeare&quot;.

== Meaningful content ==
{{Shortcut|WB:NMC}}
Content is not ''meaningful'' if it does not add value to readers or otherwise contribute to the project. What is considered &quot;meaningful content&quot; depends on the namespace. Under this criterion, you'll have to be careful when nominating or deleting pages. In doubt, put it under a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion|deletion discussion]].

Absence of meaningful content includes, but is not limited to:
* Spam and [[WB:DWV|vandalism]].
* Test edits and nonsense.
* Abandoned pages displaying intent, but no actual content.

You can leave {{tl|query}} on the page to check whether the user is intending to develop the page further.

== Speedy deletions ==
{{shortcut|WB:SPEEDY}}

Speedy deletion is a deletion request where reasonable opposition is not expected or possible. Anyone can request speedy deletion and anyone who objects or believes more discussion is needed can turn a speedy deletion candidate into a [[#Requests for deletion|request for deletion]]. Speedy deletion requests made in bad faith can be removed by anyone.

Add {{tlx|delete|reasons for speedy deleted}} to the top of a page to request speedy deletion. That page will then appear in [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]] for administrators to address whenever time is available.

Pages that satisfy any of the following criteria can be considered for speedy deletion:

# Pages nominated for speedy deletion by the only significant contributor.
# Pages in the nominator's user namespace (their user page, talk page, or any sub-page thereof).
# Pages with no [[#Meaningful content|meaningful content]]. Always check and revert if good content in the revision history was replaced.
# Pages in a book where current book contributors support deletion. Always link to the discussion page where consensus was reached.
# Pages that cannot comply with the [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|scope]] or [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|policies]] of the project. Should there be '''any''' doubt, [[#Requests for deletion|get community consensus]].
# Orphaned redirects that do not conform with [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] or where the names are unlikely to be inadvertently searched for by anyone.
# A repost of work previously deleted as a result of a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion|requested for deletion]] that has not successfully gone through [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion#Undeletion|requests for undeletion]].

== Requests for deletion ==
If you disagree with the reason given in a speedy deletion nomination, or if you believe a work that does not satisfy any of the speedy deletion criteria should still be deleted, you can discuss deleting the work with your fellow community members at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]]. Please sign/date your reasoning and be prepared to defend it.

Next you should add {{tlx|rfd}} to the top of the work, which will add the page to [[:Category:Requests for deletion]].  At this time, the discussion process begins. 

Every registered Wikibooks user can participate in the discussion process to decide what to do with the work in question. Please explain your reasoning, sign/date your comments, and be ready defend your position. For convenience please include a [[Template:Icon|discussion icon]] to help other participants quickly review what the overall position of the participants is. If your reasoning changes, please ''strikeout'' (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;s&gt;old text&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) any part of your stance that you wish to change, before (optionally) declaring a different position.

One week after the last comment if participants have mostly reached consensus about what to do, action will be taken by an administrator. Otherwise discussion may continue until consensus is reached. Deciding whether consensus has been reached and what consensus is should occur according to [[Wikibooks:Decision making|the decision-making guideline]] for [[Wikibooks:Decision making#High impact decisions|high impact decisions]].  Per this guideline, any position declaration is an aid to discussion and not a vote; the decision isn't based on quantity but on quality.

Discussion may be terminated early and any outcome ignored if the discussion is believed to be the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress|result of vandalism]] or part of an edit war between two contributors who may not like each other. If later serious objections are raised, discussion may resume.

You should be especially sensitive to discussions about brand-new works, particularly by new contributors to Wikibooks. Unless there are obvious problems that are unlikely to be rectified, your time would be better spent mentoring new contributors and trying to help clean up new works, even if the work is currently a blatant violation of current procedures. Remember you were once a new contributor too.

If the decision is that the page should be deleted, an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]] will do so, and it will show up on the page [[Special:Log/delete]]. Either way, the section should be archived for historical reference.

== Copyright violations ==
{{shortcut|WB:COPYVIO}}

Violations of copyright (usually determined by running a [[Help:Glossary#Google test|Google test]]), should have {{tlx|copyvio|&amp;lt;source URL or description of source&gt;}} added to the top of the offending page, which adds the page to [[:Category:Copyright violations]].

The user who submitted the work has one week from this date to prove that they had permission to post the work, otherwise it will be deleted.

== Transwiki ==
First of all, if the page looks okay, but it's just on the wrong wiki (e.g. wrong language, wrong type of content), add {{tlx|transwiki|&lt;suggested wiki&gt;}} to the top of the page, which add the page to [[:Category:Pages for transwiki]].

== Guidelines for admins ==
Here are some guidelines that those tasked with removing pages from the database can generally be expected to follow in making the decision to delete or not:

# As a general rule, ''don't'' delete pages you nominate for deletion if there are a number of comments in favor of keeping. Let someone else do it.
# Simply deleting a page does ''not'' automatically delete its talk page or any subpages. Please delete these pages too.
# If another solution has been found for some of these pages than deletion, leave them listed on [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] for a short while, so the original poster can see why it wasn't deleted, and what did happen to it. This will prevent reposting of the same item. Alternately, leave a message on their user page explaining the verdict of the deletion process.
# Use common sense and respect the judgment and feelings of other Wikibooks participants.
# When in doubt, don't delete.
# Don't hesitate to turn a speedy delete into a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion|RfD discussion]].  It is better to get community input on deleting a page than indiscriminate deleting on the part of admins.
# Where the content is such that it might usefully be moved elsewhere (for example, another wiki or that the authors might want a copy for their own records) give some time for them to do this before deleted (or alternatively email them a copy of the text).
# '''Copyright''': See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] for deletion policy on copyright infringement (and [[m:Wikipedia and copyright issues]] and [[m:Avoid Copyright Paranoia]] for perspective).
#Administrators necessarily must use their best judgment, attempting to be as impartial as is possible for a fallible human, to determine when rough consensus has been reached. For example, administrators can disregard comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such &quot;bad faith&quot; comments include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article.

Ideally, when an admin deletes a test page or other page with no useful content, it is a good idea to put a note on the author's talk page explaining things, pointing them to the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] in cases of tests. Be friendly! Everyone was new once. In the case of anon IP users this is not as important as they have likely moved on or their IPs changed since that edit.

== Frequently asked questions ==
;This book is totally biased! What gives?
: See [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]]. You don't need the RfD page for that.
;Where'd my page go?!
: Check the [[Special:Log/delete|deletion log]] and head over to [[Wikibooks:Requests for undeletion]] if you believe that a page may have been deleted without proper grounds.

Hello thanks for educating me about how it supposed to work, but my content (page) was speedily deleted and I had no chance to save the content so I can merged it in the existing book in accordance to the rules.  Would you let me recover the content in the deleted page below?  For a history of the （very short) discussion see [[User_talk:C.t.chin#copy_.2F_paste]].  Emailing the content to me would be great, thank you so much!

{{closed|1=Based on the fact that PDF version of the books was uploaded to Commons in 2009 with a compatible license, I believe the correct thing to do is attribute our books to that copy. It will be done by attaching a template to all pages of the books. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 15:12, 19 June 2015 (UTC)}}

We have received an OTRS ticket, number 2015011310024438, from the CK-12 Foundation requesting that these books (which are copied from CK-12) are properly attributed to them. The relevant text of the OTRS ticket, for those without access is:
::&quot;...I am a science associate with the ck-12 foundation. I'm writing on behalf of ck-12 in regards to the versions of our flexbooks you have published on the wikibooks site. To begin I should say that we are extremely pleased to be featured on your site and greatly appreciate you taking the time to import our texts. We would like to ask that you attribute our content using the guidelines present on the ck-12 website. We also ask that you add this attribution to the individual concept pages; I stumbled upon a few of them and was concerned until i went back to the book and chapter pages and saw the attribution.&quot; 

I can confirm the email comes from CK-12 based on the mail headers, etc. In responding to this request I have reviewed the CK-12 attribution guidelines [http://www.ck12.org/about/attribution-guidelines/ here] and noted that their license is CC-BY-NC. This license is incompatible with Wikibooks. Specifically, it does not allow commercial use, and Wikibooks does. Given this, I believe we have no choice but to delete the books. 

I, or any admin, could delete these after 7 days as a copyright violation without an RFD, but given that some of them are featured books, I am raising this RFD to encourage others to check my interpretation of the license issue is correct. Note that I have named the nine books that are obviously CK-12 copies, but this deletion requirement may apply to other books from the same source - I will add them hear if I identify more. Thanks.

:The importers of the content should also be notified and even admonished for such an extensive violation. Admins should do random content cross-pollination checks as they delete the pages by selecting some random bits of text and see if they find a match in other wikibook works.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:04, 17 January 2015 (UTC)

:Note that this is more a violation of the terms of use than of copyright (in the consequence that it is an unauthorized relicensing of the works).
:One thing that I've been thinking about is the WHY we can't have non-commercial content on Wikibooks. It seems counterproductive in the primary goal of creating free content and not an issue to any of the parts involved in the work we do here. It seems simply a political decision and we may need to revisit it as it needn't be so, any primary objections would be about cross pollination but as this instance proves in a connected world that argument is very weak.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:43, 17 January 2015 (UTC)

:::This is quite interesting. A PDF of the CK-12 material was uploaded to Commons ([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/High_School_Biology_1-13.pdf here]) in 2009.

:There are two choices: delete them, or retain them. If the latter, then every page has to have a URL linking back to the original source for attribution purposes as this has been demanded by the copyright owner. While interpretation of the &quot;by attribution&quot; part of the license is possible, I think the copyright holder is making a reasonable request as just providing attribution on , say, the main page of the book, is not really providing a clear link to the source. It is because of the need to edit the 100s of pages to do this that nobody has done it yet.

== All pages contained in [[:category:pywikibot]] and it's sub-cats. ==

I propose this hole pywikibot manual for deleting. The origin pywikibot manual is hold by [[mw:]], you'll find it as [[mw:Manual:Pywikibot]] with all it's content. The pages at Wikibooks are just older copies, they are outdated and nobody will update it here. The local copy may confuse developers and the duplication is not useful at all. [[User:Xqt|Xqt]] ([[User talk:Xqt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Xqt|contribs]]) 16:10, 18 May 2015 (UTC)

:Why don't you propose that the media wiki book be only hosted by Wikibooks (it seems the better project to have it), not that I particularly care, only addressing your duplication concern. I really don't see lack of advancement in itself as a proper reason for deletion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 16:36, 18 May 2015 (UTC)
::The manual is nearby the Mediawiki software (and its manual) where it concerns to. Maybe it was the first thought coming from [[m:Pywikibot|meta]]. It does not make any sense to spread manuals on several platforms, especially when nobody keeps it up-to-date. This would be confusing bot owners. It is a property of that instruction manual of an often used bot framework in perpetual beta state to be outdated within a short time. Therefor I guess it would be a good idea to delete this page duplications, which you can verify by the version histories.

:::I fail to see the rationality in discussing notions like &quot;nearby&quot; when we are talking about the same Internet software infrastructure and same hardware setup (Wikimedia) especially after the merging efforts being made.

::: I'm not taking a position of opposition against your request  at present, just pointing out that the grounds your are formulating it are very weak and in my view misdirected...  
:::In regards to Wikibooks the nearness to the software isn't an issues, nor is it the duplication, in fact the issues you raised (confusion, etc) are good points to press the developers to, especially in light of general Wikimedia policies that fragmented the scope of each wiki subproject, move the manual here (in fact every manual that resides in the Media Wiki project), even facilitating future translations of the same.

::::{{ping|Panic2k4|Xqt}} It seems to me that since these manuals are for Mediawiki software, and are self-referential to Wikimedia, they should be kept at Mediawiki, especially since the software is used for non-Wikimedia sites. If we imported the manuals, it would follow that we should import all the descriptions of extensions and parser functions and so forth. That's what the Mediawiki website is for; to host it all here would muddle our mission and would be self-referential. But that is all a whole debate in itself. If we're going to have one, we should have them all, and so it makes no sense just having this one manual here, which is only an outdated version of the one at Mediawiki anyway.

:::  A notice can easily be added at top of every page pointing to an updated resource (not a generic portal) or a portal can be prominently displayed on the cover page indicating that the book is out of date.
::: I dont agree with the arguments for the deletion, will not support but also not object to it as the content seems to be freely available elsewhere in an updated form. My view is that Mediawiki manuals should be on Wikibooks, the same rational that made us move our images to Commons all the other non-Wikibooks issues are just that, not a Wikibook problem that we need to address.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:12, 15 November 2015 (UTC)
:::: [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]], then I must ask you to look at the content again.  It is not a manual.  Most of the pages are auto-generated junk.  e.g. [[Pywikibot/family.py]] - what do the plus and minus mean in those lists?  Some pages like [[Pywikibot/Basic use]] could be used in a manual, but however is full of incorrect information about pywikipedia (a dead project) instead of pywikibot, and anyone wanting to seriously write a manual about pywikibot for a real audience would start by using the equivalent pages on MediaWiki, such as [[mw:Manual:Pywikibot/Basic use]].

== [[Cookbook:Char Siu]] ==

Not sure if this page qualifies for speedy deletion, so I am requesting it to be deleted here. I've noticed that [[Cookbook:Char Siu]] is an exact copy-and-paste of [[Cookbook:Char Sui]] (note the switched &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot;) and, according to [[User:Kgroat|Kgroat]]'s [[Special:Diff/2987730|edit summary]] on Cookbook:Char Siu, was intended to be a move to the correct name for the page. I am requesting it to be deleted to make way for a proper page move from Cookbook:Char Sui to Cookbook:Char Siu. (There is only one revision in Cookbook:Char Siu's [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Char_Siu&amp;action=history page history], not including my addition of the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{rfd}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template.)

Request to delete [[Modern Greek/LegacyLesson_5b]]. There is nothing here that doesn't separately exist in [[Modern Greek/Lesson 02.2]] which is the correct structure.

NOTE: There are on-going rfd's and merge requests for this. There appears to have been no active work on the Modern Greek Wikibook for many years and my attempts at getting previous contributors involved appears to have failed. I have made many changes / improvements and have had no comments, so I expect no discussion regarding these on going changes. Hopefully as the content grows some more contributors will be attracted.

{{Branch unstable}}

[[Wikibooks]] [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] have the ability to &quot;protect&quot; pages such that editing of those pages is restricted. This ability is only to be used in limited circumstances, as described in this policy.

==Appropriate use==
This ability is used semi-permanently in some cases:
* Protecting the highly visible pages like [[Main Page]] from [[WB:DWV|vandalism]].
* Maintaining the integrity of the [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright]] and [[WB:GFDL|license]] pages.
* Protecting certain ''&quot;system administration&quot;'' pages.
* Maintaining the integrity of past press releases. (not needed yet)

This ability is also intended to be used temporarily in some cases:
* Enforcing a &quot;cool down&quot; period to stop an edit war, upon request (see below).
* Protecting a page that has been a recent target of ''persistent'' vandalism or ''persistent'' edits by a banned user.
* Preventing changes to a page while investigating a possible bug.

Admins should not protect pages when they have been involved in the edit war in question (either by actively editing the page or by holding strong opinions about the content). Administrative tools are not editor privileges - administrators act as servants to the user community at large. If you are an admin and you want a page in an edit war in which you are somehow involved to be protected, you should contact another admin and ask them to protect the page for you.

In general, pages should not be left protected for very long, and discussion pages should be left open. Indefinite page protection should almost ''never'' be used.

==Types and levels of page protection==
;Levels of protection
#Full protection{{anchor|full}}
#:Only administrators may make changes
#Semi protection{{anchor|semi}}
#:Users must wait until autoconfirmed to make changes

;Types of protection
#Create protection{{anchor|create}}
#:Restricts page ''creation''
#Edit protection{{anchor|edit}}
#:Restricts page ''editing''
#Move protection{{anchor|move}}
#:Restricts page ''moving''
#Cascading protection{{anchor|cascade}}
#:Can only be used with full edit and move protection. This protects the page, and all pages transcluded into it, and all images used on it (if they are local).

Administrators can also edit [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]], which can [[mw:Extension:Title blacklist|block]] uploads, edits, page move, and page creation matching [[w:regex|regex]] entries.

== Editing protected pages ==

Administrators should be cautious in editing semi-permanently protected pages, and do so in accordance with consensus and any specific guidelines on the subject. In many cases it is appropriate for an administrator to first raise the issue on the relevant talk page, as any other user would have to do.

In cases of temporary page protection, administrators should refrain from editing pages while they are protected. They ''should not'' continue editing content while people with different points of view who are not admins are unable to do so. There are, however, a few times when it maybe appropriate to edit such a page:
* Adding a link to [[Wikibooks:Accuracy dispute]] or [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]], or a similar disclaimer about the current state of a page.
* Reverting to an old version of the page from a week or so before the controversy started (see [[m:The Wrong Version|The Wrong Version]])

== List of temporarily protected pages ==
*[[Special:ProtectedPages]] provides a dynamic list of protected pages.
*For create-protected pages, see [[Special:ProtectedTitles]].

Like most programming languages, C is able to use and process named variables and their contents. Since C is a low-level programming language, it is necessary for a C program to claim the memory needed to store variables before using the memory. This is done by '''defining''' variables, the way in which a C program shows the number of variables it needs and what they are going to be named.

Within the C programming language, when we manage and work with variables, it is important for us to know the ''type'' of our variables and the ''size'' of these types. This is because C is a sufficiently low-level programming language that these aspects of its working can be hardware specific.

'''All''' variables in C are typed.

== Your First Program ==
Your first program, like in every other language, is going to display the text, &quot;Hello World!&quot;  There is a problem, though: C does not have any input or output statements.  The solution: we must call a function to do the work.  This is called ''printf'' and is implemented in the standard C library.

In C, functions are defined in ''headers'', which have an extension of ''*.h''.  (You will learn that the same is true in C++.)  These header files are imported into your code with the preprocessing directive ''#include''.  This statement essentially cuts and pastes the functions into your code.  (Yes, this is legal.  Don't worry about copyrights in this case.)

Here is how to use an #include directive to get the ''printf'' function, which is in the ''&lt;stdio.h&gt;'' header:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Good!  You have the ''printf'' function, as well as many others that do input, output and the like.  Now, it is time to code!

C programs start with a function called ''main''.  In programming terms, this is called the ''entry point'' of the program.  Since the C program is fairly simple, this will be the only function we will write.

To start the function, type the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int main(void) {
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The int specifies that the function will return an integer.  This will be the program's exit code.  Main is the name of the entry point function, and the parentheses surround the ''parameters'' of the program.  You do not want parameters in this program, but future programs will possibly use this to get command line arguments.

The open bracket means that the function's code is starting here.

Inside the function, type the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
  return 0;
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first line is a function call.  ''printf'' is the name of the function, and like in ''main'', the parentheses surround the arguments.  &quot;Hello, World!&quot; is a ''string'', which is a bunch of text surrounded by quotes.

All statements, whether they are declarations, function calls or another type, end in semicolons.  This is like a period in an English sentence.  ''return 0;'' ends the function and gives a return value.  The value of 0 means that everything went okay.  Finally, the } ends the function.

Your code should look like this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main(void) {
  printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
  return 0;
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Compile this, and enjoy!!

== Simple C types ==

In C, there are a small key set of types. The rest are modifiers, arrays and other such low-level data structures. The keywords for these types are '''&lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;''', '''&lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;''' and '''&lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;'''.

When we wish to store an integer, we use an integer type. The C name for this type is called &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. Ints usually require 4 bytes per variable. 

When we wish to store a single character or byte, we use a character type. The C name for this type is called &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;. Chars always use one byte each.

When we wish to store a floating-point (non-integer) value, we use either a single precision or a double precision floating point type. For single precision, C terms this type &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;. For double, &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;. Variables of type &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; usually use 4 bytes of memory and those of type &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;, 8.

There is no fundamental predefined string type in C. Strings in C are more complicated (they are ''arrays'' of chars), requiring manual handling, and we will deal with them later.

== Other type keywords ==

'''&lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a type specifier for numeric variables (those of type &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; or type &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;) which (possibly) allocates more memory for the variable, allowing it to contain and process larger numeric values than usual. Some C implementations allow this modifier to be used twice ('&lt;tt&gt;long long&lt;/tt&gt;') to define even larger variables. However, this is not in standard C, unless you use the 1999 standard (which currently (2003) has very meager support by implementations.)

'''&lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a type specifier that may only be applied to derivatives of &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. This might allocate less memory than a normal ''int''.

'''&lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a type specifier which explicitly allows a variable to have either positive or negative values at the expense of a smaller possible range of values. By default all variables in a C program are defined as 'signed' variables (except for &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;, which is either signed or unsigned by default.)

'''&lt;tt&gt;unsigned&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a type modifier which allows a variable to only have nonnegative values (zero or greater). However, it allows a range of values twice as large as that of the equivalent &lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt; variable.

When &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;unsigned&lt;/tt&gt; are used without specifying a base type, the type is &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. In some cases you can get away with using absolutely no keywords, but this is considered bad style, and is invalid in the 1999 standard (&quot;C99&quot;).

'''&lt;tt&gt;register&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a hint to the compiler to attempt to optimise the storage of the given variable by storing it in a register of the computer's CPU when the program is run. Most modern optimising compilers do this anyway, so use of this keyword is often unnecessary.

'''&lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a special type modifier which informs the compiler that the value of the variable may be changed by external entities other than the program itself. This is necessary for certain programs compiled with optimisations - if a variable were not defined &lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt; then the compiler may assume that certain operations involing the variable were safe to optimise away when in fact they aren't.

'''&lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt;''' specifies that the variable may not be modified.

Arrays could be considered an extension of an existing variable's type: arrays cannot exist as a type on their own but act just to extend an existing variable. An array applied to a variable implies not a single variable but a series of variables of a single type indexed by integers starting from zero. The characters used to indicate an array are '[&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;]' where '&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;' is the number of variables in the series. For example, a single integer variable would be defined by &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, but an array (series) of seven integer variables could be defined by &lt;tt&gt;int[7]&lt;/tt&gt;. Assuming this variable had the name &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;, the individual integer variables could be accessed as &lt;tt&gt;a[0]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;a[1]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;a[2]&lt;/tt&gt; and so on until &lt;tt&gt;a[6]&lt;/tt&gt;. The integer used to index the series of variables is also known as a ''subscript''.

== Declaring variables ==

All type declarations using the above simple types follow a standard format
:&lt;tt&gt;type_name variable_name&lt;/tt&gt;
where &lt;tt&gt;type_name&lt;/tt&gt; represents one of the C type names, and variable name a generic name for the variable. 

For example, if we want to declare a variable called &lt;tt&gt;number&lt;/tt&gt; and of type &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, we write
:&lt;tt&gt;int number;&lt;/tt&gt;.

In C, all declarations are terminated by semicolons. If we wish to declare a number of variables of the same type, we can write
:&lt;tt&gt;int variable1, variable2, variable3;&lt;/tt&gt;
which delcares all &lt;tt&gt;variable1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;variable2&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;variable3&lt;/tt&gt; to be of type integer.

== Control structures ==
C is an imperative language, that is it requires a sequence of steps to be followed in order to solve a problem. 

We will need certain C constructs in order to achieve a certain result; we will need to make ''decisions'' and to perform steps over and over again in a certain way, ''iteration''.

=== Decisions ===
Decisions are important to programming. When we want to consider different actions for different values, we need to make a decision. For example, say if we are writing a program to calculate the square root of a number. C does not contain capabilities to calculate the square root of negative numbers. So we wish to make a decision to return an error message if we get a negative number, and to calculate the square root otherwise. 

C provides two ''main'' capabilities of making decisions:
* &lt;tt&gt;if..else&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt;

==== if and else ====
The &lt;tt&gt;if..else&lt;/tt&gt; construct allows us to make a ''binary'' decision, that is, a decision that can go two ways (binary) -- one way or the other.

We write this construct:
 if (''condition'')
 {
  ''statements''
 }
 else
 {
  ''statements''
 }


If there is only one statement, the braces may be removed.

==== switch ====
The &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; construct allows us to make a decision based upon an expression and multiple possible values for it.

The construct is written:
 switch (''expression'')
 {
   case expression_1:
     ''statements''
     break;

   /* more case statements if desired */

   default:
     ''statements''
     break;

 }

When the &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, the value of the expression given as an argument is calculated. The calculated value is then compared with each of the subsequent expressions given as arguments to the 'case' statements in order. If the value of the &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; expression matches that of a &lt;tt&gt; case&lt;/tt&gt; expression, the statements subsequent from the corresponding &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; statement are executed until the &lt;tt&gt;break&lt;/tt&gt; statement.

If the value of the &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; expression is not equal to any of those of the &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; statements, the statements between the &lt;tt&gt;default&lt;/tt&gt; statement and its corresponding &lt;tt&gt;break&lt;/tt&gt; statement are executed.

=== Iteration ===

&lt;!-- Unlike some strict functional programming languages which require all looping to be done by recursion, --&gt; 
C has a number of control structures to perform iteration:

* &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loops
* &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loops
* &lt;tt&gt;do..while&lt;/tt&gt; loops

== Numerical Axioms ==

It is possible to define a regular set of numbers in a formal fashion. The set of ''Peano axioms'' define the series of numbers known as the natural numbers. They are as follows:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: thin solid purple;&quot;&gt;
# There is a whole number 0.
# Every natural number ''a'' has a successor, denoted by ''a'' + 1.
# There is no natural number whose successor is 0.
# Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if ''a'' &lt;&gt; ''b'', then ''a'' + 1 &lt;&gt; ''b'' + 1.
# If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number it is possessed by, then it is possessed by all natural numbers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let us attempt to motivate these axioms. We want these axioms to eliminate any set which is not the natural numbers. E.g., any set fulfilling the above should at least be infinite.

The first two are obvious properties of the natural numbers (and of integers) as we know them. Note that some prefer to use 1 as the lowest number. The reason for choosing zero has root in [set theory], in which the first natural number is chosen as the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. 

The 3rd axiom prevents circularity. If this axiom was not included, defining &lt;math&gt;0 + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; would trivially fulfill the remaining axioms --- prove this for yourself by considering each remaining axiom!

The 4th prevents a partial loop. Consider a the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;0+1=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1+1=1&lt;/math&gt;. This set fulfills every axiom but the 4th --- prove this for yourself.

The 5th is sometimes called the induction axiom. It ensures that the set is ''connected'', i.e. that we can reach any number by using the 2nd axiom repeatedly on 0. An example of a set that fulfills every axiom but the 5th is &lt;math&gt;\left\{0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, \dots\right\}&lt;/math&gt; with the usual meaning of +1. 


From this we can deduce the existence of a series of quantities like this:

*0
*0 + 1
*0 + 1 + 1
*0 + 1 + 1 + 1
*0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
*0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
*and so on

where '0' is a constant and the first natural number and '1' is a constant natural number equivalent to the difference in value between two consecutive natural numbers.

This set is sufficient for counting. However, it is inconvenient to refer to a large natural number as '0' followed by the requisite large number of '+ 1' expressions. Due to this, each of the natural numbers is given a label, and to make the labelling easier another axiom is introduced:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: thin solid purple;&quot;&gt;
'0 + 1' is equivalent to '1'.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus the series of natural numbers may be written so for some brevity:

*0
*1
*1 + 1
*1 + 1 + 1
*1 + 1 + 1 + 1
*1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
*and so on

Once this is done, giving each quantity its own label is trivial. And so the series of natural numbers can then be written:

*0
*1
*2
*3
*4
*5
*and so on</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mathematics can help you solve many problems by training you to think well.  This book will help you think well about '''discrete''' problems: problems like chess, in which the moves you make are exact, problems where tools like [[calculus]] fail because there's no continuity, problems that appear all the time in games, puzzles, and computer science.

We hope you'll enjoy discovering discrete mathematics here, and we hope you'll find this a good reference for quickly picking up the details you'll forget with time.

Hello and Welcome! You might be interested in checking out [[Help:Textbook planning|Textbook planning]] or the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]]. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 06:32 3 Aug 2003 (UTC)

: Thanks mav :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:42, 19 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Dysprosia: Don't want to sound rude, but your change on the [[Algebra I]] page isn't correct. A surd is not specifically a radical. More accurately, it's an irrational number-any irrational number. &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {3}&lt;/math&gt; is a surd and a radical, &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is a surd but not a radical...Surd is an outdated term anyway. Every Algebra I book I've ever seen calls them 'irrational numbers'.

Why are you changing all the page names in the German text and others? I was not aware that we had settled on a style and I prefer spaces (i.e. German: Lesson 1) as it reads better at the top of the page - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 09:20, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

: It's convention by default, really - sorry if changing them upset you. If you look at how it's done in all other name spaces, such as User talk:, Wikibooks:, User:, there are no spaces between the colon and article name. 
: Maybe I'm being pernickety and should just let others do their thing. Revert/move back if you prefer (with my apologies). [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:25, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)
::I'll have to think about it. Not upset, but I had just finished changing over the few old way pages.  There was some discussion on standarding these things (Staff Lounge), but that has not gone too far. Don't you think it looks better at the top of each book page to have '''German: Lesson 1''' rather than '''German:Lesson 1''' (convention or not)? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:00, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Dysprosia - Good working with you on the C book.  I'm using my experiences teaching at the university to guide my thinking, so I'll probably tend to be pretty retentive based on the common problems I see from my students.  But my main goal is to get a usable text book, and that transcends all other desires.  Good input - glad to be able to open source this!

Thanks for the welcome; I thought it would be a fun change.  :)  I think I have a lot to learn about what style is used here though, so I'm trying not to change too much at first. - [[User:Hephaestos|Hephaestos]] 01:28, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)
: Well, if you like, stick with Wikipedia style, but for math I use my own idiosyncratic variant lol - it's logical to me - but if others want to change it to conform to WP style I won't really argue with them :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:41, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)

== Style ==
I like your teaching style (e.g., [[Discrete mathematics:Finite fields]]). It contains some casual questions and some transitions and comparisons. Very professional. Keep up the good work! --[[User:Menchi|Menchi]] 01:43, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Dysprosia -
Flushing buffers may not always work; but it does work for many applications and it resolves many troubles with beginning programmers.  The fflush() function is quite simple and allows new C coders the chance to work on other issues in their course instead of trying to figure out why scanf() doesn't seem to work right.  I know this because I've seen these students wrestle with it.  fflush() does the job.

I'm willing to concede that further discussion is appropriate; however, deleting mention of this topic entirely is wrong -- students need to know where to begin their search for help.  If you insist on deleting this reference, I suggest that you either offer an alternative method or we seek additional ideas, because students need to know how to handle code that seems to bypass their scanf() calls.

[[User:Maffu|Maffu]] 01:43, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)

: Some implementations/compilers of C will let you fflush(stdin) and have the behaviour as expected but it's not really legal C (check K&amp;R - fflush(stdin) is undefined) as you can only reliably fflush output streams. Have a look on the web too, many discourage fflush(stdin). fflush(stdin)'s behaviour is not portable, either. We should be emphasizing portability and legality - that's what makes good C programs.
: The other way to have behaviour that will act like fflush(stdin) is to chuck characters away until a newline is reached, but this won't work for all situations. There's no real reliable way, otherwise.
: I apologize if I was a little bull-headed in removing the reference, and I'll try and add a compromise in the text. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:43, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::I agree with most of what you say.  I personally would sacrifice portability for functionality at this level.  And K&amp;R is primarily a grammar reference for me; functional applications can't possibly be dictated in a language spec - there would be no way to cover all angles.  I haven't reviewed K&amp;R for this, but will shortly.  Unless the language explicitly forbids this type of application, I don't consider it &quot;illegal&quot; - although a caveat on portability would certainly be appropriate.
:: I'm content with the wording you've inserted and appreciate the compromise.  I'm sure there is a &quot;proper&quot; method for clearing the buffer.  I'll try to find that method so that we can offer what the student needs.
::[[User:Maffu|Maffu]] 04:51, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::: Ok, cool. By the way, K&amp;R doesn't explicitly forbid fflush(stdin), but undefined code is really ''never'' a good thing. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:51, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==NPOV?==

Hi there! Nice edit on [[Computer Programming]]... but one minor question.  Is the NPOV all that important on Wikibooks?  Sure, for history and govt, cultural stuff I'd understand, but we're talking technical stuff not ideological stuff right?  If our main goal is to teach, aren't we inevitably forced to have some POV and to do just a teensy weensy little bit of steering?  This is not a protest, but a minor ponder on the issue.  Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 17:01, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

----
-- You say we haven't discussed scope yet. We have, see Basic Concepts. [[User:Thunderbunny|Thunderbunny]] 01:20, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)
: Sorry, missed that. But there is a lot more that could be said about scope, but Ill be away for a while... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]]

-- Okay. Sorry we had to have that editing war, but with regards to const vs. #define, const doesn't require any more memory accesses/register loading than #define. The compiler should find-and-replace each occurrence of the const with its value, just like #define does. And const obeys all the scope laws that #define doesn't. The K&amp;R seems to back me up on this.

Also, it's definitely worth leaving all the stuff about unsigned, long, float and short in. Speaking as somebody with a lot of experience with embedded systems, there are lots of cases where having a floating-point variable that is one word in size would be useful. Also, unsigneds and longs are convenient when you need to express values that can't be represented with no qualifiers. [[User:Thunderbunny|Thunderbunny]] 02:56, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)

: That's okay :) I didn't know that about const, and if you have K&amp;R by your side, I believe you :) 
: It would be nice if you mentioned that kinda stuff about unsigned and longs and such, to motivate/enforce their importance.
: Thanks for your help in the C book! :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:00, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I have a question for you; I've noted that you are also involved in Wikipedia. After a quick search I noticed no entry for grape seed oil. While my grape seed oil document is currently a stub, should it be contributed? [[User:Dbroadwell|Dbroadwell]] 03:04, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)

: If you wish, you should, but you may need to rewrite or reword it appropriately first to match the article style. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:32, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:: Thought so. There is little hope of me writing it into a book, so that gives the freedom for annother to do so. It will take a bit more research. Thanks. [[User:Dbroadwell|Dbroadwell]] 05:05, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)</text>

Hey Geoffrey - what stuff have you written under other licenses that we could use on the textbook site ? -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

To the user Geoffrey, Greetings.

One has found the wisdom in the advice you have tendered. The link to &quot;Glossary&quot; has been amended to &quot;Civics Glossary&quot;.  -- [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 29 September 2003.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Geoffrey. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Geoffrey~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Re superposition: How do 2 material waves actually pass through each other? Considering water waves, the energy transmits because water molecules receive kinetic and potential energy, and then pass it to other molecules.  Right?  But at an interference point there is no net movement of the material, no change of either kinetic or potential energy.  So if the molecules' momentums are unchanged, how can they pass the tendency to change on? Or, is interference just an average effect, some molecules having momentum in one direction while a balanced number have momentum in the opposite direction?

Its just an average affect --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 23:22, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)</text>

==Error==
I believe that I found an error. In the second dialogue of the first lesson, there is an accent missing over the first o in cómo. I have changed...

Señora Pérez: 	Me llamo Ana Pérez. ¿Y usted? ¿Como se llama?

to

Señora Pérez: 	Me llamo Ana Pérez. ¿Y usted? ¿Cómo se llama?

If I have erred, just let me know and I'll change it back, or someone else can. -- [[User:Phreq|Phreq]] 02:57, 3 August 2005 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
----

The first dialogue is losing control.  We have an audio file listed that does not match the dialogue.  We have acquired three new audio files that only cover three specific lines in the dialogue (and seem to be of poor quality - it could be my software, but the volume on the three files is really low and the sound quality seems low).

I suggest that the three mini files be removed (because downloading three separate files is inconvenient) and that the errant dialogue be replaced by one that matches the existing dialogue.  -- [[User:FyreWolfe|FyreWolfe]] 03:54, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Hello, I uploaded these 3 audio files in Commons. They are the first ones I recorded so it is quite possible that their quality could be improved. Honestly I tell you that it was my mistake to record them because I didn't realize that there was another audio file with the whole dialogue recorded. About their volume, i thought that their quality were good enough to be uploaded but i didn't realised that my loudspeakers are very powerful. Therefore, i wouldn´t mind and i'll understand if it's decided to erase the audio files I created, I'll try to do it better next time :), but then we have to ask for it in Commons. --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 08:27, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Hey this looks great, I'm a Spanish speaker and especially excited to see this textbook started .. -- [[Karl Wick]]

The sound files that are now on the web pages are spoken by Mariela, a friend
of mine who founded a SpanishForForeigners group at yahoo. She is currently
having some trouble with her internet connection and asked me to upload the
files for her. -- [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas Strohmann]]

:I was reading the lesson and I think some of the phrases sound somewhat funny: &quot;¿Cómo se llama usted?&quot; (lit. How are you called?) and &quot;¿Hay algo nuevo para contar?&quot; (Is there anything new to say?). I think no native spanish speaker speaks like that. In the question: &quot;¿Cómo se llama usted?&quot; the word &quot;usted&quot; is redundant, because the context already implies it. I think it's better to remove the word and to explain to the reader the use of the verb conjugation to establish the context. As for the question &quot;¿Hay algo nuevo para contar?&quot;, even when it is completely valid spanish, it's simply never used in the real world. Actually, spanish speaking persons rarely ask questions like that. Some &quot;more natural&quot; alternatives are &quot;¿Qué ha pasado?&quot; or even better, &quot;¿Qué hay de nuevo?&quot; or &quot;¿Cómo te va?&quot;.

:Other instances of redundance are: &quot;¿Y tú, cómo estás?&quot;: &quot;¿Y tú?&quot; is enough. &quot;¿Y usted, cómo se llama?&quot;: &quot;¿Y usted?&quot; will do.

: OASO (Octavio Salguero)

:OASO, I've made the changes you suggested. Thanks so much for all the useful comments (since I'm just starting to learn Spanish I'm not yet confident in writing well stylistically). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

:Perhaps including a note that 'hasta' literally translates to 'until', making it easier later on when it is given other uses in normal conversation.

Hello. I think there are to much information for a newbie. I suggest to split the lesson into two parts ''Lesson 1, A'' and ''Lesson 1, B''. Then, there would be in ''lesson 1, A'' : Dialogue 1, vocab of dialogue 1, pronouns seen in lesson 1. 

There is also a lot of information on verbs. I suggest to introduce ''ser, estar'' in lesson 2 or later, beacause it is a complicated topic.

The verbe ''cantar'' has been introduced in lesson 1. I suggest to add examples of sentences with ''-ar'' verbes in lesson 1, B. ''Trabajar'', ''hablar'' seems to be verbs that newbies use soon.

What do you think about my comments ? --[[User:Youssefsan|Oualmakran Youssef]] 14:30, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:I think your comments make a lot of sense. Please take the initiative and do what you suggest and if it gets all messed up (which I don't think will happen) I'll help straighten things up. Some of those simple &quot;-ar&quot; verbs make much more sense to introduce first and we don't want to overwhelm anyone with too much information to bite off in one piece .. - [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I just noticed the audio file doesn't correspond exactly with the written text in example dialog one.  Should the text be changed? [[User:Lbs6380|Lbs6380]] 18:14, 12 May 2004 (UTC)

== audio files. ==

What should I use to listen to the audio files? Neither real player nor window media player seem to work.

Any suggestions on what to use in the Mac world?  I have tried Quicktime, RealPlayer, iTunes, and MPlayer OS X--this last one produces something really garbled and static-y sounding but is the only thing close to sounding like speech.
===Answer===
I manged to listen to the audio files ending in .ogg with Goldwave, a free program, but it is not really designed for that - Goldwave is really a sound file editing and recording program, and the text files sound a little too funny and a bit fast.  Maybe someone else can tell us what program is supposed to work with .ogg -  and where to get a free version of it...
Yes, I can tell you: Winamp will do (free download for Windows). Found while looking at the possibillities of .ogg files (linux)

== Vowel pronounciation ==

Why are there two tables for vowel pronounciation?  I think both are really confusing.  For example: E=&quot;Eh&quot; as in &quot;Day&quot;.  I know what you mean but it would be better to use a vowel between two consonants such as in the word &quot;bed&quot;.

In the second set of vowel examples we have &quot;A&quot; = A in &quot;father&quot;.  It just isn't.  I don't know anyone who pronounces &quot;que pasa?&quot; using the &quot;a&quot; from father.  It's more like the &quot;a&quot; from &quot;dad&quot; or &quot;fat&quot;.  Shouldn't we use IPA to be clear? Or just use better examples from the English?

[[User:82.213.248.138|82.213.248.138]] 17:27, 7 November 2005 (UTC) El Choco

OK, I have rewritten the Vowel Pronounciations as I suggested above and also moved the section to underneath the Consonant Pronounciation because it makes more sense there.  I have moved the section on &quot;Diacrital use over the vowel u&quot; to be with the other pronounciation changes of u.

I also extended the stress rules so they are correct. 

[[User:82.213.248.138|82.213.248.138]] 21:02, 7 November 2005 (UTC) El Choco

== Consonant pronunciation ==

Why do the vowel and semivowel sections have IPA, but the consonant section only the vague approximations?   Isn't |j| pronounced /x/ (at least in some dialects?), not really /h/ (&quot;like the h in hotel&quot;)?  Or should it say in which dialects |j| is /x/ and which dialects have /h/? --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] 23:05, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

== ¿Cómo te llamas? ==

I believe that it is also correct in certain places to say &quot;¿Qué es tu nombre?&quot; instead of &quot;¿Cómo te llamas?&quot;. If I am right, would somebody like to put this in somewhere? --[[User:222.153.151.94|222.153.151.94]] 08:33, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

I don't know if they really use it some places, but it wouldn't be &quot;¿Qué es tu nombre?&quot;. It'll be &quot;¿Cuál es tu nombre?&quot;
([[User:200.126.201.17|200.126.201.17]] 05:30, 25 February 2006 (UTC))

== Semi-Vowels ==
Here in Argentina, we don't pronounce Oyo with the &quot;y&quot; as in &quot;yet&quot;, we do it like a &quot;sh&quot; as in &quot;shake&quot;. So maybe there could be a better example, like &quot;rey&quot;, that it is pronounced the same everywhere (with the y as in &quot;yet&quot;).
([[User:200.126.201.17|200.126.201.17]] 05:38, 25 February 2006 (UTC))

== Side to side ==

Maybe the words in spanish (for the people talking examples) should have the english version right next to it, for better translation. I would do this, but I'm trying to learn spanish.</text>

== In regards to vocabulary ==

I believe that we should not only give words and definitions, but demonstrate these words in a conversational context. For example, in the food and beverages unit, in addition to the basic vocabulary aspect, we could also provide commonly used phrases such as &quot;I would like to book a reservation at your restaurant&quot;, &quot;Enjoy your meal&quot;, &quot;What would you like to order?&quot; etc. It's the only way people will learn how to actually apply Lojban to conversational speaking.

Secondly, I believe that we should add more units to the textbook. I suggest the topics Celebrations, Shopping, Medical (doctor and veterinary), Entertainment and Interests, Relationships (family, friends, fiancees), School, Work, etc. What is your opinion? fe'o --[[User:Jboprelinomu|Jboprelinomu]] 13:07, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, I agree. The wikibook like it is now is quite unreadable, which doesn't aid in learning the language (or ANY language for that matter). [[nl:Gebruiker:JorisvS|JorisvS]]

' only appears in Lojban words between vowels. &quot;,&quot; only appears in Lojban names. Lojbanists can optionally not include the &quot;.&quot; in their writing. The stress is on a word's penultimate syllable. The exception is that a syllable whose nucleus is a 'y' cannot be stressed; in that case, stress the syllable immediately preceding it. Names may indicate different from penultimate stress by capitalizing the entire stressed syllable or the vowel of the stressed syllable. Some Lojbanists have unofficially proposed other characters to mark stress like &quot;^&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Lojban has eleven diphthongs written by composed vowels. The following transliterations are assuming that the reader has an American English accent.&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| ai ||        As in h''igh''
|-
| au ||        As in h''ow''
|-
| ei ||        As in h''ey''
|-
| oi ||        As in b''oy''
|-
| ia ||        As in ''ya''cht
|-
| ie ||        As in ''ye''s
|-
| ii ||        As in ''yea''r and ''ye''
|-
| io ||        As in ''yo''gurt
|-
| iu ||        Like ''you''
|-
| ua ||        As in ''waah!'' and French q''uoi''
|-
| ue ||        As in q''ue''stion
|-
| uo ||        As in q''uo''te
|-
| ui ||        Like ''we'' and French ''oui''
|-
| uu ||        As in ''wo''mb
|}

A pair of adjacent vowels which are capable of forming a diphthong ''will'' form a diphthong unless a comma is placed between them. That is the purpose of the comma in Lojban; to act as a separator between syllables whenever necessary for pronunciation purposes. (It is not for pausing between words or phrases like in English.)

To make pronouncing some words easier, you may put unwritten '''buffer vowels''' in your speech between consonants. Any non-Lojban vowel can act as a buffer vowel, but i as in h''i''t has the most popularity. For example, you could pronounce (but not write) a buffer vowel between the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; of &quot;sfani&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Lojban names are called ''cmene'' (pronouced shmen-eh, IPA /ʃme.ne/), and are transliterated to use only Lojban sounds. In Lobjan all words end in a vowel, and so to avoid any possible confusion all cmene end in a consonant; if a transliterated name would end in a vowel, it is usual to add an s to the end. All cmene are followed by a full stop, so confusion to where the name stops and the next word starts it avoided; for this reason, any names beginning in a vowel have a full stop in front of them. To indicate an accent somewhere other than the second-to-last syllable, the entire syllable to be accented must be capitalised. A comma should be used to stop two vowels next to each other that should not be pronouced as a dipthong. All names must have the word 'la', meaning 'the', placed before them. A few examples are below:

|New York||nu,IORK (in some accents ni,IORK)
|-
|Cynthia||sinti,a (pronounced SEEN-tee-ah)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ellmist. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ellmist~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Stem Changing Verbs==

In Spanish, some verbs change their stems when they are conjugated. These verbs are known as ''stem-changing verbs''. Many of these verbs are important and often used. There are three different types of stem changing verbs in Spanish:

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''Cambios de los Verbos'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Types of Stem-Changing Verbs&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;e → ie&lt;br&gt;
e → i&lt;br&gt;
o → ue&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The stem changes for all conjugations, excepting '''nosotros/as''' and '''vosotros/as'''. The endings are the same as for regular verbs ('''-o''' for '''yo''', '''-as/-es''' for '''tú''', ...). 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;big&gt; '''Entender'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Understand

|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (pl.) understand
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | vosotros entend&lt;br&gt;
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;eis&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | They understand&lt;br&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | ellos ent'''ie'''nd
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;en&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (pl form) understand&lt;br&gt;

| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;en&lt;/b&gt;
|}

Note that the stem change is done for the second 'e' (not the first one) - in general the stem always changes for the last vowel before the '''-ar/-er/-ir''' ending.

==Present Participle==

The present participle in Spanish is used either for continuous tenses (with ''estar'', e.g. ''I am running.'') and can also be used as an adjective. The Spanish present participle corresponds to the English '''-ing''' form of the verb.To form the present participle for regular '''-ar''' verbs, add '''-ando''' to the stem. For '''-er''' and '''-ir''' verbs add '''-iendo''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''El Participio Presente'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los Verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;-ing&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;hablar →  hablando&lt;br&gt;
comer →  comiendo&lt;br&gt;
vivir →  viviendo&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;speaking&lt;br&gt;
eating&lt;br&gt;
living&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, not all present participles are that regular. Some verbs add a &quot;y,&quot; or change the spelling, to adhere to Spanish orthography (spelling) rules. Here is a list of some common verbs that have an irregular present participle:

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''Participios Irregulares'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los Verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;-ing&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;caer&lt;br&gt;

oir&lt;br&gt;
pedir&lt;br&gt;
repetir&lt;br&gt;

seguir&lt;br&gt;
traer&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;cayendo&lt;br&gt;

repitiendo&lt;br&gt;
riendo&lt;br&gt;
siguiendo&lt;br&gt;
trayendo&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Present Progressive==

Like in English, the Spanish present progressive is used to describe an ''action in progress''.
It is formed by conjugating the verb '''estar''' and then adding the present participle:

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #7FFFD4; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''El Presente Progresivo'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los Verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Talking about actions occurring right now&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;Yo estoy hablando&lt;br&gt;
Tú estás hablando&lt;br&gt;
Él/ella/usted está hablando&lt;br&gt;
Nosotros estamos hablando&lt;br&gt;
Vosotros estáis hablando&lt;br&gt;
Ellos/ellas/ustedes están hablando&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;I am talking&lt;br&gt;
You are talking&lt;br&gt;
He/She/You is/are talking&lt;br&gt;

== Text ==

Here are a couple of sentences and short dialogs about people planning/doing leisure activities. Besides the new vocabulary you should also have a look at how the verbs are conjugated depending on the subject of the sentence.

{{Spanish Dialogue|1=Los Verbos|2=Maria '''viaja''' a México&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''Luis'': ¿Qué '''hacen''' por la noche?&lt;br&gt;''Ana y Carmen'': Nosotras '''bailamos''' en la fiesta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''Raúl'': ¿Qué '''haces''' mañana?&lt;br&gt;''Carlos'': Mañana '''practico''' al tenis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marco '''mira''' la televisión porque hace mal tiempo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pedro y Mario '''toman''' unos refrescos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rosalía '''escribe''' a sus padres los domingos.}}

As you may see, each verb is bolded. These verbs are ''conjugated'', that is, changed by the person(s) to which they are referring. Notice that subject pronouns are ''not'' necessary.

===Regular Verbs===

Spanish has three different types of regular verbs: '''-ar''', '''-er''', and '''-ir''' verbs. The subject pronoun is not necessary and in conversational Spanish it is only used for emphasis. For this lesson, we will omit it. One can still use pronouns, however. The conjugation pattern is the
following:

{{Spanish Grammar|1=El presente regular|2=
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;background: #F0F0FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''Person'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''-ar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''-er'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''-ir'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Infinitive''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''hablar''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''comer''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''vivir''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;English&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;to talk&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;to eat&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;to live&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''o'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''o'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''o'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''as'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''es'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''es'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''3'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''a'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''e'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''e'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''4'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''amos'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''emos'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''imos'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''5'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''áis'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''éis'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''ís'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''6'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''an'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''en'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''en'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}}
&lt;/br&gt;

As one can see, the endings for each person are different. This is similar to other Romance languages, such as Portuguese and Italian (the notable exception is French). This is the reason why we may omit the pronouns while we speak. Remember that sometimes it is best to clarify whether él, ella, or usted is speaking, because they share the same form. However, the context of the rest of the sentence sometimes clarifies this. There are a few steps involved with conjugating a verb. Here are the steps involved:
# Take the ending off of the infinitive. This is either an -ar, -er, or -ir.
# Without the -ar, -er, or -ir, the verb is in its ''base'' form.
# Add the appropriate ending to the base of the verb.

Notice that there are only two differences between the conjugations of -er and -ir verbs. The ''nosotros'' (4) and ''vosotros'' (5) forms are the only differences. Those forms have an &quot;i&quot; in the stem instead of an &quot;e.&quot; 

'''Exercise''': [[Spanish/Exercises/Regular Verbs|Regular Verbs]]

===&quot;G&quot; Verbs===
The verb ''hacer'' means to do or to make. Hacer is irregular in the first person singular form ''(I)'' of the present tense only. The irregular form is '''hago'''. Hacer is one of the many verbs in Spanish which add a &quot;g&quot; in the first person singular of the verb. This is the present indicative of the verb '''hacer'''.
{{Spanish Grammar|1=El verbo hacer|2=
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;background: #F0F0FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;'''Person'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;'''Verb form'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ha'''g'''o&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;haces&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''3'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hace&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''4'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hacemos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''5'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;haceis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''6'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hacen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}}

Note that the verb '''hacer''' is translated as ''to do'' and ''to make'' when
referring to activities. But it can also be used to talk
about some weather conditions:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!El Tiempo
!The Weather
|-
|Hace buen tiempo.
|The weather is good.
|-
|Hace mal tiempo.
|The weather is bad.
|-
|Hace frío. (also: Está frío)
|It's cold.
|-
|Hace fresco.
|It's chilly.
|-
|Hace calor.
|It's hot.
|-
|Hace sol.
|It's sunny.
|-
|Hace nublado.
|It's cloudy.
|-
|Hace viento.
|It's windy.
|}

But:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!El Tiempo
!The Weather
|-
|Está fresco.
|It's chilly.
|-
|Está caluroso.
|It's hot.
|-
|Hay sol/está soleado.
|It's sunny.
|-
|Hay nubes/está nublado.
|It's cloudy.
|-
|Hay viento/está ventoso.
|It's windy.
|}

When speaking about the weather using '''hacer''', the Ud. form (third singular form) is always used.

==Basics==
A healthful diet brings many benefits. It can help one avoid cancer and heart disease, control weight, and avoid diabetes. A healthful diet can also have effects on mood.

In choosing a healthful diet, you must start with two important concepts:
*Your diet choice is no good if you don't think you can follow it long-term.
*Your diet choice doesn't make up for smoking, lack of exercise, or any other bad habit; however, a healthful diet is a critical ingredient for a healthy body and you will enjoy many benefits from making good eating decisions.

==Examples and suggestions regarding diet==
Not everyone is trying to lose weight, but as an example, suppose that you are. Suppose that you eat a delicious treat. Would you consider yourself a failure? You shouldn't!  Allowing thoughts of failure may only give you an excuse to give up on healthy eating.

If you are trying to lose  weight, cutting down the treats and making sure you eat plenty of vegetables may help.  Beyond diet, losing weight depends on your activity level.  If your calorie intake (food) exceeds your calorie output (activity) your body will store the excess calories as fat.  Weight loss requires your calorie intake to be lower than your calorie output, though neither should be done in the extreme.

Choose a different attitude.  Don't think of healthy eating as a &quot;diet&quot;. Think of healthy eating as balanced eating. Healthy eating is a lifestyle and one that you should enjoy.  You will have difficulty eating well if you don't like the food.   Get yourself in the habit of making good dietary choices by trying different foods as well as different ways to prepare them to find healthy foods that appeal to you.

One last thought, eating healthily does not mean starving yourself!  If you are hungry, eat.  Just be smart about what you take in.  Reach for apples or [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] over candy bars or chips.  You don't need to feel like you have to cut out completely the occasional treat &amp;mdash; just keep it that: occasional.

==Non-diet concerns==
Diet is hardly your main problem if you won't exercise. As with following a good diet, exercise is best if you can work it into your daily schedule. For example, try taking the stairs instead of the elevator whenever possible. Consider biking to work instead of driving.

==Balance==
Humans function best on a diet consisting mainly of [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], and a protein source that could be [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]] or [[Cookbook:Legume|legumes]]. Fresh leafy green vegetables are most important, but it is also necessary to eat yellow vegetables frequently. Starches ([[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], [[Cookbook:Grits|grits]], [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], etc.) are often both tasty and low-cost. Starches with whole grains are best, as white flours, other modified grains and potatoes have high [[w:Glycemic_index|glycemic indexes]], which can promote [[w:Diabetes|diabetes]] and cause a build up of gas in the digestive tract. You can do very well by planning meals as small servings of meat or meat alternatives with heaping piles of vegetables, and a reasonable serving of some carbohydrate. Add [[Cookbook:Fat|fat and oil]] as needed for energy, rather than using sugar for this purpose. Add [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|herbs and spices]] for taste; increased taste can lead to earlier feelings of satiation.

==Specific tips==

===Vegetables===
For many vegetables it is a good method to lightly [[Cookbook:Steaming|steam]] them. While cooking can destroy nutrients, it also makes nutrients more available for the body. Some people think that uncooked vegetables contain the risk to spread disease from frequently-ill farm workers, manure, and animal contamination, but thorough washing of the vegetables before their uncooked use avoids this risk. [[Cookbook:Boiling|Boiling]] will leach nutrients out of the vegetables, so you should avoid it. If you do not have a proper [[Cookbook:Steamer|steamer]], try placing a metal [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]] into a large lidded pot holding a half inch of water.

Many of the best-tasting vegetables are commonly hated because they are typically overcooked.
[[Cookbook:Broccoli|Broccoli]], [[Cookbook:Brussels Sprout|Brussels sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], and [[Cookbook:Bean Sprouts|bean sprouts]] are all tasty when fresh and not overcooked. Broccoli is particularly versatile, tasty, nutritious, but relatively short-lived. Don't forget to try more unusual vegetables, such as [[Cookbook:Okra|okra]] (cooked with tomatoes) and [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]]. Variety is good for you.

Try serving your green vegetables with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] instead of creamy sauces. Lemon juice is particularly good with broccoli and spinach. You might prefer [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] with cabbage.

[[Cookbook:Lettuce|Lettuce]] is very high in nutrients and tastes very good.. While green vegetables are most important, don't forget the yellow vegetables ([[Cookbook:Squash|squash]], [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]]) and [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]].

===Meat, including eggs and fish===
In general, meat needs to be cooked to at least medium rare for safety. One exception is domestic poultry such as chicken and turkey. [[Cookbook:Pork|Pork]] can be cooked to 145° for medium rare, contrary to popular belief. [[Cookbook:Microwaving|Microwaving]] meat is generally bad, because dangerous bacteria can survive in any cold spots that remain.

It is particularly important to avoid browning nitrite-cured meat such as [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] or [[Cookbook:Corned Beef|corned beef]] because the added nitrates and nitrites react during browning to make things much worse.

In place of salt on meat, try some [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|herbs and spices]]. For example, a [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] roast goes well with [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]. [[Cookbook:Chicken|Chicken]] goes well with [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], and [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]. For a more [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|Asian]] flavor, use [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] and [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]].

You might enjoy your meat with [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|teriyaki]], [[Cookbook:Barbecue Sauce|barbecue]], or [[Cookbook:Sweet and Sour|sweet and sour]] sauce. These [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauces]] are somewhat high in [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], but the good taste may save you from far worse dietary choices.

A technique to remove excess fat from shredded or ground meats after frying is to remove the meat to a metal [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]], and rinse with hot water. This is especially important when cooking such meats ahead of time to prepare for freezing - otherwise the fat solidifies on the meat when it freezes, and can sometimes cause unpleasant odors and tastes. Another method is to float the fat with cold water or broth, then refrigerate to solidify the fat.

For [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], try cooking it with some ground [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|herbs and spices]]. Also, try serving it plain or with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]. You won't need to cover up a &quot;fishy&quot; (bacterial) smell if you buy fresh fish and use it quickly; fresh fish does not have an odor. If the fish is whole, fresh fish will have clear eyes.

[[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]] whites are generally more healthy than egg yolks.{{citation needed}} In most recipes, you can use 2 egg whites to replace 1 whole egg.

Try flavoring your [[Cookbook:Scrambled Eggs|scrambled eggs]] with chopped [[Cookbook:Olive|black olives]] instead of [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] bits.

===Oil and Fat===
For general use, [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]] (low erucic acid rapeseed oil) is a good choice.
Fancy grades of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] can be better, but they are easy to overheat because they have low [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke points]]. When oil is overheated, harmful chemicals end up both in the food and in the air. (use olive oil on your salad, and canola oil for frying)

As a general rule, it is more healthful to choose liquid oils over solid fats. It is currently suspected that the ''trans-'' fats (partially hydrogenated oils) are least desirable; these are found in most [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] and [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]. Shortening without ''trans-'' fats is now available, made from a mixture of unhydrogenated oil and '''fully''' hydrogenated oil.

===Milk===
People with European ancestry usually handle [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] well. Milk is a valuable nutritious food, providing vitamins and essential fats to those who can properly digest it. Fermenting milk to make products such as [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]], and [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]], increases the digestibility and available nutrition of milk.

Some people have trouble digesting the lactose in milk, and find that many dairy products cause flatulence or loose bowels. Milk can be treated to reduce lactose by fermenting it or by adding an enzyme. Look for strong (aged) [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheeses]] and Lactaid if you have this problem. 

In addition, some people have intolerance to the proteins in milk, [[w:Casein|casein]] and [[w:Whey|whey]]. Casein intolerance is frequently seen in people with both [[w:Coeliac disease|coeliac disease]] and dairy intolerance. Whey intolerance is less common. In these instances, removing lactose will not help, and cheeses are particularly bad foods for people with casein intolerance because the casein in milk is concentrated in the cheese.

If you choose to avoid milk, you will need an alternate source of calcium. [[Cookbook:Anchovy|Anchovies]] and canned [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] are good sources. You may also need an alternate source of vitamin D, which is added to milk in some countries. This is particularly important if you are a dark-skinned person who does not receive lots of exposure to bright sunlight; the human body normally relies on ultraviolet light to produce vitamin D. Several milk substitutes are available, typically based on [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy]], [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], or [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]]. These can be used to some extent in cooking as well as for drinking, and variants with vitamins and calcium content equivalent to milk are available.

===Salt===
For [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] added at the table, consider using flaked salt. It's the same stuff, but it tastes stronger (so you use less) because it dissolves faster.

When cooking, you can reduce salt by 20% to 45% without giving up taste by adding a small amount of [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]]. Consider doing this with [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:Soup|soups]], [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], [[Cookbook:Fried Rice|fried rice]], and anything else you might consider to be a &quot;savory&quot; dish. (MSG contains far less sodium than table salt does)

See above for specific tips for meat and vegetable salt reduction.

===Flour-based foods and fiber===
[[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|Whole wheat]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] provides [[Cookbook:Fiber|dietary fiber]], which helps to clean you out. Whole wheat flour also has more protein than plain white flour. In most recipes, you can replace half of the plain white flour with whole wheat flour. The more whole wheat you use, the less the result will rise. You might add some extra leavening agent ([[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]], [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]], etc.) to make up for this. Many recipes are specifically designed for 100% whole wheat flour, including [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]] and [[Cookbook:Raisin Oatmeal Muffins|raisin oatmeal muffins]].

When making batter for [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep-fat frying]], try using [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] in place of some of the plain white flour.

Instead of white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], choose brown rice. This gives you extra flavor, fiber, and nutrients.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis (SWH) is a hypothesis in linguistics, stating that there are notable differences in thought patterns of speakers of different languages, and that the way people's brains function is strongly affected by their native languages. It's a very controversial theory, championed by linguist Edward Sapir and his student Benjamin Whorf.

First discussed by Sapir in 1929, the hypothesis became popular in the 1950s following posthumous publication of Whorf's writings on the subject. In 1955, Dr. James Cooke Brown created the Loglan language (which led to the offshoot Lojban) in order to test the hypothesis. After vigorous attack from followers of Noam Chomsky in the following decades, the hypothesis is now only believed by linguists with a grain of salt; that thought processes are somewhat affected by language, but that differences aren't that notable.

Central to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is the idea of linguistic relativity: distinctions of meaning between related terms in a language are often arbitrary and particular to that language. Sapir and Whorf took this one step further by arguing that a person's whole world view is determined by the vocabulary and syntax available in his or her language.

The extreme (&quot;Weltanschauung&quot;) version of this idea, that all mental function is constrained by language, can be disproved through personal experience: people in every language occasionally struggle to express their exact thoughts, feeling constrained by the language. It's common to say or write something, only to correct one's self or further clarify meaning, especially to someone being explained to. These show that ideas are not merely words, because one can imagine something without being able to express it in words.

The opposite extreme - that language does not influence thought at all - is also widely considered to be false. For example, it has been shown in studies that people's discrimination of similar colors can be influenced by their vocabulary for distinguishing said colors. Another study showed that deaf children of hearing parents are more likely to fail on some cognitive tasks unrelated to hearing, while deaf children of deaf parents succeed, due to parents being able to more extensively communicate. Computer programmers who know different programming languages often see the same problem in completely different ways.

The Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) analysis of the problem is direct: most people do notable thinking by talking to themselves and by imagining images and other sensory phantasms. To the extent that people think by talking to themselves, they are limited by their vocabulary and the structure of their language and linguistic habits. (However it should also be noted that everyone have idiolects, mental language patterns individual to them.)

John Grinder, a founder of NLP, was a linguistics professor who perhaps unconsciously combined the ideas of Chomsky with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. A seminal NLP insight came from a challenge he gave to his students: coin a neologism to describe an idea for which you have no words. Student Robert Dilts gave an example by coining a word for the way people stare into space when they are thinking, and for the different directions they stare. These new words enabled users to describe patterns in the ways people stare into space, which led directly to NLP results — as notable a validation of the weak hypothesis as one could ask.

Lojban is thus designed to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, by attempting to expand the speakers' minds and express thoughts as conveniently as possible to see if there's any notable effects in the speakers' thought patterns/worldview. The only complication with this is that the third factor - the speakers all wanting to learn Lojban, an obscure language - could skew the results somewhat, but the only way to fix that is to get more Lojban speakers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Loglan ==

In 1955, sociologist from Philippines Dr. James Cooke Brown began work on '''Loglan''', a constructed language designed for linguistic research, particularly investigation of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, a theory stating that linguistic structures affect people's thoughts. The object was to make a language so powerfully expressive for logic and calculation that people learning it would become measurably smarter if the hypothesis was true.

He intended it to be as culturally neutral as possible, logically and linguistically powerful, incorporating all known expressive features of any language (e.g., compounded location tenses), metaphysically parsimonious (e.g., you are not required to express any feature of reality, as you are in English time-tenses of verbs), and totally regular and unambiguous.  He even used maximally stable phonemes.

The formal grammar was disambiguated mechanically (at first).

The language's grammar is based on predicate logic (the name Loglan is short for &quot;logical language&quot;), which also makes it particularly suitable for human-computer communication, an application that led Robert Heinlein to mention the language in his novel The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.

Dr. Brown founded The Loglan Institute to develop the language and other applications of it.  He always considered the language a research project that was never complete, so although he released many papers about its design he never &quot;released&quot; it to become a usable language.  A group of his followers later formed The Logical Language Group to create the language '''Lojban''' along the same principles, but with the intention to make it freely available and encourage its use as a real language.  This latter group has a small but active community of speakers.

Loglan allows very strange speech, because one can say things that are simply not meaningful.  For example, you can literally say that John, a person, is a short word.  Or one can directly and precisely say any of the many possible meanings of the English phrase &quot;a pretty little girls school.&quot;

In natural languages, the ambiguity of the grammar hides these odd meanings; but in Loglan they are all available and add expressive freedom to the language.  This feature is so pronounced that people fluent in Loglan say impossible things as a sort of joke — a type of humour simply not supported by the linguistic machinery of natural languages.

The oddest, most difficult thing for a speaker of an Indo-European language like English is that Loglan has no distinction between nouns or verbs, objects, direct objects, indirect objects, possessive forms or tenses.  There are only predicates, with places for variables: for example, ''botso'': X buys item Y from seller P for price Q.  There are prefixes to reorder predicates; for example, price would be ''botso'' with a little word to make price the first variable.  With different reorderings, one speaks of buyer, bought-thing, or seller.

Tenses for time, location, actor, type of action, etc. are provided by &quot;little words&quot; which are optional.  Predicates compound, so a predicate can fit in the variable of another predicate.  Every feature of the language has standard, regular forms for acting in compounds.  For example, time-travel tenses are available trivially in Loglan (I did X from time Y to P in time Q.) using compounding forms normally used for location tenses.

After long use of Loglan, the world gains a sort of timeless, objectless, actorless flavor.  Time words and location words fall away except when needed to make a point, usually with emotional emphasis.  It is rather easy to avoid blame for responsibilities in Loglan, and scheduling may be creatively ambiguous because the tenses are optional.

The language is designed so that the patterns of phonemes always parse into words.  Thus, one cannot babble Loglan, because even when run together, the language is still parsable.

== Lojban ==

The constructed language '''Lojban''' (SAMPA &amp;#0091;'loZban]) was created by the Logical Language Group in 1987 based on the earlier Loglan, with the intent to make the language more complete, usable, and freely available.  The language itself shares many of the features and goals of Loglan; in particular:

* The grammar is based on predicate logic, and is capable of expressing complex logical constructs precisely.
* It has no irregularities or ambiguities in spelling or grammar, so it can be easily parsed by computer.
* Lojban is designed to be as culturally neutral as possible.
* It is, nonetheless, simple to learn and use compared to many natural languages.

While the initial goal of the Loglan project was to investigate the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, the active Lojban community has additional goals for the language, including:

* General research into linguistics.
* Research in artificial intelligence and machine understanding.
* Improved human-computer communication, storage ontologies, and computer translation of natural language text.
* Use of language as an educational tool.
* Personal creativity.

=== Lojban Grammar ===

All words in Lojban belong to one of three overall categories: ''brivla'', for both common nouns and verbs; ''cmene'', for proper nouns; ''cmavo'', for structural particles: articles, numerals, tense indicators and other such modifiers. The ''cmavo'' are further subdivided into ''selma'o'', which are closer to the notion of parts of speech (e.g., UI includes interjections and discursives). There is no distinct class of words for adjectives or adverbs, unlike  most Indo-European languages. Most types of noun phrases are always preceded by an article; there are different articles to indicate whether it is being treated as an individual, mass, set, or typical element. ''Brivla'' do not inflect for tense, person, or number; tense may optionally be indicated by separate ''cmavo'', and number may optionally be indicated in various ways.

As befits a logical language, there is a large assortment of conjunctions. Logical conjunctions take different forms depending on whether they connect ''sumti'' (the equivalent of noun phrases), ''selbri'' (phrases that can serve as verbs; all ''brivla'' are ''selbri''), parts of a ''tanru'' (a construct whose closest English equivalent is a string of nouns), or clauses in a sentence.

The typology is Subject Verb Object, with Subject Object Verb also common. Word formation is polysynthetic; many ''brivla'' (all of which, except for a handful of borrowings such as ''alga'', have at least five letters) have one to three three-letter forms called ''rafsi'' which are used in making longer words.  For example, ''gasnu'' means &quot;to make something happen&quot;; its ''rafsi'' form of ''-gau'' regularly forms compounds meaning &quot;to cause...x&quot;, in which the agent is in the subject place of the new predicate.

Lojban has a positional case system, though this can be overridden by marking predicate arguments with explicit case particles. For instance, ''bramau'' means &quot;is bigger than&quot;; the bigger thing is in first position, and the smaller is second, and the measured property in the third.  So ''mi bramau do le ka clani'' means &quot;I am bigger than you in the property of height&quot; or &quot;I am taller than you&quot;; but this could also be expressed as something like ''fi le ka clani fe do fa mi bramau'', &quot;In height, you are exceeded by me&quot;.

* ''le cinfo cu bramau le mlatu'' -- &quot;The lion is bigger than the cat&quot;
* ''mi bramaugau le cinfo le mlatu'' -- &quot;I make the lion bigger than the cat&quot;

What a particular place means depends entirely on the ''brivla''. For animals and plants the second place is the species, variety, breed, or other taxon; for verbs of measurement it is the numerical measurement, and a further place is the standard; for ''klama'' (&quot;go&quot; / &quot;come&quot;) it is the destination. There may be up to five places for some ''brivla''.

Something of the flavor of Lojban (and Loglan) can be imparted by this lightbulb joke:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Q: How many Lojbanists does it take to change a broken light bulb?&lt;br&gt;
A: Two: one to decide what to change it into, and one to figure out what kind of bulb emits broken light.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This makes use of two features of the language; first, the language attempts to eliminate polysemy, that is, having a word with more than one meaning.  So while the English word &quot;change&quot; can mean &quot;to transform into a different state&quot;, or &quot;to replace&quot;, or even &quot;small-denomination currency&quot;, Lojban has different words for each.  In particular, the use of a ''brivla'' such as the word for &quot;change&quot; (&quot;binxo&quot;) implies that all of its predicate places exist, so there must
be something for it to change into.  Another feature of the language is that it has no grammatical ambiguities such as appear in English phrases like &quot;big dog catcher&quot;, which can mean either a big person who catches dogs or a person who catches big dogs.  In Lojban, unless you clearly specify otherwise with ''cmavo'', such modifiers always group left-to-right, so &quot;big dog catcher&quot; is a catcher of big dogs, and a &quot;broken light bulb&quot; is a bulb that emits broken light (you can also avoid the ambiguity by creating a new word, so &quot;broken lightbulb&quot; has the intended meaning).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Attitudinals are markers of attitude or [[Lojban/Emotions|emotion]], modifying the word (brivla, cmavo, cmene, sumti, or tanru) directly before it. For example, the simple &lt;&lt; ''mlatu'' &gt;&gt; for &quot;cat&quot; can become &lt;&lt; ''mlatu .ui'' &gt;&gt; for &quot;cat (happiness!/:D)&quot;. At the beginning of a sentence (after the place of .i) they modify the entire sentence (bridi), and after the attitudinal beginning bracket &lt;&lt; ''fu'e'' &gt;&gt; continues the emotion for all the statement until the closing bracket &lt;&lt; ''fu'o'' &gt;&gt;.

Attitudinals can also effect [[Lojban/Vocatives|vocatives]] the same way a change in vocal tone can greatly effect a simple &quot;hello&quot; - for example, &lt;&lt; ''coi .ui'' &gt;&gt; means not a simple &quot;Hello.&quot;, but a &quot;Hello! :D&quot;. Combined with the attitudinal question-maker ''pei'', you can easily create more complex &lt;&lt; ''coi .uipei'' &gt;&gt; may be thought of as &quot;Hello - are you glad to see me?&quot;, while &lt;&lt; ''co'o .uipei'' &gt;&gt; may be viewed as &quot;Good-bye - are you happy that we part?&quot;.

Beyond mere emotion, they can mark prepositional ideas such as desire (&quot;I want this to happen&quot;), obligation (&quot;This needs to happen&quot;), and many other complex functions we take for granted - for example, &lt;&lt; ''mi citka'' &gt;&gt; means &quot;I eat&quot;, while &lt;&lt; ''.au mi citka'' &gt;&gt; means &quot;I want to eat&quot;, and &lt;&lt; ''.e'e mi citka'' &gt;&gt; means &quot;I am able to eat&quot;.

Since {ki'e} means approximately &quot;Thank you,&quot; it might seem appropriate to respond by saying {fi'i}, seemingly corresponding to the English &quot;You're welcome.&quot;  However, {fi'i} means &quot;welcome&quot; in the sense of an invitation/acceptance only. In order to respond, {je'e} should be used.

{coi co'o} means &quot;Greetings in passing.&quot; English speakers generally just say &quot;Hi.&quot;

==Exercises==
In Exercises 1-7, give the most suitable Lojban word(s) to say in each situation.

01. The beginning of a conversation.&lt;br&gt;
02. Begging.&lt;br&gt;
03. During an oath.&lt;br&gt;
04. Inviting a guest into your house.&lt;br&gt;
05. Getting a group of people to listen to your announcement.&lt;br&gt;
06. You desire the floor while someone else has it.&lt;br&gt;
07. Leaving a party.

In Exercises  8-43, give the closest Lojban translation of the English sentences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|set theory}}

Set Theory starts very simply: it examines whether an object ''belongs'', or does ''not belong'', to a ''set'' of objects which has been described in some non-ambiguous way.  From this simple beginning, an increasingly complex (and useful!) series of ideas can be developed, which lead to notations and techniques with many varied applications.

==Definition of a Set==
The definition of a set sounds very vague at first.  A '''''set''''' can be defined as a collection of '''''things''''' that are brought together because they obey a certain '''''rule'''''.

These 'things' may be anything you like: numbers, people, shapes, cities, bits of text ..., literally anything.

The key fact about the 'rule' they all obey is that it must be ''well-defined''.  In other words, it enables us to say for sure whether or not a given 'thing' belongs to the collection.  If the 'things' we're talking about are English words, for example, a well-defined rule might be:

::'... has 5 or more letters'

A rule which is not well-defined (and therefore couldn't be used to define a set) might be:

::'... is hard to spell'

===Elements===
A 'thing' that belongs to a given set is called an '''''element''''' of that set.  For example:
::Henry VIII is an element of the set of Kings of England.

== Notation ==
'''Curly brackets''' &lt;math&gt;\{ \dots \}&lt;/math&gt; are used to stand for the phrase 'the set of ...'.  These braces can be used in various ways. For example:
*: We may ''list'' the elements of a set:
*:: &lt;math&gt;\{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}&lt;/math&gt;

*: We may ''describe'' the elements of a set:
*:: &lt;math&gt;\{ \text{ integers between } -3 \text{ and  } 3 \text{ inclusive} \}&lt;/math&gt;

*: We may use an ''identifier'' (the letter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for example) to represent a ''typical element'', a &lt;math&gt;|&lt;/math&gt; symbol to stand for the phrase 'such that', and then the rule or rules that the identifier must obey:
*:: &lt;math&gt;\{x | x \text{ is an integer and } |x| &lt; 4 \}&lt;/math&gt;
*: or
*:: &lt;math&gt;\{x | x \in \mathbb{Z}, |x| &lt; 4 \}&lt;/math&gt;

The last way of writing a set - called ''set comprehension'' notation - can be generalized as:
: &lt;math&gt;{x | P(x)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a statement (technically a ''propositional function'') about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the set is the collection of all elements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true.


The symbol &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; is used as follows:
*: &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; means 'is an element of ...'.  For example: &lt;math&gt;\text{dog } \in \{ \text{quadrupeds}\}&lt;/math&gt;
*: &lt;math&gt;\notin&lt;/math&gt; means 'is not an element of ...'. For example: &lt;math&gt;\text{Washington DC} \notin \{\text{European capital cities}\}&lt;/math&gt;

A set can be ''finite'': &lt;math&gt;\{\text{British citizens}\}&lt;/math&gt;

... or ''infinite'': &lt;math&gt;\{7, 14, 21, 28, 35, \dots \}&lt;/math&gt;

(Note the use of the ''ellipsis'' &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that the sequence of numbers continues indefinitely.)


Sets will usually be denoted using ''upper case'' letters: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, ...

Elements will usually be denoted using ''lower case'' letters: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, ...

== Set Operations ==

===Universal Set===
The set of all the 'things' currently under discussion is called the '''''universal set''''' (or sometimes, simply the '''''universe''''').  It is denoted by '''U'''.

The universal set doesn’t contain everything in the whole universe.  On the contrary, it restricts us to just those things that are relevant at a particular time.  For example, if in a given situation we’re talking about numeric values – quantities, sizes, times, weights, or whatever – the universal set will be a suitable set of numbers (see below).  In another context, the universal set may be {alphabetic characters} or {all living people}, etc.

===Empty set===
The set containing no elements at all is called the '''''null set''''', or '''''empty set'''''.  It is denoted by a pair of empty braces: &lt;math&gt;\{ \}&lt;/math&gt; or by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.

It may seem odd to define a set that contains no elements.  Bear in mind, however, that one may be looking for solutions to a problem where it isn't clear at the outset whether or not such solutions even exist.  If it turns out that there isn't a solution, then the set of solutions is empty.

For example:

*: If &lt;math&gt;U = \{\text{words in the English language}\}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\{\text{words with more than 50 letters}\} = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.
*: If &lt;math&gt;U = \{\text{whole numbers}\}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\{x | x^2 = 10\} = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.

====Operations on the empty set====
Operations performed on the empty set (as a set of things to be operated upon) can also be confusing. (Such operations are nullary operations.) For example, the sum of the elements of the empty set is zero, but the product of the elements of the empty set is one (see empty product). This may seem odd, since there are no elements of the empty set, so how could it matter whether they are added or multiplied (since “they” do not exist)? Ultimately, the results of these operations say more about the operation in question than about the empty set. For instance, notice that zero is the identity element for addition, and one is the identity element for multiplication.

===Some special sets of numbers===
Several sets are used so often, they are given special symbols.

====The natural numbers====
The 'counting' numbers (or whole numbers) starting at 1, are called the '''''natural numbers'''''.  This set is sometimes denoted by '''N'''.  So '''N''' = {1, 2, 3, ...}

Note that, when we write this set by hand, we can't write in '''bold''' type so we write an N in blackboard bold font: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

====Integers====
''All'' whole numbers, positive, negative and zero form the set of '''''integers'''''.  It is sometimes denoted by '''Z'''.  So '''Z''' = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

In blackboard bold, it looks like this: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

====Real numbers====
If we expand the set of integers to include all decimal numbers, we form the set of '''''real numbers'''''.  The set of reals is sometimes denoted by '''R'''.

A real number may have a ''finite'' number of digits after the decimal point (e.g. 3.625), or an ''infinite'' number of decimal digits.  In the case of an infinite number of digits, these digits may:

*: recur; e.g. 8.127127127...

*: ... or they may not recur; e.g. 3.141592653...

In blackboard bold: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

====Rational numbers====
Those real numbers whose decimal digits are finite in number, or which recur, are called '''''rational numbers'''''.  The set of rationals is sometimes denoted by the letter '''Q'''.

A rational number can always be written as exact fraction ''p''/''q''; where ''p'' and ''q'' are integers.  If ''q'' equals 1, the fraction is just the integer ''p''.  Note that ''q'' may NOT equal zero as the value is then undefined.
*: For example: 0.5, -17, 2/17, 82.01, 3.282828... are all rational numbers.

In blackboard bold: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
 set theory
union-
{a,b,c}^{a,f,g,}
={a,b,c,f,g,}

====Irrational numbers====
If a number ''can't'' be represented exactly by a fraction ''p''/''q'', it is said to be '''''irrational'''''.
*: Examples include: &amp;radic;2, &amp;radic;3, &amp;pi;.

== Relationships between Sets ==
We’ll now look at various ways in which sets may be related to one another.

=== Equality ===
Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be '''''equal''''' if and only if they have exactly the same elements.  In this case, we simply write:

: ''A'' = ''B''


Note two further facts about equal sets:

*: The ''order'' in which elements are listed does not matter.

*: If an element is listed ''more than once'', any repeat occurrences are ignored.


So, for example, the following sets are all equal:
: {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1} = {1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2}


(You may wonder why one would ever come to write a set like {1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2}.  You may recall that when we defined the ''[[#Null set (empty set)|empty set]]'' we noted that there may be no solutions to a particular problem - hence the need for an empty set.  Well, here we may be trying several different approaches to solving a problem, some of which in fact lead us to the same solution.  When we come to consider the ''distinct'' solutions, however, any such repetitions would be ignored.)

'''''// Actually in the set theory, there is not expression like these ({1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2}). All elements must be unique.'''''

=== Subsets ===
If all the elements of a set ''A'' are also elements of a set ''B'', then we say that ''A'' is a '''''subset''''' of ''B'', and we write:

: ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''

For example:

In the examples below:

*: If ''T'' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and ''E'' = {even integers}, then ''T'' &amp;sube; ''E''

*: If ''A'' = {alphanumeric characters} and ''P'' = {printable characters}, then ''A'' &amp;sube; ''P''

*: If ''Q'' = {quadrilaterals} and ''F'' = {plane figures bounded by four straight lines}, then ''Q'' &amp;sube; ''F''


Notice that ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B'' does not imply that ''B'' must necessarily contain extra elements that are not in ''A''; the two sets could be equal – as indeed ''Q'' and ''F'' are above.  However, if, in addition, ''B'' does contain at least one element that isn’t in ''A'', then we say that ''A'' is a '''''proper subset''''' of ''B''.  In such a case we would write:

: ''A'' &amp;sub; ''B''

In the examples above:

: ''E'' contains ... -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ... , so ''T'' &amp;sub; ''E''

: ''P'' contains $, ;, &amp;, ..., so ''A'' &amp;sub; ''P''

But ''Q'' and ''F'' are just different ways of saying the same thing, so ''Q'' = ''F''

The use of &amp;sub; and &amp;sube; is clearly analogous to the use of &lt; and ≤ when comparing two numbers.

Notice also that ''every'' set is a subset of the ''universal set'', and the ''empty set'' is a subset of ''every'' set.

(You might be curious about this last statement: how can the empty set be a subset of ''anything'', when it doesn’t contain any elements?  The point here is that for every set ''A'', the empty set '''doesn’t''' contain any elements that '''aren't''' in ''A''.  So &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; &amp;sube; ''A'' for all sets ''A''.)

Finally, note that if ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B'' and ''B'' &amp;sube; ''A'' then ''A'' and ''B'' must contain exactly the same elements, and are therefore equal.  In other words:

*: If ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B'' and ''B'' &amp;sube; ''A'' then ''A'' = ''B''

=== Disjoint ===
Two sets are said to be '''''disjoint''''' if they have no elements in common.  For example:

*: If ''A'' = {even numbers} and ''B'' = {1, 3, 5, 11, 19}, then ''A'' and ''B'' are disjoint sets

== Venn Diagrams ==
A ''Venn diagram'' can be a useful way of illustrating relationships between sets.

In a Venn diagram:

*: The ''universal set'' is represented by a ''rectangle''.  Points inside the rectangle represent elements that are in the universal set; points outside represent things not in the universal set.  You can think of this rectangle, then, as a 'fence' keeping unwanted things out - and concentrating our attention on the things we're talking about.

*: Other sets are represented by ''loops'', usually oval or circular in shape, drawn inside the rectangle.  Again, points inside a given loop represent elements in the set it represents; points outside represent things ''not'' in the set.
[[Image:VennSubset02.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 2'']]
[[Image:VennDisjoint.jpg|left|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 1'']]


On the left, the sets ''A'' and ''B'' are [[#Disjoint|disjoint]], because the loops don't overlap.

On the right ''A'' is a [[#Subsets|subset]] of ''B'', because the loop representing set ''A'' is entirely enclosed by loop ''B''.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

=== Venn diagrams: Worked Examples ===
[[Image:VennTwoSetsGeneralCase.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 3'']]
''Example 1''


''Fig. 3'' represents a Venn diagram showing two sets ''A'' and ''B'', in the general case where nothing is known about any relationships between the sets.

Note that the rectangle representing the universal set is divided into four regions, labelled ''i'', ''ii'', ''iii'' and ''iv''.

What can be said about the sets ''A'' and ''B'' if it turns out that:

: (a) region ''ii'' is empty?

: (b) region ''iii'' is empty?
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

(a) If region ''ii'' is empty, then ''A'' contains no elements that are not in ''B''.  So ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', and the diagram should be re-drawn like ''Fig 2'' above.


(b) If region ''iii'' is empty, then ''A'' and ''B'' have no elements in common and are therefore disjoint.  The diagram should then be re-drawn like ''Fig 1'' above.

''Example 2''

: (a) Draw a Venn diagram to represent three sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'', in the general case where nothing is known about possible relationships between the sets.

: (b) Into how many regions is the rectangle representing '''U''' divided now? 	

: (c) Discuss the relationships between the sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'', when various combinations of these regions are empty.

[[Image:VennThreeSetsGeneralCase.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 4'']]


(a) The diagram in ''Fig. 4'' shows the general case of three sets where nothing is known about any possible relationships between them.

(b) The rectangle representing '''U''' is now divided into 8 regions, indicated by the Roman numerals ''i'' to ''viii''.

(c) Various combinations of empty regions are possible. In each case, the Venn diagram can be re-drawn so that empty regions are no longer included.  For example:
*: If region ''ii'' is empty, the loop representing ''A'' should be made smaller, and moved inside ''B'' and ''C'' to eliminate region ''ii''.

*: If regions ''ii'', ''iii'' and ''iv'' are empty, make ''A'' and ''B'' smaller, and move them so that they are both inside ''C'' (thus eliminating all three of these regions), but do so in such a way that they still overlap each other (thus retaining region ''vi'').

*: If regions ''iii'' and ''vi'' are empty, 'pull apart' loops ''A'' and ''B'' to eliminate these regions, but keep each loop overlapping loop ''C''.

*: ...and so on.  Drawing Venn diagrams for each of the above examples is left as an exercise for the reader.


{{clear}}
''Example 3''

The following sets are defined:

: '''U''' = {1, 2, 3, …, 10}
: ''A'' = {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
: ''B'' = {2, 8}
: ''C'' = {4, 6, 7, 10}

Using the two-stage technique described below, draw a Venn diagram to represent these sets, marking all the elements in the appropriate regions. 

The technique is as follows:

*: Draw a 'general' 3-set Venn diagram, like the one in ''Example 2''.

*: Go through the elements of the universal set one at a time, once only, entering each one into the appropriate region of the diagram.

*: Re-draw the diagram, if necessary, moving loops inside one another or apart to eliminate any empty regions.

'''Don't''' begin by entering the elements of set ''A'', then set ''B'', then ''C'' – you'll risk missing elements out or including them twice!


''Solution''

After drawing the three empty loops in a diagram looking like ''Fig. 4'' (but without the Roman numerals!), go through each of the ten elements in '''U''' - the numbers 1 to 10 - asking each one three questions; like this:

[[Image:VennThreeSetsAllocatingElements01.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 5'']]

First element: 1
: Are you in ''A''? No
: Are you in ''B''? No
: Are you in ''C''? No

A 'no' to all three questions means that the number 1 is outside all three loops.  So write it in the appropriate region (region number ''i'' in ''Fig. 4'').

Second element: 2
: Are you in ''A''? Yes
: Are you in ''B''? Yes
: Are you in ''C''? No

Yes, yes, no: so the number 2 is inside ''A'' and ''B'' but outside ''C''.  Goes in region ''iii'' then.

...and so on, with elements 3 to 10.

The resulting diagram looks like ''Fig. 5''.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

[[Image:VennThreeSetsAllocatingElements02.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 6'']]


The final stage is to examine the diagram for empty regions - in this case the regions we called ''iv'', ''vi'' and ''vii'' in ''Fig. 4'' - and then re-draw the diagram to eliminate these regions. When we've done so, we shall clearly see the relationships between the three sets.

So we need to:
*: pull ''B'' and ''C'' apart, since they don't have any elements in common.

*: push ''B'' inside ''A'' since it doesn't have any elements outside ''A''.


The finished result is shown in ''Fig. 6''.

=== The regions in a Venn Diagram and Truth Tables ===
Perhaps you've realized that adding an additional set to a Venn diagram ''doubles'' the number of regions into which the rectangle representing the universal set is divided.  This gives us a very simple pattern, as follows:

*: With one set loop, there will be just two regions: the inside of the loop and its outside.

*: With two set loops, there'll be four regions.

*: With three loops, there'll be eight regions.

*: ...and so on.

It's not hard to see why this should be so.  Each new loop we add to the diagram divides each existing region into two, thus doubling the number of regions altogether.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
! In ''A''?
! In ''B''?
! In ''C''?
|-

| Y
| Y
|- 
| N
| Y
| N
|- 
| N
| N
| Y
|- 
| N
| N
| N
|}

But there's another way of looking at this, and it's this.  In the solution to ''Example 3'' above, we asked three questions of each element: ''Are you in A? Are you in B?'' and ''Are you in C?''  Now there are obviously two possible answers to each of these questions: ''yes'' and ''no''. When we ''combine'' the answers to three questions like this, one after the other, there are then 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 possible sets of answers altogether. Each of these eight possible combinations of answers corresponds to a different region on the Venn diagram.

The complete set of answers resembles very closely a ''Truth Table'' - an important concept in [[Discrete_mathematics/Logic#Truth_Tables|''Logic'']], which deals with statements which may be ''true'' or ''false''. The table on the right shows the eight possible combinations of answers for 3 sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C''.

You'll find it helpful to study the patterns of Y's and N's in each column.

*: As you read down column ''C'', the letter changes on every row: Y, N, Y, N, Y, N, Y, N

*: Reading down column ''B'', the letters change on every other row: Y, Y, N, N, Y, Y, N, N

*: Reading down column ''A'', the letters change every four rows: Y, Y, Y, Y, N, N, N, N

== Operations on Sets ==
Just as we can combine two numbers to form a third number, with operations like 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply' and 'divide', so we can combine two sets to form a third set in various ways.  We'll begin by looking again at the Venn diagram which shows two sets ''A'' and ''B'' in a general position, where we don't have any information about how they may be related.


[[Image:VennTwoSetsGeneralCase.jpg|left|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 7'']]


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
! In ''A''?
! In ''B''?
! Region
|- 
| Y 
| Y
| ''iii''
|- 
| Y
| N
| ''ii''
|- 
| N
| Y
| ''iv''
|- 
| N
| N
| ''i''
|}

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

The first two columns in the table on the right show the four sets of possible answers to the questions ''Are you in A?'' and ''Are you in B?'' for two sets ''A'' and ''B''; the Roman numerals in the third column show the corresponding region in the Venn diagram in ''Fig. 7''.

=== Intersection ===
Region ''iii'', where the two loops overlap (the region corresponding to 'Y' followed by 'Y'), is called the ''intersection'' of the sets ''A'' and ''B''. It is denoted by ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B''.  So we can define intersection as follows:

*: The '''''intersection''''' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', written ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'', is the set of elements that are in ''A'' '''and''' in ''B''.

(Note that in [[Discrete_mathematics/Logic#Compound_Propositions|symbolic logic]], a similar symbol, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt;, is used to connect two logical propositions with the '''AND''' operator.)

For example, if ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, 4} and ''B'' = {2, 4, 6, 8}, then ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'' = {2, 4}.

We can say, then, that we have combined two sets to form a third set using the ''operation of intersection''.

=== Union ===
In a similar way we can define the ''union'' of two sets as follows:
*: The '''''union''''' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', written ''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'', is the set of elements that are in ''A'' '''or''' in ''B'' (or both).

The union, then, is represented by regions ''ii'', ''iii'' and ''iv'' in ''Fig. 7''.

(Again, in logic a similar symbol, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vee&lt;/math&gt;, is used to connect two propositions with the '''OR''' operator.)

*: So, for example,  {1, 2, 3, 4} &amp;cup; {2, 4, 6, 8} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}.

You'll see, then, that in order to get into the intersection, an element must answer 'Yes' to ''both'' questions, whereas to get into the union, ''either'' answer may be 'Yes'. 

The &amp;cup; symbol looks like the first letter of 'Union' and like a cup that will hold a lot of items.  The &amp;cap; symbol looks like a spilled cup that won't hold a lot of items, or possibly the letter 'n', for i'n'tersection.  Take care not to confuse the two.

=== Difference ===
*: The '''''difference''''' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'' (also known as the '''''set-theoretic difference''''' of ''A'' and ''B'', or the '''''relative complement''''' of ''B'' in ''A'') is the set of elements that are '''in''' ''A'' '''but not in''' ''B''.

This is written ''A'' - ''B'', or sometimes ''A \ ''B''.

The elements in the difference, then, are the ones that answer 'Yes' to the first question ''Are you in A?'', but 'No' to the second ''Are you in B?''. This combination of answers is on row 2 of the above table, and corresponds to region ''ii'' in ''Fig.7''.

*: For example, if ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, 4} and ''B'' = {2, 4, 6, 8}, then ''A'' - ''B'' = {1, 3}.

=== Complement ===
So far, we have considered operations in which ''two'' sets combine to form a third: ''binary'' operations.  Now we look at a ''unary'' operation - one that involves just ''one'' set.

*: The set of elements that are '''not''' in a set ''A'' is called the '''''complement''''' of ''A''.  It is written ''A''&amp;prime; (or sometimes ''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, or &lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bar{A}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).
Clearly, this is the set of elements that answer 'No' to the question ''Are you in A?''.

*: For example, if '''U''' = '''N''' and ''A'' = {odd numbers}, then ''A''&amp;prime; = {even numbers}.

Notice the spelling of the word ''complement'': its literal meaning is 'a complementary item or items'; in other words, 'that which completes'. So if we already have the elements of ''A'', the complement of ''A'' is the set that ''completes'' the universal set.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

=== Cardinality ===
Finally, in this section on ''Set Operations'' we look at an operation on a set that yields not another set, but an integer.

*: The '''''cardinality''''' of a finite set ''A'', written | ''A'' | (sometimes #(''A'') or ''n''(''A'')), is the number of (distinct) elements in ''A''.  So, for example:
*: If ''A'' = {lower case letters of the alphabet}, | ''A'' | = 26.

=== Generalized set operations ===
If we want to denote the intersection or union of ''n'' sets, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (where we may not know the value of ''n'') then the following ''generalized set notation'' may be useful:

: ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;cap; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;cap; ... &amp;cap; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

: ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;cup; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;cup; ... &amp;cup; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bigcup_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

In the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, then, ''i'' is a variable that takes values from 1 to ''n'', to indicate the repeated intersection of all the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

You know about this?  http://mecmath.net  It looks in terms of licensing like it can be incorporated into the wikibook, and maybe the author would like to participate. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:207.241.238.217|207.241.238.217]] ([[User talk:207.241.238.217|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/207.241.238.217|contribs]]) 04:46, 2 July 2008  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Current Contributors ==
Hello, I'm fairly new to Wikibooks but interested in helping on this chapter. Would anyone be willing to give me an overview of the goals and organization, as well as where the most help is needed

Hearing no objections, I'm planning on doing some reorganization of the Integration Techniques modules. I would love to get some input from the community, let me know. [[User:W3asal|W3asal]] ([[User talk:W3asal|talk]]) 05:32, 20 September 2008 (UTC)

: If anyone else is currently working on this book, let me know. I'm planning on doing major rewrites of several sections (starting in the Applications of Integration), and I'd love to coordinate with others. Leave me a message below or on my talk page. Thanks, [[User:W3asal|W3asal]] ([[User talk:W3asal|talk]]) 01:27, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

== Style for theorems. ==

Is there a standard style for stating theorems in this book? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:199.170.84.172|199.170.84.172]] ([[User talk:199.170.84.172|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/199.170.84.172|contribs]]) 09:39, 7 October 2008  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;
: This book seems to lack a contributor's guide or local manual of style. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:36, 13 February 2009 (UTC)
:I've created {{tlx|Calculus/Def}} for this sort of thing.
:The old [[Calculus/Outline]] resembled a contributor's guide, so I've expanded it at [[Calculus/Contributing]]. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 16:28, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

== Merge with Solving Integrals by Trigonometric substitution ==

I would agree with this merger. Unless there are objections, I will be happy to start this process. --[[User:Shiftout|Shiftout]] ([[User talk:Shiftout|talk]]) 23:11, 29 October 2008 (UTC)

: The merger sounds like a good idea to me.[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:13, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

: I've moved the merge notice to the appropriate sub-page. Go ahead and be bold. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:12, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

== Expanded TOC ==

I've just expanded the TOC on the main page. While the collapsed version may be more contributor friendly, those who are new to calculus and unfamiliar with the book structure benefit from a more detailed view. To further help them catch their bearings (and pretty this up a bit) I've added some relevant images to the first few sections. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:11, 13 February 2009 (UTC)


== Inclusion of more examples and intent of book ==

Is there a policy on the number of examples/worked problems within the text?  I think more examples would be of great value.  Secondly, I'm curious as to the intent of the book.  Certainly, someone looking for a survey of calc text would not be served well by this book but the content they want/need is within.  Any suggested reading ideas? [[User:Tiled|Tiled]] ([[User talk:Tiled|talk]]) 17:47, 17 November 2009 (UTC)

:I think lots of examples is a good thing.  However, the exercises have solutions so it's not that important.  I mean, you should have enough examples to show how to do the standard calculations/problems.  Beyond that, people can just look at solutions to exercises if they need more help.  So, an extra example won't hurt anything either probably, but once there are a good amount of examples, you could just add to exercises maybe.  This is just what seems good to me at the time but I'm not saying it is definitely the best way.

:I'm not sure what your second question is supposed to mean.  This is just a calculus book like any other calculus text, at least that's what I assume.  What do you mean someone looking for a survey of calc text would not be served well by this?  If you just want a survey of calculus, skip some sections.  All the basics are here, as well as nonbasics.  Of course, the book could use a lot of work but it's certainly got a lot of good stuff in it already.  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 20:42, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

== Exercises ==

The exercises in this book need lots of work.  I will work on them a little but they could use a lot of work.  For example, problem 8 in Differentiation is currently to find the derivative of &lt;math&gt;x^3 * 2 \sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; and the solution is given as &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^3}{\sqrt{y}} + 6\sqrt{y} x^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Hopefully if you're helping on this book, you understand that this makes no sense, sort of a hybrid of a derivative with respect to x in some parts and with y in other parts.  And, the exercises have all sorts of formats.  This looks bad.  Also, some come in the middle of the section and some come in their own section at the end.  This is actually fine if we want to do it that way but it's probably best to just put them all at the end in one section (or to have all exercises pertaining to a certain section at the end of that section).  Any way, point is all aspects of exercises need work and I will do only a little work so need lots of help. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 02:39, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

:Okay, for starters, what are opinions on where exercises should go?  My vote is they should be at the end of each section because there are too many topics per chapter to have them all there.  For example, currently we have a chapter Differentiation with sections
:Differentiation - An introduction
:More differentiation rules - More rules for differentiation
:Higher Order derivatives - An introduction to second power derivatives
:Implicit Differentiation
:Exercises
:My thought is we do away with the section Exercises altogether and we put exercises at the end of each of the 4 other sections.  This is how your typical calculus book does thing.  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 02:46, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

:: I suggest that each module end on an exercise section with problems that specifically practice the concepts just covered. We could also collect the exercises into a special set of modules, but little is gained and it would make keeping the content up to date harder. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:10, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

:::Hmm, well, I don't know the terminology here :)  What's a module?  If you look above, you'll see my terminology.  Differentiation is a chapter and then there are 5 sections under it, Differentiation through Exercises.  I am saying, and perhaps you are too, that exercises should go at the end of each section.  This is what basically any calculus book, and almost any math textbook, would do.  It would be way too confusing to cover all of differentiation and then go to the exercises.  You need to cover a little bit and then have focused exercises on those concepts.  Then, cover a bit more and do some exercises, and on and on.  All of the Differentiation chapter covers a ton of material, equal to at least 9 sections in the calculus book I am teaching from right now.  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:00, 18 February 2010 (UTC)
::::Also, I realized that most calc books have a section at the end of each chapter with additional exercises, so it's not wrong to put them at the end of a chapter but there need to be exercises at the end of each section, if you ask me. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:02, 18 February 2010 (UTC)
:::::And, sorry, but I looked up what a module is and it seems that we agree if I understand it correctly. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:15, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::: Yes, we seem to see this the same way. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:47, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

=== question-answer template ===

I am assuming that the question-answer template is OK for all exercises? I love it. I will be sandboxing some multivariate exercises, and will try to include them here in the next few weeks.

=== Multivariable Calc Exercises ===

I dumped a bunch of multivar calc exercises in the corresponding sub-section (it used to be empty). Some of them in the beginning may be more properly located in single-var calc, and the reason they are there is because I used them as a part of review in a multivar calc course. Of course, now we can move them, as long as they work with the text already written. Another area where more work is almost certainly needed is the consistency of the notation: I didn't look very carefully, so some of the notation I used (which is the same as that used by Stewart and Sullivan, and is pretty standard) may be in conflict with the text already written. I believe, though, that many exercises may be used as they are. [[User:Melikamp|Melikamp]] ([[User talk:Melikamp|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Melikamp|contribs]]) 18:04, 8 January 2014 (UTC)

== A few questions, how should this book be organized ==

1. Should we introduce some sort of numbering system, such as Precalculus is labeled Chapter 1 and Limits is Chapter 2 (some books might make Precalculus Chapter 0 and Limits Chapter 1)?  And, then below that, sections being labeled.  And, how should this be done?  Should it be Chapter 1, then Section 1, or we could do an outline form, I and then 1 and then a and so forth?  Or other?

: I'm against the idea of numbering systems. They serve little purpose and make restructuring content a pain. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:11, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

2. Does it make sense to put solutions to all exercises?  If so, where should these go?  Should there be a link to the solutions?  Should we just Hide the solutions so you click on &quot;Show&quot; and they pop up?

: I think solutions to all examples are a good idea. Something along the lines of {{tlx|DropBox}} might be useful. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:11, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

3. What is the standard format for an exercise?  I see some putting the \, in to make the math bigger and then I see some without it.  And, if you have a question, such as &quot;What is the area of blah blah blah &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 6x&lt;/math&gt;?&quot;, what do you do with that if your general rule is to make all the math type bigger?

That's a good start I guess. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:30, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

: There doesn't seem to be a standard format. Just be bold. The format can always be changed later. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:11, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

== [[Calculus/More Differentiation Rules]] ==

Without going into extreme detail, this section has the amount of material in about 5-8 sections in your normal calculus book (I've looked through 2 different ones and I think it's 5 sections for one and 7 or 8 for the other).  So, it seems to me this section should be split up some.  It could be done in many ways probably.  Any thoughts? [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:51, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

: I think this content would best be split in four along the level-two headings: One for the chain rule, another for the product (and quotient) rule, a third for implicit differentiation and a fourth for derivatives of common functions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:19, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

::Hmm, I was thinking more like separate pages (or modules might be the right word).  The reason I thought that was because of exercises.  Right now, it seems like too much material to go through before having exercises.  If it were split at least in 2 or 3 or 4 modules (for example, your suggestion), then there would be less material before the exercises show up and it seems like this would be easier to learn from.  What do you think? [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 23:49, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

::: Yes, that was what I was talking about: To split the content (up into separate modules/pages). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:51, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

::::Alright, hehe, I guess I need to get down this new vocab.  I think your four headings are good but with the added point that product and quotient rule should come first.  I noticed that in the discussion on some page, maybe this one, it was already mentioned by one person and agreed by another that those are easier and should come first.  They came first in the 2 calc books I looked at. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 03:01, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::Upon looking at it again, I have a couple thoughts.  First off Implicit Differentiation is already a section so the implicit differentiation part of this section should just be merged with the implicit differentiation one that is already there.  Beyond that, it might be nice to do the derivatives of trig functions before the chain rule, as you only need the quotient rule to do them, so that you can have a little more variety than just a polynomial to a power.  And, technically you use implicit differentiation to prove the derivative of logs and also of inverse trig functions.  So, I propose we put inverse trig functions in the implicit differentiation section and then after that put exponential and logarithm functions as another section.  I will create these sections right now. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 03:14, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

::::::I put in the top nav bars for each of the new pages and labeled them to not included &quot;More Differentiation Rules&quot;.  As far as that section, I moved all the exercises to the Exercises section temporarily.  I did notice all the new sections are showing up under Subject:Calculus but maybe they will go away now that I deleted BookCat from each one.  I don't know what causes that.  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 22:34, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

== Reorganization of Structure ==

Contents page is too long.  I propose we stick to just major sections on the contents page, and their subsections.  Links to subsections introduce the subsection and show the contents of its pages.  Links to major sections show table of contents for the whole section.  I believe this was what was originally planned (from the contribution page) but seems to have been drifted away from. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 19:31, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

:Dude, I'm in totally agreement with you on the length.  Personally, I don't think that this wikibook should be one giant treatise, like the popular Stewart Calculus book.  That book is over 1,100 pages.  That's too long, too much content.  It takes about three semesters to go through the whole thing.  That's the real reason why this contents page is too long.  If this book, with its current ambitions, was seen to total fruition, it would be ''way'' long.  If anyone ever wanted to make a physical version of it, you could use it for [[w:crushing|crushing]].  Anybody else think it would be smart to split this book up? [[User:Tiled|Tiled]] ([[User talk:Tiled|talk]]) 22:20, 26 August 2010 (UTC)

::Uhh, it covers the material that would be 3 semesters at most colleges.  And, most colleges would use 1 textbook for such a course.  I own 3 different calculus books (one begin Stewart's) and teach from another and they're all essentially the same, as far as the main topics covered goes.  I say it's smart to leave this wiki book as is.  Perhaps you could do, as most textbooks do, and make several editions of the book.  There could be a single variable version, a multivariable version, an early transcendentals version, whatever.  But, this one book should stay together as it is a standard list of topics for one textbook.  I will admit it may have a few sections here and there that wouldn't be in a standard calculus book but that's the beauty of an online book.  We don't have to exclude topics to save money in printing. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/NumberTheorist|contribs]]) 19:20, 26 April 2011 (UTC)


== GFDL ==

This book (at least in the printable version) ends with a copy of the GFDL. I think it should be removed since now wikibooks is under CC-BY-SA. Can I do it, or am I wrong? [[User:Fale|Fale]] ([[User talk:Fale|talk]]) 16:45, 9 June 2010 (UTC)
: I don't have a problem with it.  The whole point of moving to CC-BY-SA was to avoid having to include the full text of the GFDL with every instance of the content. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:58, 9 June 2010 (UTC)

:Go ahead and remove it, this was indeed one of the benefits of relicensing. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 17:40, 9 June 2010 (UTC)

== the title of the &quot;Infinite Limits&quot; section  ==

The section titled &quot;Infinite Limits&quot; should be titled &quot;Limits at Infinity&quot;. The definition is for &quot;limits at infinity&quot; and we talk about limits at infinity for rational functions. The discussion is almost exclusive about finite limits at infinity.  Only the last example is an infinite limit. [[User:Chrislmorin|Chrislmorin]] ([[User talk:Chrislmorin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chrislmorin|contribs]]) 16:20, 27 January 2013 (UTC)</text>

===Intro: What Is Biochemistry?===
Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of, and relating to, biological organisms.  It forms a bridge between biology and chemistry by studying how complex chemical reactions and chemical structures give rise to life and life's processes. Biochemistry is sometimes viewed as a hybrid branch of organic chemistry which specializes in the chemical processes and chemical transformations that take place inside of living organisms, but the truth is that the study of biochemistry should generally be considered neither fully &quot;biology&quot; nor fully &quot;chemistry&quot; in nature. Biochemistry incorporates everything in size between a molecule and a cell and all the interactions between them. The aim of biochemists is to describe in molecular terms the structures, mechanisms and chemical processes shared by all organisms, providing organizing principles that underlie life in all its diverse forms.

Biochemistry essentially remains the study of the structure and function of cellular components (such as enzymes and cellular organelles) and the processes carried out both on and by organic macromolecules - especially proteins, but also carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules.  All life forms alive today are generally believed to have descended from a single proto-biotic ancestor, which could explain why all known living things naturally have similar biochemistries.  Even when it comes to matters which could appear to be arbitrary - such as the genetic code and meanings of codons, or the &quot;handedness&quot; of various biomolecules - it is irrefutable fact that all marine and terrestrial living things demonstrate certain unchanging patterns throughout every level of organization, from family and phylum to kingdom and clade.

Biochemistry is, most simply put, the chemistry of life.

'''Catalysis''' refers to the acceleration of the rate of a chemical reaction by a substance, called a catalyst, that is itself unchanged by the overall reaction. Catalysis is crucial for any known form of life, as it makes chemical reactions happen much faster than they would &quot;by themselves&quot;, sometimes by a factor of several million times.

A common misunderstanding is that catalysis &quot;makes the reaction happen&quot;, that the reaction would not otherwise proceed without the presence of the catalyst. However, a catalyst cannot make a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction proceed. Rather, it can only speed up a reaction that is already thermodynamically favorable. Such a reaction in the absence of a catalyst would proceed, even without the catalyst, although perhaps too slowly to be observed or to be useful in a given context.

Catalysts accelerate the chemical reaction by providing a lower energy pathway between the reactants and the products. This usually involves the formation of an intermediate, which cannot be formed without the catalyst. The formation of this intermediate and subsequent reaction generally has a much lower activation energy barrier than is required for the direct reaction of reactants to products.

Catalysis is a very important process from an industrial point of view since the production of most industrially important chemicals involve catalysis. Research into catalysis is a major field in applied science, and involves many fields of chemistry and physics.

Two types of catalysis are generally distinguished. In homogeneous catalysis the reactants and catalyst are in the same phase. For example acids (H+ ion donors) are common catalysts in many aqueous reactions. In this case both the reactants and the catalysts are in the aqueous phase. In heterogeneous catalysis the catalyst is in a different phase than the reactants and products. Usually, the catalyst is a solid and the reactants and products are gases or liquids. In order for the reaction to occur one or more of the reactants must diffuse to the catalyst surface and adsorb onto it. After reaction, the products must desorb from the surface and diffuse away from the solid surface. Frequently, this transport of reactants and products from one phase to another plays a dominant role in limiting the rate of reaction. Understanding these transport phenomena is an important area of heterogeneous catalyst research.

== Enzymes ==
'''Enzyme''' (from Greek, ''in ferment'') are special protein molecules whose function is to facilitate or otherwise accelerate most chemical reactions in cells.
Many chemical reactions occur within biological cells, but without catalysts most of them happen too slowly in the test tube to be biologically relevant.

Enzymes can also serve to couple two or more reactions together, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to &quot;drive&quot; a thermodynamically unfavorable one. One of the most common examples is enzymes which use the dephosphorylation of ATP to drive some otherwise unrelated chemical reaction.

Chemical reactions need a certain amount of activation energy to take place. Enzymes can increase the reaction speed by favoring or enabling a different reaction path with a lower activation energy (Fig. 1), making it easier for the reaction to occur. Enzymes are large globular proteins that catalyze (accelerate) chemical reactions. They are essential for the function of cells. Enzymes are very specific as to the reactions they catalyze and the chemicals (substrates) that are involved in the reactions. Substrates fit their enzymes like a key fits its lock (Fig. 2). Many enzymes are composed of several proteins that act together as a unit. Most parts of an enzyme have regulatory or structural purposes. The catalyzed reaction takes place in only a small part of the enzyme called the active site, which is made up of approximately 2 - 20 amino acids.

[[File:Catalytic Reaction Activation Energy.png|frame|none|'''Figure 1''': Diagram of a catalytic reaction, showing the energy needed (''E'') against time (''t'').]]

The substrates (A and B) need a large amount of energy (&lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;) to reach the intermediate state &lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;/font&gt;, which then reacts to form the end product (AB). The enzyme (&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;) creates a microenvironment in which A and B can reach the intermediate state (&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;/font&gt;) more easily, reducing the amount of energy needed (&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;). As a result, the reaction is more likely to take place, thus improving the reaction speed.

[[File:Two substrates.svg|frame|none|'''Figure 2:''' An enzyme catalyzes the reaction of two substrates and to form one product.]]

Enzymes can perform up to several million catalytic reactions per second. To determine the maximum speed of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is achieved (Fig. 3). This is the maximum velocity (''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of the enzyme. In this state, all enzyme active sites are saturated with substrate. This was proposed in 1913 by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten. Since the substrate concentration at '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be measured exactly, enzymes are characterized by the substrate concentration at which the rate of reaction is half its maximum. This substrate concentration is called the Michaelis-Menten constant (''K''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;). Many enzymes obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

[[File:Michaelis-Menten_saturation_curve_of_an_enzyme_reaction.svg|thumb|350px|'''Figure 3''': Diagram of reaction speed and Michaelis-Menten constant.]]

The speed ''V'' means the number of reactions per second that are catalyzed by an enzyme. With increasing substrate concentration [S], the enzyme is &lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;asymptotically approaching&lt;/font&gt; its maximum speed &lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, but never actually reaching it. Because of that, no [S] for &lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; can be given. Instead, the characteristic value for the enzyme is defined by the substrate concentration at its half-maximum speed (''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''/2''). This K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; value is also called Michaelis-Menten constant.

Several factors can influence the reaction speed, catalytic activity, and specificity of an enzyme. Besides de novo synthesis (the production of more enzyme molecules to increase catalysis rates), properties such as pH or temperature can denature an enzyme (alter its shape) so that it can no longer function. More specific regulation is possible by posttranslational modification (e.g., phosphorylation) of the enzyme or by adding cofactors like metal ions or organic molecules (e.g., NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, FAD, CoA, or vitamins) that interact with the enzyme. Allosteric enzymes are composed of several subunits (proteins) that interact with each other and thus influence each other's catalytic activity. Enzymes can also be regulated by competitive inhibitors (Fig. 4) and non-competitive inhibitors and activators (Fig. 5). Inhibitors and activators are often used as medicines, but they can also be poisonous.

[[File:Comp inhib.svg|frame|none|'''Figure 4''': Competitive inhibition.]]

A competitive inhibitor fits the enzyme as well as its real substrate, sometimes even better. The inhibitor takes the place of the substrate in the active center, but cannot undergo the catalytic reaction, thus inhibiting the enzyme from binding with a substrate molecule. Some inhibitors form covalent bonds with the enzyme, deactivating it permanently (suicide inhibitors).  In terms of the kinetics of a competitive inhibitor, it will increase K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; but leave V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; unchanged.

[[Image:Noncompetitive inhibition.png|frame|none|'''Figure 5''': Non-competitive inhibition.]]

Non-competitive inhibitors/activators (&lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;I&lt;/font&gt;) do not bind to the active center, but to other parts of the enzyme (&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;) that can be far away from the substrate (&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;) binding site. By changing the conformation (the three-dimensional structure) of the enzyme (&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;), they disable or enable the ability of the enzyme (&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;)
to bind its substrate (&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;) and catalyze the desired reaction.  The noncompetitive inhibitor will lower V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; but leave K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; unchanged.

An ''uncompetitive'' inhibitor will only bind to the enzyme-substrate complex forming an enzyme-substrate-inhibitor (ESI) complex and cannot be overcome by additional substrate.  Since the ESI is nonreactive, V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is effectively lowered.  The uncompetitive inhibitor will in turn lower the K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; due to a lower concentration of substrate needed to achieve half the maximum concentration of ES.

Several enzymes can work together in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways (e.g., the citric acid cycle, a series of enzymatic reactions in the cells of aerobic organisms, important in cellular respiration). In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. The end product(s) of such a pathway are often non-competitive inhibitors (Fig. 5) for one of the first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called ''committed step''), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathway (Fig. 6).

[[image:feedback_inhibition.svg|450px|none|'''Figure 6:''' Common feedback inhibition mechanisms.]]

# The basic feedback inhibition mechanism, where the product (P) inhibits the committed step (A&amp;#8640;B).&lt;br&gt;
# ''Sequential feedback inhibition.'' The end products P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhibit the first committed step of their individual pathway (C&amp;#8640;D or C&amp;#8640;F). If both products are present in abundance, all pathways from C are blocked. This leads to a buildup of C, which in turn inhibits the first common committed step A&amp;#8640;B.
# ''Enzyme multiplicity.'' Each end product inhibits both the first individual committed step and one of the enzymes performing the first common committed step.
# ''Concerted feedback inhibition.'' Each end product inhibits the first individual committed step. ''Together'', they inhibit the first common committed step.
# ''Cumulative feedback inhibition.'' Each end product inhibits the first individual committed step. Also, each end product ''partially'' inhibits the first common committed step.

Enzymes are essential to living organisms, and a malfunction &lt;I&gt;of even a single enzyme&lt;/I&gt; out of approximately 2,000 present in our bodies can lead to severe or lethal illness. An example of a disease caused by an enzyme malfunction in humans is phenylketonuria (PKU). The enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which usually converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine does not work, resulting in a buildup of phenylalanine that leads to mental retardation. Enzymes in the human body can also be influenced by inhibitors in good or bad ways. Aspirin, for example, inhibits an enzyme that produces prostaglandins (inflammation messengers), thus suppressing pain. But not all enzymes are in living things. Enzymes are also used in everyday products such as biological washing detergents where they speed up chemical reactions, (to get your clothes clean).

==Digestive and Metabolic Enzymes==
In the previous section we have been talking about the digestive enzymes, both the ones produced by the body, such as salivary amylase, and the food enzymes. Their primary role is for the digestion of food. Another class of enzymes is called metabolic enzymes. Their role is to catalyze chemical reactions involving every process in the body, including the absorption of oxygen. Our cells would literally starve for oxygen even with an abundance of oxygen without the action of the enzyme, cytochrome oxidase. Enzymes are also necessary for muscle contraction and relaxation. The fact is, without both of these classes of enzymes, (digestive and metabolic,) life could not exist.
Digestive enzymes function as biological catalysts in which it helps to breakdown carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. On the other hand, metabolic enzymes function as a remodel of cells.  
Digestion of food has a high priority and demand for enzymes; digestive enzymes get priority over metabolic enzymes. Any deficiency in metabolic enzyme can lead to over work, which could lead to enlarge organs in order to perform the increased workload. The result is unhealthy and could cause enlarged heart or pancreas. The deficiencies of metabolic enzymes can have a tremendous impact on health. As we grow older enzyme level decline and the efficiency in the body decline.

== Enzyme naming conventions ==
By common convention, an enzyme's name consists of a description of what it does, with the word ending in &quot;-ase&quot;. Examples are alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. Kinases are enzymes that transfer phosphate groups. 
The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has developed a nomenclature for enzymes, the EC numbers; each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers, preceded by &quot;EC&quot;. The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism:
* EC 1 ''Oxidoreductases'': catalyze oxidation/reduction reactions
* EC 2 ''Transferases'': transfer a functional group (e.g., a methyl or phosphate group)
* EC 3 ''Hydrolases'': catalyze the hydrolysis of various bonds
* EC 4 ''Lyases'': cleave various bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation
* EC 5 ''Isomerases'': catalyze isomerization changes within a single molecule
* EC 6 ''Ligases'': join two molecules with covalent bonds
----

Some other important enzymes are:
Protease:  breaks the protein into amino acids in high acidity environments such as stomach,pancreatic and intestinal juices. Act on bacteria, viruses and some cancerous cells.
Amylase: Break complex carbohydrates such as starch into simpler sugars (dextrin and maltose). It found in the intestines, pancreas and also in salivary glands.
Lipase: breaks down fats and some fat soluble vitamins (A,E,K, and D). helpful in treating cardiovascular diseases. 
Cellulase: break down cellulose that found in fruits, grains, and vegetables. It increases the nutritional values of vegetables, and fruits.
Pectinase: break down pectin that found in citrus fruits, carrots, beets, tomatoes, and apple. 
Antioxidants: protect from free radical negative effect that can damage cell in the body. 
Cathepsin: break animal protein down.
Lactase: break down lactose that found in milk products. the production of lactase decrease with age. 
Invertase: assimilate sucrose that can contribute to digestive stress if not digested properly. 
Papain: break down protein and help the body in digestion. 
Bromelain: Break proteins that found in plants and animals. it could help the body to fight cancer and treat inflammation. 
Glucoamylase: break down maltose that found in all grains in to two glucose molecules.

Diagram of a catalytic reaction, showing the energy needed at each stage of the reaction. The substrates (A and B) normally need a large amount of energy to reach the transition state, which then reacts to form the end product (AB). The enzyme creates a microenvironment in which A and B can reach the transition state more easily, reducing the amount of energy needed. Since the lower energy state is easier to reach and therefore occurs more frequently, as a result the reaction is more likely to take place, thus improving the reaction speed.

== Book topic discussion ==

It's a good idea to write a book about HTML (though it would be better about 
web design and web building).

However what has been written here seems to be all wrong! 
First writing simple web pages is not programming at all. It is marking up
content of the page. Writing a CSS stylesheet is not programming either.
Using DOM and for example Javascript to produce DHTML effect can be called
programming.

So let's start all over again. First I think one should consider
* audience
* aim
* scope
* methodology to archieve the aim
* multimedia to use in the book

[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 20:38 5 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Writing CSS can be called programming. The other day I had to come up with a cross-browser effect to add bullets to list items only on hover. This is easy enough using JavaScript and rollover images, but the cooler effect - and quicker loading - is to use &lt;code&gt;li {list-style-type: none;} a:hover li {list-style-type: disc;} a:hover {list-style-type: disc;}&lt;/code&gt;. Coming up with this code required using the same skills/thought processes as if I had done the same thing using JS and the DOM.

:I think there should be a distinction between a markup language languages like HTML, programming languages like Java, C++ and scripting languages. HTML and CSS should not be categorized under Programming Languages as it would confuse those who are unfamiliar with what is a progamming language. Perhaps, we can make a book on WebDesign instead and clump HTML, CSS, etc under that instead of under Programming Languages. --[[User:Voed|VoeD]] 2 Nov 2003

CSS is a markup language, and cannot be considered a programming language.  Markup may be used to generate interesting effects, but it remains markup.  The fact that programming languages can generate output similar to markup is irrelevant to its classification.

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 06:51, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I agree -- let's make one big book called something like &lt;del&gt;[[web design and web building]] or perhaps simply [[web building]].&lt;/del&gt;
Then we can discuss the &quot;best practices&quot; in web building -- whether it's HTML, [[XHTML|Programming:XHTML]], [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/XHTML|XHTML (XML)]], [[CSS Programming|CSS]], [[XML]], DHTML (aka [[JavaScript]]), [[Programming Ajax|AJAX]], Flash ([[Macromedia Flash MX: Formtweening]] ?), [[RSS]], or something that none of heard of when we started the book, but now everyone is doing it.
This lets us make recommendations -- if you want to ''start a blog'', we can immediately recommend a few free blog sites (and what features to look for in a blog site). Same for &quot;start a wiki&quot;. Or &quot;install a web server&quot;. Instead of making them wade through a bunch of irrelevant-to-them stuff about HTML tags, JavaScript, etc.
[[Web advertising]]
(This also makes it easier for us to add a couple of paragraphs about some new upcoming technology, then a few months later delete it if it's a flash in the pan, or else split it into it's own Wikibook if it catches on).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 20:53, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Great, it looks like someone has already done this at [[Web Design]].

== rollovers ==

FIXME: move [[User:Voed|VoeD]]'s tip and the following links to a page in a wikibook (where?) that discusses rollovers.
* http://www.alistapart.com/articles/taminglists/
* http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/index.htm

== examples ==

:Can't we upload HTML files and link to them with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[media:]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links? --[[User:Geoffrey|Geoffrey]] 03:48 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)


== browser-specific information / recommendations ==
Should a Free book recommend using Internet explorer, especially considering that it is about 3 years behind the state of the art in web browsers? [[w:User:Arvindn|Arvindn]]

:Fixed -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 12:13, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Moreover, should any particular browser be recommended at all?  Aside from the most standards complaint browser (I believe it's Mozilla Firefox), any browser recommedations are purely subjective.  However, the point should be made that different browsers render markup differently and several sections of the specification state that the browser itself is to govern the appearance of a particular &quot;widget&quot; (not all browsers conform to the specifications).

== Help provided in Article Introduction ==

I started working on this this morning.  So far I've just copied the intoductory information from the HTML article in the Wikipedia to the introduction in this article, made sense and the text was already linked.  I guess I should read up on how to link articles.  Just thought I'd pitch in.

== HTML vs XHTML ==

The HTML img tag syntax page uses the XHTML example.  While modern browsers may be able to parse &quot;self-closing&quot; tags (eg &amp;lt;img /&amp;gt;, it is not proper HTML (whether such pages validate as HTML is another matter entirely, albeit an interesting one).  This is probably prevalent throughout the site.

[http://w3.org/TR/html401 World Wide Web Consortium HTML 4.01 Specification]

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 06:51, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

: I'd guess that it's perfectly valid (at least if the W3C recommendation to put a space before the slash is followed) - the W3C recommend it, and HTML has always been supposed to degrade gracefully. On this subject, though, the examples in the text aren't valid HTML at all! There's no doctype. Perhaps this would be a bit much to throw at beginners, so I'd recommend a piecewise approach to building up the HTML covered: HTML tags, HEAD and BODY tags, content, and then the doctype.

::It's not recommended ''per se'', it's recommended as the best solution to a transition style, i.e. when the page is intended to be transferred into XHTML at a future point without requiring a major rewrite.
::The closing slash on empty elements can lead to confusion in some browsers strictly following the SGML specifications (according to which, if I remember correctly, the syntax &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; /&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; &gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt; are identical), which will render the slash as if placed after the element tag, not within it, other browsers' rendering might break (probably not an issue with 21st century generations of browsers) and in the case of elements requiring a closing tag as per HTML 4.01, this may lead to the tag being treated as an opening tag that is never closed (or treated as automatically closed at the end of its containing element).
::It's litterally a Best Current Practice for this specific purpose, but not for HTML 4.01 in general.
::Well-formdness, validity (i.e. full HTML 4.01 Strict compliance -- the Transitional doctype is intended to be a transitional aid for people used to HTML 3.2 or garden shed markup) and semantic markup should be a key goal of this book if it shouldn't end up being worth no more than any of the random &quot;HTML 4&quot; books on the market since the 1990s, but this is still a book about clean HTML 4.01 (if more versions should be covered, please keep them seperate), not wannabe-XHTML. -- [[w:User:Ashmodai|Ashmodai]] 00:18, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

== bold and italic vs. strong and emphasis ==

Bold and italic are &quot;discouraged&quot; by W3 [http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/graphics.html#h-15.2].

I'm going to replace with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;.

== borders and getting rid of them ==

Many web browsers display something like

    &lt;A href=&quot;/index.html&quot;
    &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;logo.png&quot; 
    ALT=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

with a thick blue rectangle around the image.

To get rid of that blue rectangle, many people
add
    border=&quot;0&quot;
something like this:

    &lt;A href=&quot;/index.html&quot;
    &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;logo.png&quot; 
    border=&quot;0&quot; ALT=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

(For example, as of 2005 the Google Search Bar at
Google
http://www.google.com/searchcode.html
still used
    border=&quot;0&quot;
.
)

However,
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/objects.html#h-13.7.3
informs us that the &quot;border&quot; attribute is ''deprecated''.

The modern way to get the same effect is with CSS.
Leave the HTML as simply
    &lt;A href=&quot;/index.html&quot;
    &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;logo.png&quot; 
    ALT=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
.
Add something like this to the head of your HTML file,
then *all* images will (by default) have no border.

    &lt;STYLE type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
    img {
        border-style: none;
    }
    &lt;/STYLE&gt;

(one could get basically the same effect with any of:

* border-style: none;
* border-color: transparent;
* border-width: 0;

)

== discussion ==

Technically HTML is a &lt;i&gt;markup language&lt;/i&gt; and JavaScript is a &lt;i&gt;scripting language&lt;/i&gt;. Compiled languages like C++ and Java are programming languages. --CarbonUnit

::I agree that HTML isn't a &quot;programming language&quot;. Let's move it from &quot;Programming:HTML&quot; to somewhere in the [[Web Design]] book. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 16:20, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:Is anyone still working on this?  I'd love to help.  I'm a bit inexperienced as far as anything Wiki is concerned, but I'm a quick learner.  --[[User:Twistofreality|twistofreality]] 21:07, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

I have some ideas that I think would be productive, but, being new to Wikibooks as I am, I'm hesitant to start editing things without support from previous contributors.  I taught myself HTML, Javascript, and Cascading Style Sheets six years ago using nothing but online tutorials, so I believe that I have a rough idea of what someone who has never attempted to build a web page is looking for in a reference guide and textbook.  For instance:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The easiest approach for a beginner's module may be to write the text with a specific browser in mind (I learned on Internet Explorer, but Safari and Firefox are both gaining popularity).  Later discussions in an intermediate or advanced module could stress cross-browser design and standards compliance.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The language and structure may need to be improved to appeal to individuals who have little to no experience with web design or computers in general.  With personal computing becoming so wide-spread, many people who are barely interested in why or how their computers work are interested in building web pages for various reasons.  Many will resort to WYSIWYG editors that produce awful code, but many will strive to learn the languages for themselves, as I did.  Some examples of modifications to consider are:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The descriptions of the elements of the &quot;simple document.&quot;  They seem a bit convoluted and may scare of novices.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The submodules' titles.  They may seem to contain jargon for those not &quot;in the know.&quot;  Is it safe to assume that someone unfamiliar with HTML is going to know what a form, table, layer, or frame is?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Few people want to learn HTML solely; rather, people who seek out knowledge of HTML often want to design a web page, which can encompass several different languages and design methodologies.  A concerted effort should be made to make beginning, intermediate, and advanced information on JavaScript and CSS more readily available from the HTML modules where appropriate.  Efforts should also be made to standardize the layout and content struction of all web-design related modules to ensure ease of use.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Finally, consideration should be made for the development of exercises, the results of which could be displayed as screen shots within the module.  In my opinion, reading about any programming/markup language is boring; being able to utilize techniques and see an actual product shortly after a concept is introduced and discussed will almost certainly promote comprehension.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  --[[User:Twistofreality|twistofreality]] 02:37, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

:As this is a HTML book, it should only cover HTML. Strict HTML 4.01 as per its Specification does not have any strictly presentational features. Cross-browser compliance is therefore not an issue unless the behavior of the elements strongly varies across mainstream browsers (abbr and acronym for example don't behave identically in MSIE). The primary scope of this book should be semantic markup, rather than presentation, so concepts like the difference between lists, the hierarchy of headers and the like should be described in-depth and tables should not be described as presentational tools (while they can be (ab)used in that way without strictly violating the Specs, there are other means to achieve a tabular layout in CSS-compliant browsers and as the modern W3C chant goes: HTML is not a presentational language) and be described in their entirety (tables in HTML have lots of features, so don't just stick to the good old table-&gt;tr-&gt;td model). And don't you dare leaving all the things that can and should go in the head element out -- just because not many browsers take note of the link element (other than for stylesheets) doesn't mean it should be taught -- although it should not be the primary focus.
:Since HTML and CSS work hand-in-hand, this relation should be described in one of the later chapters. Stylesheets, alternate stylesheets, classes and IDs need to be explained (an ID is more than a unique class anyway), although this book should not explain CSS syntax and functionality in full detail, that's what the CSS book is for. -- [[w:User:Ashmodai|Ashmodai]] 00:31, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

::I'm new to the Markup Languages, and I think it is a good idea to separate all those languages in three sorts of languages: Markup Languages, Scripting Languages and Programming Languages. 
::I hope that the writers of the lessons will emphasize the abilities with using each language. 
::Suppose that an absolute beginner decided to lean programming, an he visited this article in Wikipedia. I guess he will start with the html to learn programming, wich is not wise from him, since he will never bring any application to existence with language. This is also the same case of JavaScript. Although this last language is something stronger than the html/ xhtml or CSS. I don't believe people can make any application with it. The other &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;point&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is that it is often unclear to understand the use/abilities of the scripts if the author, wouldn't make it clear. As example I learnt some basics of JavaScript but i can hardly know what i can do with it.[[User:Htmlb|Htmlb]] 16:36, 3 February 2006 (UTC) 

==Thank you!==
I am new to HTML and website building.  I liked going through the chapter on making tables.  It helped with the basic concepts and how to read html markup in general.  I appreciate the time and effort put into this work.  Thanks again. 8-19-05

== Adding Music to a Page ==

If most browsers prefer the Object element, why doesn't the page teach that to the user? Why doesn't the page teach the user how to add music to the page using the object element? As you see, there really is no reason to put this under &quot;Techniques that shouldn't be used&quot; when there is a valid way that should be used to add music! Catch my drift?

[user:VenomousNinja]

== Frontpage ==

No offense, but Frontpage is horrid. It should -not- be suggested for any beginner. It adds bits of unnecessary text that make learning from it nearly impossible, and editing it worse.

I totally agree, what I do is type the html source in notepad and save it as a .html document rather than a .txt, try it out. Also, a free html editor (open source) is out there. I use it sometimes, it is okay. It is called Nvu. Another one called Notpad++ is excellent too. These two are used if you want the syntax highlighted when you are editing. --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 01:15, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== If and when it is merged... ==
The title should be considered, as HTML is not programming, but a markup language as noted by others.

== Link to a download  ==

Is there a way to have a link bring up a 'Save as...' box by default rather than try opening the linked to file inside the browser. More specifically, I have a long lecture on my site that opens in visitors' browsers rather than offering to be downloaded. I know visitors can right-click on the link to get a 'Save as...' box, but I would rather 'Save as...' be the default action whenever the link is clicked.

Yeah, this is when you get into a Server lngauge called PHP. Were you can let a user download a file. Look it up on the wikibooks. I don't know any other way. Sorry. --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 09:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Title: HTML Programming? ==

HTML isn't a programming language. It's a markup language. I don't think you can consider it programming any more than the very wiki markup on this page.  Shouldn't it be called HTML formatting rather? --[[User:Jocke pirat|Jocke pirat]] 02:55, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

: Well, its an important part of programming. The XML format is used alot in programming. Within HTML, you can incorporate JAVASCRIPT and PHP. It should be classed amoungst Programming and Web Developement. --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 09:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

: '''Support renaming.''' A &quot;HTML Programming&quot; book would actually need to be a book about [[JavaScript]], for which we already have one. That XML, of which XHTML is just a species, can be used for all kinds of things around the world including programming has no bearing on whether HTML is a programming language or has to do with programming. That said, HTML indeed needs to be marked up or encoded. Proposals: &quot;Marking up HTML&quot;, &quot;Mastering HTML&quot;, &quot;HTML Guide&quot;, &quot;A Guide to HTML&quot;. I am uncertain about articles: &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:37, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

== Merger ==

I don't think it's a good idea to merge HTML with CSS and XHTML with XML. It's best to learn XHTML first and then move to CSS and/or XML. It doesn't make any sense to learn XML first. Or to learn CSS and HTML at the same time. --[[User:S.Örvarr.S|Stefán Örvarr Sigmundsson]] 00:24, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

: Yes. I agree that we should cover the preliminary stuff in the earlier chapters of a book, and the dependent stuff in the later chapters of the same book, rather than trying to cover everything in the first chapter. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 14:25, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

The article you wish to place is a redirect to a non-existent article, so there is no point.
-- anonymous

: Huh? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 14:25, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

I suggest merging [[HTML]] into [[HTML Programming]].

Although, as I've said earlier, I think &quot;HTML Programming&quot; is not a very good name.
Is it too late to rename this whole book to [[Web Design]]?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 14:25, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

: '''Title.''' AFAIK, the subject of web design goes far beyond HTML, being related to book design, to the choice of colors, fonts, including type faces and display faces, various layouts of pages, the software tools supporting the process, and the like. In contrast to this, this book so far has been a mixture of a reference and a user guide to HTML, the specific mark up language. Web design would need to encompass CSS, on which there is a standalone book: [[Cascading Style Sheets]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 14:34, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

== Conditional comments ==

There has been a recent attempt to remove the chapter [[HyperText Markup Language/Conditional Comments|Conditional Comments]], per it's not being part of the standard HTML. I think the book should better document all that there is, even if supported only by certain browsers. How else are the readers going to find out about such comments when they see them in HTML? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:04, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

== Please fix: no page advancement links ==

The only way to move to the next section is to go back to the contents and click on the next section. This is not the case with other books on wikibooks, which have a link to the next section on the top right of the page.</text>

Please delete the modules that you want to delete ''properly''.  Deleting only the cover pages isn't enough.  Moreover, if you are waiting around ''solely'' in order to provide time for people to copy the content, don't.  If anyone has a GFDL wiki that they want the content transwikified to in the future, I can temporarily undelete the modules, transwikify them, and re-delete them. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 16:16, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

Actually I wanted to just delete the front page for now, I don't want to cause too much trouble for anyone.  Yes, the temporary undeletion thing could be done, but I'd hate to have you have to go to all that trouble.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 16:54, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

It's not an enormous amount of trouble.  I have [[User:Uncle G's 'bot|tools that make such transwikification relatively easy]] that I use, which I deliberately designed to be readily adaptable to arbitrary wikis; and I've already been through this specific process with the Body Parts Slang list, which I temporarily undeleted at Wikipedia in order to transwikify it to Wiktionary (for incorporation into WikiSaurus, which is now proceeding).  Actually doing the work itself didn't take very long at all.  A ''manual'' transwiki would be tedious and require a fair amount of effort.  But my transwikifications are semi-automatic.  (I don't copy, paste, and reformat author histories by hand any more. &amp;#9786;)  I could readily set up a one-off script to transwiki the entire Jokebook to another GFDL wiki, for example.  (I've been through that process before, too.  I've just transwikified the all of the reader and editor Help pages from Meta to here under script control, as a matter of fact.)

== What a bookshop is ==
By the way, if you are going to continue using the &quot;books one might expect to find in the non-fiction section of a bookshop&quot; metaphor, you can clarify what you mean to everyone by specifying ''what kind'' of bookshop you are talking about.  See [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks#Headless_chickenism]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 18:15, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

== games people play...this message deleted at your wikipedia box ==

Hi there, Jimbo. Lets see, my story is pretty simple. I stood up
to one &quot;mongo&quot; for better than a dozen ad hominem attacks, and assorted seriously fallacious reasoning, including blocking somebody else for changing a pov term &quot;conspiracist&quot;  (patent characterization, invalidation and republican talking point) to
&quot;Independant Researchers.&quot; I stood up to mongos obvious abuse of admin powers, and was blocked by tony sidaway without just cause
indefinitely. The reason for the block? &quot;Stupid.&quot; Thats the reason tony gave. He called me &quot;stupid.&quot; Now that we know that tony had no valid reason to block me, and that he used an ad hominem as a justification, I am sure you will be happy to do the ethical thing
and unblock me. However, if not, this is the way i see things.

I have posted several different peices to your talk page regarding
the out of control abusiveness going on over at wikipedia. To wit,
and to be specific, Mongo, Tony Sidaway, Inshanne, Fred Bauder, and
probably other people are with certainty pov warriors with admin powers. (and in the case of bauder, arbiter powers.)

Nobody should be subject to this abuse, wikipedia has become abusive
(extremely abusive) ad hominems are the standard fare of such as tony
and mongo and inshanne, and editors are complaining and leaving for good reason.

Wikiepdia is in fact extremely abusive right now, and I'd like to fix it. I'd like to help you out. I'd like to see your adventure
work out for the best. But if you can't get this three ring circus together for something other than animal cruelty, somebody needs to stand up to it, and that person is going to end up being me.

Let me tell you what I have in mind. I think I will start by starting
a hundred different conversations on the net at assorted places
talkign about how corrupt and abusive wikipedia has become. Then,
I'll post questions on yahoo Q+A such as &quot;Is mongo a pov warrior?&quot;
and show links to his assorted pov warring and abuse. Then I'll go chat up all the anti wikipedians i can find.

And to frame this for you in even more tight of a perspective, I have expert knowledge of sociology, Psychology, and Logic, So my argument versus the corruption and abusiveness is going to come from
my depth knowledge. This isn't going to be like the people who mock
you and aren't taken seriously. This is going to be 20 page essay,
distributed to hundreds of different places on the net.

Now, I am sure that you and everybody else are saying &quot;hey, now thats not nice, and, its against the rules, since its a threat.&quot;

People who are abusive, and corrupt must have consequences for their actions. The public needs to know that Wikipedia is abusive unless wikipedia can quit being abusive. You can call it a threat, you can call it a plea for help, you can call it whatever you want. The facts
still remain; Wikipedia is corrupt and abusive. And the ethical thing to do is to warn people not to become involved in an abusive relationship.

Your &quot;wikipedia&quot; has become flagrantly abusive, you have 48
hours to respond, or i will fullfill my obligation to the public
to warn them about the abusiveness here. 

You have never faced a person as rational, as smart, or as determined
as I am regarding.

== starting rough ==

thought i'd keep you appraised of the progress on what you now have about 24 hours to look foreward to appearing all over the net.
(unless you can be civil and be bothered to answer and resolve this.)
This is of course just a stream of consciousness rough...
I still have 24 hours to work on it.
------------------

I started my journey with Wikipedia several months ago. After using it on a few occasions as a handy resource, I became intrigued with it because it’s general conceptual
Modus operandi matched my own personal objectives. Wikipedia exists to create an online encyclopedia, the largest and most complete ever. For many years, and since well
Before Wikipedia, my personal goal has been to participate in a collaborative Textbook
Writing experience, and to use good information and lucidity to end the age of propaganda and start a genuine age of information. As a child, I learned to speed read,
And managed to read thousands of textbooks. This put me in a unique position to integrate the concepts from many different sources, and to try to solve apparently unsolved problems. 
As I explored Wikipedia, I found an article which was very poor in overall quality and Very skewed with patently bad information on a topic I am an expert in. The Wikipedia Article “psychonaut”. This article still stands as a good example of the problem with Wikipedia. Drug using self justifying people have written an article about Psychonautics  Which frames Psychonautics as being about drug use. Psychonautics is not about drug use, it is about the exploration of the psyche. I made an effort to improve the article, and succeeded in getting the definition changed, but it became rapidly apparent that I was facing ignorant people who didn’t know what they didn’t know and who were prepared in any case to fight to defend their turf. After giving them a very complete outline, and starting a professional level conversation with them, all they could do was include A few minor points in a new version and otherwise tell me more or less to shut up and go Away. This alerted me to the problem, which I will now try to define.

The primary problem with Wikipedia is that it is in fact written by everybody collectively, and, THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO PREVENT DRIFT TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. Expert level knowledge is irrelevant; because what goes into the article is what 10 uneducated people want in the article, not what is
True, important, or most useful or informative to the general public. This ends up meaning that if you are an expert on a topic and want to participate in Wikipedia, your
Real task is an uphill battle that may take months or years just over even a single Article.
This problem could be theoretically dealt with if there were lucid rules to deal with content disputes. However, Wikipedia offers exactly the opposite. If you are in a conflict on wikipedia, there is almost no recourse for you if the other person is both abusive, but clever enough not to violate only a very few insufficient rules. You can be attacked and maligned at any time, and there is no real recourse for you. There is a rule against personal attacks, but it is really only enforced on Wikipedia by admins using it for
Personal warfare purposes, and otherwise, you are more or less swimming alone.
Wikipedia is thus completely vulnerable to the Tyranny of the majority. Wikipedias articles in general character are very low in quality, and the reason for this is simple;
The people writing the articles are factually ignorant, and any interference from somebody who knows what they are talking about will only cause that person to get ganged up on and abused.

The next biggest problem on wikipedia is the way that it handles neutrality. Wikipedias definition of neutrality is that something is neutral if the “mainstream press” has said it.
The problem is that the mainstream press isn’t neutral, and the mainstream press is by vast majority republican owned and operated. This skews wikipedia badly towards the right, which doesn’t stop the left from being represented. Wikipedias policy is that articles should be written from a “neutral point of view”. This is called the NPOV
Policy. The problem with this policy and how it is actually applied in practice is that
In the first place, “neutrality” is never rationally defined. Neutrality doesn’t just consist of neutral language, and it doesn’t just consist of giving equal time to different sides of an argument. It also requires a real understanding of the difference between opinion and fact. There is no method for pointing out the difference between opinion and fact. 
On Wikipedia. Wikipedia side steps the issue by calling something a fact if somebody else said it. It requires only references, not a cogent evaluation of those references. References are only required to be mainstream, there are no criteria and there is no methodology for determining if a reference is itself biased. The result of this is that “neutrality” as such Becomes incredibly vague and hard to pin down, and, more importantly, “neutrality” As such is only what the local administrator says it is. These admins are not required to understand logic, aren’t required to know how to evaluate fact from opinion, and, aren’t even required to follow the rules set for mere editors. It is factually common practice for admins to verbally attack others, and there is no recourse for the abused.

	Wikipedia has thus become a battleground, not an encyclopedia. There are no real
Criteria set forth to limit persons from becoming admins, and so eventually, those who seek power for nefarious purposes, including Trolls, can become administrators on Wikipedia. Once a person is an admin, they are essentially above reproach. 
Confronting an admin over abuse is enough to get people banned. (Or blocked.) Wikipedia essentially has become nothing more than several different point of view camps, which war with each other in never ending battles to twist the truth and facts
Their way.  

	The proof that this is true is actually written all over Wikipedia. Any given exploration of a science topic will demonstrate quickly that the information presented is substandard and often not even factual, just well sourced. With a million articles, you would think that by now a single textbook worth of material on some topic or another
Would have been generated. Not so. Check out the “portals” on Wikipedia. “Portals”
Are ways of grouping articles together by subject. Any cursory examination of the portals
Shows that there wouldn’t be enough material out of any given portal to justify a whole
Textbook.  So what are 1 million articles covering? Everything you can think of, and mostly noise, nonsense, drivel, entertainment, Movies, Television, Games, Politics,
Biographies, and so forth. Wikipedias content is by vast majority “non-encyclopedic.”
If we define “encyclopedic” material as being that which would be found in some given textbook, or if we define an encyclopedia as a topic orientated textbook, Wikipedia is
Already a gross failure. 
	This proof is content driven, but there are more and better proofs that Wikipedia
Is a battleground of point of view warriors. Perhaps the best proof is Jimbos talk page.
Jimbo is the person who came up with the idea of Wikipedia, and he is the defacto
Dictator of Wikipedia. Jimbo is a pretty kewl dictator as far as such go, because he believes in consensus process. But the point is, if you read his talk page, every third entry
Or so is somebody making an appeal to him versus outlandish abuse. And he doesn’t answer these people, and the abuse goes on. At the top of Jimbos Talk page is a message saying to take such complaints to and Administrative page. Good luck. If your complaint for instance involves an admin, they might just delete the complaint and block you. If you are being personally attacked, the standard answer is to go “work it out yourself.” Of course, there are other methods to deal with problems on Wikipedia, and to be fair, we should discuss them. There is in fact an entire dispute resolution process. The first step is called a request for comment, or RFC. Here, you are invited to make a page, list your evidence, and make a complaint. The reality is that you are just drawing a big bull’s-eye across your forehead. It’s not against the rules for others to seek the help of all of their friends, and “consensus” process thus really amounts to nothing more than a popularity
Contest. If you are new to wikipedia, or an expert with less time to devote than the next
Whole month, you are pretty much out of luck. You’ll be crucified, happily, and if you get upset about it, and do anything other than allow yourself to become a good well behaved martyr, you are likely to get blocked or banned. After all of that trouble, and we will say a minimum of 5 days, an RFC must in theory be filed before any other complaints, but an RFC carries zero weight of authority. So if you are being abused, you just lost five days fighting where it doesn’t really matter,  and on top of it all you have been tricked into criticizing Wikipedia, and thus have become a defacto enemy and 
Scapegoat for Wikipedias pov warriors and ignorant admins. Now that things have escalated, you can start a new process that will last a minimum of five days, and which also carries zero actual weight of authority called mediation. Here, you are expected to compromise and give in and allow others to assault you, mischaracterize you, and insult
You, and further scapegoat you. There is no recourse here to logic or fair play, and despite rules that supposedly require civility, nobodies required to stay civil except you. Any admin can attack you, and, you simply are required to endure it. So now you have spent a minimum of ten days, nothing has changed, and nothing has been done about your complaint. Your article may have been nominated for deletion and been deleted by then, Before you even have a chance to seek genuine authority to resolve the dispute.

The next and last and final step, is called Arbitration. Unlike two prior steps, Arbitration actually has authority and weight to actually make people do things or face consequences. However, you should know that there are Arbiters who are pov warriors, and that the process only requires one arbiter to more or less act as facilitator. So if you are lucky, and you get an arbiter who favors you, you are in luck. But if not, you are basically in a court of law where the main judge is also the prosecution against you. You aren’t allowed to defend yourself versus the arbiter, nor to cross examine the arbiters case or logic. By now, the people you were in the conflict with have had at least 10 days to attack you, bait you, and abuse you. There is an evidence page where you get to make your case, but arbiters aren’t required to read it, and most don’t. Instead, the facilitating arbiter makes his or her case, and the other arbiters vote to agree with or disagree with the facilitating Arbiter. The page on which that happens you aren’t allowed to even make comment to.

So justice is elusive at best, and impossible at worst on Wikipedia. This creates a host of other systemic problems. It means that in the end, 99 percent of the participants put up or shut up, and learns to go along with the flow of apparent “consensus”. (Which is often generated by only a single admin.?) The idea here is that conflict takes time and process to resolve. The problem is, nobody in their right mind is going to put up with all of that. Wikipedia thus chases away anybody of decent or high caliber unless they are for whatever reason truly dedicated, and willing to spend hours and hours and hours being abused in order to accomplish writing a short article which will then probably degenerate into noise anyways.

	Wikipedias government is thus definable as a tyranny of the majority based in pack psychology and anarchy. Its claim to consensus process is totally illusory, in fact it practices a perfect example of the now well discredited Delphi process. It forces false consensus via threat, intimidation, and manipulation. 

Nowhere does this become more apparent than in trying to specifically bring these problems to the attention of Wikipedia. Like all bureaucratic monsters, Wikipedia isn’t
Really interested in criticism, and serious critics are punished by intimidation, threat,
Blocking, and banning. Standing up to an abusive admin is “asking to be banned.”
Standing up to wikipedia as a whole on account of this problem was a lesson is doublethink and pack psychology. Being blocked for defending somebody else against blatant admin abuse (and reckless flagrant disregard for the rules) demonstrated the simple truth. People are blocked or banned from wikipedia simply for the crime of standing up for their rights, or other people’s rights, or for demanding that the rules be followed. The rules are followed selectively and at the convenience of the admins. Personal attacks are the modus operandi of admins, Votes for deletion, and even arbiters.
Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia; it’s a political battleground, a war zone of ideologies,
Complete with total blatant and flagrant corruption.

Now, having made my case against Wikipedia, the next question is why bring this up
With you? The answer of course is that I am interested in collaboration of the type that Wikipedia promises but cannot hope to deliver. For over 15 years, my goal has been to
Write Textbooks or Tomes on those subjects which are most contended over, and to use truth and knowledge and logic and reason and fact to facilitate real change and evolution
In our society towards the better. Specifically, I am interested in getting together with others and building a knowledge base prequel to writing textbook tomes on the following subjects. Ethics, Psychology, Sociology, Metaphysics, Philosophy, World Religions, Politics, Psychonautics, Permaculture, Arcologies, Architecture, Space Exploration and Colonization, Physics, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Herbology, Botany, Aerodynamics,
Computer Sciences, Robotics, Alternative energy,

Certain topics seem to generate unusual problems.  Try to say something bad about Uncle Joe

Think of the 3 names associated with the largest number of killings in the 20th century.
* One has a last name starting with &quot;H&quot;
* One has a name starting with an &quot;M&quot; (for Chinese names, Last / First may confuse some)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Spanish}}
To study '''Spanish''' or any non-native language you should determine your goals. Many people study a language in school to fulfill a requirement. Others do it generally as a &quot;broadening&quot; experience. Still others do it so that they can speak with others in their own language. 

===Number one tip: study every day===
To speak any language fluently and be able to survive in the language among native speakers, it is probably necessary to immerse yourself in the language for an extended period such as 9 months to a year. Short of that it is best to study intensively every day for an extended period. '''Studying every day''' is much more effective than studying every other day. Studying only once a week is a sure way to forget everything by the end of the week and be eternally relearning the same little bit of vocabulary. The problem is that your mind will forget much of what you learn in the course of one day and by the end of two days it is even more. If you study every day, even for a little while, it will mean that you can focus more of your time learning new material and waste less time relearning old material. This is one of the secrets to learning a language: study it every day.

Tip for studying new words: Have your own vocabulary. It can be some note, every page is e.g. 10 words. And every day study 10 new words, 10 words from the yesterday, 10 words from the day before yesterday, 10 words from the week before, 10 from 2 week before, 10 from 3 week before and 10 from 4 week before. It's overall 70 words. It want about half or 1 hour studying. 10 new words want more time than then repeat 60 others and you have confidence that you will know for a long time.

Spaced learning software such as [http://anki.ichi2.net/ anki] does a similar thing by scheduling reviews depending on how well you do.

===Using web resources===
Learning via the web offers a lot of benefits that a standard textbook can not provide. One example are audio files which we already include in some of our lessons. Another benefit are online dictionaries that allow you to quickly look up vocabulary. Check out our [[Spanish/Web Resources| Web Resources]] page to find out more.

===Using media resources===
Once you have learned the basics of Spanish, try reading or viewing material in spanish.  A newspaper, a magazine or a children's book is a great place to start.  Online retailers, such as Amazon.com[http://www.amazon.com], have international storefronts that sell books in foreign languages.

Watching Spanish television or Spanish movies will help you practice listening.  Playing your favorite DVD or television show with Spanish close captioning on or with the Spanish soundtrack will help you learn new vocabulary and will assist in putting items into context.

Areas where a significant number of people speak Spanish should have reading material available at local supermarkets and bookstores, and may have some local television or radio stations in Spanish.  If you cannot find Spanish media where you live, the Internet has online editions of many Spanish newspapers and magazines available.

Keep a dictionary nearby if you have trouble with unfamiliar vocabulary.  The dictionary can be a very effective study tool.  Each time you look up a new word, place a dot or symbol near the word.  If you forget a word and need to look it up again, add another dot near the word.  Pretty soon, you will have a collection of words with two, three and four dots.  This marking system helps you figure out which words are either important to remember (because you use them frequently) or which ones are difficult to remember.  During your vocabulary review, you can flip through your dictionary and find important words to practice.

Regular use of a dictionary has the added benefit of putting things into context.  Many dictionaries have tidbits and trivia added to the definitions, to help you see how components of language fit together.  

In addition, every time you open your dictionary, you will see other Spanish words, while searching for your target word and this has the effect of reminding you of other words.

===Use it===
The best way to learn Spanish is by using it with other speakers. Do not be discouraged by your bad accent and choppy flow; these are things that come with being a beginner. People will understand that you are learning and will appreciate you applying the skills that you have acquired. So go ahead—say something. Ask your neighbor &quot;¿Dónde está el baño?&quot; 

Look around your local community. Often times coffee shops, libraries, or other local organization sponsor a &quot;Spanish club&quot; for adults.  Both native and non-native speakers attend.  This is a great way to use Spanish by speaking with others (especially native speakers).

Another great way to practice your new language skills is to travel to the country where the language is spoken. Most major cities in Spanish speaking countries host a number of Spanish language schools for foreigners.  These schools offer language classes at all levels by hour, week, or month of classes.  Also, they normally will arrange for their students to live with a local host family, which provides another source for practicing the Spanish language with native speakers.

===Link for Inclusion===
There's this really incredible website for learning Spanish called [http://www.onlinespanishhelp.com Online Spanish Help] that I think should be included in the list of link. It has games and audio pronunciations. It's the best site I've seen out there. [[User:adjwilli|adjwilli]]

===Worlds foremost Spanish textbook in the making===
Dudes, you realize that this is going to become the most used Spanish textbook for English speakers out there ? This thing is going to put the traditional Spanish textbooks out of business one by one. It can continue to grow and reflect real Spanish use, and uploading the sound files is something that a printed book cannot have. This is SO COOL ! I am confident that we are making history.

===Sound file format: MP3 vs Ogg ===
Oh yeah, one question: does anyone out there know what would be the best format for sound files ? I was just lucky that I had a de-zipper on my machine to unzip the Spanish ones. Is there an open standard format ? A most common, non-M$ one (is Quicktime any better ?) --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 14:23 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Karl, what about MP3? That sounds ;-) ok for me.. and I have heard that is popular..
I am not sure about the MP3 licence but probably there are not problems with that. In other hand is a very useful format for learning a language. You can download the file, load it in you MP3 reader and listening the lesson in the undergroung, travelling to work.
[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 17:27 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Huh .. MP3 ... sounds great to me, lets see if anyone has any objections to it. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::Not really my objection but I hear ogg format is recommended within Wikipedia. [[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]]

::Ogg ? I am not familiar with it. Is it compatible with &quot;everything&quot; like MP3 ? [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:::All modern MP3 playing software on computers should play ogg just fine. If you have an older player then you might need to install a plugin. MP3 is evil and should be avoided. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

:::Ah. &quot;Evil&quot;. [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::::uuuhh.. &quot;Evil&quot;..  Evil like.. I don't know.. M$? really? so bad?. Maybe the '''soft''' MP3 play ogg but.. what about the '''hard''' MP3 players? I have a new one! But is ok. If it is evil there is nothing to do. [[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]]

:::::&amp;lt;sarcasm&gt;You're right. It will be horrible that people can't take the speech examples in Spanish onto their non-ogg compatable MP3 players. Such a shame.&amp;lt;/sarcasm&gt; [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 14:59, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)

::::Yes - Evil. The owners of the MP3 patents have been trying to force websites that stream or otherwise host MP3 files to pay the patent owners thousands of dollars per website and on top of that a per download charge. Ogg, however, is free and will always be free. We should be supporting free software and free file formats over proprietary software and formats whenever practically possible. Ogg is such a format. --mav

::::Paying thousands of dollars for licensing ? That does sound pretty evil. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

: ogg is the best choice as the format &amp; codec are patent free. Maybe we should make a special [[ogg]] page talking about the format and how to read it on different computers (mac / win32 / linux ...). There could be a guide about converting the ogg encoded sound to other codec for hard mp3 players (ogg to wav then reencode for example).
[[User:Hashar|Hashar]] 02:14, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)

[[w:Speex]] could also be interesting, since it is a codec especially for speech. The project is part of the Xiph foundation, and it is completely ridden of patents and nasty licensing issues. Since it is geared towards speech, it can result in much smaller files, which is nice for people with expensive slow connection or for PDA usage. [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 23:41, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Here is a revolutionary idea: hows about every soundbite being offered in mp3 (cause everything can read it) and speex (cause it is a freely avaliable, well thought out format, which is quickly becoming the standard for VoIP among other things)
btw, ogg is a whole group of different formats (all of which are open-source) and of which speex is but one format (specifcally designed for voice recording). [[wikipedia:User:the_bellman|the bellman]]
----
It seems like common sense to me to just use WAV format.  It's not like a sentence of speech is going to be that big anyway.
: It would be big for me, with my extremely slow internet. I'd very much prefer the files to be as small as possible -- it might be the difference between me having to wait for a few seconds versus not having to wait at all. And when you add up thousands of downloads from all the different people using the wikibook, then it adds unnecessary network and server load for Wikimedia foundation.

===Project name, indices, non-zipped sound files===
* I think that the title &quot;Spanish&quot; is too general. Foreign language textbooks usually are aimed at learners at some level
* it would be nice to have grammatical and themed indices.  I was thinking that we should add the name &quot;castellano&quot; because that is the correct name for the Spanish being taught.
* wouldn't it be better to provide both zipped and directly playable sound samples ?

:*I guess that more advanced learners can easily click through the first lessons.
:*Could be nice, but maybe it's better to have an overview of the entire grammatic and provide links to lessons.
:*Zipping already (lossly) compressed soundfiles doesn't (and shouldn't..) result in much smaller files. It only makes it less convenient to play the files. But it could be nice to provide different qualities, or Ogg and Speex files of the same audio. [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 23:48, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:For your first point, the name, I think it is implied (if nothing is stated) that it is for beginners. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 14:59, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Hi there, Native Spanish speaker over here. Just went to the German wikibook and looks superb. In my humble opinion, there are a number of thing that could be copied from that one. For example... the should be a cover. My personal sugestion for it would be the cover of the &quot;Don Quijote&quot; (400 years of its publication on 2005 I believe). The level divition also helps, and the more the better. Its always more fun to thing that something has been achieved like the first level out of x, than just 3 chapters. Anyway... Ill contribute to the Spanish one as much as i can. (have to find my login and password which at the moment dont remember them) Cheers.

===Two comments: 1. this is great, 2. wheres the alphabet ?===

#This is unbelievable.  I am so happy to see this project.  I would love to see you language-learning become a subject for a &quot;free&quot; textbook.  I'm so impressed to hear the ogg examples.  Eventually, of course, it would be neat if you all had a bunch of different speakers from different spanish-speaking countries, so students don't become overly familiar with one accent.
#Shouldn't lesson 1 include the alphabet and how to pronounce the letters?  I would think this is the most important lesson.

--[[w:user:DanKeshet|Dan Keshet]]

I agree, pronounciation is important and should be covered very early on. I'll ask my friend Mariela if she can also give a sound recording of the alphabet (of course others are encouraged to do a recording as well, so that we have a lot of variety). [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]]

I disagree, lessons on pronunciation are boring.  The pronunciation of spanish is so easy learners can pick it up on their own. -DM

===Ideas for new chapters===
'''Fun, social things'''
*Parties
*The beach
*Dates
*At a bar
*Salsa dancing, La Bamba, la discoteca (anthro)

'''Topics common to richer/more developed cultures'''
*At the office
*At school
*Transportation, airport, el metro, taxis ..
*On the phone
*buying a car
*business trip, tourist trips
*food shopping
*in the kitchen
*Beauty, barber shop
*el gimnasio-the gymnasium
*el cine (movies)
*weddings (la boda)
*Technology
*restaurants
*boating
*soccer, sports

'''Things relatively unique in Latino culture'''
*feelings toward the US
* el quinceanero (Sweet Fifteenth Birthday)
*Catholic Mass
*deadbeat dads from the Spaniards to today
*emotions
*families
*at home
*poverty, Street beggars
*el tianguis
*crime
*spanish-speaking communities in the US
*discussion of various cultural spots in Latin America
*restaraunts, taco stands
*paracaidistas
*historical events in LatAm history such as the killings in Mexico in '68
*Historical figures like Che Gueverra, Selena, Pedro Infante, Cantinflas, Fidel Castro, Picasso, la dictablanda, Cortez, los Mayas, Cristobal Colon ... Don Quijote ..
*Street vendors
*etc etc ...

Hope this helps! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

===Comments about the structure of the lessons===

Please, see this comment like a mindstorm comment (Its possible that it doesnt make too much sense).. I would like to know what you (all) think about


I think that a lesson should contain only the matter for one period of study (one hour?, half hour?). There is not reason for limit the number of lessons in a textbook, so, what is a lesson if not a period of study?
Maybe in others subjects of study you can split it by concepts but I think that, in languages, would be useful a one-day separation.
It seems that for a basic language capabilities you need to know 2000 (more or less) words. 2000/365 = 5,4 words. If you can learn a few of grammar and 5,4 words every day, theorically you can write and read a language in a year (listening and speak is another thing). It seems a good mark to me for only 1 or 1/2 hour day. So, maybe, a lesson should be a few of vocabulary, a concept of grammar and a lot of exercices. Obviously, everybody could advance with the speed that he/she need or want.

Sorry by my english, I am learning..

[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 22:36, 17 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Hi, I think you are right with your point that we need a lot of exercises
which only cover a small amount of material (for example a maximum of
10 new words or a single grammar concept). So we should definitely try
to put an exercise right after new vocabulary/grammar concepts are
presented. This way we can even keep the longer - theme oriented - lessons
together as a whole (doing one 'lesson' would then maybe require four or five
1/2 hour learning sessions, but as long as each learning session has
its own exercise part this should be OK). In either case, I think we
should start now to put in some exercises for the lessons 1-3 where we
already have enough material to construct useful exercises. 
-- [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]
===Formatting ===
I think its a good idea to put everything in Spanish first and then English. This translation helps people see the similarities and differences between Spanish and English. 

I also removed some repetitive words like &quot;Lesson&quot; and &quot;Lección&quot; because I think it makes the page simpler and less work to read.

Also I moved the (very cool) flags to the bottom of the page so that people see content first. I'm not sure which way I like it, maybe its better with the flags up top like the were. 

Please feel free to undo any changes you hate ;-) -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
--------------------
About the exercices format:

What should be the exercices format? I propose using a different page for every exercices lesson and another one for the solutions. That would be 3 pages for lesson. It has a few advantages. A student could print the exercices, work in that in paper if she want, and check the solutions when he/she has finished. In this way, the lesson wouldn't be so big and we could enlarge the exercicies without limit.

Another question is.. should be write the exercices like the exercicies in a traditional book?

for instance:

Translate:

house     ______________

what do you think about?


[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 20:44, 25 Aug 2003 (UTC)
-------------------------------
Thanks for bringing that up. We should be starting to work on exercises as soon as possible. I agree that we should have exercises separate from the main 
lessons (in fact, as our lessons are quite long, there should be one exercise 
sheet for every 1/2 hour study part of a lesson). I think the solutions can be 
writtem far more compact (by writing only the missing words or correct answers 
for multiple choice). So we probably won't need one page for each exercise but 
just one solution sheet for all exercises (or all exercises of one lesson).

In my opinion we should also try to emphasize collaborative learning in the 
exercises. So maybe we don't even want to give solutions to each exercise but 
rather leave some of them open so that students and teachers have to come 
together to discuss exercises. More importantly I would like to see a lot of 
exercises that can be done only with partners or in a group. For these exercises we will definitely need to use (voice!) chat. Even though the development of Wiki tools for realtime interaction are discussed as part of the 'Wikiversity' project it will probably take a while until they become available. So to get started with that (which will hopefully be soon) we should just go with available chat tools like irc,icq,aim,yahoo,...) -- [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

:No, I think people should still be able to learn spanish by themselves with this book. I think we should have a subpage for group resources, if anyone wants to do that, but it shouldn't make it so that people feel like they have to have a teacher to use the textbook. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 14:59, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)
-------------------------------


Hi guys.  I'm new to wiki, but actually I was thinking about starting a similar project to this one for a while.  I'm using javascript to allow you to test yourself by hiding either the English or Spanish half of the vocab list, click to reveal, shuffle, there are two stylesheets to make the printed version good for paper, readings are similar to vocab in that you can click to reveal translations, and the content is in XML and parsed to html (or latex) which should make the content useful for people wanting to parse it to other formats.  Take a look and let me know if there is any interest in seeing this done.  [[http://www.apmaths.uwo.ca/~bfraser/test/test.html It's all here.]]  Click on the reading, click on Practice: Recognition and then words in the vocab list.  Print preview should be formatted for printing.

[[User:crail|crail]]

=== New format looks fine to me ===

Hello,

I really like the work of Karl and others to put all the headers
first in Spanish and then in English. Omitting the 'Lesson' word
for all the lessons is definitely reasonable. For where to place
the flags I'm not sure either. I think it would be cool if we
eventually come up with a cool title plus a nice picture for our book
to put it at the very start of the page. This could be the
combination 'Aqui se habla espanol' (title) &amp; flags (picture)
but maybe we can come up with something more creative ;)

[[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

P.S. I've been away on a conference most of last week, this week I'll
have much more time to work on the Wikibook...

=== Help ===
Hi, I was wondering if some people here are more familiar with Spanish than I am
&amp; are willing to look at some of the lessons we have so far and correct the mistakes
that are in there. As the lessons get more advanced I try to make more elaborate
examples, but since I'm just learning Spanish I'm not so sure if they are all
grammatically correct / stylistically good. So if anyone wants to help out on this
issue I would really appreciate it! -- [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]] -- UTC 05:55 Wednesday, October 15, 2003

:I just downloaded all the lessons and I'm going to check them, but I won't be able to correct them for a while (dial-up connection, expensive telephone bills in the third world). Also I could contribute with some sound files with Guatemalan accent, just tell me what should I record.

(update) I just checked them. Look at the comments [[OASOs comments|here]]

=== Colored Tables ===
Following the good examples in other Wikibooks, I've starting to put in colored tables. I suggest the following colorcode: yellow for pure vocabulary (single words), blue for grammar tables (e.g. conjugations), and green for examples  
(whole sentences in dialogs, or sentences illustrating grammar rules). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]
:I was just going to suggest the same thing, but with different colors. Current colors look too strong. I think it's better to use pastel colors, like the Wikipedia's front page. If you were wondering, I was going to suggest pale blue for vocabulary, pink for grammar, pale yellow for examples, and gray for exercises.
:[[User:Oaso|Oaso]] 15:49, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)

==Grammar==

We ''ought'' to have a ''lot'' more grammar here! Gender! Agreement! Articles! Demonstrative adjectives! Prepositions! '''''Verbs!!!''''' The best way to learn Spanish is to learn the ''rules'', so that you can create just about every sentence in existence. These situation-oriented lessons only allow you to say things appropriate for...well, that situation. If we were to exclusively use that approach, we would have to have an exhaustive list of situations, which would blow up the wiki server. If you learn grammar, you can interact in ''any'' situation. --Grammar bug

:Yeah, thats a good point. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:Hi, I stumbled on this project. It's very interesting. I noticed you have past participle in Lesson 9, but kept the present progressive until Lesson 10. The way I learned Spanish, progressive was the first tense learned after present indicative. It's a simple way to vastly increase the number of phrases you can create, and I would suggest addressing it earlier.
::What you say makes sense .. if you could play around and try to make the changes yourself that would be very helpful. Let me know if I can be of any help to you - [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----

When learning Spanish I tried a lot of books and courses. The only thing that clicked with me was Madrigal's Magic Key, which is a very old text book, but teaches the language by rules and shortcut aids to memory. In fact it teaches grammar, but in a very palatable way.

I find all these &quot;how to order a meal&quot; type lessons OK, and superficially appealing but will never move the learner past the phrasebook stage, and ultimatly they will lose interest, this is not the way to master a language.

Once you have the grammar of Spanish, all the rest is plain sailing, you just have to practice and add to your vocabulary.

I don't have a user name, but I hope this comment helps. I'll look in here from time to time and see if there's anything I can add, but if it does develop into a phrasebook, then I don't think there's much I would contibute.

It would also be helpful to decide how to handle the question of which version of Spanish will be taught. Castillian is the standard, but Latin American is of equal importance. Maybe some method of highlighting the Latin American differences by color code, or a sidebar of important deviations by country would allow the book to be more useful. The alternative would be to create a Castillian main book with a Latin American appendix.

== Wiktionary ==

Could this be in some way related to [[Wiktionary]] ? (Or, maybe it is, but I haven't noticed).

I'm thinking about something like a bilingual dictionary for language learning. The contents itself would probably look more like that of a textbook than that of a dictionary, but the purpose is to have the dictionary browseable / referenceable format.

I'm trying to put similar ideas together at [[meta:Wiki Language School]] [[User:Flammifer|Flammifer]] 19:27, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Standards ==

I think in the long term intrest of this book, we should all consider starting the plans for restructuring this book so it conforms to textbook standards in a Spanish I, II, III, IV format. I know that currently, this will probably be quite unpopular, but in the long term intrest, we should at least consider it, maybe even splitting the book, one for serious education and study, and one for conversational situation reference. I'm just saying we should consider it. That's all.

== New design proposal ==

Could you look at [[:pl:Hiszpański: Lekcja A1]] and [[:pl:Hiszpański]]? Here you can see the proposal of new design for this Wikibook. [[User:Sblive|Sblive]] 19:16, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Helping...==

I'm Spanish but I find it difficult to help in this book. Make a clearer index or a page with things to do. About a wictionary: I think we should have ONE page for all languages. There you could see the word and then translations to all languages with definitions in that language. You could use any language to sort words alphabetically. Please ask for it in meta or in wikipedia!!! Or let's do one book here. I'm Barcelona in catalana wikipedia if you want to talk to me: http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuari_Discussi%C3%B3:Barcelona

:I'd love to help as well (don't even have a user name yet), but it really seems difficult, besides I'm from Argentina and lots of the lenguage used sounds weird, different latin american countrys have different vocabulary, specially Argentina (and Uruguay I think) were verbs are even conjugated differently. Some examples would be &quot;vos&quot; used instead of &quot;tú&quot;, and others like &quot;Sos de México&quot; instead of &quot;Eres de México&quot;. Skimming through the pages I've seen many references to Mexico (&quot;You are from Mexico&quot;), so I guess the idea is to mainly use vocabulary from Mexico (that is the spanish that people from the US is more familiar with), is there a standard way to add words used in other countries with a note clarifying it, or it would be too complex and confusing? [[User:200.89.153.204|200.89.153.204]] 6 July 2005 13:46 (UTC)

::You can always make some additional pages (or another course within this textbook) about Spanish used in south America. That would be great! [[User:Sblive|Sblive]] 13:32, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

== Mouth Mechanics  ==

I would like to request a section on the mechanics involved in speaking another language.  I couldn't nail spanish R's correctly until I did a lot of digging.  English produces an &quot;r&quot; without the tongue touching any part of the mouth, like a vowel.  The spanish R is pronounced behind the upper teeth.  Most try to approximate this by telling one to pronounce it something akin to TH.  I am not an expert in the subject, and don't even know Spanish, so I can only ask for at least some links.

Like &quot;TH&quot;?!?  I've always heard it described as &quot;rolling&quot; the R. I beleive one rapidly moves the tongue behind the upper teeth. Its easy to overdo, but when starting to learn its probably OK to &quot;roll&quot; the R's in an exagerated way. If unable to do so, I would think a &quot;T&quot; or &quot;D&quot; sound might be better than &quot;TH,&quot; which seems more likely to lead to nasty tongue injuries than anything else.

There is some information here:
http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonetics/
The stated use is for:
It is intended for students of phonetics, linguistics, and foreign language.
Maybe he would like to donate it to GFDL and we could hack it up?
Although they do not follow words or letter they only give the phonetic alphabet.

== Opening Paragraph ==

I'm reading this to learn Spanish, I don't have enough ability to actually contribute to the book in any substantial way.  However, I found this initial paragraph absolutely baffling, enough to make me wonder whether I should even bother reading further in the book:

''The fundamental norm of Spanish grammar is the sentence, structured as follows:''

''Subject - Verb - Object''

''This is so until the point that, in technical Spanish, you can consider an equivalence between the concept 'Grammar' and the concept of 'a sentence arranged according to the rule Subject-Verb-Object'. At this level, paragraphs, articles, and other sorts of grammatical groups are not considered. So, at this level, Spanish is an impossible language, because if it existed according to its theoretical definition, that is, if Spanish were used correctly according to its technical standard, then all the words from the Spanish dictionary would have been used just for an only eternal sentence, valid for past, present and future. Maybe this sentence is still to come, but, meanwhile, normal Spanish conversations are constituted by groups of sentences.''

Unless somebody can seriously rework and explain what is trying to be expressed here, i'd just as soon see this paragraph removed.  The fact that we go Subject Verb Object is enough for me.  Doesn't need much explanation, since that is a typical pattern in English, and this book is written in English and therefore assumes English knowledge.

Yikes. That certainly is a difficult paragraph. I have no idea what it's  trying to say. I think that whole section needs to be reworked. I'll get on it. [[User:Fenoxielo|Fenoxielo]] 03:52, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

Those paragraphs on grammar need to be moved off the main page. They don't look right sitting in the middle of what is essentially the contents. Any suggestions on where to stick it? Perhaps delete it from the main page and paste it in here until it gets a home? --[[User:Zapateria|Zapateria]] 09:39, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

== Cover and Contents ==

Does anyone think that we should change the cover title from &quot;[[Spanish (Cover)]]&quot; to just &quot;Spanish&quot; and change &quot;[[Spanish]]&quot; to &quot;Spanish:Contents&quot;?  This will make it more in-line with other language textbooks. [[User:Geoking66|Geoking66]] 22:46, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

== Former Page Spanish: Contents ==

The titles in the &quot;Lecciones&quot; list do not match the content of the lessons. E.g. the second title, &quot;El viajar&quot;, takes me to grammar of the noun... [[User:18.19.0.183|18.19.0.183]] 19:47, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Originally, the lessons consisted mainly of vocabulary (you will find that lesson 2 has a part for vocabulary that you need for travelling). We started adding grammar topics later and they are harder to put under a specific title. If we find better titles for the lessons we can certainly change them. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

I changed it to &quot;De viaje&quot; because it sounds much better. Maybe it should be noted that verbs may work as masculine nouns, but certainly &quot;El viajar&quot; sounds too strange. [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 12:08, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)

===Incorporating verb tenses into the lessons===
As I research the language I realize that Spanish has fourteen [[Verbs (Spanish)|verb]] [[Verb tenses (Spanish)|tenses]], seven simple and seven compound, as well as a couple extras. We could use that information to work new tenses into the lessons systematically. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

=== Sound file format ===
Now I just had a teacher trying to use the site and he could not use the sound files because his hardware was not compatible with the sound file format that we are using. Would it be so wrong to offer the files in one &quot;free&quot; format and one proprietary one ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

== Naming policy ==

The Spanish book is now 100% naming policy compliant. Check http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=Spanish&amp;namespace=0. All left non compliant pages are redirects. I also replaced most of all links to these redirect pages. [[User:E^(nix)|E^(nix)]] 10:01, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

== Lesson Setup ==

I really think the lessons need to be setup in a different way. As it is you get tons of words at once with little to no practice. If there were large chapters broken up into smaller sections with an excercise at the end of each it wouldn't be so overwhelming. For example, the first chapter after doing the alphabet and pronunciations could be over Introductions. It would teach people how to say hello, nice to meet you, and my name is xyz in the first part with an excercise at the end. The next part could be over saying your age and numbers. After that could be a few adjectives and a lesson on noun-adjective agreement. I would be willing to reorganize the current lessons or start a string of alternative lessons if people like this idea, but I don't want to do it if people won't like it. It's just that I think it's quite overwhelming as it is.--[[User:Leostrife|Leostrife]] 21:19, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

== suggestions==
This is a wiki, it can be non-linear learning (sorry if I make mistakes, I'm Spanish speaker): suggest projects and exercise to USE language. Show words in use, link to images, texts and dialogues. Words couls also be linked to wiktionary for definitions and so on, so translations are not needed here (they always depends on the context). I 'll explain it better:

Imagine we are talking about food (in lesson 6). We can open the section with some pictures to match eith words instead of boring lists. Users can also click on words so they see the defintion in wiktionary. When exercise is finished, they have the basic vocabluary to start using it. They can read some dialogues: &quot;in the shop&quot;, &quot;in the restaurant&quot; while they listen to them. Then they will be asked to complete a multuser dialogue. For example, there's a discussion between 2 people arguing about 2 different cooks. Each user adds a line or corrects mistakes, or ask for help in wikiversity page. Because the main point of a wiki is to edit it!.

== Pronouns missing? ==

I couldn't find anything in here so far about pronouns.  The section on regular verb conjugation would be a good place to mention them.  Also, some places that describe conjugations have 2 column tables where the first column in &quot;Ingles&quot; and lists only the English pronoun, and the second column is &quot;Espanol&quot; and lists only the conjugated Spanish verb.  I think that instead of showing &quot;I&quot; &quot;Soy&quot; it would be better to show &quot;I am&quot; &quot;(Yo) soy&quot;.

Why does this book link to the English Wikipedia article about the language, but doesn't link to the English Wiktionary ''Category:Spanish language'', which includes a huge Spanish vocabulary defined in English, as well as appendices on conjugation and other tools?

===Agree===
I want to thank all the contributors of this Wikibook. On 2008 I dived in for my first Spanish class. Our professor was from Madrid and it intimidated me greatly, as she expected us answer her in her language all the time. And then there was this Wikibook. I remember I would get up early every morning to diligently study as much as I could, memorize words, practice verbs. This book helped me immensely as though it were the only book that mattered, largely because it was the only book I could read simply by being connected to the Internet, and could be accessed at any time of the day. This went hand-in-hand with Wiktionary, being the only multilingual dictionary (a mighty vast one too) I could browse through the net. I started editing there too, adding words and learning about others, and it made me realize I liked this: writing, words, languages. This has made a lasting influence on me. 

The Spanish language also gave me an opportunity to form relationships with awesome Spanish-speaking people who have touched my life forever, like with the professor I mentioned. This is another story, but my point is that ''it all started here''. This Wikibook had been a catalyst. Changes in life from an online project pitched in upon by people I may never meet! Now learning languages is still an enjoyable hobby for me. And you know what? Despite not studying Linguistics full-on, Wikibooks on many other subjects still help me today. 

So, thank you. The gratitude goes deeper than words can express. --[[User:Icqgirl|Icqgirl]] ([[User talk:Icqgirl|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Icqgirl|contribs]]) 13:57, 28 April 2011 (UTC)

== How old is the PDF file? ==

I was pretty disappointed to find that in the PDF file of the Spanish Wikibook, it has the following answers for the first exercise in the first lesson:

What greeting would you use...
# At 8:00pm?
# At 10:00am?
# At 3:00pm?
# When you're going to bed?

Answers:

# Buenas tardes
# Buenas mañanas
# Buenos días
# Buenas noches

Buenas mañanas? Really? And buenos días for 3 PM? I don't really know what else to say. It's a shame because the PDF version is beautifully done and one of the best-formatted free resources available. Is it known when the PDF version will be updated to match the online/live version? I also just noticed that the link to the live version for lesson 1 in the PDF is broken.

What about the printable version? Is it the same text as the online version? I don't know if it takes that version and makes it ready for printing or if it's a separate file like the PDF.

== Grammar - Questions ==

Unlike English, yes/no questions in Spanish are not usually formed by switching
the position of subject and verb (if the subject is explicit). To recognize a sentence as affirmative or as a question one must pay attention to the intonation pattern. Unlike English, Spanish uses a reversed question mark ('''¿''') at the beginning of a question:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|Tú eres de México.
|''You are from Mexico.''
|-
|Eres de México.
|''You are from Mexico.''
|}
become

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|¿Tú eres de México?
|''Are you from Mexico?''
|-
|¿Eres de México?''
|''Are you from Mexico?''
|}

For other type of questions Spanish uses the following question words (note that all of them have an accent in the word):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
| ¿Cómo...? or ¿Qué...? || ''How...?'' or ''What...?''	
|-
| ¿Cuándo...? || ''When...?''		
|-
| ¿Cuánto...? || ''How much...?''	
|-
| ¿Cuántos...? || ''How many...?''	
|-
| ¿Dónde...? || ''Where...?''		
|-
| ¿Por qué...? || ''Why...?''		
|-
| ¿Quién...? || ''Who...? (singular)''	
|-
| ¿Quiénes...? || ''Who...? (plural)''	
|}

Here are some Spanish sentences where specific question words are used:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| ¿Cómo te llamas?
| ''What is your name?'' (Literally: ''How do you call yourself?)
|-
| ¿Cuántos años tienes?
| ''How old are you?'' (Literally: ''How many years do you have?'')
|-
| ¿Dónde está el aeropuerto? || ''Where is the airport?''
|}

Questions can also be posed within a sentence:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&quot;
|-
| Y tú, ¿cuántos años tienes?
| ''How old are you?'' (Literally: ''And you, how many years do you have?'')
|-
| Entonces, ¿por qué no puedo jugar con él?
| ''So, why can't I play with him?''
|}

== Grammar - Possessive Adjectives ==

Like English, the Spanish possessive adjectives differ depending on the person they are referring to. Unlike English, the possessive article also changes depending on the number of items that one possesses (for example: '''mi libro''' = ''my book'', '''mis libros''' = ''my books''). It can also change depending on the gender of the item (for example: '''nuestro perro''' = ''our dog'', '''nuestra casa''' = ''our house''').
The following table summarizes all Spanish possessive adjectives:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! Person  
! Singular  
! Plural  
! &lt;i&gt;English	&lt;/i&gt;
!
Examples
|-
| yo || mi           || mis          
| &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt; ||
mi lápiz
|-
| tú || tu           || tus          
| &lt;i&gt;your	&lt;/i&gt; ||
tu lápiz
|-
| él || su, de él || sus           || &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de él
|-
| ella || su, de ella || sus, de ella || &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de ella
|-
| usted || su, de usted || sus, de usted
| &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de usted
|-
| nosotros/nosotras || nuestro, nuestra, de nosotros  
|
nuestros, nuestras
| &lt;i&gt;our &lt;/i&gt; || nuestro lápiz, el lápiz de
nosotros
|-
| vosotros/vosotras || vuestro, vuestra
| vuestros, vuestras || &lt;i&gt;your	&lt;/i&gt; ||
vuestro lápiz
|-
| ellos || su, de ellos || sus, de ellos
| &lt;i&gt;their	&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de ellos
|-
| ellas || su, de ellas || sus, de ellas
| &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de ellas
|-
| ustedes || su, de ustedes || sus, de ustedes
| &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de ustedes
|}

*Possessive Pronouns are &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; used when talking about body parts:&lt;br&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| mi nariz (la nariz de él) || my nose (his nose)
|-
| mi dedo (el dedo de él) || my finger (his finger)
|-
| mis manos (las manos de él) || my hands (his hands)
|-
| mis ojos (los ojos de él) || my eyes (his eyes)
|}

== Grammar - Comparisons ==

=== Equality ===

Spanish uses three slightly different constructions for comparisons of equality. One for comparing verbs,
one for comparing nouns and one for comparing adjectives/adverbs. The following examples
show the three different possibilities:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| Alberto estudia '''tanto como''' Felicitas.
| ''Alberto studies as much as Felicitas.''
|-
| Yo tengo '''tanto''' dinero '''como''' mi hermano.
| ''I have as much money as my brother.''
|-
| La estudiante es '''tan''' inteligente '''como''' el profesor.
| ''The student is as intelligent as the teacher.
|}

When comparing nouns, the ending of '''tanto''' will be modified to '''tanta''', '''tantos''',
or '''tantas''' in order to match gender and quantity of the noun. The general pattern for comparisons
of equality is the following:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| {verb} '''tanto como'''  
| {verb} ''as much as''  
|-
| '''tanto/a/os/as''' {noun} '''como''' 
| ''as much/as many'' {noun} ''as''
|-
| '''tan''' {adjective/adverb} '''como'''
| ''as'' {adjective/adverb} ''as''
|}

=== Inequality ===

For comparisons of inequality, Spanish uses the same form for both nouns and adjectives/adverbs. There
are two types of inequalities: '''más ... que''' (''more than'') and '''menos ... que''' (''less than''):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| Trabajo '''más''' horas '''que''' tú. 
| ''I work more hours than you.''
|-
| Trabajo '''menos''' horas '''que''' tú.
| ''I work less hours than you.''
|-
| Tom Hanks es '''más''' famoso '''que''' Patrick Stewart.
| ''Tom Hanks is more famous than Patrick Stewart.''
|-
| Patrick Stewart es '''menos''' famoso '''que''' Tom Hanks.
| ''Patrick Stewart is less famous than Tom Hanks.''
|}

In general:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| '''más/menos''' {noun/adjective/adverb} '''que'''
| ''more/less'' {noun/adjective/adverb} ''than''
|}

=== Superlatives ===

Superlatives in Spanish are similar to comparisons of inequality: They use '''más''' for ''the most'',
'''menos''' for ''the least''. Then follows the adjective and finally there is a preposition ('''de'''):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| Ricardo es el estudiante '''más''' alto '''de''' la universidad.
| ''Ricardo is the tallest student in the university.''
|-
| Plutón es el planeta '''más''' pequeño '''del''' sistema solar.
| ''Pluto is the smallest planet in the solar system.''
|-
| Los diamantes son las gemas '''más''' caras '''del''' mundo.
| ''Diamonds are the most expensive gems in the world.''
|-
| María es la '''más''' inteligente '''de''' la clase.
| ''Maria is the most intelligent one in the class.''
|-
| El libro de Jorge es el '''menos''' interesante '''de''' la clase.
| ''Jorge's book is the least interesting book in the class.''
|}

Note that in some cases ('''la más inteligente''') you can just write the article and omit the noun. The
general pattern for Spanish superlatives is:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| '''el/la/los/las''' ({noun}) '''más/menos''' {adjective} '''de'''
| ''the (most/least)''{adjective} {noun} ''in/of''
|}

=Chordates=
The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate chordates.

==Characteristics==
Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all chordates, including vertebrates

Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system, hydrostatic, fluid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.

Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth, passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.

Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord

Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into tail, early locomotive function led to success. 

Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
* bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
* segmented muscles and bones

==Subphylum Urochordata==
The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata, these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, filter-feeders which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic, which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits, and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In urochordates notochord is confined to larval tail.These lack cranium.
These have an open type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.there are two siphons through which water enters and exit.they have a tubular heart.they have a tough outer covering.example acidia

== Subphylum Cephalochordata ==
The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their bladelike shape. They resemble fish but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.

Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).

==Subphylum Vertebrata==
(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). 
Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks firmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord. Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into organ systems.

All vertebrates share the following characteristics:
- segmentation
- a true coelom
- bilateral symmetry 
- cephalization
- a backbone
- a bony skull
- a closed circulatory system
- chambered heart
- two pairs of jointed appendages
- tissues organized into organs

Vertebrate Organ Systems:
- Nervous System
- Circulatory System
- Digestive System
- Respiratory System
- Reproductive System
- Excretory System

* Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like, spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is an injury to this.)
* Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.

What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher chordate animals? 

Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile (attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less efficient for locomotion, favoring the undulating motion allowed by a notochord.

Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayfly, which has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts. 

Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile (“attached”).

===Class Agnatha===
&quot;jawless fish&quot;
* Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive fins and massive plates of bony tissue on their body.
* Cyclostomes: &quot;circle mouth&quot; - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of lampreys and hagfish.
Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100 million years. 
The first group of fish to appear. They had neither jaws, paired fins, nor scales, but they were the first organisms with a backbone.

====Class Acanthodia====
&quot;spiny fish&quot;
Appeared about 430 million years ago. 
An extinct class of fish that developed jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.

====Class Placodermi====
Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years.
An extinct class of fisive heads.

===Class Chondrichthyes===
&quot;cartilaginous fish&quot;
Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony fish.
Includes sharks, skates and rays, and chimaeras. 
Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the mineral calcium carbonate. 

The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: 
- gills
- single-loop blood circulation
- vertebral column
- presence of placoid scales on their bodies
- internal skeleton of cartilage
- paired, fleshy pectoral and pelvic fins
- asymmetrical tail fin prevents sinking
- fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy
- visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills
- no external ear
- oviparous
- internal fertilization
- ectoderms
- cold blooded

===Class Osteichthyes===
&quot;bony fish&quot;
Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous fish.
Includes about 95% of today's fish species.

=====Subclass Sarcopterygii=====
fleshy-finned fishes. Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs. 

=====Order Dipnoi=====
lung fishes, two groups isolated when continents separated

=====Order Crossopterygii=====
includes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved into a swim bladder in bony fishes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex folding of enamel.


•	Skeleton made of bone, jaws, fins, most with scales, two-chambered heart.

===Class Amphibia===
means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult
Amphibians:
- Legs
- Lungs
- Double-Loop Circulation
- Partially Divided Heart
- Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through Skin)

=====Order Salientia=====
frogs (jumping) (aka Anura)

=====Order Urodela=====
salamanders (tailed)

Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.

Amphibians have limbs instead of fins. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial and connected, support body on legs.

Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).

Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and therapsids. 

====[[en:Reptiles|Class Reptilia]]====
amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have four extra-embryonic membranes:
* Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in fluid sac.
* Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes. 
* Chorion: gas exchange
* Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor
Reptiles are cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment. Sometimes defined as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.

Reptiles can be classified by skull structure into four groups:
* Anapsid
* Synapsid
* Diapsid
* Euryasid
Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull

Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium. 

=====Subclass Anapsidia=====


=====Subclass Testudinata=====
[[en:turtle|turtles]], terrapins

=====Subclass Diapsida=====
[[en:dinsosaur|dinosaurs]], [[en:snake|snakes]], most stuff

=====Subclass Synapsida=====

======Order Therapsids======

=====Subclass Diapsida=====
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; 
Plesiosaurs, ancient sea monsters; 
Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and 
Thecodonts, which gave rise to
* birds 
* dinosaurs
* crocodilians 

Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure

* Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
* Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal

Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant. Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.

Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur &gt;&gt; therapsid &gt;&gt; mammals

Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than constant push-up. Teeth differentiated into different types, for pre-processing of food needed by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

====Class Aves====
arose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modified for flight. Feathers: epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like fingernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary flight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed to support flight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only exothermic animals. 

Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found in Zolenhoffen, German sandstone mine with fine sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no sternum, bony tail, not a good flyer but did have primary flight feathers. 

Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx. 

Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian flightless birds.

Neognathae: remaining live birds.

====[[en:Mammals|Class Mammalia]]====
Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies: 
* Hair 
* Mammary glands 
(don’t fossilize well)

Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize) 
* Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
* Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
* Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles this joint is between other bones)

Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor

Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
* Warm-blooded
* Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
* Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
* Heterodonty (differentiated teeth)
* Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile teeth are continually replaced)

=====Subclass Protheria=====
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening for excretion and urination.

=====Subclass Theria=====
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo…)
Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common mammals)

Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny offspring crawls into a pouch where it completes development latched onto a teat. 

Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two different mammal groups may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the offspring and increase its own chance of survival.</text>

==Phylum Porifera==
[[Image:Woda-1 ubt.jpeg|thumb|right|Sponges]]
Name means &quot;pore-bearing&quot;.

This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.

Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a free swimming larva.

Their bodies are porous. They are filter feeders; water flows in through many small openings (ostia), and out through fewer, large openings (osculum). They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and fibres made of spongin (a form of collagen). Choanocytes are flagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and trap and phagocytize food particles.

Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally flexible: they can become any type of cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power sponges have.

Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).

Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoflagellates, a.k.a. &quot;zooxanthellae&quot;).

==[[w:Cnidaria|Phylum Cnidaria]]==  
See text pages 886 - 889.

Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning &quot;nettle&quot;.

This phylum consists of the [[w:Jellyfish|jellyfish]], hydra, [[w:Sea anemone|sea anemones]], [[w:Coral|corals]], sea pens, sea wasps, and box jellyfish. There are about 9,000 species. Almost all are marine. This is another ancient group, with fossils perhaps reaching back to 700 mya.

Cnidarians exhibit '''radial symmetry'''. Their basic body plan is a sac with a gastrovascular cavity, or a central digestive system. They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undifferentiated middle layer called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.
[[Image:Schleiden-meduse.jpg|thumb|right|Jellyfish Development]]
There are two basic body plans: the [[w:polyp|polyp]] and the [[w:Medusa (biology)|medusa]]. The polyp is sessile and attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa (&quot;jellyfish&quot;) is a floating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have both.

The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called &quot;alternation of generations&quot;: an alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.

The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular &quot;harpoons&quot; that function in defense and prey capture. When fired, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.

Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a &quot;nerve net.&quot;

Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic relationship (Dinoflagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of the primary productivity of coral reefs.

There are three main classes in the phylum 

* [[w:Hydrozoa|Class Hydrozoa]] (hydras and Portuguese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples of this Class)
* [[w:Scyphozoa|Class Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish)
** The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
* [[w:Anthozoa|Class Anthozoa]] (sea anemones, most corals)
** No medusa (jellyfish) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual &quot;corals&quot; grow.

==[[w:Platyhelminthes|Phylum Platyhelminthes]]==
See text pages 890 - 893.

Name means &quot;flat worm&quot;

Most members of this phylum are parasitic (flukes and tapeworms), but some are free living (e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.

They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., &quot;flat&quot;).  

Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior &quot;brain&quot; and a simple ladder-like nervous system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or &quot;flame cells&quot;).

Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex reproductive (life) cycles.

There are four main classes of platyhelminths:

* [[w:Turbellaria|Class Turbellaria]] (mostly free living flatworms, e.g., planaria)
* [[w:Monogenea|Class Monogenea]] (parasitic flukes)
* [[w:Trematoda|Class Trematoda]] (parasitic flukes, e.g., liver fluke and the human blood fluke, Schistosoma)
* [[w:Cestoda|Class Cestoda]] (tapeworms)
** Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or digestive system.

==[[w:Rotifer|Phylum Rotifera]]==  
See text page 900

The Rotifers. The name means &quot;wheel bearing,&quot; a reference to the corona, a feeding structure (see below).

They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered pseudocoelomates.

Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.

Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk, and foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e., mouth &amp; anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized circulatory or gas-exchange structures.

Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.

Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present, sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily when living conditions are unfavorable.

Most structures in rotifers are syncytial (&quot;a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into separate cells,&quot; or &quot;a multinucleated cell&quot;) and show eutely (here, &quot;constant or near-constant number of nuclei&quot;).

==Phylum Nematoda == 
See text pages 894 - 895.

Name from the Greek for &quot;thread&quot;.

This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!

These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates. They are vermiform, or wormlike.

In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!). Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete. They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle fibers. The sexes are separate.

Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much anywhere.
: In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!

Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number (eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).

==Phylum Annelida==
See text pages 906 - 909.

Name means &quot;ringed&quot;, from the Greek annulatus.

This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many different names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.

Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates. Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal &quot;bristles&quot; (setae or chaetae).

Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere sufficient water is available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.

Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory system (metanephridia).

There are three main classes of Annelids

* Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
* Class Polychaeta (marine worms, fan worms, sand worms, paddle worms)
* Class Hirudinea (leeches)

==Phylum Arthropoda==
[[Image:Arthro_characters.jpeg|thumb|right|Arthropods]]

Name means &quot;jointed feet&quot;.

This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
: This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era. Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been named.

These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates. The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They have an open circulatory system.

The most notable advancement of this phylum is a rigid exoskeleton. It has major implications in these organisms' locomotion, flexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.

There are several major groupings of arthropods:
: Major subgroups include:
:* The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
:* The Trilobites...they get their own grouping
:* The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and unbranched (uniramous) appendages.
:* The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.
: Major Classes Include  
:* Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
:* Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
:* Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
:* Class Insecta (insects)
:* Class Crustacea (crabs, crayfish, lobsters, shrimp)

==Phylum Mollusca==
See text pages 900 - 905.

Name means &quot;soft&quot;.

This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others. About 110,000 species

All molluscs have a similar body plan: 

* A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
* A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
* A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if present.
* Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.

Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Development is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization. Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).

Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of annelids.

There are several major classes of molluscs:

* Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
* Class Gastropoda (snails, limpets, conchs, slugs, nudibranchs)
* Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
* Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopus, nautilus, cuttlefish)
* Class Scaphopoda (tusk shells)

==Phylum Echinodermata==
Name means &quot;spiny skin&quot;

This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.

Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.

As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.

Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system of fluid-filled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding, locomotion, and gas exchange.

There are six major classes of echinoderms:

* Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
* Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
* Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
* Class Crinoidea (sea lilies and sea feathers)
* Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumber)

==Phylum Chordata==
Name means &quot;the chordates&quot;, i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their lifecycle.

This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.

There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.

* A notochord, or a longitudinal, flexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This is the structure for which the phylum is named.
* A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and spinal cord.
* Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates, these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modified for gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
* A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.

Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved independently from the segmentation of annelids.

Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:

* Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbohydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are filter feeders. The only &quot;chordate&quot; characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits. Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates &amp; adult vertebrates than adult urochordates.
* Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually live on the bottom, but can swim.
* Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...

Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.  

===Subphylum Vertebrata===
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.

This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
: Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.

The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium &amp; vertebral column in adults.

====Neural Crest Cells====
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage cells, pigment cells, neurons &amp; glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.

Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.

Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.</text>

== Key Terms ==

synapomorphy


== Introduction ==

What makes an animal an animal?  

If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be defined by synapomorphies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT define this or any taxon using symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters (the independent evolution of similarity, or &quot;convergent evolution&quot;). See pages 654 - 656 and Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.


== Characteristics of an Animal ==


* There is no one universally accepted definition of an animal. The following treatment follows your text, beginning on page 876.
** Animals:
*** Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes &amp;hellip;
*** Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants &amp; fungi
*** Share unique characteristics &amp;hellip;
*** Share certain reproductive characteristics &amp;hellip;
*** Other commonly used definitions &amp;hellip;

Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes 
* Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals: 
** Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
** Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic. 
** Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
* Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi. 
** However, there is a difference here between animals and fungi. Animals generally take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then absorb the resulting nutrients.

Animals share unique characteristics
* Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
* Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
* Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139, Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)
** Tight junctions (sealing function)
** Desmosomes (anchoring function)
** Gap junctions (communication function)

Animals share certain reproductive characteristics  
* Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
* In most animals, a small, haploid, flagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid, nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
* Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A synapomorphy? This feature could be another &quot;unique characteristic&quot; shared by animals.
* Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage (or stages) that are morphologically &amp; ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva (plural: larvae).

Other commonly used definitions or characterizations
* It is surprisingly difficult to find two texts that agree on a precise definition of an animal. Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
** Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest their food.
** Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygote passes through embryonic stages that include a blastula.
** Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed from two different haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a blastula.
** Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What would a cladist think of this definition of the taxon Animalia?)

What kinds of animals are there?  
* Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
** There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
** Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
* Remember that two animals in different phyla generally are considered to be more different from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more different from annelids than humans are from sharks).

==The Evolutionary Tree in Animals==

There are many competing hypotheses for the form of the evolutionary tree of animals. A traditional hypothesis is that the tree resembles a tuning fork: it has a short base and two main branches. However, there is recent molecular evidence that challenges part of this traditional hypothesis.

Under the tuning fork model, the &quot;base&quot; of the tree includes structurally simple animals like sponges, corals, and their relatives.

One main branch includes [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Arthropoda|arthropods]], [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Mollusca|molluscs]], [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Annelida|annelids]], and [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Nematoda|nematodes]]. This branch, or a large part of it, usually is called the '''protostomes'''.

The second main branch includes vertebrates ([[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Chordata|phylum Chordata]]), and starfish, sea urchins, and their relatives ([[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Echinodermata|phylum Echinodermata]]). This branch usually is called the '''deuterostomes'''.

Flatworms ([[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Platyhelminthes|phylum Platyhelminthes]]), which include free living planarians as well as parasitic flukes and tapeworms may be placed very low on the protostome branch, or high on the trunk just below the protostome - deuterostome branching.

==Support for the &quot;Tuning Fork&quot; Model==

The features of animals that have been interpreted as suggesting a tuning fork model are extremely basic characteristics of body organization and early embryonic development.  

===Body Symmetry===

====Asymmetry====

Lack of any symmetry. Many sponges are asymmetric.

====Bilateral Symmetry====

There is only one plane of symmetry, and it is anterior-to-posterior, dorsal-to-ventral, through the midline.

Characteristic of most protostomes and the higher deuterostomes.

===Presence of True Tissues===

Tissues are defined as an integrated group of cells that share a common structure and a common function (for example, nervous tissue or muscle tissue).

Sponges are described as lacking true tissues.

True tissues are present in [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Cnidaria|Cnidaria]], flatworms, and all higher animals.

===Number of Embryonic Germ Layers===

Germ layers are defined as the basic tissue layers in the early embryo which give rise developmentally to the organs and tissues of the adult (e.g., ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm).

This is a concept that is applied ''only'' to organisms considered to have true tissues.

====Two Germ Layers====

Organisms with two germ layers are said to be '''diploblastic'''.

This is characteristic of Cnidarians. 

====Three Germ Layers====

Such organisms are said to be triploblastic.

This is characteristic of flatworms and all higher organisms.

====Four Germ Layers (?)====

Some developmental biologists consider the neural crest tissue of vertebrate embryos to be a fourth germ layer.

===Nature of the Main Body Cavity===

Most triploblastic animals have a fluid-filled space somewhere between the body wall and the gut. Such a cavity can provide numerous functional advantages.

For example, peristalsis of the gut need not affect the body wall, and movements of the body wall during locomotion need not distort the internal organs.

We will consider three conditions with respect to the body cavity:

====Acoelomates====

These animals lack an enclosed body cavity; the only &quot;body cavity&quot; is the lumen of the digestive tube.

The space between the gut and the body wall is filled with a more or less solid mass of mesodermal tissue.

The major example of this is the phylum Platyhelminthes, the flatworms. Minor examples: Phylum Nemertea (Rhynchocoela) and Phylum Gnathostomulida (not responsible for these &quot;minor&quot; examples).

====Pseudocoelomates====

Pseudocoelomates have a fluid-filled cavity between the body wall and the gut, but it does not form within mesoderm, nor does it end up fully enclosed by mesoderm.

This cavity often is interpreted as being a developmental remnant of the blastocoel, the fluid-filled cavity of the blastua stage of the embryo.

To distinguish it from the next grade, this type of cavity is called a pseudocoelom.

Major examples of pseudocoelomates include the phyla Nematoda (round worms) and Rotifera (rotifers). Other phyla listed in the table that are considered to be pseudocoelomates are flagged with an asterisk. Note that recent molecular data in particular have challenged the &quot;naturalness&quot; of the pseudocoelomates as a possible taxon.

====Coelomates====

Coelomate animals also have a fluid-filled cavity between the body wall and the gut.

In this grade, however, the cavity is completely enclosed by mesoderm.

Major examples of coelomates include molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, and chordates.

=== The protostome-deuterostome distinction ===
The distinction is based on several fundamental characteristics of early development.

'''Characteristic:'''
*Protostomes
*Deuterostomes

'''Determinate vs. indeterminate cleavage'''

'''Spiral vs. radial cleavage'''

'''Fate of the blastopore'''
*Mouth
*Anus

'''Source of mesoderm'''
*Lip of blastopore
*Wall of archenteron

'''Formation of coelom'''
*Schizocoely
*Enterocoely 

'''Phyla'''
*Mollusca, Annelida, Arthropoda
* Roundworms &amp; flatworms, although non-coelomate, demonstrate other protostome features, and so are included in this group by some authorities.
Echinodermata, Hemichordata, Chordata

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

The [[w:Robert Atkins (nutritionist)|Atkins]] diet is a diet in which one eats a low level of carbohydrates and larger amounts of protein, including meats, poultry, and fish.  Dieters avoid simple carbohydrates (refined sugar and starch (ie.flour) as well as most forms of sugar, starches (including starchy vegetables like potatoes), milk (but not cream or cheese), and grains (including most breads).  During the initial 'induction' phase, during which the dieter is limited to no more than 20 net carbohydrates per day, there is a long list of vegetables that are generally felt to be too high in carbohydrates for the Atkins diet, including sweetcorn, peas, potato and others. Some people include carrots in their list of no-nos. However, green beans and many other vegetables such as asparagus, cabbage, broccoli, lettuce, courgettes/zucchini, aubergines/eggplant are OK and encouraged within the Atkins diet, even during the early stages.

Net carbohydrates are defined as total carbohydrates minus fiber content and sugar alcohols.  It is net carbohydrates that are monitored by those practising the Atkins way of life.  In fact, one of the first goals of Atkins is to discover your unique CCL, or Critical Carbohydrate Level.  This number is simply the number of net carbs that can be eaten daily to maintain a fixed weight.  There are four phases to Atkins: 

# Induction
# Ongoing Weight Loss
# Pre-Maintenance
# Lifetime Maintenance

As one moves through the four phases, more variety in food types can be added to the diet, including some breads, fruit, etc. that are considered taboo during the very early stages.

Artificial sweeteners are generally used instead of sugar, and Atkins recipes have high levels of protein. Fat is not avoided. A typical Atkins-approved dessert might be fresh berries served with heavy cream mixed with splenda.

It should be noted that while Atkins works well for short-term weight loss for many people, its long term side effects are continually debated.  Therefore, one would be wise to do research and consult a doctor before beginning this diet.  Thereafter, your doctor will be able to advise you as to the frequency of additional physical check-ups.

The following recipes were created for the Atkins diet or are otherwise acceptable on it:

*[[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Tiramisu|Atkins-friendly Tiramisu]]
*[[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Chocolate Mousse|Atkins-friendly Chocolate Mousse]]

Consider replacing [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]] with [[Cookbook:Pawpaw|pawpaws]], which are generally [http://www.pawpaw.kysu.edu/pawpaw/cooking.htm#Nutritional%20Information more nutritious].

      <text xml:space="preserve">My knowledge about the Atkins diet is only cursory but does it really contain '''no''' (== 0) carbohydrates. I doubt it. I suppose it is rather a low carbohydrate high fat and diet. [[w:Atkins Nutritional Approach]]
&lt;br&gt;[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 18:26 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)
:No, in fact it doesn't. The &quot;Atkins Diet&quot; described in this writeup is referring to the first phase of the diet, &quot;Induction&quot;. Despite popular hearsay, Induction is not the entire Atkins program; it is but a two-week program for beginning the Atkins diet. Also, the limit is 20 grams of carbohydrates a day. The limit increases to each person's needs over the course of the program.--[[User:66.24.4.236|66.24.4.236]] 06:31, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)
:It's generally impossible to consume a no-carb diet due to the presence of 'incidental' carbohydrates - the lactose in milk and even cream products, for instance (however, there is considerably less in higher-fat creams (table, whipping, etc) per serving and some preferentially consume these). Even animal tissue has SOME carbs in the form of residual glycogen but it is negligible. Generally the only way you're going to achieve a true no-carb diet is by going on a traditional arctic Inuit style diet.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">About Internet: I don't know how much work or how far your thoughts have gone in starting this book. My thought is to move (retitle it) to ''Using the Internet'' and tighten the scope a bit in that direction. Of ourse, you DO need an outline of the technology involved, so it would be embedded. What do you think? ...[[User:LouI|LouI]] 05:39 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)


: What I was invisioning for the book was to cover a more &quot;behind the scenes of the internet&quot; type content, whereas a ''Using the Internet'' would really only need to cover it from a user points view. Perhaps it might make more sense to have two books, one aimed at the novice/beginner level which just explains how to use email/usenet/irc/etc, and one aimed at the intermediate level user who already knows how to use the internet and now wants to know how it works. We could use the books to complement each other (i.e. in the Internet Technologies book we could have say a short introduction to usenet which says for more information about how to use Usenet see chapter X in ''Using the Internet''.) --[[User:Imran|Imran]] 13:23 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)

: Following that thought, I'd reach for three interrelated books: ''Surfing the Internet'', ''Using the Internet'', and ''Understanding the Internet'' (even though the last is an impossible stretch ;-) and perhaps should be ''Working with the Internet''). Of course, eventually you get a lot of specific technology books, addressing subjects like CSS/HTML/ASP etc. Another way to look at this might split it different ways: ''Introduction to Internet Technology'', ''Introduction to Internet in Business'', and ''Intro to Internet Personal Uses''. The field is so large I don't know how to crack it. How do you address prop-heads, suits, and geeks at the same time? For a third view, you can look at Internet components, contents, and uses separately. Sorry to ramble, but I'm trying to hit various combinations to see if one emerges as obvious.

::Splitting it into Surfing the Internet, Using the Internet, and Understanding the Internet seems like a good idea. I don't think splitting it into usages (personal, business,etc.) would be effective because of overlap between the two. --[[User:Imran|Imran]]

== Image copyright problems ==

 
Thanks for uploading images on Wikibooks. However, the images may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user={{urlencode:{{PAGENAME}}}} all images you have uploaded] or will upload.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Imran. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Imran~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''''&lt;u&gt;This page is for an elementary explanation of the origins and nature of the religions.  It is not meant to be an in depth study by any means.&lt;/u&gt;'''''

==Animism==
Animism (from Latin animus, -i &quot;soul, life&quot;) is the worldview that non-human entities (animals, plants, and inanimate objects or phenomena), possess a spiritual essence.

==Baha'i Faith==
The ''Bahá'í Faith'' is the youngest of the world's independent religions. Its founder, [[wikipedia:Baha'u'llah|Bahá'u'lláh]]  (1817–1892), is regarded by Bahá'ís as the most recent in the line of [[wikipedia:Manifestations of God|Messengers of God]] that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Christ and Muhammad.

The central theme of Bahá'u'lláh's message is that humanity is one single race and that the day has come for its unification in one global society. God, Bahá'u'lláh said, has set in motion historical forces that are breaking down traditional barriers of race, class, creed, and nation and that will, in time, give birth to a universal civilization. The principal challenge facing the peoples of the earth is to accept the fact of their oneness and to assist the processes of unification. [http://www.bahai.org/faq/facts/bahai_faith]

Wikipedia article: [[wikipedia:Baha'i Faith|Bahá'í Faith]]

==Buddhism==
Buddhism is a religion based largely around the teachings of the Siddhārtha Gautama (although his exact status is still controversial and changes by sect), and is now the central religion of most of Southeast Asia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and parts of China, India, and a small part of Russia. It is also a major religion in Korea and Japan, and has growing influence in the west.

Gautama was born in ancient Nepal around the 6th century BC, son of a King and relieved of all tasks. One day, while being brought around by his charioteer, he saw the four passing sights (an old man, a sickly man, a decaying corpse, and a holy man), which brought him to the realization that birth, old age, sickness, and death happen to all people over countless lives. He left his wife, children, rank, and his entire life to solve that problem.
Gautama tried everything to achieve inner peace (he nearly killed himself numerous times), but found nothing that worked. He then tried sitting peacefully under a Bohdi tree and meditating. This proved very successful, and he soon achieved the inner peace he wanted. He then traveled the lands, preaching his new faith.(Postscript-Buddhism is largely based on Jainism, and shares many beliefs with Jainism.)

Within the context of postclassical China, dominations such as pure land and Zen Buddhism appealed to both aristocratic elites and the mass peasantry. A commonality of religion in the global context: the induction of fervent belief system in the presence of societal corruption and lack of intellectual synthesis.

Modern Buddhism still follows the ideals of Gautama-peace, kindness to man, and love of nature (including vegetarianism). There are three modern sects of Buddhism - Theravada, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna (practiced in southeast Asia, East Asia, and scattered parts of Asia, respectively).

For information on the sects of Buddhism, or some tenents of Buddhism, go to:

==Christianity==

==Confucianism==

==Hinduism==
''Hinduism'' is a term coined to designate the traditional socio-religious systems of the people of India. This term does not appear in any of the sacred literature of India. Hindus refer to their religion as ''Sanatana Dharma'' which loosely translated means “The Eternal Path”. ''Sanatana'' means ''eternal'', ''perpetual'' or ''sustained''. ''Dharma'' means any method by which one sees reality for what it is, and that by which one is drawn closer to the Absolute Truth and Ultimate Reality — it is the ''Philosophia Perenis''.

In a context of world history, the Hindu emphasis placed upon social divisions as ample means for a productive society led to the highly stratified caste system in which birth and socio-economic position determined semi-permanent placement. 

There are two world religions which have formed the cultural and ethical basis of the world as we know it. Both have an unbroken history going back thousands of years. Judaism with a 5000 year old tradition is the mother of the western civilisation through its offshoot Christianity. Hinduism is the older of the two with a literature going back to the beginning of recorded history. 

Hindu civilisation originated in the Gangetic and Indus valleys and from there spread out over the entire region of southeast Asia. Its offshoot — Buddhism, shaped and molded the civilizations of Japan, China, Tibet and the rest of Asia. There is evidence to suggest that the Ancient pre-Biblical kingdom of the Mittani in Asia minor was ruled by Kings with Hindu/Sanskrit names. The Hittites were an Indo-European people and according to some sources are said to have originated in the Gangetic Basin of India. Hindu philosophy/theology influenced the ancient Greeks since the time Alexander the Great conquered parts of north India. A remarkable similarity has also been demonstrated between the religion and mythology of the ancient Scandinavian people and that of the people of India. 

The ancient civilizations such as the Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Mayan, Aztec, and Inca have all passed away. Even the Jewish culture has undergone many radical changes since its inception 5000 years ago – yet the Hindu civilisation continues as a vibrant and living vector, and has remained virtually unchanged for over 6000 years. Today, Hindu communities are to be found in almost every country on earth.

'''10.3 Students analyze the effects of the '''Industrial Revolution''' in England, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States.'''

1. Analyze why England was the first country to industrialize.

2. Examine how '''scientific and technological changes''' and new forms of energy brought about massive social, economic, and cultural change (e.g., the inventions and discoveries of James Watt, Eli Whitney, Henry Bessemer, Louis Pasteur, Thomas Edison).
 
3. Describe the growth of '''population''', rural to urban migration, and growth of cities associated with the Industrial Revolution. 

4. Trace the evolution of '''work and labor,''' including the demise of the slave trade and the effects of immigration, mining and manufacturing, division of labor, and the union movement. 

5. Understand the connections among natural resources, entrepreneurship, labor, and capital in an industrial economy. 

6. Analyze the emergence of '''capitalism''' as a dominant economic pattern and the responses to it, including Utopianism, Social Democracy, Socialism, and Communism. 

7. Describe the emergence of '''Romanticism''' in art and literature (e.g., the poetry of William Blake and William Wordsworth), social criticism (e.g., the novels of Charles Dickens), and the move away from Classicism in Europe.

==The Industrial Revolution==

In 1750, most people in Europe lived on small farms and produced most of their needs by hand. By the middle of the 19th century, many people lived in cities and most of their needs were produced by complex machines using steam power. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and spread to Belgium, France, Germany, the United States and Japan. It was a fundamental change in the way goods were produced, and altered the way people lived. The Industrial Revolution is a major turning point in world history. 

===Why Great Britain?===

Great Britain became the focus of the Industrial Revolution for a variety of reasons: the start of the Agrarian Revolution, an abundance of natural resources, available capital, and the political will to support innovation.

The Agrarian Revolution was a change in farming methods that allowed for a greater production of food. This revolution was fueled by the use of new farming technology such as the seed drill and improved fertilizers. The results of this revolution in farming was a population explosion due to the higher availability of food. Also, the Enclosure Movement, which was the consolidation of many small farms into one large farm, left many people jobless and homeless. These people provided the workforce of the Industrial Revolution. 

Great Britain's geography provides them with an abundance of the natural resources needed for industrialization, such as iron ore and coal. Britain also had access to many navigable rivers and natural harbors which provided for the easy movement of goods both within the country, and overseas. The British overseas empire provided them with a strong economy, this produced the capital (money) needed to build railroads, factories, and mines. 

Politically, British entrepreneurs enjoyed a high degree of freedom from state control, compared to their counterparts in France, Russia and other parts of Europe.  A relatively fair court system existed to enforce contracts and settle disputes among capital owners.  These factors may have allowed new technologies and energy resources to take root and flourish. Britain experienced a revolution in energy use as they switched from animal power, to water power, to steam power in a few short years. The steam engine was the power source of the Industrial Revolution.

==Effects==


===Philosophy=== 

The philosophy of Communism appeared as a reaction to the condition of the Working Class in industrial society. Karl Marx wrote in The Communist Manifesto (1848) that all of human history is based on the conflict between the bourgeoisie (those who control the means of production) and the proletariat (working class). He predicted that the proletariat would rise up in a violent revolution to overthrow the bourgeoisie and create a society with an equal distribution of goods and services. This socialist theory would form the basis for the Bolshevik, Chinese, and Cuban Revolutions in the 20th Century. The United States had a very strong reaction to him.

===Imperialism===

Due to the need for raw materials and new markets, the industrialized nations took control of Africa, India, South East Asia, and others. Imperialism had a negative effect on most of these cultures, and did not completely end until after World War II. Most of the benefits of imperialism accrued to the European nations.

The Industrial Revolution was a major turning point in world history as it resulted in a complete change in society on all levels. Effects of the Industrial Revolutions were long reaching, and influenced many other cultures both positively and negatively.

== Before the Great War ==

=== Factors Leading to War ===

Constant colonial tensions among the great powers had given rise to the possibility of a great war between the major European powers.  For almost a hundred years, since the fall of Napoleon, a remarkable series of events kept the relative peace.  But as 1914 approached, tensions began to rise in a number of countries, and key issues began to take their toll. 

==== The Changing of Imperialism ====

By 1914, Imperialism had begun to come at last to a turning point.  The massive land grabs that had divided up Africa, given Britain such a huge empire, and led to the collapse of the Chinese Empire had finally run their course.  There simply were very few places left on Earth containing massive amounts of land not already claimed by a western power.  This was especially bad news to nations that were latecomers to the game of Imperialism, Germany and, to a lesser extent, Russia.

Wilhelm II did not wish for Germany to miss out on the benefits of a colonial empire. Germany already had some territories in Africa, and after the Berlin Conference of 1885, they were major policy makers on the continent.  However, Wilhelm II continually pushed for a larger role for Germany in Africa, leading ultimately to the Morocco Affair, and a heightening of tension.

==== Turmoil in Russia====

Russia was also undergoing immense changes.  After three hundred years of Romanov rule, Russia was finally making a transition to a modern nation.  However, the Romanov tsar, Nicholas II of Russia , was still clinging onto a good measure of authoritarian power.  The struggle between Nicholas II and reform-minded progressives would eventually lead to the drama of the Russian Revolution.

To make a bad situation worse, Russia was also in a bad geographic situation.  Despite being the largest European power in terms of land area of their home nation, Russia was mostly poor and un-industrialized.  Much of the nation was underdeveloped, and only slowly inching its way toward a more profitable existence.  At the same time, Russia was dealing with an unfavorable political situation, already reeling from the loss of the Russo-Japanese War, as well as attempting to stay afoot of the fast-paced diplomacy of the west.

==== The Sick Man of Europe ====

For several hundred years, the Ottoman Empire had been slowly collapsing under its own weight, watching helplessly as first one province and then another had broken away, or been stolen.  Recently, in the Crimean War, the Ottomans had been forced to rely upon the aid of Britain and France to sustain itself in conflict against the Russians. The Empire had previously been called the &quot;Sick Man of Europe&quot;, but prior to the war it was called the &quot;Dying Man of Europe&quot;.

Only sparse pieces of the Balkans remained in Ottoman control by 1914, and they were being encroached on from many fronts.  The Austrians in the north clearly wanted to pacify provinces in the region, the Russians in the east wanted Istanbul itself to guarantee themselves a safe passage through to the Mediterranean from their Black Sea ports, and the people who lived in the Balkans were beginning to experience their own internal unrest.  By 1914 it looked like conflict could erupt at any moment in the Balkans.

==== Naval build up and the end of Splendid Isolation ====

In order to demonstrate their military capability, Germany embarked on a plan to build up her navy, constructing the High Seas Fleet, equipping it with the latest in military technology.  This not only contributed to a rise in Germany's military power, but it also seriously alarmed Great Britain.  Britain had long subscribed to the theory of ''Splendid Isolation'', under which Britain attempted to hold itself aloft from affair on the continent.  Protected by the Royal Navy, the most powerful navy in Europe, Britain had remained inviolate to foreign powers for centuries; even Napoleon was unable to land an army on her shores.  Under Splendid Isolation, Britain chose to abstain from permanent relationships with European powers and to continually work to maintain a balance between them, all the while protected from continental strife by her powerful navy.

The construction of the German High Seas Fleet pushed Britain into a fury of shipbuilding, in an attempt to stay ahead of German production.  The knowledge that they could no longer stand by in the distance and remain safe from European struggle, and the continuing threat created by German armament programs, propelled the British out of their self-imposed isolation.  It also led to a souring of relations between both Britain and Germany.

==== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ====

On June 28, 1914, at approximately 11:00 am, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were killed in Sarajevo, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by Gavrilo Princip, a member of Young Bosnia and one of several (seven) assassins organized by The Black Hand (Crna Ruka). The event, known as the Assassination in Sarajevo, was one of the main triggers of World War I.

== War Breaks Out ==
Officially, the First World War began on June 28, 1914 in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo, with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by Gavrilo Principe, a  member of a secret Serbian society, The Black Hand, hoping to unite the Slavic speaking lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the nearby Kingdom of Serbia. In retaliation, Austria, with the support of Germany, presented Serbia with a list of demands that would severely threaten the Kingdom's autonomy. The Austrian leaders had been waiting for this moment for several years, because they feared just the sort of Serbian groups that were now operating in Bosnia, and had been waiting for this chance to weaken Serbia for several years. After consultations with the Russians, Serbia rejected the demands, leading to war with Austria. Russia responded with a general mobilization, followed by Austria's ally Germany and Russia's ally France. The first stage of the war quickly escalated, with a general war breaking out between an alliance of Germany and Austria against Russia, France, and Serbia.

The war presented the Germans with a special problem. Their own armies were scattered on the country's eastern and western borders against France to the west and Russia to the east, but the armies of France and Russia were concentrated against the Germans on their respective borders. In order to make the best out of this two front situation, the German generals began to carry out the '''Schlieffen Plan''', developed by a German general in case of war with both France and Russia. The plan called for a quick and massive strike against the French while the massive Russian army was still mobilizing, hoping that their Austrian allies could stop the Russian advance long enough for them to finish off the French and move their troops by rail to defend the east.

Unfortunately, the quickest way to strike the French capital, Paris, and knock the French out of the war involved a broad offensive through neutral Belgium. Great Britain, a nominal ally of France, promised to intervene in case Germany invaded Belgium, and declared war shortly after German forces crossed the border. The Germans initially expected the Belgians to put up very little resistance, but this proved to be incorrect and the longer than expected time required to defeat the Belgians allowed the French to regroup.

While the Germans were pushing deep into Belgium, Serbian forces crossed the Danube in a daring attack against the Austrians. This offensive, like many others after it, failed, and the war zone along the Balkans would change very little during the first year.

Meanwhile, the massive German offensive bearing down on France was beginning to run out of steam. First, the Russians scored several early victories against the Austrians and moved through Poland (then a Russian territory) on their way to attack Prussia and the vulnerable German capital, Berlin. The worried German generals withdrew several divisions to the eastern front, allowing the French to regroup and defeat the German lead elements at the Battle of the Marne, slightly more than 15 miles outside Paris.

Though the German armies were stopped by the French, the Russian armies bearing down on Prussia were similarly defeated by German forces under Field Marshall Hindenburg at the Masurian Lakes, and then at Tannenberg. Though the Russian army was much larger than the German army, the Russian commander's decision to split his forces in a two-prong attack contributed to his defeat, and allowed the Germans to break apart the offensive piecemeal.

== Stalemate and Trench Warfare ==

Following these defeats, the war on both fronts bogged down. In the west, both French and British forces and the Germans built a massive series of trenches from the Swiss border to the North Sea to defend their positions. This period of &quot;Trench Warfare&quot; saw very little change in the battle lines, and several uses of poison gas by the Germans.

With no major breakthroughs on either fronts, and furthermore the people in Russia were killed. German and British leaders looked to the Mediterranean to break the stalemate. This put the two remaining neutral powers, Italy and the Ottoman Empire (later Turkey) in a tough position. Before the war, the Italians had agreed to support Germany and Austria in case of war. However, British and French diplomats promised the Italians the Austrian territories adjacent to Venice if Italy declared war, which they did after the prodding of many Italian radicals, among them Mussolini. The Ottoman Empire also had to make a tough choice, because Britain was the Empire's traditional protector and Russia was the Empire's traditional enemy. Germany's offer of two battleships and Middle Eastern territories allowed the Turks to strike out at both simultaneously, beginning with a naval strike against the Russian naval base at Odessa. The Ottoman entry into the war encouraged neighboring Bulgaria to also enter the war in an alliance with Germany, leading to the rapid defeat and occupation of Serbia by the Austrians. Austria played an important part in the war and still is today a leading military nation.

In 1915 the Ottomans launched an attack into Egypt in an attempt to capture the Suez Canal. The assault failed and the Ottomans retreated back into their empire. Once again in 1916 the Ottomans attempted to capture the canal, but this once again failed. This attack convinced the British to push their defence of the Canal further out, into the Sinai, and so starting in October, the British under Lieutenant General Sir Charles Dobell began operations into the Sinai desert and on to the border of Palestine. Initial efforts were limited to building a railway and a waterline across the Sinai. After several months building up supplies and troops, the British were ready for an attack. The first battle was the capture of Magdhaba on December 23 1916. This was a success, the fort was captured.

In 1916, the Central Powers invaded Romania, and forced them to sign an unwilling peace.

== America Enters the War ==

By 1916, the two groups had been fighting for two years with neither side making significant gains. Food shortages had appeared in Germany (under blockade by Britain) and Russia, leading to much discontent. Responding to the British blockade, the Germans launched a naval offensive of their own, using submarines known as U-Boats to prey on allied shipping.

=== The Lusitania ===

A British-American tourist cruise liner that was intentionally sunk by a German U-Boat. However, there was some ammunition onboard in the cargo area, and this was the German reason for sinking.

=== The Zimmerman Telegram ===

A telegram from Germany to Mexico that encouraged Mexico to attack the United States.

This telegram was provided to the United States by Great Britain and there has been some speculation on whether it was forged by Great Britain in order to get the previously neutral United States to join World War I

==Defeat of the Central Powers==

[[World History/The Rise of Dictatorship and Totalitarianism/Quick Quiz|Quick Quiz]]
==Benito Mussolini and Fascism in Italy (1922-1939)==
Benito Mussolini, born into a poor blacksmith's family, was so named by his radically socialist father (his mother was a devout Catholic schoolteacher) after the executioner of a Mexican emperor. Shortly after becoming qualified as a teacher, Mussolini taught in a small school. Mussolini was a far-left socialist and advocated a violent revolution to overthrow the parliamentary monarchy within Italy and denounced nationalism. When World War I broke out in 1914, however, he broke with his party comrades when he celebrated the entry of his nation into the war – even though he had dodged the draft. Throughout the Great War, he fought earnestly to keep Italy involved, and, financed by large arms manufacturers and the British and French governments, operated a small, pro-war newspaper. When the war came to an end in 1919, Mussolini was quick to recognize the dissatisfaction of many of the homebound soldiers and countrymen concerning the Treaty of Versailles. In an effort to persuade Italy to enter the war on their side, the Allied Powers promised Italy significant territorial gains at the expense of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The final settlement, however, was less favorable to Italian interests than that originally promised, and resulted in widespread malcontent regarding the post-war government. 

In March of 1919, Mussolini created a radically nationalist and anti-communist party – Fasci Italiani di Combattimento. Mussolini, who loved the splendor and extravagance of Ancient Rome, adopted a Roman symbol of authority, the ''fascio'' (an axe wrapped in whipping rods) for his group of devotees. As inflation and economic decline spread throughout Europe and Italy following the war, factory workers began to go on strikes in northern Italy. In 1920, Mussolini’s group’s numbers were bolstered by ex-soldiers willing to break up these strikes. Mussolini marched 50,000 Fascist supporters (known as Blackshirts for their attire) in squads against the strikers and left-wing newspapers. The Blackshirts garnered their support from the financial contributions of industrialists and large landowners, who shared their anti-communist sentiments, but also believed that they could control the excesses of the Fascist party. The police often refused to stop the squads, allowing the Blackshirts freedom to inflict whatever damage they wished.

The widespread destabilization of the previous social orders throughout Europe due to economic uncertainty in the aftermath of the war and the successful establishment of the Soviet Union as a socialist state led many to believe that democracy was weak and ineffectual, while monarchy was discredited as an oppressive and unresponsive system. A command economy was thought to be a progressive and scientific method of social organization. Fascism incorporated the futuristic and populist elements of Communist ideology, but also identified itself strongly with the nationalism that had created the modern European nation-states in the late 19th Century.

Despite growing popularity and the introduction of proportional representation in the Parliament, Mussolini's party faired poorly at the polls, winning no seats in 1920 and only 35 in May 1921 (7% of the vote). The internal political situation however, swung in Mussolini's favor. The birth of the Communist Party of Italy, openly allied with Lenin's Soviet regime in Moscow, polarized Italian politics. Proportional representation caused stagnation in government, until a weak coalition finally came into place in February 1922. In October of that year, as Mussolini was giving one of his soon-to-be characteristic speeches from atop a balcony, he suddenly cried, “To Rome! To Rome!” The crowd of supporters, much to Mussolini’s surprise, echoed his cry. Blackshirts to the number of 40,000 organized to march on the capital. Mussolini, however, went into hiding, afraid of the impending collapse of his movement. When it became clear that the army would not oppose his action, however, Mussolini moved decisively. As Blackshirts began to occupy key posts in Rome on 27-28 October, the king, Victor Emmanuel III, to the chagrin of his elected cabinet, appointed Mussolini as Prime Minister so long as Mussolini halted the advance to Rome. Mussolini agreed. His word was not to be trusted, however, as he soon after marched on the city anyway, creating an incredible propaganda success for the Fascists. Over the next few years, he led a slow-motion coup d'etat. By 1926, he had become the undisputed totalitarian dictator (“Il Duce,” or “the leader”) of Italy.

Mussolini's regime embarked on a campaign of militarization and political maneuvering.   First, he began to ready Italy for war. One of Mussolini’s driving ambitions was to restore the hegemony of the Roman Empire in a modern Italy. To that end, he encouraged couples to have as many children as possible as he organized large-scale expansions of the agricultural sector to feed them.  He extended an olive branch to the Catholic Church by way of the Lateran Accords, which recognized papal authority over the Vatican and declared Catholicism the official religion of all of Italy, ending hundreds of years of estrangement. Mussolini seemed to have been a victim of his own propaganda as, in 1935, he deemed his newly-formed army strong enough to invade Ethiopia. The Italian army invaded from Italian-held Eritrea. The underestimation of the enemy proved fatal for thousands of ill-prepared Italians as the army met face-to-face with the “Lion of the Desert,” Omar Mukhtar (whose death by hanging at the hands of the Italians ended his twenty-year resistance). The poorly-armed Ethiopians were eventually defeated primarily due to terror tactics, such as poison gas and terror bombings. Mussolini’s sense of superiority did not seem hurt by his army's poor preparation, as, over the next few years, he became a close ally of Hitler's. In 1939, Mussolini signed the “Pact of Steel,” creating a formal alliance between Italy and Nazi Germany. Mussolini, while publically effervescent, did not have the universal power and control enjoyed by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, a lack of gravitas which would later cost him his life. Nevertheless, Mussolini rode at the helm of the 20th century dictatorship, invented the terms Fascism and Totalitarianism, and pioneered the use of propaganda to control the masses in newspapers, posters, radio, and in movie cinemas.

==The Weimar Republic (1918-1933)==

Following the complete collapse of Germany's armed forces throughout the waning months of 1918, German generals and  politicians desperately sought to surrender. The Allied Powers, however, would not negotiate with the autocratic Kaiser Wilhelm II, and insisted upon Germany to adopt a democratic government. In this disarray, Germany quickly fell along the slippery slope to revolution, appearing as though it might go the same direction as Russia – Marxist.  After Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated the throne on November 7, a new republic was declared, and a National Assembly convened at Weimar to circumvent the unrest in Berlin. The hastily-formed republican government took its name from the host city and surrendered. The Allied Powers, in turn, forced upon the defeated nation extremely harsh and punitive terms through the Treaty of Versailles. Clause 231 of the treaty, the so-called &quot;war-guilt&quot; clause, called for Germany to accept total and sole blame for the Great War (while, arguably, they merely joined) and to pay reparations to the “victimized” Allied Powers. Finally, it was established that Germany was to disband its air force permanently, and to have no more than 100,000 men in its armed forces. The Rhineland, along the Franco-German border, was demilitarized and put under French jurisdiction.  The extremely valuable Saar region, home to most of Germany’s factories, was made autonomous.

These harsh restrictions gave the fledgling Weimar Republic unwarranted disrespect. Many Germans had opposed the treaty, and it created large amounts of resentment within Germany.  (Retrospectively, the Treaty of Versailles is seen as one of the most fundamental causes of the rise of Adolf Hitler and World War II.) The newfound lack of industry compounded the reparations Germany was forced to pay. To assuage its monetary woes, The Weimar Republic began to print paper money at exhorbitant rates – rates so high, that, by 1923, the American Dollar was worth 4.2 trillion German Marks. Amidst the chaos of disappearing life savings and a tumultuous economy, Gustav Stresemann came to the forefront of Weimar politik. Under his leadership, the Weimar Republic managed to regain marked stability in the period of 1923-1929. peoples discontent about the weimar government increased day by day. Hyperinflation was corrected, but Stresemann's death in 1929 and the catastrophic worldwide Great Depression the same year brought about the death of the Weimar Republic. This untimely fall led to the empowerment of a man who would vault Germany to an unprecedented world power, who would pursue the elimination of “undesirables” such as Jews and homosexuals, who would begin the second world war of the 20th Century. Hitler, who had been subverting many of his countrymen during the economically tumultuous 1920s, took advantage of the Weimar Republic’s fall.

==The Rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany (1914-1939)==

In August 1914, as the world took the fatal plunge into World War I, an unknown and unimportant young Austrian national named Adolf Hitler enlisted in the German Army.  Born on April 20, 1889 into a troubled and strict Austrian family, Hitler was a failed artist and an ardent German nationalist (Austrians are ethnically German and indistinguishable from their cousins).  His anti-semitic views already in place from his early life as a vagrant (he dropped out of high school and was refused admission to a Vienna art school), Hitler was eager to serve his adopted homeland.  He had an exemplary record of service and received the prestigious Iron Cross, both First and Second Class, and also achieved the undistinguished rank of Corporal.  Shocked and deeply angered by the German defeat in 1918, he personally put the sole blame on the so-called &quot;November politicians&quot;  (referring to those who formed the Weimar Republic). He also put blame on the Jews for the downfall of Germany. 

After the war, Hitler remained in the army and after receiving intelligence and oratory training, became an intelligence official tasked with infiltrating political parties and reporting to his superiors on their activities.  In March 1919, he was instructed to sit in on a meeting of the small nationalist German Worker's Party.  He joined the party in September, and upon his discharge from the army in 1920, soon became the leader of the party which changed its name to the German National Socialist Worker's Party (NSDAP or Nazi for short, from its German name ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'').  Over the next few years, Hitler's oratorical skills allowed the party to expand.  It soon had its own private armed forces, known as the SA led by Ernst Rohm.  Another important admirer was Erich Lundendorff, a Field Marshall from the First World War, whose help proved invaluable in setting up the Beer Hall Putsch.

===The Beer Hall Putsch and Mein Kampf (1923-1925)===
On November 8, 1923, Adolf Hitler and a group of SA raided a beer hall in Munich where the three most powerful politicians in Bavaria were giving speeches.  Taking the men hostage, Hitler threatened them with death (and his own suicide) if they did not side with his intention to overturn Bavaria's government and then to march on Berlin.  The men agreed (with little other choice).  Hitler then made the colossal error of leaving the hall.  He left Marshall Lundendorff in command, who upon the assurances of the three politicians that they only wished to return home to their families and would continue to support Hitler, allowed them to leave the hall.  The men quickly denounced Hitler and mobilized the government's resistance to his &quot;revolution&quot;.  Adolf Hitler was enraged.  He decided to march his SA the next morning against the Bavarian government.  However, army regulars were already at the War Ministry when Hitler arrived and the rebellion was quickly scattered.  Hitler was arrested and tried.  He spoke so forcefully at his trial however, that the head judge had to harass the other two judges into even convicting him at all.  He received a five year sentence.  The abortive coup Hitler tried to carry out is referred to as the Beer Hall Putsch.

In prison, Hitler dictated the book ''Mein Kampf'' (My Struggle) to his close friend and confidant, Rudolf Hess.  The book was a savage &quot;hymn of hate&quot; denouncing Jews as &quot;parasites&quot; and laying down the foundation for the plan of military conquest Hitler would later attempt.  It was all painfully clear: the rearmament of Germany, the invasion of Poland, the invasion of the Soviet Union; Hitler had written down for anyone who wished to read it his plan of action.  Unfortunately, few non-Germans read the book, but all too many Germans did.  Hitler was released after spending only eight months of his sentence, mostly because the authorities thought he was harmless.  He found the Nazi party virtually moribund.  In 1925, he formed the ''Schutzstaffel'' (SS) to be his personal body guard under the leadership of Heinrich Himmler.

===The Nazi Regime (1933-1939)=== 
Through the use of propaganda, Hitler became immensely popular among the German people.  To end the depressions, Hitler followed a program of massive public works, including the infamous Autobahn, dams, roads, railroads, and civil improvements.  His official announcement of rearmament in 1936 (although it had actually begun much earlier) stimulated the economy further, as it would in the United States during the Second World War.  Culture evolved along a strict set of party rules.  Men were the heads of work and home; a woman's place was as a cleaner and a mother.  The Nazis encouraged large families to literally create men to serve in the army.  The Nazis, through their policy of racism, wanted superiority in every sphere of life.  When the Olympic Games came to Berlin in 1936, the Germans showed off their athletes in huge stadiums built for the purpose.

Adolf Hitler practiced a policy of racial superiority of the Germans, whom he called Aryans, and people were sorted by the correct ethnic &quot;purity&quot;.  The ideal was the tall, blond, blue-eyed, muscular, and handsome Nordic youth (ironically, Hitler had brown hair).  Hitler's regime followed a totalitarian policy; the SS and the secret police, the Gestapo, ruthlessly enforced loyalty to Hitler and rounded up the Nazi's enemies.  In 1934, when the army had demanded as the price of its support the dissolution of the SA, Hitler had Ernst Rohm assassinated.  Heinrich Himmler became the chief of secret police activities and the mastermind behind the terror.  In 1935, the Nazis enacted the Nuremberg Laws, which placed extreme restrictions of Jews and their freedoms as human beings.  The economic lives of the Jews were smashed.  At this stage however, Hitler was not actively killing Jews but deporting them.  The Nazis operated concentration camps at this time to deal primarily with political prisoners.

The propaganda machine of the Nazis was similar to that of Stalin in the USSR.  However, the Nazis, under propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, used their propaganda to acquire not only acquiescence to Hitler's schemes, but also to convince the Germans of their policy of racial purity and antisemitism.  Goebbels saw to it that, like in the Soviet Union, a picture of the Führer appeared in every building and home, and in many public places.  Posters were one of the favorites of the Nazis.  They also used the theater extensively to bring in support for the party's goals.

==Joseph Stalin takes power in the Soviet Union (1924-1934)==



When Vladimir Lenin died in 1924, he left a power vacuum behind in the wake of his death, centering on the continued use of the New Economic Policy (NEP).  The primary contenders for political power were Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky.  Leon Trotsky was a brilliant politician, and had been Commissar of War during the Civil War.  He was a gifted orator and a dedicated Communist, especially to the cause of causing Marxist revolutions internationally, through the use of arms if need be.  Ironically, Trotsky had originally been a member of the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social Workers Party, until Lenin, recognizing his genius, had won him over to the Bolshevik camp.  Stalin, on the other hand, was a gifted organizer.  He was referred to by many of his contemporaries in the party as &quot;Comrade Index-card&quot;.  However, Trotsky was obviously the more popular choice for the job as the head of the new communist state.  Unfortunately for Trotsky, Stalin was also the party's General Secretary.  Although primarily a bureaucratic job, the General Secretary actually held the most power in the party because he appointed regional and local party posts in government.  Stalin was therefore in a position to appoint those who would support his bid for power.

Stalin initially allied himself with the right and center factions of the Communist Party (if any part of a far-left party may be called &quot;right&quot;) which supported the continued existence of the NEP.  Allying himself with Lev Kamenev and Grigori Zinoviev, he threw his might against Trotsky, who was removed from his post as People's Commissar of War.  Stalin now turned against Kamenev and Zinoviev, allying himself with Nicolai Bukharin.  Trotsky was expelled from the Communist Party on November 12, 1927, and expelled from the Soviet Union in 1928.  He eventually found his way to Mexico, where he was murdered in 1940, probably on Stalin's orders.  Now Stalin turned on his allies again, abandoning Bukharin and calling for the abandonment of the NEP.  By now, Stalin was the undisputed leading figure of the Communist Party.  By the early 1930s, Stalin would truly become the dictator of the Soviet Union.
===The First Five-Year Plan and Collectivization (1927-1939)===

At the Fifteenth Congress of the Communist Party, Stalin openly advocated the end of the NEP and introduced a plan for rapidly industrializing the largely rural Soviet Union, remarking that the country was &quot;fifty to one hundred years behind the advanced countries&quot;.  The government then introduced Gosplan (The State General Planning Commission) which came up with basis for the Five-Year Plan, aimed to turn the country into a major industrial power within five years.  The plan set ridiculously high quotas for development.  Nonetheless, terrific economic growth was achieved, especially in the areas of coal and iron output.  As a result, steel production grew exponentially.  However, harsh penalties for not making quotas caused large-scale misrepresentation of growth to occur.  Harsh totalitarian measures were introduced.  Miners were expected to put in 16 and 18 hour work days, unheard of even the strictest parts of the major capitalist countries.  Poor and hazardous working conditions caused countless deaths.  Most of the massive industrial complexes constructed for the Five-Year Plan were built by slave-laborers, sentenced for trivial and often completely false crimes.  Approximately 3.7 million people were sentenced for counter-revolutionary crimes, approximately 0.6 million were put to death, 0.7 million were expatriated, and 2.7 million   were sent to forced labor camps (called the Gulag), often itself a death sentence.

As another part of the Five-Year Plan, the government began to forcibly collectivize agriculture (that is, to create large-scale farms where peasants worked the land collectively).  The state sought not only an increase in agricultural output, but also to export grain abroad, in order to gain financial capital to buy important technologies for the industrial parts of the Five-Year Plan.  By 1936, 90% of the nation's farms had been collectivized.  However, this was not done without cost.  Peasants almost universally actively opposed collectivization.  In the Ukraine, the peasants killed off livestock rather than give it to the authorities.  Stalin was so incensed that he allowed a famine to occur which led to the deaths of millions of innocent Ukrainians.  As a result, throughout the period of 1924-1953, agricultural output was generally low, not regaining output levels of the period of the NEP until 1940, and rising only marginally in the following years.  In addition, Stalin saw fit to deal with richer peasant farmers (known as Kulaks) by deporting them to forced labor in Siberia.  In practice however, any person critical of collectivization was deemed a Kulak and summarily deported.  It is estimated that at least 2.5 million peasants (in addition to the above industrial workers) were deported, though the true number is believed to be much greater.

===The Great Purges and Politics in the Soviet Union (1930-1939)===

Throughout the period of collectivization and the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet government became increasingly tyrannical.  Stalin, was extremely paranoid, began to turn on important members of the party he had once called supporters.  In 1934, the last person who might have rivaled Stalin, Sergei Kirov, was shot in his office, most likely on Stalin's orders.  Using the murder as a pretext, he began to engage in ruthless purges of the party membership.  Ironically, most of the purged members were original members of the party and colleagues of Lenin, known as the Old Bolsheviks.  Through a series of show trials, the defendants were sentenced to death and to forced labor in the Gulag.  Often, after using torture to extract signed confessions and agreeing on lenient sentences for a confession of false charges in the court, Stalin would turn on his word and have the defendants executed.  Zinoviev and Kamenev, Stalin's old allies, both met this fate. Through 1936-1937, a period known as the Great Terror, Stalin supposedly personally signed 40,000 death warrants.  

Stalin's dictatorship held incredible control over the general populace of the nation.  Intense propaganda campaigns tried to indoctrinate the society with Communist thought.  Stalin wanted to replace the national identities, such as the Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarussians, with the idea of a purely &quot;Soviet&quot; citizen.    He also stipulated that all ethnic groups be treated equally.  Under the Tsars, the Russians had been given preference.  Now the heavy hand of Stalin was given equally to all nations.  However, this did not prevent him from forcing the speakers of every language in the USSR to convert to the Cyrillic alphabet.  Religion came under intense pressure as well, as atheism was the official policy of the state.  Priests were rounded up and shipped to Gulag or executed.  By the end of the terror, less than 1,000 churches remained out of at least 20,000.  The NKVD, the Soviet secret police, hunted down citizens suspected of &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; or &quot;subversive&quot; crimes.  During the Great Terror, as many as 1 million people (the NKVD's own records admit 0.681 million) were executed for simply &quot;opposing&quot; Stalin's ideas and plans.  False confessions were routinely extracted through torture and intimidation.  The penalty for countless others (numbering by the most conservative estimates in the millions) was the Gulag.  Fear was the order of the day in the Soviet Union.  In addition, the Soviet state cultivated an extreme cult of personality around Stalin.  Pictures of the dictator appeared at every street corner and in every building, including people's homes.  School children ended the pledge of allegiance at the beginning of each day by saying &quot;...and thank Comrade Stalin for this happy life&quot;.  To be fair, social conditions did improve under Stalin.  Unemployment fell to practically zero, and large bounds in the public health were introduced.  However, there was no freedom whatsoever in Soviet society.

==Francisco Franco's Fascist Spain and the Spanish Civil War (1936-1945)==
Francisco Franco rose to power after the brutal turmoil of the Spanish Civil War. The conflict was between the residing leftist republican parties and the nationalist movement led by Franco. Some view the Spanish Civil War as a &quot;dress rehearsal for World War II&quot;. The Struggle of dictatorship and democracy is evident in this conflict.

==Causes of World War II==
France, Great Britain, and the U.S. had attained their wartime objectives. They had reduced Germany to a military cipher and had reorganized Europe and the world as they saw fit. The French and the British frequently disagreed on policy in the postwar period, however, and were unsure of their ability to defend the peace settlement. Disillusionment with war led to the practice of appeasement, or giving into an aggressor's demands to keep the peace. The U.S., disillusioned by the Europeans' failure to pay their war debts, retreated into isolationism. The Treaty of Versailles left many countries dissatisfied. Adverse conditions, such as reparations and unemployed veterans from World War I led to the circulation of new, radical ideas and solutions, such as fascism in Italy. This Fascist party, as Mussolini called it, later became a model for Hitler in Germany.

===The Failure of Peace Efforts===
During the 1920s, attempts were made to achieve a stable peace. The first was the establishment (1920) of the League of Nations as a forum in which nations could settle their disputes. The League's powers were limited to persuasion and various levels of moral and economic sanctions that the members were free to carry out as they saw fit. At the Washington Conference of 1921-2, the principal naval powers agreed to limit their navies according to a fixed ratio. The Locarno Conference (1925) produced a treaty guarantee of the German-French boundary and an arbitration agreement between Germany and Poland. In the Kellogg-Briande Pact (1928), 63 countries including all the Great Powers except the USSR, renounced war as an instrument of national policy and pledged to resolve all disputes among them &quot;by pacific means.&quot; The signatories had agreed beforehand to exempt wars of &quot;self-defense.&quot;


===The Rise of Fascism===
One of the victors' stated aims in World War I had been &quot;to make the world safe for democracy,&quot; and postwar Germany adopted a democratic constitution, as did most of the other states restored or created after the war. In the 1920s, however, the wave of the future appeared to be a form of nationalistic, militaristic totalitarianism known by its Italian name, fascism. It promised to minister to peoples' wants more effectively than democracy and presented itself as the one sure defense against communism. Benito Mussolini established the first Fascist, European dictatorship during the inter war period in Italy in 1922.

===Formation of the Axis Coalition===
Adolf Hitler, the Leader of the German National Socialist (Nazi) party, preached a racist brand of fascism. Hitler promised to overturn the Versailles Treaty and secure additional ''Lebensraum'' (&quot;living space&quot;) for the German people, who he contended deserve more as members of a superior race. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression hit Germany. The moderate parties could not agree on what to do  about it, and large numbers of voters turned to the Nazis and Communists. In 1933 Hitler became the German Chancellor, and in a series of subsequent moves established himself as dictator. Japan did not formally adopt fascism, but the armed forces' powerful position in government enabled them to impose a similar type of totalitarianism. As dismantlers of the world status quo, the Japanese were well ahead of Hitler. They used a minor clash with Chinese troops near Mukden, also known as the Mukden or Manchurian crisis, in 1931 as a pretext for taking over all of Manchuria, where they proclaimed the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932. In 1937-8 they occupied the main Chinese ports. Having denounced the disarmament clauses of the Versailles Treaty, created a new air force, and reintroduced conscription, Hitler tried out his new weapons on the side of right-wing military rebels in the Spanish civil war (1936-9). This venture brought him into collaboration with Mussolini who was also supporting the Spanish revolt after having seized (1935-6) Ethiopia in a small war. Treaties between Germany, Italy, and Japan in 1936-7 brought into being the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis. For example, Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern pact in 1936 and then Italy joined in 1937. This pact denounced communism and it showed their unity in the matter. The Axis thereafter became the collective term for those countries and their allies.

===German Aggression in Europe===
Hitler launched his own expansionist drive with the annexation of Austria in March 1938. The way was clear: Mussolini supported him; and the British and French, overawed by German rearmament, accepted Hitler's claim that the status of Austria was an internal German affair. The U.S. had impaired its ability to act against aggression by passing a neutrality law that prohibited material assistance to all parties in foreign conflicts. In September 1938 Hitler threatened war to annex the western border area of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland and its 3.5. million ethnic Germans. The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain initiated talks that culminated at the end of the month in the Munich Pact, by which the Czechs, on British and French urging, relinquished the Sudetenland in return for Hitler's promise not to take any more Czech territory. Chamberlain believed he had achieved &quot;peace for our time,&quot; but the word Munich soon implied abject and futile appeasement. Less than six months later, in March 1939, Hitler seized the remainder of Czechoslovakia. Alarmed by this new aggression and by Hitler's threats against Poland, the British government pledged to aid that country if Germany threatened its independence. A popular joke ran at the time: &quot;A guarantee a day keeps Hitler away&quot;. France already had a mutual defense treaty with Poland. The turn away from appeasement brought the Soviet Union to the fore. Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator, had offered military help to Czechoslovakia during the 1938 crisis, but had been ignored by all the parties to the Munich Agreement. Now that war threatened, he was courted by both sides, but Hitler made the more attractive offer. Allied with Britain and France, the Soviet Union might well have had to fight, but all Germany asked for was its neutrality. In Moscow, on the night of August 23, 1939, the Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed. In the part published the next day, Germany and the Soviet Union agreed not to go to war against each other. A secret protocol gave Stalin a free hand in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, eastern Poland, and eastern Romania.

===The Worldwide Great Depression===

The costs of carrying out World War I, as well as the costs to rebuild Western Europe after years of fighting, resulted in enormous debts on the part of the Western European powers to the United States.  The enormous reparations put on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles also increased the debts.  Coupled with ineffective governments in many of these European States (notably the Weinmar Republic, pre-Mussolini Italy and Socialist France) led to slow reconstruction and poor economic growth.

With the crash of the New York Stock Market on 29 October, 1929, the United States recalled all foreign loans in the following days.  Unable to repay these loans, the economies of the West collapsed, beginning the Great Depression.

==The War in the Pacific==

*Note that this is only a rough outline. Change it as needed.

===Mukden Incident and the Invasion of Manchuria (1931)===

After winning the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan quickly became the dominant power in its region. Russia recognized Korea as a Japanese sphere of influence and removed all of its forces from there and Manchuria, the sparsely populated northeastern region of China. In 1910, Japan annexed Korea as its own with little protest or resistance. Still, Japan was a quickly growing country, both population-wise and economically. It founded the South Manchuria Railway company in Manchuria in 1906, and with that company was able to gain government-like control of the area. 

By 1931, the Depression had struck a blow to Japan. The government did little to help Japan's economy, and in the eyes of its citizens, was weak and powerless. Instead, the public favored the Japanese army, and soon the civilian government had lost control of its military. To the army, Manchuria seemed like an obvious solution to many of Japan's problems. Manchuria was vast and thinly populated, and would serve as excellent elbow room for an already overcrowded Japan. It was also thought that Manchuria was rich in forests, natural resources, and fertile land. The fact that the Japanese believed themselves to be far superior to the Chinese only moved Japan towards conflict faster. Additionally, the warlord of Manchuria went against Japanese expectations and declared his allegiance to a growing Chinese military movement. So, in 1931, the army staged an explosion at a section of railway near Mukden, a city in Manchuria, as a pretext to invade and annex China. Japan met little resistance, although it did not have support of its own government, and Manchuria was completely occupied by the end of the year. Japan subsequently set up the puppet state of Manchukuo to oversee the newly acquired region. The League of Nations vehemently protested Japan's aggression, but Japan then withdrew from it.

===Japan invades China (1937)===

The 1920s saw a weak and politically chaotic China. Warlords of the many provinces of China constantly feuded, and the central government was weak and decentralized, unable to do anything to stop conflict. In 1927 Chiang Kai-Shek gained control of the Kuomintang (the Chinese government) and its National Revolution Army. Chiang led an expedition to defeat southern and central Chinese warlords and gain the allegiance of northern warlords. He was successful, and he soon focused on what he perceived to be a greater threat than Japan, which was communism. But in 1937, the deposed warlord general of Manchuria kidnapped Chiang and refused to release him until he at least temporarily united with the communists against the Japanese threat. The Japanese army responded by staging the Battle of Lugou Bridge, which was supposed to provoke open war between China and Japan. It worked and the Sino-Japanese War began. The beginning of the conflict was marked by the Chinese strategy of giving up land in order to stall the Japanese. It is important to note that the Japanese was not to completely take over China; rather, the Japanese wanted to set up puppet governments in key regions that would protect and advance Japanese interests. The fall of Nanjing in the early stages of this conflict saw the beginning of Japanese war atrocities. 100,000-300,000 were killed in the six weeks after Nanjing was captured. Other war crimes committed included widespread rape, arson, and looting.

====Anti-Comintern Pact and Tripartite Pact====

These were pacts between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Anti-Comintern pact had been a pact that denounced communism and it was initially signed by Japan and Germany. However, later, as German and Italian relations improved, Italy also signed and this was made stronger later by the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis in 1938. The Tripartite Pact also strengthened the alliance and it was basically a confirmation of the Rome-Berlin-Toyko Axis.

===Pearl Harbor and Simultaneous Invasions (early December 1941)===
On December 7, 1941, Japanese warplanes commanded by Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo carried out a surprise air raid on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the largest U.S. naval base in the Pacific. The Japanese forces met little resistance and devastated the harbor. This attack resulted in 8 battleships either sunk or damaged, 3 light cruisers and 3 destroyers sunk as well as damage to some auxiliaries and 343 aircraft either damaged or destroyed. 2408 Americans were killed including 68 civilians; 1178 were wounded. Japan lost only 29 aircraft and their crews and five midget submarines. However, the attack failed to strike targets that could have been crippling losses to the US Pacific Fleet such as the aircraft carriers which were out at sea at the time of the attack or the base's ship fuel storage and repair facilities. The survival of these assets have led many to consider this attack a catastrophic long term strategic blunder for Japan.

The following day, the United States declared war on Japan. Simultaneously to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan also attacked U.S. air bases in the Philippines. Immediately following these attacks, Japan invaded the Philippines and also the British Colonies of Hong Kong, Malaya, Borneo and Burma with the intention of seizing the oilfields of the Dutch East Indies. 

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Germany declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, even though it was not obliged to do so under the Tripartite Pact of 1940. Hitler made the declaration in the hopes that Japan would support him by attacking the Soviet Union. Japan did not oblige him, and this diplomatic move proved a catastrophic blunder which gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the pretext needed for the United States joining the fight in Europe with full commitment and with no meaningful opposition from Congress. Some historians mark this moment as another major turning point of the war with Hitler provoking a grand alliance of powerful nations, most prominently the UK, the USA and the USSR, who could wage powerful offensives on both East and West simultaneously.

===Allied Defeats in the Pacific and Asia (late December 1941-1942)===

Simultaneous with the dawn raid on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese carried out an invasion of Malaya, landing troops at Kota Bharu on the east coast, supported by land based aircraft from bases in Vietnam and Taiwan.  The British attempted to oppose the landings by dispatching Force Z, comprising the battleship HMS Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser HMS Repulse, with their escorting destroyers, from the naval base in Singapore, but this force was intercepted and destroyed by bombers before even reaching their objective.

In a series of swift maneuvers down the Malay peninsula, thought by the British to be &quot;impassable&quot; to an invading force landing so far north, the Japanese advanced down to the Johor Straits at the southernmost tip of the peninsula by January 1942.  The Japanese were even using tanks, which the British had thought would not be able to penetrate the jungles but they were wrong.

During a short two week campaign the Japanese crossed the Straits of Johor by amphibious assault and conducted a series of sharp battles, notably the battle of Kent Ridge when the Royal Malay Regiment put up a brave but futile effort to stem the tide.  Singapore fell on 15 February 1942 and with its fall, Japan was now able to control the sea approaches from the Indian Ocean through the Malacca Straits.  The natural resources of the Malay peninsula, in particular rubber plantations and tin mines, were now in the hands of the Japanese.

Other Allied possessions, especially in the oil rich East Indies (Indonesia) were also swiftly captured, and all organised resistance effectively ceased, with attention now shifting to events closer to Midway, the Solomon Islands, the Bismark Sea and New Guinea.

====Resistance in the Philippines and the Bataan Death March====

===The Tide Turns: The Coral Sea===

===Allies Regroup and the Battle of Midway (1942)===

Following the attack on Pearl Harbour, the US military sought to strike back at Japan, and a plan was formulated to bomb Tokyo.  As Tokyo could not be reached by land based bombers, it was decided to use an aircraft carrier to launch the attack close to Japanese waters.  The Doolittle Raid was carried out by Doolittle and his squadron of B-25 medium bombers, launched from the USS Hornet.  The raid achieved little strategically, but was a tremendous morale booster in the dark days of 1942.  It also led to the decision by the Japanese military to attack the only logical base of the attackers, the tiny atoll of Midway.

A powerful force of warships, with four large fleet carriers at its core (Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu and Soryu) attacked Midway.  The US navy, with the aid of intercepted and decoded Japanese signals, were ready and launched a counter attack with the carriers USS Enterprise and USS Yorktown, destroying all four of the Japanese fleet carriers.  This was a devastating blow to the Japanese and is considered the turning point of the Pacific War.  The Japanese had largely roamed the Pacific Ocean, the South China Sea, the Malacca Straits and the Indian Ocean with impunity, launching raids from these same four carriers on Allied bases in these areas including Darwin, Colombo and along the Indian east coast.  With the loss of these carriers and more importantly their cadre of irreplaceable hard core highly trained naval aviators, the Japanese could no longer maintain an effective offensive and became largely defensive from then on.

===Guadalcanal Weakens Japan (August 1942-February 1943)===

===Buna, Gona, and Rabaul (1943)===

===Island Hopping (1943- Late 1944)===
Island hopping was a campaign of capturing key islands in the Pacific that were used as prerequisites, or stepping stones, to the next island with the eventual destination being Japan, rather than trying to capture every island under Japanese control. Allied forces often assaulted weaker islands first, while starving out the Japanese strongholds before attacking them.

===Iwo Jima and Okinawa (Early 1945)===

===The Atomic Bomb (August 1945)===
On August 6, 1945, a lone B-29 bomber, named the Enola Gay, appeared over the skies of Hiroshima. Air raid sirens went off around the city and people ran for their shelters. However, minutes later, the all-clear symbol was given. Although it had been a seemingly harmless run, the B-29 had, in fact, dropped a single bomb (this bomb was called &quot;Little Boy&quot;). This bomb detonated about 1,900 feet over Hiroshima and leveled much of the city within a few thousandths of a second. Tens of thousands were killed immediately and many more would eventually die from the radiation poisoning.

However, Japan did not surrender to the United States, so three days later, on August 9, 1945, a B-29 named Boxcar dropped an atom bomb on the city of Nagasaki (this bomb was called &quot;Fat Man&quot;). Although the bomb was actually more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, the foggy weather conditions and the hilly terrain of Nagasaki somewhat shielded a portion of the city from the worst effects. 

This led to an immediate ceasefire with Japan, and surrender a month later.

The Second World War saw the most far-reaching transformation of world politics to date.  The destructive technologies introduced during the war &amp;ndash; foremost, the atomic bomb &amp;ndash; made it very unlikely that a land-based conflict of similar scale and duration among the major nations could ever happen again, because of the potential for total destruction of all combatants.  

No advanced industrial nation has been invaded since 1945, and all wars since that time have either been guerrilla conflicts in less-developed countries, conflicts involving less-developed countries with more advanced ones, or some combination of these two scenarios.

From an economic standpoint, the war and its aftermath consumed much of the real and potential industrial production of the world over the period 1940-1960 (with the exception that the United States, its homeland untouched, was able to expand both its defense industries and its civilian economy very rapidly after 1945).  Europe and Japan lay in ruins and would spend 15-20 years rebuilding the basis for economic life, with much assistance from the U.S.  The Soviet Union and China, though victorious in the war, were also ravaged.

== The splitting of the world ==

Europe was split into two main camps by the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;, which divided Germany in half and separated Austria from Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and Italy from Yugoslvia.  The Soviet Union absorbed eastern Poland, and &quot;reassigned&quot; large areas of German territory to Polish rule by way of compensation.  Moscow intervened directly to install Communist parties in power in Poland, eastern Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.  Finland was able to keep its independence, but did not regain the lands it lost to the Soviets in the 1940 Winter War.  Yugoslavia under Marshal Tito, already Communist, did not submit to direct influence from Moscow, choosing a more independent path and greatly angering Stalin.  Elsewhere in the Balkans, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania also were brought into the Soviet bloc.
  
To the west were the democracies allied to the USA: the UK, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and West Germany.  Washington became quite concerned, however, that local Communist parties might gain power in France, Italy and Greece in the late 1940s, given the battered state of the postwar European economy and the proximity of the Soviet Union.  French leader Charles DeGaulle received strong backing from the U.S., and anti-Communist parties in Italy were heavily financed.  In the end neither nation left the Western sphere of influence.  

  
In Asia China, Vietnam, Korea and Mongolia were communist countries, whereas Japan first under occupation by the USA after WWII had to reform its system. Moving away from from militarism and expansionism and into democratic reforms. Military alliances were formed on both sides: First NATO, on 4 April 1949 in the USA geopolitical sphere and as a direct response due to the Cold War the Soviet Union (USSR), on 14 May 1955 created the Organization of Warsaw treaty, better know as Warsaw Pact. 

Also, Organization of United Nations was established in by USA initiative in 1945, as attempt to set up a body for possible dialog between Western, Eastern, and Developing countries and establish international law. The failing of the League of Nations, also initiated by the USA was one of several precursor stages for WWII. Special consideration must be given to the geopolitical interests behind this organizations, especially who they favor, even if ultimately they are a stabilizing force. Other USA international initiatives include the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and more recently the World Trade Organization (WTO), that has its roots in the discussions to form the International Trade Organization (ITO) as an evolution from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1947.

[[Talk:World History Project - Contents/Archive 1|Old talk]] (pre-Standard change)


Oh what fun, I've now added a section the Weimar Republic (it seems appropriate here) tomorrow I'll spruce up ol' Mussolini and finish up Hitler.  Then on to World War II!  Oh, I think I'll tackle some ancient history tomorrow as well.  But where to put the Great Depression?  I guess it's own article is the way to go.  And since I'm the only big contributor for a month...I am kind of giving myself free reign to take the reins (inline assonance intentional :-) of power for the time being.  I think however, I will begin to aim for AP World History standards (I achieved a 5, so I will call myself well-qualified for the task) rather than the very regional California standards (although they provide an excellent ''baseline'')  I will give a week's notice before I unilaterally make the standards change.  Please comment--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 04:13, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

----
So what'd I get done today?  Let's see, I redid much of the structure of the historical contents page and moved some pages around.  I added potential sections.  I added info on the AP World History Standard.  I added a disclaimers page and a Golden Rule, to help keep us on track.  As soon as the Standard change is official, I'm taking the California standards out of the articles and will probably replace them with the appropriate AP World History Standard material.  I redid ol' Mussolini and made the Maya something to be proud of, as well as restructuring the Precolumbian page.  It now takes into account all the cultures likely you'll want to know about.  You personally probably haven't heard of them, and I've got some more, if we get to that eventuality.  I created World History 101, a clever introduction and explanation that should help streamline the process of getting FAQs out of the way.  I mean it about rapid progression over the next month.  I beleive by that time it will be at least half finished, and worthy of an &quot;orange&quot; two-block recognition.  You deserve commendation for putting the project into place and giving it some initial vitality.  But now, it's time to get moving, abandon the regional standard, and I pray, make it a good enough page that I'm not just always talking to thin air.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:51, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Okay, well, I'm back after my extended leave of abscence for personal reasons.  Actually I've been back for a while but I just haven't done major edits.  I added a large amount to the Roman Republic part of that article and I plan to add some more to other parts over the next few weeks.  A few people have shown actual interest in helping now so I hope this project becomes further advanced.  Thanks for you interst in our project if you're reading this!  Also, I choose to stay with the AP World History Standard for now because whoever it was that was upset a few months back never turned up again or spoke to me personally so...Anwyway, if you want to help and don't know where to start, then drop me a line and I'll give you some starting places.  We don't just need contributors-- we need proofreaders and reviewers too (reviewers check for consistency and smooth transition of ideas, all that sort of thing).  I'd love your help!--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]

== Naming convention ==

Hi, I assembled the [[Wikibooks:Top active|Top active]] list of Wikibooks. Unfortunately, World History does not follow any naming convention, so the contributions can not be attributed easily to a book. If somebody is still working on this book, please consider a consistent naming convention, so that all pages belonging to World History can be recognized by a computer script.

It is up to you to choose either 
World History
World History:Ancient Civilizations

or the more modern version (since subpages have been activated on Wikibooks recently)
 
World History
World History/Ancient Civilizations

(subpages give additional navigational advantages, e.g. an automatic link to the parent page, etc.)

Logged in users can easily move pages by the &quot;move&quot; command. Thanks! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 06:09, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==Frustration==

I'm dissapointed. A WikiProject entitled WORLD history turns out to be exclusivley HUMAN history. Were this a fair and balanced representation of the history of our species, I'd be satisfied. However, this project is culturally-one sided.

This project dismisses the first 99.5% of human history in 1 'chapter', less than 20 sentances. This summary effectivley throws out the overwhelming majority of the history of our species as trash: not worth writing about, not worth reading about, not worth learning about. More or less, this project makes this point:

&quot;Around 10,000 years ago agriculture... effectivly started civilization and the begining of the nation-state.&quot;

Which implies:

&quot;Nothing worthwhile happened until agriculture was developed 10,000 years ago&quot;

and

&quot;The initial 99% of the history of our species was spent building UP to our civilized state.&quot;

Honestley. 

The 'history' book you are writing has been written before, in every text book across the globe. This in an opportunity to BREAK THE MOLD, and write a history of our species that does not dismiss &quot;prehistory&quot; as worthless. You guys are throwing this opportunity away.

:Don't view this as the 'final essay'.  If you have information to add--add it!  Wiki projects like this are ongoing and information is only available as people add it.  Obviously, there is an overwhelming amount of data that needs to be added.  So contact whatever history experts you know and have them insert the missing data!  Don't complain about it--fix it. That's what Wiki is all about.

:To add on - If you honestly feel the need to have a difference in perspective, it would be beneficial to all for you to include it within the book's framework (or as a totally new wikibook). However, the standards that wikibooks should aspire to should still be maintained, especially with regards to facuality and NPOV.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I do not believe the original author(s) intended this to be a totally biased POV article; it's just that, humans have only seen history from our own POV, and even then records of ancient times have been badly maintained if at all. Certainly if you have insights to the areas you mentioned, I believe wikibooks will welcome your contributions (within reasons, of course). [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 17:19, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)


::If you want anthropology, write and anthropology book.  Don't get your shorts in a wad because you can't change definitions to suit your prejudices.  History is a record of HUMAN events, particularly human WRITTEN events. we need to make this like the U.S. history book

:::Isn't this supposed to be a HISTORY book? Pre-history is not history at all, and the first chapter really should be scrapped. It might be ok in a Science book, or anthropology, or mythology, or something--but the fact remains it's really not history! It can't be history unless we have written records.--[[User:Linesdata|Linesdata]] 17:54, 31 October 2007 (UTC)

==First chapter on China started==

I'm new to editing Wikibooks, but after reading some of them - specifically this one - and noticing missing content, I decided to do some personal research. As a result, I typed up &quot;The Mythical Period&quot; in Chapter 5: The First Chinese Dynasties. I'm not sure if it conforms to AP standards, but I hope it fits well. Thanks!

--Ccny930

==Christian first chapter==
How about having an optional first chapter that has origins from a Christian perspective, so that this can be developed as homeschoole friendly, and the instructor can choose which chapter to use.?

All Wiki's are written from a non buyist perspective and therefore the most scientific perspective (except for the buyist wikis of course) It would be extremely inappropiate to write a christian point of view because the bible states that the Earth is only   about 5000 years old. your best bet would be to come up with your own first chapter, skip it, or use an entirely different source of information.

I believe I can speak for a great number of people who would also find it totally unacceptable to write any history from a specifically Christian perspective. Does &quot;homeschoole(sic)friendly&quot; mean that children who are homeschooled are mostly being taught history, and other subjects, from a &quot;Christian perspective?&quot; Does this mean they are being sheltered from &quot;non-Christian&quot; education in public schools?  If this is the case, I don't think you are going to find a great deal of &quot;creationist&quot; literature or other media on Wikibooks in Wikimedia, unless it is to explain creationism. I'm sure Wiki-people come from all backgrounds, but I believe we all agree that the scientific method is one construct of reality from which learning materials in &quot;academic&quot; topics are best oriented. Of course, I am not saying that religious topics should or would be kept out of Wikibooks or Wikimedia at all.

==Brazil content==
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Brazilian_History Brazilian History] page up for deletion can you use it in this project?  [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 16:53, 15 February 2008 (UTC)

== Some remarks regarding structure of project ==

I notice that material regarding early chinese dynasties is duplicated in Ancient Civilisations and The First Chinese dynasties. Also the structure of Ancient Civilisations could do with some tidying up; The Hittites,Kassites and Assyrians should be moved into the Mesopotamian section as there is a clear linear sequence between these civilisations and events in southern Mesopotamia. Besides, should the Kassites be seen as an independent civilisation.

Material regarding the Persians should be moved from the Ancient Civilisations section and moved to the Greek Section where it is contemporaneous, (also alter the title of the Greek section as well to include Persians). The Persians signify the end of Mesopotamian dominance and therefore should not be included in that section, they are not as ancient as the New Babylonians.

I would like to contribute to this project but until the overall structure is decided upon, I don't know whether my work is duplicated or not, or whether it will be eventually deleted. I read a chapter on Mesopotamian history and made copious notes on the Amorites,Kassites,Hittites and Assyrians without realising the text had information on them at the end of the Ancient Civilisations section. I might add something at another time.

I hesitate on making the changes myself without some discussion beforehand.

Also see my remarks in the talk page of Ancient Civilisations.

== anyone still here==
if no one else seems to be active I have some big ideas which involve moving/creating/combing chapters and other large structural changes. I received a five on the AP exam myself and know a few of its secrets.


If their is no opposition I propose a new table of contents that i believe better fits AP standards and flows better
# Ancient civilizations 
# Migrations and complications 
# The Axial Age 
# Greece and Persia 
# Rome 
# Classical Asia 
# Islam 
# Darkness in Europe 
# The golden age of Asia 
# Hemispheric interaction 
# Mongols and aftermath 
# The ancient Americas 
# Empires of Gunpowder 
# Global transformation: Early modern interactions   
# The European transformation 
# The Russian emergence 
# Asia and Africa in transition 
# The enlightenment  and revolution 
# The revolution of everyday life, the industrial revolution 
# The European world order 
# The Japanese reaction 
# Into the trench: World War one 
# Depression and dictators 
# The War of the world
# The cold war

==Plagiarism ==
I was suspicious that large amounts of this were not original content I am right, copying and pasting random paragraphs of this book into google I found that most of them were cut and paste out of other books and never did a see a citation, therefore the majority of this book should be removed for copyright violations it seems.</text>

== Grammar - Object Pronouns ==

=== Direct Object Pronouns ===

While the subject of a sentence ''initiates'' an action (the verb), the
direct object is the one that is ''affected'' by the action. A direct
object pronoun is used to refer to the direct object of a previous sentence:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
El chico come '''la manzana'''.&lt;br&gt;
Él '''la''' come.
|
''The boy eats'' '''''the apple''''' ''.''&lt;br&gt;
''He eats'' '''''it''''' ''.''
|}

The following table shows the six types of direct object pronouns:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Object&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;English&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| yo || '''me'''     || ''me''            
|-
| tú || '''te'''     || ''you''           
|-
| él || '''lo'''  || ''him/it''
|-
| ella || '''la''' || her/it
|-
| usted || '''lo/la''' || you
|-
| nosotros || '''nos'''    || ''us, we''            
|-
| vosotros || '''os'''     || ''you (plural)''           
|-
| ellos || '''los''' || ''them (masculine)''     
|-
| ellas || '''las''' || ''them (feminine)''     
|-
| ustedes || '''los/las''' || ''you''
|}

In spanish tú is used for informal situations, and usted must be used when a formal treatment is needed.

Note: In Spain, ''le'' and ''les'' are used as the masculine direct object pronoun only when referring to people. If the antecedent of a direct object is masculine but non-human, ''lo'' or ''los'' are used instead. In most other Spanish speaking places, ''lo'' and ''los'' are used instead of ''le'' and ''les''.

=== Indirect Object Pronouns ===

An indirect object is an object that would be asked for with
''To whom...?'' or ''From whom...?''. It is called ''indirect'' because
it occurs usually together with a direct object which is affected directly
by the action: 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
La mujer da una manzana '''al chico'''.&lt;br&gt;
La mujer '''le''' da una manzana.
|
''The woman gives an apple'' '''''to the boy''''' ''.''&lt;br&gt;
''The woman gives'' '''''him''''' ''an apple''.
|}

The apple ''is given'' by the woman (direct). The boy gets
the ''given apple'' (indirect - depends on the apple being given).

Here is a table with all of the Spanish indirect object pronouns:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Indirect Object&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;English&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| yo || '''me'''     || ''to/from me''         
|-
| tú || '''te'''     || ''to/from you''        
|-
| él/ella/usted || '''le'''     || ''to/from him/her/you''
|-
| nosotros/nosotras || '''nos'''    || ''to/from us''         
|-
| vosotros/vosotras || '''os'''     || ''to/from you''        
|-
| ellos/ellas/ustedes || '''les'''    || ''to/from them/you''   
|}

=== Position Of Object Pronouns (Double Object Pronouns) ===

So far we have only seen sentences with one object pronoun. If there is
both a direct and an indirect object pronoun, the indirect pronoun usually comes
first:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
'''Te''' compro una bicicleta .&lt;br&gt;
'''Te''' '''la''' compro.
|
''I buy you a bike.''&lt;br&gt;
''I buy it for you.''
|}

Also, when both object pronouns are in the third person (either singular or plural),
the indirect pronoun changes from '''le/les''' to '''se''':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
El profesor '''le''' da unos libros.&lt;br&gt;
El profesor '''se''' '''los''' da.
|
''The professor gives her the books.''&lt;br&gt;
''The professor gives them to her.''
|}

In sentences that contain an infinitive or a participle, the object
pronoun may be either '''placed before''' the conjugated verb or it
maybe '''attached''' to the infinitive/participle:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
Carmen puede cantar el himno nacional.&lt;br&gt;
Carmen puede '''cantarlo'''. '''''or''''' Carmen '''lo''' puede cantar.
|
''Carmen can sing the national anthem.''&lt;br&gt;
''Carmen can sing it.''
|}

It is possible to have the two rules above working at the same time: A combination
of direct and indirect pronouns that is attached to an infinitive/participle:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
Quiero mostrarte una casa.&lt;br&gt;
Quiero '''mostrártela'''.
|
''I want to show you a house.''&lt;br&gt;
''I want to show it to you.''
|}

== Vocabulario (Vocabulary) - La comida (The food) ==

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
! Las comidas  
! The meals  
|-
| el desayuno || breakfast               
|-
| desayunar, tomar el desayuno || to have breakfast       
|-
| el almuerzo || lunch
|-
| almorzar || to have lunch
|-
| la cena || dinner                  
|-
| cenar || to have dinner                  
|-
| la comida || food, meal                  
|-
| comer || to eat                  
|}
&amp;nbsp;
In Spain and some other countries, ''comida'' is the midday meal.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
! Las comidas  
! The meals  
|-
| el desayuno || breakfast

|-
| comer (almorzar) || to eat, to lunch
|-
| la cena || dinner                  
|-
| cenar || to have dinner                  
|}
&amp;nbsp;
In other countries, for example Chile, ''comida'' is the last meal in the day.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
! Las comidas

|-
| el desayuno || breakfast

|-
| almorzar || to have lunch           
|-
| la comida (la cena) || dinner, main meal
|-
| comer (cenar) || to eat, to have dinner
|}

Instead of saying ''desayuno, comida y cena'' (Spain) or ''desayuno, almuerzo y comida'' (Chile, Colombia), it's safer to say ''desayuno, almuerzo y cena''.
&amp;nbsp;

The word ''comida'' has several meanings
*'''food''' ''Me gusta la comida mexicana''
*'''meal''' ''El desayuno es la principal comida del día''
*'''lunch''' ''La comida es a las 2 PM''
*'''dinner''' ''La comida es a las 9 PM''

Note that due to the pervasive influence of English, in many supermarkets there is a section called ''Vegetales'' instead of ''Verduras''. They mistranslate '''vegetable''', forgetting that this is not the same as English '''vegetal''' (relating to plants).

*&lt;b&gt;Legumbres&lt;/b&gt; means the same thing as &lt;b&gt;verduras&lt;/b&gt; (vegetables).

I have a question about the format in the vocabulary.
In my opinion, the correct translation for &quot;la manzana&quot; (for instance) is &quot;the applet&quot; and not &quot;applet&quot;. Is perfectly correct to say in Spanish &quot;manzana&quot;. I think that if we want to use &quot;el&quot; or &quot;la&quot; with the words for make more clear the genre we should translate that like &quot;the applet&quot;. That sounds more correct for me.

[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 19:47 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:I think the sentence &quot;Quiero mostrar una casa a ti.&quot; can be written as &quot;Quiero mostrarte una casa.&quot; The first form is correct, but it sounds somewhat foolish or childish.

:OASO (Octavio Salguero)

:I've changed the sentence OASO, (btw. feel free to just go and edit the pages right away if you see something that is incorrect and/or stylistically bad). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

== Platano and/or Banano? ==

[[User:Hlasso|Hlasso]] 22:22, 30 March 2006 (UTC) In some countries the words 'banano' and 'platano' are used for different fruits. Banano is very similar to platano, however, platano is bigger and requires cooking to be eaten. In several countries the green 'platano' (not reap yet) is fried to make 'Patacón'.

== Articles in Spanish ==

[[User:Hlasso|Hlasso]] 22:27, 30 March 2006 (UTC) I agree that translating &quot;la manzana&quot; to &quot;apple&quot; is incorrect. And I think this small error can be found throughout the document. For example: &quot;El Vocabulario&quot; is not common in spanish, books having a vocabulary usually have that section named &quot;Vocabulario&quot;.

I'd help modifying the pages, but I'd like to hear the main author point of view before doing so.</text>

As you have learned in the previous sections, the linear waves you studied in the previous section tend to disperse. However, there are nonlinear waves described by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) which admits solutions with nondispersing wave packets.

Here are two primary examples:
== Sine-Gordon ==
This is described by the PDE 

&lt;math&gt;\partial^2_x\phi-\partial^2_t\phi=\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.

== What is Differentiation? ==
Differentiation is an operation that allows us to find a function that outputs the '''rate of change''' of one variable with respect to another variable.  

Informally, we may suppose that we're tracking the position of a car on a two-lane road with no passing lanes.  Assuming the car never pulls off the road, we can abstractly study the car's position by assigning it a variable, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the car's position changes as the time changes, we say that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on time, or &lt;math&gt;x = f(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  This tells where the car is at each specific time.  Differentiation gives us a function &lt;math&gt;dx / dt&lt;/math&gt; which represents the car's speed, that is the rate of change of its position with respect to time.  

Equivalently, differentiation gives us the slope at any point of the graph of a non-linear function. For a linear function, of form &lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax+b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the slope. For non-linear functions, such as &lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x^2&lt;/math&gt;, the slope can depend on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; differentiation gives us a function which represents this slope.

== The Definition of Slope ==
Historically, the primary motivation for the study of '''differentiation''' was the tangent line problem: for a given curve, find the slope of the straight line that is tangent to the curve at a given point.  The word ''tangent'' comes from the Latin word ''tangens'', which means touching.  Thus, to solve the tangent line problem, we need to find the slope of a line that is &quot;touching&quot; a given curve at a given point, or, in modern language, that has the same slope.  But what exactly do we mean by &quot;slope&quot; for a curve?

The solution is obvious in some cases: for example, a line &lt;math&gt;y = m x + c&lt;/math&gt; is its own tangent; the slope at any point is &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  For the parabola &lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, the slope at the point &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;; the tangent line is horizontal.

But how can you find the slope of, say, &lt;math&gt;y = \sin  x + x^2&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x = 1.5&lt;/math&gt;? This is in general a nontrivial question, but first we will deal carefully with the slope of lines.

===Of a line===
[[Image:Lines with Gradients.svg|thumb|325px|right|Three lines with different slopes]]
The '''slope''' of a line, also called the '''gradient''' of the line, is a measure of its inclination. A line that is horizontal has slope 0, a line from the bottom left to the top right has a positive slope and a line from the top left to the bottom right has a negative slope.

The slope can be defined in two (equivalent) ways. The first way is to express it as how much the line climbs for a given motion horizontally. We denote a change in a quantity using the symbol &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced &quot;delta&quot;). Thus, a change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. We can therefore write this definition of slope as:
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Slope}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

An example may make this definition clearer. If we have two points on a line, &lt;math&gt;P \left(x_1,y_1 \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q \left( x_2,y_2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;, the change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = x_2 - x_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise, the change in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta y = y_2 - y_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
This leads to the very important result below.

{{Calculus/Def|
text=The slope of the line between the points &lt;math&gt;(x_1, y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2, y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

Alternatively, we can define slope trigonometrically , using the tangent function:
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Slope}=\tan\left( \alpha \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle from the rightward-pointing horizontal to the line, measured counter-clockwise. If you recall that the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate on the unit circle, you should be able to spot the equivalence here.

===Of a graph of a function===
The graphs of most functions we are interested in are not straight lines (although they can be), but rather curves. We cannot define the slope of a curve in the same way as we can for a line. In order for us to understand how to find the slope of a curve at a point, we will first have to cover the idea of '''tangency'''. Intuitively, a '''tangent''' is a line which ''just'' touches a curve at a point, such that the angle between them at that point is zero. Consider the following four curves and lines:

{| align=center
|align=center|'''(i)'''
|align=center|'''(ii)'''

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-roman&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; crosses, but is not tangent to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; crosses, and is tangent to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; crosses &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at two points, but is tangent to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; only at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are many lines that cross &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, but none are tangent. In fact, this curve has no tangent at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

A '''secant''' is a line drawn through two points on a curve. We can construct a definition of a tangent as the limit of a secant of the curve taken as the separation between the points tends to zero. Consider the diagram below.

[[image:Tangent_as_Secant_Limit.svg|center]]

As the distance &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; tends to zero, the secant line becomes the tangent at the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. The two points we draw our line through are:

::&lt;math&gt;P \left( x_0, f\left( x_0 \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;
and
:: &lt;math&gt;Q \left( x_0+h, f\left( x_0+h \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

As a secant line is simply a line and we know two points on it, we can find its slope, &lt;math&gt;m_h&lt;/math&gt;, using the formula from before:

::&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}&lt;/math&gt;

(We will refer to the slope as &lt;math&gt;m_h&lt;/math&gt; because it may, and generally will, depend on &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.) Substituting in the points on the line,

::&lt;math&gt;m_h = \frac{f\left( x_0+h \right) - f\left( x_0 \right)}{\left(x_0 + h \right) - x_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

This simplifies to

::&lt;math&gt;m_h = \frac{f\left( x_0+h \right) - f\left( x_0 \right)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is called the '''difference quotient'''. Note that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; can be positive or negative — it is perfectly valid to take a secant through any two points on the curve — but cannot be &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition of the tangent line we gave was not rigorous, since we've only defined limits of ''numbers'' — or, more precisely, of functions that output numbers — not of ''lines''. But we ''can'' define the ''slope'' of the tangent line at a point rigorously, by taking the limit of the slopes of the secant lines from the last paragraph. Having done so, we can ''then'' define the tangent line as well. Note that we cannot simply set &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; to zero as this would imply division of zero by zero which would yield an undefined result. Instead we must find the [[Calculus/Limits|'''limit''']] of the above expression as &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; '''tends''' to zero:

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (Slope of the graph of a function)
|text=
The '''slope''' of the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;(x_0,f(x_0))&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\left[\frac{f\left( x_0+h \right) - f\left( x_0 \right)}{h}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

If this limit does not exist, then we say the slope is '''undefined'''.

If the slope is defined, say &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''tangent line''' to the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;(x_0,f(x_0))&lt;/math&gt; is the line with equation

:&lt;math&gt;y-f(x_0) = m\cdot(x-x_0)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

This last equation is just the point-slope form for the line through &lt;math&gt;(x_0,f(x_0))&lt;/math&gt; with slope &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Rate of Change of a Function at a Point ==
Consider the formula for average velocity in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; over the time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;. This formula gives the average velocity over a period of time, but suppose we want to define the instantaneous velocity. To this end we look at the '''change in position as the change in time approaches 0'''. Mathematically this is written as:
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;, which we abbreviate by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. (The idea of this notation is that the letter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; denotes change.)  Compare the symbol &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. The idea is that both indicate a difference between two numbers, but &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; denotes a finite difference while &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; denotes an infinitesimal difference. Please note that the symbols &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; have no rigorous meaning on their own, since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \Delta t=0&lt;/math&gt;, and we can't divide by 0.

(Note that the letter &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is often used to denote distance, which would yield &lt;math&gt;\frac{ds}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. The letter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is often avoided in denoting distance due to the potential confusion resulting from the expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{dd}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.)

== The Definition of the Derivative ==
You may have noticed that the two operations we've discussed — computing the slope of the tangent to the graph of a function and computing the instantaneous rate of change of the function — involved exactly the same limit. That is, the slope of the tangent to the graph of &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; can, and generally will, depend on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, so we should really think of it as a ''function'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We call this process (of computing &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;) '''differentiation'''. Differentiation results in another function whose value for any value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the original function at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This function is known as the '''derivative''' of the original function.

&lt;!-- This is repeated below... --&gt;
Since lots of different sorts of people use derivatives, there are lots of different mathematical notations for them. Here are some:
* &lt;math&gt;f'(x)\ &lt;/math&gt; (read &quot;f prime of x&quot;) for the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;D_x[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;D f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; for the derivative of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[ y\right]&lt;/math&gt;, which is more useful in some cases.

Most of the time the brackets are not needed, but are useful for clarity if we are dealing with something like &lt;math&gt;D (fg)&lt;/math&gt;, where we want to differentiate the product of two functions, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The first notation has the advantage that it makes clear that the derivative is a function. That is, if we want to talk about the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;, we can just write &lt;math&gt;f'(2)&lt;/math&gt;.

In any event, here is the formal definition:

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (derivative)
|text=Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a function. Then &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt; wherever this limit exists. In this case we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''differentiable''' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and its '''derivative''' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

=== Examples ===

'''Example 1'''

The derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x/2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{\frac{x+\Delta x}{2} - \frac{x}{2}}{\Delta x}\right)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{\frac{x}{2}+\frac{\Delta x}{2} - \frac{x}{2}}{\Delta x}\right)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{\frac{\Delta x}{2}}{\Delta x}\right)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2 \Delta x}\right)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;,

no matter what &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is. This is consistent with the definition of the derivative as the slope of a function.

'''Example 2'''

What is the slope of the graph of &lt;math&gt; y=3x^2 &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(4,48)&lt;/math&gt;? We can do it &quot;the hard (and imprecise) way&quot;, ''without'' using differentiation, as follows, using a calculator and using small differences below and above the given point:

When &lt;math&gt;x=3.999&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y=47.976003&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;x=4.001&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y=48.024003&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the difference between the two values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Delta x=0.002&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the difference between the two values of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Delta y=0.048&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the slope &lt;math&gt;= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = 24&lt;/math&gt; at the point of the graph at which &lt;math&gt;x=4&lt;/math&gt;.

But, to solve the problem precisely, we compute

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{3(4+\Delta x)^2-48}{\Delta x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{(4+\Delta x)^2-16}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{16+8\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2-16}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{8\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}(8+\Delta x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3(8)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;24&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
We were lucky this time; the approximation we got above turned out to be exactly right. But this won't always be so, and, anyway, this way we didn't need a calculator.

In general, the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x^2&lt;/math&gt; is

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;f'(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{3(x+\Delta x)^2-3x^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{(x+\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{x^2+2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}(2x+\Delta x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3(2x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;6x&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

'''Example 3'''

If &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left|x\right|&lt;/math&gt; (the absolute value function) then &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \frac{x}{\left|x\right|}&lt;/math&gt;, which can also be stated as &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} -1, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\ \operatorname{undefined}, &amp; x = 0 \\ 1, &amp; x &gt; 0 \end{matrix} \right. .&lt;/math&gt; Finding this derivative is a bit complicated, so we won't prove it at this point.


Here, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not smooth (though it is continuous) at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and so the limits &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^{+}} f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^{-}} f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; (the limits as 0 is approached from the right and left respectively) are not equal. From the definition, &lt;math&gt;f'(0)=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{\left|\Delta x\right|}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;, which does not exist. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f'(0)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined, and so &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a discontinuity at 0.  This sort of point of non-differentiability is called a cusp.  Functions may also not be differentiable because they go to infinity at a point, or oscillate infinitely frequently.

===Understanding the derivative notation===
{{Wikipedia|Notation for differentiation}}
The derivative notation is special and unique in mathematics.  The most common notation for derivatives you'll run into when first starting out with differentiating is the Leibniz notation, expressed as &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.  You may think of this as &quot;rate of change in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.  You may also think of it as &quot;infinitesimal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; divided by infinitesimal value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.  Either way is a good way of thinking, although you should remember that the precise definition is the one we gave above.  Often, in an equation, you will see just &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, which literally means &quot;derivative with respect to x&quot;.  This means we should take the derivative of whatever is written to the right; that is, &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(x+2)&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y=x+2&lt;/math&gt;.

As you advance through your studies, you will see that we sometimes pretend that &lt;math&gt;dy&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; are separate entities that can be multiplied and divided, by writing things like &lt;math&gt;dy=x^4\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.  Eventually you will see derivatives such as &lt;math&gt;\frac {dx} {dy}&lt;/math&gt;, which just means that the input variable of our function is called &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and our output variable is called &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; sometimes, we will write &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dy}&lt;/math&gt;, to mean the derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of whatever is written on the right.  In general, the variables could be anything, say &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\theta}{dr}&lt;/math&gt;.

All of the following are equivalent for expressing the derivative of &lt;math&gt;y = x^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x^{2} = 2x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;dy = 2x dx \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f '(x) = 2x \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;D(f(x)) = 2x \ &lt;/math&gt;

==Differentiation Rules==
The process of differentiation is tedious for complicated functions. Therefore, rules for differentiating general functions have been developed, and can be proved with a little effort. Once sufficient rules have been proved, it will be fairly easy to differentiate a wide variety of functions.  Some of the simplest rules involve the derivative of linear functions.

===Derivative of a constant function===
For any fixed real number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[c\right]=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Intuition====

The graph of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = c&lt;/math&gt; is a horizontal line, which has a constant slope of zero. Therefore, it should be expected that the derivative of this function is zero, regardless of the values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof====

The definition of a derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; f(x) = c &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. (That is, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a constant function.) Then &lt;math&gt; f(x+\Delta x) = c &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left[c\right] = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{c-c}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{0}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;g(\Delta x)=\frac{0}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;.  To prove that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}g(\Delta x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, we need to find a positive &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that, for any given positive &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|g(\Delta x)-0\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|\Delta x-0\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  But &lt;math&gt;\left|g(\Delta x)-0\right|=0&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\left|g(\Delta x)-0\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any choice of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

====Examples====

#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3\right]=0&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[z\right]=0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, in the second example, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is just a constant.

===Derivative of a linear function===
For any fixed real numbers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding: 1em 10em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[mx+c\right]=m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The special case &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dx} = 1&lt;/math&gt; shows the advantage of the &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; notation—rules are intuitive by basic algebra, though this does not constitute a proof, and can lead to misconceptions to what exactly &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dy&lt;/math&gt; actually are.

====Intuition====
The graph of &lt;math&gt;y=mx+c&lt;/math&gt; is a line with constant slope &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof====
If &lt;math&gt;f(x)=mx+c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x+\Delta x)=m(x+\Delta x)+c&lt;/math&gt;. So, 

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;f'(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{m(x+\Delta x)+c-mx-c}{\Delta x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{m(x+\Delta x)-mx}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{mx+m\Delta x-mx}{\Delta x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{m\Delta x}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;m.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Constant multiple and addition rules ===

Since we already know the rules for some very basic functions, we would like to be able to take the derivative of more complex functions by breaking them up into simpler functions. Two tools that let us do this are the constant multiple rule and the addition rule.

====The Constant Rule====
For any fixed real number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding: 1em 10em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[cf(x)\right] = c \frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The reason, of course, is that one can factor &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; out of the numerator, and then of the entire limit, in the definition.  The details are left as an [[Calculus/Differentiation/Exercises|exercise]].

'''Example'''

We already know that 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^2\right]=2x&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose we want to find the derivative of &lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;3\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\times2x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;6x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Another simple rule for breaking up functions is the addition rule.

====The Addition and Subtraction Rules====
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding: 1em 10em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)\pm g(x)\right]= \frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)\right]\pm\frac{d}{dx}\left[g(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''Proof'''

From the definition:

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left[\frac{[f(x+\Delta x) \pm g(x + \Delta x)] - [f(x) \pm g(x)]}{\Delta x}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} 
   \left[\frac{[f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)] \pm [g(x + \Delta x) - g(x)]}{\Delta x}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \left[\frac{[f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)]}{\Delta x}\right]
  \pm \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \left[\frac{[g(x+\Delta x) - g(x)]}{\Delta x}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

By definition then, this last term is &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left[f(x)\right] \pm \frac{d}{dx}\left[g(x)\right] &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example'''

What is the derivative of &lt;math&gt;3x^2+5x&lt;/math&gt;?

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2+5x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2+5x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[5x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;6x+\frac{d}{dx}\left[5x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;6x+5\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

The fact that both of these rules work is extremely significant mathematically because it means that differentiation is '''linear'''.  You can take an equation, break it up into terms, figure out the derivative individually and build the answer back up, and nothing
odd will happen.

We now need only one more piece of information before we
can take the derivatives of any polynomial.

===The Power Rule===
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding: 1em 10em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^n\right]=nx^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This has been proved in an example in [[Calculus/Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithm Functions|Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithm Functions]]  where it can be best understood.  

For example, in the case of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; the derivative is &lt;math&gt;2x^1=2x&lt;/math&gt; as was established earlier.  A special case of this rule is that &lt;math&gt;dx/dx=dx^1/dx=1x^0=1&lt;/math&gt;.  

Since polynomials are sums of monomials, using this rule and the addition rule lets you differentiate any polynomial.  A relatively simple proof for this can be derived from the binomial expansion theorem.

This rule also applies to fractional and negative powers.  Therefore

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[\sqrt x \right]&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[ x^{1/2}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 2 x^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {2\sqrt x}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Derivatives of polynomials===
With these rules in hand, you can now find the derivative of any polynomial you come across.  Rather than write the general formula, let's go step by step
through the process.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[6x^5+3x^2+3x+1\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The first thing we can do is to use the addition rule to split the
equation up into terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[6x^5\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[1\right].&lt;/math&gt;

We can immediately use the linear and constant rules to get rid of
some terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[6x^5\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2\right]+3+0.&lt;/math&gt;

Now you may use the constant multiplier rule to move the constants outside the derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;6\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^5\right]+3\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^2\right]+3.&lt;/math&gt;

Then use the power rule to work with the individual monomials:

:&lt;math&gt;6\left(5x^4\right)+3\left(2x\right)+3.&lt;/math&gt;

And then do some algebra to get the final answer:

:&lt;math&gt;30x^4+6x+3.\,&lt;/math&gt;

These are not the only differentiation rules. There are other, more advanced, differentiation rules, which will be described in a later chapter.

===Exercises===
* Find the derivatives of the following equations:
{{question-answer|question=7. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 42 &lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=0 &lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{question-answer|question=8. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 6x + 10 &lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=6 &lt;/math&gt;}}}}

== Fourier Transform ==

So far, you've learned how to superimpose a finite number of sinusoidal waves. However, a wave in general can't be expressed as the sum of a finite number of sines and cosines. Fortunately, we have a theorem called Fourier's theorem which basically states that under certain technical assumptions, any function, f(x) is equal to an integral over sines and cosines. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(c_1(k)\cos(kx)+c_2(k)\sin(kx)) dk&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, if we're given the wave function when t=0, &amp;phi;(x,0) and the velocity of each sine wave as a function of its wave number, v(k), then we can compute &amp;phi;(x,t) for any t by taking the inverse Fourier transform of &amp;phi;(x,0) conducting a phase shift, and then taking the Fourier transform.

Fortunately, the inverse Fourier transform is very similar to the Fourier transform itself.

:&lt;math&gt;c_1(k)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\cos (kx)\,dx \quad
c_2(k)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \sin (kx)\,dx &lt;/math&gt;

This tells us that, since waves which are very spread out, like the sine wave, have a narrow range of wave numbers, wave functions whose wave numbers are very spread out will only be significant at a narrow range of positions.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===Writing General Chemistry Reactions===
In organic chemistry, a reaction may be written precisely as it is for general chemistry if only a basic amount of information is needed.  For example, when a haloalkane is turned into an alkene, the reaction may be written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O --&gt; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HBr + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately, this method of notation does not tell anyone very much about the reaction, and it takes expertise to know exactly what is going on.  A new student to organic chemistry probably would not notice that the product molecule contains one site of unsaturation due to a double bond between carbon atoms number one and number two.  Because it is so general, this notation is good for general chemistry, but organic chemistry requires more precision.

For most students, common practices in writing organic reactions will be different than used in general chemistry.


===Differences in Organic Chemistry Notation===
Organic chemistry reactions are often '''not''' written as '''balanced''' equations. This is because many organic chemists - who are just as lazy as anyone else - tend to be more interested in the ''organic product'' of a reaction than in anything else going on in the reaction.  Side products are often ignored, and just as often catalysts and solution notation may be highly abbreviated or left out altogether.  As you gain familiarity with organic chemistry you will come to understand just what may be abbreviated or left out, but in the beginning this can be a source of frustration.

Another difference is that modified Lewis drawings of molecules are often used instead of molecular formulas. This makes sense due to the fact that organic molecules are often rather large in size and complicated in structure, so that they can be more easily understood in the form of a drawing as opposed to a word-formula.  A two-dimensional drawing reveals some of the three-dimensional shape of the molecule, but when necessary even three-dimensional drawings are used to depict reactants and products.

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:imaginary_organic_molecule.gif |center| This image depicts the complicated interconnectivity and structure of an imaginary organic molecule]]
&lt;br&gt;

Working with the above drawing of a molecule may be difficult, but it is still far easier than using its name, or attempting to guess at the structure and functionality of a molecule using just its chemical formula of &lt;code&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;COOH&lt;/code&gt;.

===Examples of Organic Chemistry Notation===
Typically organic chemistry molecules are drawn as modified Lewis structures.  If you remember, a Lewis structure uses lines to connect chemical symbols together, illustrating a covalent bond, and also uses dots to represent non-bond electrons.  This is shown in the diagram below of carbon dioxide.  The drawing illustrates the four electrons of carbon participating in two double bonds with two oxygen atoms, and also the non-bonding electron pairs for each atom of oxygen.

[[image:Lewis_carbon_dioxide.gif | Lewis Diagram of Carbon Dioxide, Illustrating Double Bonds and Free Electrons]]

In organic chemistry, there are a '''lot''' of carbons in every molecule, generally, so organic chemists by convention do not draw every single carbon in every molecule.  The same is true of hydrogens attached to the carbons; it is twice the annoyance to draw thirty hydrogens in a fatty acid than it is to draw the fifteen carbons.  Therefore, in organic chemistry, carbon atoms are assumed to be wherever a line or line segment begins or ends.  Furthermore, enough hydrogen atoms are assumed to be attached to any carbon not marked with a + or - sign (indicating an ionic charge) to bring that carbon's total number of bonds to four.  At first this notation may be confusing, but the shorthand method rapidly proves its worth.

'''Computer programming''' is the craft of writing useful, maintainable, and extensible source code which can be interpreted or compiled by a computing system to perform a meaningful task. Programming a computer can be performed in one of numerous languages, ranging from a higher-level language to writing directly in low-level machine code (that is, code that more directly controls the specifics of the computer's hardware) all the way down to writing microcode (which does directly control the electronics in the computer).

Using programming languages and markup languages (such as [[XHTML]] and [[XForms]]) require some of the same skills, but using markup languages is generally not considered &quot;programming.&quot;  Nevertheless, many markup languages allow inclusion of scripts, e.g. many HTML documents contain [[JavaScript]].  There are exceptions where markup languages do represent programming such as SuperX++ (http://xplusplus.sourceforge.net/) and o:XML (http://www.o-xml.org/)

Computer programming is one part of a much larger discipline known as [[w:software engineer|software engineering]], which includes several different aspects of making software including design, construction and quality control. The subject of this book is software construction, that is, programming.  Computer programming is also a useful skill (though not always necessary) for people who are interested in [[subject:computer science|computer science]].  Whereas software engineering is interested specifically in making software, computer science tends to be oriented towards more theoretical or mathematical problems.

== Getting started ==
{{wikiversity|Topic:Computer programming}}
Many people think they must choose a specific programming language in order to become a programmer, believing that they can only do that language. They ask themselves, &quot;Should I be a '''C''' programmer or a '''Java''' programmer?&quot; That's completely the wrong question. The right question is &quot;How can I become a '''good''' programmer?&quot; Unfortunately the employment market has contributed greatly to misconceptions about computer programming by companies advertising for employees with a specific (therefore limited) computer language skill-set and responses being handled by human resources(HR), without someone with a programming background.

There are a few points one can make about what a good programmer knows about specific computer languages.  First - many languages are based on the same fundamental building blocks.  Learning a language should be seen more as a way of acquiring those concepts than language or machine specific techniques.  Second - good programmers are generally competent in more than one language because it is naturally interesting and useful to find different ways of solving problems.  It is not necessary to master many different languages or even more than one -- a programmer could excel in one language and have only a vague working idea how to program others. It is useful to know many different methods for solving computer problems, also known as algorithms. An [[w:algorithm|algorithm]] is a list of well-defined instructions for completing a task, and knowing several languages means having the ability to list the computer instructions in many different ways.  Since computer programming languages have so much in common, it is generally easy to learn a new programming language once you have mastered another.

So how do you get started?  One reasonable technique would be to just pick a language and run with it.  Unfortunately, we cannot suggest what the right computer language might be for all people for all purposes.  Ask ten programmers what language you should learn and you will get ten different responses.  Given the collaborative nature of this wikibook, you'll probably get as many responses as there are programming language books on the site.

== Families of languages ==
There is a common misconception by people unfamiliar with computer programming that all programming languages are essentially the same.  In one sense this is true because all digital electronic computers translate programming languages into strings of ones and zeros called binary, or [[w:Machine code|Machine code]].

While mainstream, personal computer languages tend to be derived from a specific tradition and are very similar (hence the popularity of this misconception), some languages fall into different paradigms which provide for a radically different programming experience.  Programming in [[Java Programming|Java]] is quite different from programming in [[Subject:Assembly languages|assembly language]], which is quite different from programming in [[Haskell]] or [[Prolog]] or Forth, etc.

In the American Scientist article [http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/51982#52116 The Semicolon Wars], Brian Hayes classifies languages into four categories: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and declarative.  Imperative and object-oriented languages tend to be used in the mainstream, whereas functional and declarative languages tend to be used in academic settings.  Functional and declarative programming enthusiasts might argue that the paradigms are 20 years ahead of the mainstream and superior in many respects; however, mainstream language advocates would probably counter that such paradigms are hard to learn, or not very practical for their own unpopularity, among other things.  We do not make any claims about who is right on this matter, but at the very least, we will suggest that building familiarity with the four major paradigms is an extremely valuable exercise.

When it comes to computers, all things are made, and function primarily by, programming. Although programming is an essential part of the functionality of any computer or application, not all programming languages are the same. In fact, they are very different from one another with different uses, functionality, and different levels of complexity. A programming language, in the most basic way, is a set of rules or guidelines that is used to write the computer programs. Even though you are writing the program, you may need a certain type of software or program for the language that you use. There are many different types of programming languages that can be used and each has a different set of rules. Programming has two basic categories. There are low-level and high-level languages, the difference between the two is that low-level languages often use 0s and 1s, and this works because it gives the computer the ability to quickly understand what needs to be done or executed. High level languages are easier to write because they are much closer to the English language and are much more flexible to write with, although there are also different levels of this readability as well and different categories of these languages that can be written.  A few examples would be Visual Basic, C++, and Java.

== Common concepts ==
Programming languages tend to have many general concepts in common.  One can examine the recurring concepts and how they are expressed in various languages in the following table.

{{:Computer Programming/Language concepts}}  

To see a comparison of syntax in various programming languages, see [[Computer Programming/Hello world|these &quot;Hello World&quot; examples]].  For a list including various computer languages arranged together by syntax terms and patterns, see [[Wikipedia:Lists of computer syntax patterns|Wikipedia's lists of computer syntax patterns]].

== Programming skills ==
Computer programming is really just about solving problems.  It turns out that a large number of the problems you encounter in the real world are really just special cases of a more general problem.  Luckily for you, many of these problems have been studied by computer scientists for a very long time, sometimes leading to provably unbeatable solutions, or sometimes solutions which are &quot;good enough&quot; for every day needs.  In short, learning a language gives you skills, but learning data structures and algorithms shows you how to use these skills wisely.

The following languages deserve special mention, being significant languages in the development of structured programming languages and object-oriented programming. They are worth understanding for the concepts they introduced.

; [[w:ALGOL|ALGOL]] : was the first structured programming language and as such is the basis for all modern imperative languages. It was built around the notion of a block, delimited by BEGIN and END containing declarations and statements. ALGOL is a recursive general-purpose language, including recursive calls at a time when this was thought too difficult in languages like FORTRAN and COBOL. ALGOL is a stack language, so as blocks are entered, the declared variables are pushed on the stack and when a block exits, the stack is reduced. A block without declarations is not actually a block, but a compound statement, causing no stack building overhead. ALGOL was first developed as [[w:ALGOL 58|ALGOL 58]], based on the formal [[w: Backus-Naur Form|BNF (Backus-Naur Form)]] language design notation. ALGOL-60 was a revision and this formed the basis of many other languages such as [[w:ALGOL 68|ALGOL-68]], [[w:ALGOL W|ALGOL-W]], Pascal, [[w:Modula-2|Modula-2]], [[w:Oberon programming language|Oberon]], C, C++, Java, Simula, Ada, and Eiffel. ALGOL-60 was the first language used for systems programming in the [[w:Burroughs B5000|Burroughs B5000]] stack machines operating system in the early 1960s (when all else was programmed in assembler and where ALGOL is still used in 2006 [http://public.support.unisys.com/aseries/docs/ClearPath-MCP-10.1/PDF/86000098-506.pdf Current ALGOL manual] ). Learning ALGOL will teach you the basis of block-structured languages and structured programming concepts.

; [[w:Simula|Simula]] : was the first object-oriented language developed in 1967 using ALGOL-60 as a basis (much as C++ used C). It was originally conceived as a simulation language (hence the name) to model real world systems. As ALGOL had been a block-structured language with blocks entered on the stack as they were called and deleted from the stack when exited, Simula liberated programs from this restriction. Thus a block could be entered but when the code exited, the block persisted on the heap, rather than on the stack – thus the object was born. However, unlike records and structures (structs) of other languages, procedures were associated with this saved block so a programmer could define an entire algebra to manipulate entities. Thus variables declared as part of the outer block (class) persisted beyond the original invocation of the block code (which would now be considered a constructor or creation routine). Local variables and arguments to the procedures in the class would be pushed on the stack when called and popped when exited, but would manipulate the object’s persistent state. Class facilities could be abstracted by use of inheritance. Simula also included a sophisticated concurrency paradigm. Learning Simula will teach you object-oriented and simulation concepts along with concurrency concepts and the use of coroutines and cooperating processes.

; [[Smalltalk]] : was developed by [[w:Adele Goldberg (computer scientist)|Adele Goldberg]], [[w:Alan Kay|Alan Kay]] (the real inventor of Windows) and others at Xerox PARC. It is an object-oriented language with a natural language syntax. It is a typeless language and thus very flexible and dynamic, resulting in quick turn around of code, but can result in exceptions at run time that would have been caught at compile time by a typed language. Its concepts were the basis of Objective-C. Learning Smalltalk will teach you object-oriented programming in a typeless language with a very different syntax.

; [[Subject:C++ programming language|C++]] : '''C++''' (pronounced &quot;see plus plus&quot;) is a general-purpose, object-oriented, statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm programming language supporting procedural programming, data abstraction, and generic programming. During the 1990s, C++ became one of the most popular [[w:computer programming languages|computer programming languages]].
:[[w:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup]] from Bell Labs was the designer and original implementer of C++ (originally named &quot;C with Classes&quot;) during the 1980s as an enhancement to the [[C  programming language]]. Enhancements started with the addition of [[C++ Programming/Classes|classes]], followed by, among many features, [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|virtual functions]], [[C++ Programming/Operators/Operator Overloading|operator overloading]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|multiple inheritance]], [[C++ Programming/Templates|templates]], and [[C++ Programming/Exception Handling|exception handling]], these and other features are covered in detail in several Wikibooks on the subject.
:The C++ programming language standard was ratified in 1998 as ''[[w:ISO/IEC 14882|ISO/IEC 14882]]:1998'', the current version of which is the 2003 version, ''ISO/IEC 14882:2003''.
:The 1998 C++ Standard consists of two parts: the Core Language and the Standard Library; the latter includes the [[C++ Programming/STL|Standard Template Library]] and C's Standard Library. Many C++ libraries exist which are not part of the Standard, such as [[w:Boost (programming)|Boost]]. Also, non-Standard libraries written in C can generally be used by C++ programs.
:Features introduced in C++ include declarations as statements, function-like casts, &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt;/&lt;tt&gt;delete&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bool&lt;/tt&gt;, reference types, &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;inline&lt;/tt&gt; functions, default arguments, function overloading, namespaces, classes (including all class-related features such as inheritance, member functions, virtual functions, abstract classes, and constructors), operator overloading, templates, the &lt;tt&gt;::&lt;/tt&gt; operator, exception handling, run-time type identification, and more type checking in several cases. Comments starting with two slashes (&quot;&lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;) were originally part of [[w:BCPL|BCPL]], and was reintroduced in C++. Several features of C++ were later adopted by C, including &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;inline&lt;/tt&gt;, declarations in &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loops, and C++-style comments (using the &lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt; symbol).

; [[Visual Basic]] : Visual Basic (VB) is one of the worlds most commonly used programing languages. This is because of its simplicity and ease of use. One of the most basic functions of VB is the message box command. If I wanted to make a message box appear with a chosen message, all i would have to type would be: msgbox &quot;hello word&quot;

=== Editors ===
It is said that a programmer's best friend is the editor. A good editor is lightweight, has only essential tools and should support syntax highlighting for your language. 

Examples of good editors for which we have teaching books are &lt;small&gt;(alphabetically)&lt;/small&gt;:

; [[Learning the vi Editor/Vim|Vim]] {{stage|100%|Feb 7, 2005}}: An abbreviation of &lt;b&gt;Vi&lt;/b&gt; I&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;proved, this editor is modelled on the classic Unix editor vi. However, Vim is a much more modern editor with an optional graphical interface and quite a few features vi doesn't have, making it the editor of choice for someone experienced with vi.

Like most programming languages, C is able to use and process named variables and their contents. '''Variables''' are simply names used to refer to some location in memory – a location that holds a value with which we are working. 

It may help to think of variables as a placeholder for a value. You can think of a variable as being equivalent to its assigned value. So, if you have a variable ''i'' that is '''initialized''' (set equal) to 4, then it follows that ''i + 1'' will equal ''5''.

Since C is a relatively low-level programming language, before a C program can utilize memory to store a variable it must claim the memory needed to store the values for a variable. This is done by '''declaring''' variables. Declaring variables is the way in which a C program shows the number of variables it needs, what they are going to be named, and how much memory they will need.

Within the C programming language, when managing and working with variables, it is important to know the ''type'' of variables and the ''size'' of these types. Since C is a fairly low-level programming language, these aspects of its working can be hardware specific – that is, how the language is made to work on one type of machine can be different from how it is made to work on another.

All variables in C are '''typed'''. That is, every variable declared must be assigned as a certain type of variable.

== Declaring, Initializing, and Assigning Variables ==
Here is an example of declaring an integer, which we've called &lt;tt&gt;some_number&lt;/tt&gt;. (Note the semicolon at the end of the line; that is how your compiler separates one program ''statement'' from another.)

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int some_number;
&lt;/source&gt;

This statement means we're declaring some space for a variable called some_number, which will be used to store &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;eger data. Note that we must specify the type of data that a variable will store. There are specific keywords to do this – we'll look at them in the next section.

Multiple variables can be declared with one statement, like this:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int anumber, anothernumber, yetanothernumber;
&lt;/source&gt;
We can also declare ''and'' assign some content to a variable at the same time.
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int some_number = 3;
&lt;/source&gt;
This is called ''initialization''.

In early versions of C, variables had to be declared at the beginning of a block. In C99 it is allowed to mix declarations and statements arbitrarily – but doing so is not usual, because it is rarely necessary, some compilers still don’t support C99 (portability), and it may, because it is uncommon yet, irritate fellow programmers (maintainability).

After declaring variables, you can assign a value to a variable later on using a statement like this:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
some_number = 3;
&lt;/source&gt;
You can also assign a variable the value of another variable, like so:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;  
anumber = anothernumber;
&lt;/source&gt;
Or assign multiple variables the same value with one statement:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
anumber = anothernumber = yetanothernumber = 3;
&lt;/source&gt;
This is because the assignment &lt;tt&gt;x = y&lt;/tt&gt; returns the value of the assignment. &lt;tt&gt;x = y = z &lt;/tt&gt; is really shorthand for &lt;tt&gt;x = (y = z)&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Naming Variables===
Variable names in C are made up of letters (upper and lower case) and digits. The underscore character (&quot;_&quot;) is also permitted. Names must not begin with a digit. Unlike some languages (such as [[w:Perl|Perl]] and some [[w:BASIC programming language|BASIC]] dialects), C does not use any special prefix characters on variable names.

Some examples of valid (but not very descriptive) C variable names:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
foo
Bar
BAZ
foo_bar
_foo42
_
QuUx
&lt;/source&gt;
Some examples of invalid C variable names:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
2foo    (must not begin with a digit)
my foo  (spaces not allowed in names)
$foo    ($ not allowed -- only letters, digits, and _)
while   (language keywords cannot be used as names)
&lt;/source&gt;
As the last example suggests, certain words are reserved as keywords in the language, and these cannot be used as variable names.

In addition there are certain sets of names that, while not language keywords, are reserved for one reason or another. For example, a C compiler might use certain names &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, and this might cause problems for a program that attempts to use them. Also, some names are reserved for possible future use in the C standard library. The rules for determining exactly what names are reserved (and in what contexts they are reserved) are too complicated to describe here{{fact}}, and as a beginner you don't need to worry about them much anyway. For now, just avoid using names that begin with an underscore character.

The naming rules for C variables also apply to naming other language constructs such as function names, struct tags, and macros, all of which will be covered later.

== Literals ==

Anytime within a program in which you specify a value explicitly instead of referring to a variable or some other form of data, that value is referred to as a '''literal'''. In the initialization example above, 3 is a literal. Literals can either take a form defined by their type (more on that soon), or one can use hexadecimal (hex) notation to directly insert data into a variable regardless of its type.{{fact}} Hex numbers are always preceded with ''0x''. For now, though, you probably shouldn't be too concerned with hex.

== The Four Basic Data Types ==

In Standard C there are four basic data types. They are &lt;code&gt;'''int'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''char'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''float'''&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;'''double'''&lt;/code&gt;.

We will briefly describe them here, then go into more detail in [[C Programming/Types]].

===The &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type===
The &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; type stores integers in the form of &quot;whole numbers&quot;. An integer is typically the size of one machine word, which on most modern home PCs is 32 bits (4 octets). Examples of literals are whole numbers (integers) such as 1,2,3, 10, 100... When &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; is 32 bits (4 octets), it can store any whole number (integer) between -2147483648 and 2147483647. A 32 bit word (number) has the possibility of representing any one number out of 4294967296 possibilities (2 to the power of 32).

&lt;!-- overflows --&gt;

If you want to declare a new int variable, use the &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. For example:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int numberOfStudents, i, j=5;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this declaration we declare 3 variables, numberOfStudents, i and j, j here is assigned the literal 5.

===The &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type===
The &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type is capable of holding any member of the execution [[w:Character_encoding#Character_sets.2C_maps_and_code_pages|character set]]. It stores the same kind of data as an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. integers), but typically has a size of one byte. The size of a byte is specified by the macro &lt;code&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/code&gt; which specifies the number of bits in a char (byte). In standard C it never can be less than 8 bits. A variable of type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; is most often used to store character data, hence its name. Most implementations use the [[w:ASCII|ASCII]] character set as the execution character set, but it's best not to know or care about that unless the actual values are important.

Examples of character literals are 'a', 'b', '1', etc., as well as some special characters such as '&lt;code&gt;\0&lt;/code&gt;' (the null character) and '&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;' (newline, recall &quot;Hello, World&quot;). Note that the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; value must be enclosed within single quotations.

When we initialize a character variable, we can do it two ways. One is preferred, the other way is '''''bad''''' programming practice.

The first way is to write
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
char letter1 = 'a';
&lt;/source&gt;

This is ''good'' programming practice in that it allows a person reading your code to understand that letter1 is being initialized with the letter 'a' to start off with.

The second way, which should ''not'' be used when you are coding letter characters, is to write
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
char letter2 = 97; /* in ASCII, 97 = 'a' */
&lt;/source&gt;

This is considered by some to be extremely '''''bad''''' practice, if we are using it to store a character, not a small number, in that if someone reads your code, most readers are forced to look up what character corresponds with the number 97 in the encoding scheme. In the end, &lt;code&gt;letter1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;letter2&lt;/code&gt; store both the same thing – the letter 'a', but the first method is clearer, easier to debug, and much more straightforward. 

One important thing to mention is that characters for numerals are represented differently from their corresponding number, i.e. '1' is not equal to 1. In short, any single entry that is enclosed within 'single quotes'.

There is one more kind of literal that needs to be explained in connection with chars: the '''string literal'''. A string is a series of characters, usually intended to be displayed. They are surrounded by double quotations (&quot; &quot;, not ' '). An example of a string literal is the &quot;Hello, World!\n&quot; in the &quot;Hello, World&quot; example.

The string literal is assigned to a character &lt;b&gt;array&lt;/b&gt;, arrays are described later. 
Example:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
const char MY_CONSTANT_PEDANTIC_ITCH[] = &quot;learn the usage context.\n&quot;;
printf(&quot;Square brackets after a variable name means it is a pointer to a string of memory blocks the size of the type of the array element.\n&quot;);

&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; type === 
&lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; is short for '''floating point'''. It stores real numbers also, but is only one machine word in size. Therefore, it is used when less precision than a double provides is required. &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; literals must be suffixed with F or f, otherwise they will be interpreted as doubles. Examples are: 3.1415926f, 4.0f, 6.022e+23f. &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; variables can be declared using the &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.

===The &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; type===
The &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; types are very similar. The &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; type allows you to store single-precision floating point numbers, while the &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; keyword allows you to store double-precision floating point numbers – real numbers, in other words, both integer and non-integer values. Its size is typically two machine words, or 8 bytes on most machines. Examples of &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; literals are 3.1415926535897932, 4.0, 6.022e+23 ([[w:Scientific notation|scientific notation]]). If you use 4 instead of 4.0, the 4 will be interpreted as an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;.

The distinction between floats and doubles was made because of the differing sizes of the two types. When C was first used, space was at a minimum and so the judicious use of a float instead of a double saved some memory. Nowadays, with memory more freely available, you do not really need to conserve memory like this – it may be better to use doubles consistently. Indeed, some C implementations use doubles instead of floats when you declare a float variable.

If you want to use a double variable, use the &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.

== &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt; ==
If you have any doubts as to the amount of memory actually used by any variable (and this goes for types we'll discuss later, also), you can use the &lt;tt&gt;'''sizeof'''&lt;/tt&gt; operator to find out for sure. (For completeness, it is important to mention that &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt; is a [[w:Unary operation|unary operator]], not a function.) Its syntax is:

&lt;!-- Note: sizeof really needs the parentheses only when the argument is a type, see ISO 9899:2011 6.5.3.4/2 ``The sizeof operator yields the size (in bytes) of its operand, which may be an expression or the parenthesized name of a type.'' --&gt;
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
sizeof object
sizeof(type)
&lt;/source&gt;

The two expressions above return the size of the object and type specified, in bytes. The return type is &lt;tt&gt;size_t&lt;/tt&gt; (defined in the header &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stddef.h&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) which is an unsigned value. Here's an example usage:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
size_t size;
int i;
size = sizeof(i);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;size&lt;/tt&gt; will be set to 4, assuming &lt;tt&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/tt&gt; is defined as 8, and an integer is 32 bits wide. The value of &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt;'s result is the number of bytes.

Note that when &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt; is applied to a &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;, the result is 1; that is:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
sizeof(char)
&lt;/source&gt;

always returns 1.

== Data type modifiers ==

One can alter the data storage of any data type by preceding it with certain modifiers.

&lt;tt&gt;'''long'''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;'''short'''&lt;/tt&gt; are modifiers that make it possible for a data type to use either more or less memory. The &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; keyword need not follow the &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; keywords. This is most commonly the case. A &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; can be used where the values fall within a lesser range than that of an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, typically -32768 to 32767.  A &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to contain an extended range of values. It is not guaranteed that a &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; uses less memory than an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, nor is it guaranteed that a &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; takes up more memory than an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. It is only guaranteed that sizeof(short) &lt;= sizeof(int) &lt;= sizeof(long).  Typically a &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; is 2 bytes, an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; is 4 bytes, and a &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; either 4 or 8 bytes. Modern C compilers also provide &lt;tt&gt;long long&lt;tt&gt; which is typically an 8 byte integer.   

In all of the types described above, one bit is used to indicate the sign (positive or negative) of a value. If you decide that a variable will never hold a negative value, you may use the &lt;tt&gt;'''unsigned'''&lt;/tt&gt; modifier to use that one bit for storing other data, effectively doubling the range of values while mandating that those values be positive. The &lt;tt&gt;unsigned&lt;/tt&gt; specifier also may be used without a trailing &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, in which case the size defaults to that of an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. There is also a &lt;tt&gt;'''signed'''&lt;/tt&gt; modifier which is the opposite, but it is not necessary, except for certain uses of &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;, and seldom used since all types (except &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;) are signed by default.

To use a modifier, just declare a variable with the data type and relevant modifiers:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
unsigned short int usi;  /* fully qualified -- unsigned short int */
short si;                /* short int */
unsigned long uli;       /* unsigned long int */
&lt;/source&gt;

== &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; qualifier ==

When the &lt;tt&gt;'''const'''&lt;/tt&gt; qualifier is used, the declared variable must be initialized at declaration. It is then not allowed to be changed.

While the idea of a variable that never changes may not seem useful, there are good reasons to use &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt;. For one thing, many compilers can perform some small optimizations on data when it knows that data will never change. For example, if you need the value of &amp;pi; in your calculations, you can declare a const variable of &lt;tt&gt;pi&lt;/tt&gt;, so a program or another function written by someone else cannot change the value of &lt;tt&gt;pi&lt;/tt&gt;.

Note that a Standard conforming compiler must issue a warning if an attempt is made to change a &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; variable - but after doing so the compiler is free to ignore the &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; qualifier.

== Magic numbers ==
When you write C programs, you may be tempted to write code that will depend on certain numbers. For example, you may be writing a program for a grocery store. This complex program has thousands upon thousands of lines of code. The programmer decides to represent the cost of a can of corn, currently 99 cents, as a literal throughout the code. Now, assume the cost of a can of corn changes to 89 cents. The programmer must now go in and manually change each entry of 99 cents to 89. While this is not that big of a problem, considering the &quot;global find-replace&quot; function of many text editors, consider another problem: the cost of a can of green beans is also initially 99 cents. To reliably change the price, you have to look at every occurrence of the number 99.

C possesses certain functionality to avoid this. This functionality is approximately equivalent, though one method can be useful in one circumstance, over another.

=== Using the &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; keyword ===
The &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; keyword helps eradicate '''magic numbers'''. By declaring a variable &lt;tt&gt;const corn&lt;/tt&gt; at the beginning of a block, a programmer can simply change that const and not have to worry about setting the value elsewhere.

There is also another method for avoiding magic numbers. It is much more flexible than &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt;, and also much more problematic in many ways. It also involves the preprocessor, as opposed to the compiler. Behold...

=== &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; ===
When you write programs, you can create what is known as a ''macro'', so when the computer is reading your code, it will replace all instances of a word with the specified expression.

Here's an example. If you write
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#define PRICE_OF_CORN 0.99
&lt;/source&gt;
when you want to, for example, print the price of corn, you use the word &lt;code&gt;PRICE_OF_CORN&lt;/code&gt; instead of the number 0.99 – the preprocessor will replace all instances of &lt;code&gt;PRICE_OF_CORN&lt;/code&gt; with 0.99, which the compiler will interpret as the literal &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; 0.99. The preprocessor performs substitution, that is, &lt;code&gt;PRICE_OF_CORN&lt;/code&gt; is replaced by 0.99 so this means there is no need for a semicolon.

It is important to note that &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; has basically the same functionality as the &quot;find-and-replace&quot; function in a lot of text editors/word processors. 

For some purposes, &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; can be harmfully used, and it is usually preferable to use &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; is unnecessary. It is possible, for instance, to &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;, say, a macro &lt;code&gt;DOG&lt;/code&gt; as the number 3, but if you try to print the macro, thinking that &lt;code&gt;DOG&lt;/code&gt; represents a string that you can show on the screen, the program will have an error. &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; also has no regard for type. It disregards the structure of your program, replacing the text ''everywhere'' (in effect, disregarding scope), which could be advantageous in some circumstances, but can be the source of problematic bugs.

You will see further instances of the &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; directive later in the text. It is good convention to write &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;d words in all capitals, so a programmer will know that this is not a variable that you have declared but a &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;d macro.
It is not necessary to end a preprocessor directive such as &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; with a semicolon; in fact, some compilers may warn you about unnecessary tokens in your code if you do.
&lt;!-- Mention enum for constant defining! --&gt;

== Scope ==

In the Basic Concepts section, the concept of scope was introduced. It is important to revisit the distinction between local types and global types, and how to declare variables of each. To declare a local variable, you place the declaration at the beginning (i.e. before any non-declarative statements) of the block to which the variable is intended to be local. To declare a global variable, declare the variable outside of any block. If a variable is global, it can be read, and written, from anywhere in your program.

Global variables are not considered good programming practice, and should be avoided whenever possible. They inhibit code readability, create naming conflicts, waste memory, and can create difficult-to-trace bugs. Excessive usage of globals is usually a sign of laziness and/or poor design. However, if there is a situation where local variables may create more obtuse and unreadable code, there's no shame in using globals.

== Other Modifiers ==

Included here, for completeness, are more of the modifiers that standard C provides. For the beginning programmer, ''static'' and ''extern'' may be useful. ''volatile'' is more of interest to advanced programmers. ''register'' and ''auto'' are largely deprecated and are generally not of interest to either beginning or advanced programmers.

===static===
&lt;tt&gt;'''static'''&lt;/tt&gt; is sometimes a useful keyword. 
It is a common misbelief that the only purpose is to make a variable stay in memory.&lt;br&gt;
When you declare a function or global variable as ''static'' it will become internal. You cannot access the function or variable through the extern (see below) keyword from other files in your project.&lt;br&gt;
When you declare a local variable as ''static'', it is created just like any other variable. However, when the variable goes out of scope (i.e. the block it was local to is finished) the variable stays in memory, retaining its value. The variable stays in memory until the program ends. While this behaviour resembles that of global variables, static variables still obey scope rules and therefore cannot be accessed outside of their scope.&lt;br&gt;
Variables declared static are initialized to zero (or for pointers, NULL) by default. They can be initialized explicitly on declaration to any ''constant'' value. The initialization is made just once, at compile time. 

You can use static in (at least) two different ways.  Consider this code, and imagine it is in a file called jfile.c:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
static int j = 0;
 
void up(void)
{
   /* k is set to 0 when the program starts. The line is then &quot;ignored&quot;
    * for the rest of the program (i.e. k is not set to 0 every time up()
    * is called)
    */
   static int k = 0;
   j++;
   k++;
   printf(&quot;up() called.   k= %2d, j= %2d\n&quot;, k , j);
}
 
void down(void)
{
   static int k = 0;
   j--;
   k--;
   printf(&quot;down() called. k= %2d, j= %2d\n&quot;, k , j);
}
 
int main(void)
{
   int i;
     
   /* call the up function 3 times, then the down function 2 times */
   for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
      up();
   for (i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++)
      down();
    
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The j var is accessible by both up and down and retains its value.  The k vars also retain their value, but they are two different variables, one in each of their scopes. Static vars are a good way to implement encapsulation, a term from the object-oriented way of thinking that effectively means not allowing changes to be made to a variable except through function calls.

Running the program above will produce the following output:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
up() called.   k=  1, j=  1
up() called.   k=  2, j=  2
up() called.   k=  3, j=  3
down() called. k= -1, j=  2
down() called. k= -2, j=  1
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Features of &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; variables :'''
     1. Keyword used        - '''static'''
     2. Storage             - Memory
     3. Default value       - Zero
     4. Scope               - Local to the block in which it is declared
     5. Lifetime            - Value persists between different function calls
     6. Keyword optionality - Mandatory to use the keyword

===extern===
&lt;tt&gt;'''extern'''&lt;/tt&gt; is used when a file needs to access a variable in another file that it may not have &lt;tt&gt;#include&lt;/tt&gt;d directly. Therefore, ''extern'' does not actually carve out space for a new variable, it just provides the compiler with sufficient information to access the remote variable.

'''Features of &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; variable :'''
     1. Keyword used        - '''extern'''
     2. Storage             - Memory
     3. Default value       - Zero
     4. Scope               - Global (all over the program)
     5. Lifetime            - Value persists till the program's execution comes to an end
     6. Keyword optionality - Optional if declared outside all the functions

===volatile===
'''&lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a special type of modifier which informs the compiler that the value of the variable may be changed by external entities other than the program itself. This is necessary for certain programs compiled with optimizations – if a variable were not defined &lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt; then the compiler may assume that certain operations involving the variable are safe to optimize away when in fact they aren't. ''volatile'' is particularly relevant when working with embedded systems (where a program may not have complete control of a variable) and multi-threaded applications.

===auto===
&lt;tt&gt;'''auto'''&lt;/tt&gt; is a modifier which specifies an &quot;automatic&quot; variable that is automatically created when in scope and destroyed when out of scope. If you think this sounds like pretty much what you've been doing all along when you declare a variable, you're right: all declared items within a block are implicitly &quot;automatic&quot;. For this reason, the ''auto'' keyword is more like the answer to a trivia question than a useful modifier, and there are lots of very competent programmers that are unaware of its existence.

'''Features of &lt;code&gt;automatic&lt;/code&gt; variables :'''
     1. Keyword used        - '''auto'''
     2. Storage             - Memory
     3. Default value       - Garbage value (random value)
     4. Scope               - Local to the block in which it is defined
     5. Lifetime            - Value persists while the control remains within the block
     6. Keyword optionality - Optional

===register===
'''&lt;tt&gt;register&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a hint to the compiler to attempt to optimize the storage of the given variable by storing it in a register of the computer's CPU when the program is run. Most optimizing compilers do this anyway, so use of this keyword is often unnecessary. In fact, ANSI C states that a compiler can ignore this keyword if it so desires – and many do. Microsoft Visual C++ is an example of an implementation that completely ignores the ''register'' keyword.

'''Features of &lt;code&gt;register&lt;/code&gt; variables :'''
     1. Keyword used        - '''register'''
     2. Storage             - CPU registers (values can be retrieved faster than from memory)
     3. Default value       - Garbage value
     4. Scope               - Local to the block in which it is defined
     5. Lifetime            - Value persists while the control remains within the block
     6. Keyword optionality - Mandatory to use the keyword

      <text xml:space="preserve">In C, there is a small key set of types. The rest are variations, modifiers, arrays and other such low-level data structures. The keywords for these types are '''&lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;''', '''&lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;''' and '''&lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;'''.

== Types in C ==
=== Integer types ===
When we wish to store an integer, we use an integer type, usually &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;s have at least 16 bits. Many platforms have 32-bit &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;s. There is also &lt;tt&gt;long int&lt;/tt&gt;, which is guaranteed to have at least 32 bits. &lt;tt&gt;short int&lt;/tt&gt;s have at most 16 bits, just like regular &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;s. However, often &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; is made to be longer, so &lt;tt&gt;short int&lt;/tt&gt; is used when conserving memory is important.

All these integer types are ''signed'', meaning that they can hold both positive and negative values. There is an corresponding ''unsigned'' type that only holds nonnegative values. However, they can hold larger values in the same number of bits. Using the keyword &lt;tt&gt;unsigned&lt;/tt&gt; yields an unsigned type. For example, &lt;tt&gt;unsigned int&lt;/tt&gt; is a unsigned integer type of at least 16 bits. The keyword &lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt; can also be used, but is redundant.

When conserving memory is even more important, we can pack an assortment of 1-bit, 2-bit, and 3-bit values into a structure using [[w:bit_field|bit_field]]s.
(Or we can use the bit-manipulation instructions to manually pack and unpack bit fields from a standard &quot;char&quot; or &quot;int&quot;.)

=== Character types ===
When we wish to store a single character or byte, we use a character type. The C name for this type is called &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;s always use one byte each. &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; can also be used to store integers small enough to fit in a byte.

Since &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; is an integer type, it is important to know whether it is signed or unsigned. However, compilers are allowed to make them either. If you want to guarantee that your character variable is signed or unsigned, use the type &lt;tt&gt;signed char&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;unsigned char&lt;/tt&gt;. Unlike &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;, these types are guaranteed to be either signed or unsigned, according to their names.


char arrays are often used to store human readable strings of alphabetic language like English; a common use is the filename, the user login name, and the password. &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; arrays are often used to store user input, which may need to be manipulated : the common expectation is that  a character string ends with a null character which has a value of 0 or zero. Because arrays are either defined dynamically using malloc() , or more conveniently, in scope on the stack , 
with something like

 &lt;code&gt;char buff[maxbuf];&lt;/code&gt; 

where maxbuf is a constant or define of say, 512, a string of say 522 characters ending with a zero character on the 523rd character can write into 523-512=11 characters following the space allowed for buff on the stack, and if the stack grows backwards, so that before buff was allocated the program counter that stored the current address of the program before the function was called was pushed onto the stack, and this was going to be used at the end of the function to return to the instruction following the call to the function, an attacker could change the return address to a loader code within buff to load a malicious program and run it. This buffer overrun attack can usually be avoided if functions which copy buffers without a length limitation such as strcpy are replaced by functions which specify maximum buffer length like snprintf() , or any use of strcpy is preceded by a length check with strlen(), and strcpy not called if the length is greater than the allocated space minus 1 (for the null character to be stored ).

=== Floating-point types ===
When we wish to store a floating-point (non-integer) value, we can use the types &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;long double&lt;/tt&gt;. These differ only in the precision and range that they provide. A &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; generally has 32 bits and a &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; 64. &lt;tt&gt;long double&lt;/tt&gt; might be bigger, but it could just be the same as &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Void type ===
There is a special type called &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt;. You are not allowed to have variables of type &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt;. There are various uses of &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt;, one of which is as a return type for functions that don't need to return an actual value. &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt; did not exist before it was introduced in the 1989 ANSI C standard. However, there should be no need to worry about its not being available unless you use a really old compiler (in which case, upgrade).

There is no fundamental predefined string type in C. Strings in C are more complicated (they are ''arrays'' of chars), requiring manual handling, and we will deal with them later.

== Declaring variables ==
All type declarations using the above simple types follow a standard format
:&lt;tt&gt;type_name variable_name;&lt;/tt&gt;
where &lt;tt&gt;type_name&lt;/tt&gt; represents one of the C type names, and &lt;tt&gt;variable_name&lt;/tt&gt; would be replaced by the programmer with a name for the variable. According to the C standards there are a few restrictions on variable names. A variable name:
* must be at least one character long
* must be less than some maximum character length. 32 on some systems, 256 on others, and probably everything in between on yet others.
* must start with a letter
* must be composed of letters, numbers and/or the underscore character
* must not contain spaces
* must not be equal to reserved words such as &quot;int&quot;, &quot;char&quot;, &quot;float&quot;, et cetera. Any keyword used for the C language itself is off-limits.
* is case sensitive. This means that &quot;NUMBER&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;Number&quot;, &quot;numbeR&quot;, and &quot;NuMbEr&quot; are all different variables.

For example, if we want to declare a variable called &lt;tt&gt;number&lt;/tt&gt; and of type &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, we write
:&lt;tt&gt;int number;&lt;/tt&gt;

In C, all declarations are terminated by semicolons just as if they were statements. If we wish to declare a number of variables of the same type, we can write a comma separated list of variable names after the type. For example:
:&lt;tt&gt;int variable1, variable2, variable3;&lt;/tt&gt;
which declares all &lt;tt&gt;variable1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;variable2&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;variable3&lt;/tt&gt; to be of type integer.

== enum ==
{{wikipedia|enumerated type}}

Some C programmers use &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; to declare an enumerated type.

These enumerated types are useful when we build [[C_Programming/Control#The_Switch-Case_statement | switch case statements]].

== Ido wikibooks ==

A request has been made for one on the discussion page of the main page. [[:io:user:mithridates]]

== Proposed? ==

Why is this a proposed policy, and not enforced? at the very least, it should be an official guideline, but i think it would do better as an enforced policy. If we need to, i will start the voting myself. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:51, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

== Semi-protection ==

Should we implement semi-protection? At this point, semi-protection would make sense on Wikibooks for major spam targets like [[Main Page]]. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 17:00, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

[[:Wikibooks_talk:Semi-protection_policy#Move_to_Reject.2C_merge_to_.5B.5BWikibooks:Protected_page.5D.5D|Semi-protection policy / Move to Reject, merge to Wikibooks:Protected page]]--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

== Categories ==

I propose to clean up the policy page proper (i.e. [[Wikibooks:Protected page]]) by moving the list of pages to a category. The list of pages itself is not policy, but instead is the result of the policy. As such, the category and a link to there from here should be created.

== Unstable version ==

Changes have been made to the unstable version.  I'm interested in people's thoughts on it.  Also feel free to make changes. ([[Wikibooks:Protected page/Unstable]]). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:33, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

:It is missing any process for changing the status of the pages. My view is that 7 days protections shouldn't open for contest and the issue should be solely addressable/reversed by the acting admin, the logic is that there should be already a good enough reason for the action and the time required to come to a clear discussion would have to exceed the 7 days to be recognized. Stating this on the text can reduce those requests. Longer protections should be open for validation (that is) if not originating in a community decision (that must be at least be made visible to the editors of the project (root) of that page) the process will be focused in establishing a consensus to the removal but to the continued protection of the page..
:There is also a need to establish what constitutes in the content disputes the current version of the page (the page version that the protection will make static). Current version is extremely ambiguous, it depends on how the dispute has been running, most users resort to reversions or other engage in continues changes that promote the content they defend. One example of this type discussions that promote this type of alterations is for instance on the final approval of policies/guidelines drafts, a solution that has been taken is to fix (much like a protection) the proposed text. My view is that the same should be done in any other type of content dispute the version previous to the start of the dispute should be the one to be protected, this is easy to determine by the edits history logs...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:35, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

== Pending changes? ==

I thought there was pending changes. I noticed it in [[Cookbook:Christmas ham]]. [[User:Qwertyxp2000|Qwertyxp2000]] ([[User talk:Qwertyxp2000|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Qwertyxp2000|contribs]]) 00:44, 22 December 2015 (UTC)

:Pending changes is not a page protection per se, it is only active on Wikibooks for protection of the readers and it is used in general as a page review tool. Note that it is also an automated process, no administrative action is required (to enable, disable or make a change) and even if possible it is rarely used, most of those few instance have occurred only on Wikijunior.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:42, 22 December 2015 (UTC)</text>

'''Computer Programming Types''' determine the kinds of values and how they can be used in the given programming environment. In most cases, a programming language defines a set of basic data types, e.g. for numbers, characters or strings.
In higher languages, it is often possible to define new data types from the existing ones, for example, to represent a postal address (consisting of strings for street and city and integers for the postal code).  When communicating data between different programs and computer systems it is important to either use types that both can recognize, or have a means of translating between them.

__TOC__

== Type Definition ==

A complete definition of a data type consists of up to three things:

; Physical representation : how is the data stored 
; Operations : what can you do with the data type (the ''meaning''); what can you not do, such as divide by zero or string manipulation; and what happens if you &quot;overflow&quot; the buffers to do actions with results falling &quot;outside&quot; the space allotted
; Automatic Functions : what activities, outside program control, can change the data (hardware, user, system clock)

== Primitive Types ==

There are a few basic data types seen in some programming languages:

; Integer : Unlimited in some languages, limited to 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 48-bit, 64-bit sizes in most languages &lt;small&gt; ([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:C_Sharp_programming_language|C#]], [[w:DDS]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]], [[w:RPG]])&lt;/small&gt;. In some languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:FORTH]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]])&lt;/small&gt; size can be freely defined.
; Ratios : e.g. 2/3, only a few languages have these.
; Float : Floating point, most languages offer single and double precision &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:C_Sharp_programming_language|C#]], [[DDS]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]], [[w:RPG]])&lt;/small&gt;. In some languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]])&lt;/small&gt; precision can be freely defined.
; Decimal : Base 10 (human) fixed point, often used for monetary values. Only a few languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]], [[w:SQL]], [[w:COBOL|COBOL]], [[w:RPG]], [[DDS]])&lt;/small&gt; offer fixed point. Precision can usually be freely defined.
; Hexadecimal : Base 16 available on [[IBM]] Systems.  Digits are zero through F. Most modern languages don't need a separate Hexadecimal type, they use integers and specialized I/O routines.
; Packed Decimal : Two digits can fit into same space as one character.  Look at definition of character set for [[w:ASCII]], [[w:EBCDIC]], or similar conceptual system.  Note letters and special characters are represented by two hexadecimal half bytes so with packed data, two digits can fit in same space as one letter.  Usually one half byte is reserved for numeric sign (plus or minus).
; Complex : A complex value usually consisting of two Float values. Only a few languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language#C99|C99]], [[w:Fortran|Fortran]])&lt;/small&gt; have these. In Object Oriented languages often implemented by a library &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]])&lt;/small&gt;.
; Character : A character, usually of 8, 16 or 32 bit size. Some Characters sets, like uft-8 are for a variable length.

== Composite Types ==

; Record   : An assorted combination of primitive types.
; Variant  : Type is determined at runtime.
; Object   : In Object Oriented languages.
; Array    : See article [[Data Structures/Arrays|Arrays]].
; String   : A sequence of characters. Often implemented as Array of Characters.

== Type Attributes ==

; Null Support : In addition to data blank or zero, we can have null value, meaning we not yet know what belongs there.
; DBCS Double Byte Character Set : Some nations and cultures &quot;alphabets&quot; (such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian (Cyrillic)) can use graphical characters called ideograms to perform a role similar to the letters A to Z in western nations languages when constructing meanings, except each ideogram carries more meaning than each A to Z letter.  Data types are available to store these graphical character sets, which contain more symbols than can be represented by the 256 combinations found in traditional western character sets, thus a double byte character set (DBCS) exists to account for every combination. 
:: Some special fonts use a similar system.
:: Some bar coding uses similar concept. 
; Date Time and Duration     :  These are special data types used to support date math, such as calculating number days between two dates.
; Flags or Indicators        :   They contain value like True / False or Yes / No.  They are often used to recognize use of a keyboard function (which special keys got pressed); printer condition (ready for a new page); file access (we got the record we were looking for, we're now at end-of-file).  These special conditions mean that special actions needed.
; Variable Length : Width of data is controlled by the content.

* [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables|C++ variables]]
* [[JavaScript/Variables and Types]]
* [[Haskell/Type basics]] - the language Haskell is often used as a platform for programming language researchers to develop new, advanced type systems.  This wikibook could give you insight into what types might look like in the near future for the common programmer.  (Note: see also the advanced section of the [[Haskell]] wikibook)

== Arrays ==
An array is a collection, mainly of similar data types, stored into a common variable. The collection forms a data structure where objects are stored linearly, one after another in memory. Sometimes arrays are even replicated into the memory hardware.

The structure can also be defined as a particular method of storing '''elements''' of indexed data.  Elements of data are logically stored sequentially in blocks within the array.  Each element is referenced by an '''index''', or subscripts.

The index is usually a number used to address an element in the array. For example, if you were storing information about each day in August, you would create an array with an index capable of addressing 31 values -- one for each day of the month.  Indexing rules are language dependent, however most languages use either 0 or 1 as the first element of an array.

The concept of an array can be daunting to the uninitiated, but it is really quite simple.  Think of a notebook with pages numbered 1 through 12.  Each page may or may not contain information on it.  The notebook is an ''array'' of pages.  Each page is an ''element'' of the array 'notebook'.  Programmatically, you would retrieve information from a page by referring to its number or ''subscript'', i.e., notebook(4) would refer to the contents of page 4 of the array notebook.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SimpleArray.png]]&lt;br&gt;''The notebook (array) contains 12 pages (elements)''&lt;/center&gt;


Arrays can also be multidimensional - instead of accessing an element of a one-dimensional list, elements are accessed by two or more indices, as from a matrix or tensor.

Multidimensional arrays are as simple as our notebook example above.  To envision a multidimensional array, think of a calendar.  Each page of the calendar, 1 through 12, is an element, representing a month, which contains approximately 30 elements, which represent days.  Each day may or may not have information in it.  Programmatically then, calendar(4,15) would refer to the 4th month, 15th day.  Thus we have a two-dimensional array.  To envision a three-dimensional array, break each day up into 24 hours.  Now calendar(4,15,9) would refer to  4th month, 15th day, 9th hour.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:MultidimensionalArray.png]]&lt;br&gt;''A simple 6 element by 4 element array''&lt;/center&gt;

{{DS:ADT|Array&amp;lt;Element&amp;gt;|
&lt;tt&gt;make-array(integer ''n''): Array&lt;/tt&gt;
:Create an array of elements indexed from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;, inclusive. The number of elements in the array, also known as the size of the array, is ''n''.
&lt;tt&gt;get-value-at(Array ''a'', integer ''index''): Element&lt;/tt&gt;
:Returns the value of the element at the given ''index''. The value of ''index'' must be in bounds: ''0 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; index &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; (n - 1)''. This operation is also known as '''subscripting'''.
&lt;tt&gt;set-value-at(Array ''a'', integer ''index'', Element ''new-value'')&lt;/tt&gt;
:Sets the element of the array at the given ''index'' to be equal to ''new-value''.
}}

Arrays guarantee '''constant''' time read and write access, &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, however many lookup operations (find_min, find_max, find_index) of an instance of an element are '''linear''' time, &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Arrays are very efficient in most languages, as operations compute the address of an element via a simple formula based on the base address element of the array.

Array implementations differ greatly between languages: some languages allow arrays to be re-sized automatically, or to even contain elements of differing types (such as Perl).  Other languages are very strict and require the type and length information of an array to be known at run time (such as C).

Arrays typically map directly to contiguous storage locations within your computer's memory and are therefore the &quot;natural&quot; storage structure for most higher level languages.

Simple linear arrays are the basis for most of the other data structures.  Many languages do not allow you to allocate any structure except an array, everything else must be implemented on top of the array.  The exception is the linked list, that is typically implemented as individually allocated objects, but it is possible to implement a linked list within an array.

=== Type ===

The array index needs to be of some type. Usually, the standard integer type of that language is used, but there are also languages such as [[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]] and [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]] which allow any discrete type as an array index. Scripting languages often allow any type as an index (associative array).

=== Bounds ===

The array index consists of a range of values with a lower bound and an upper bound.

In some programming languages only the upper bound can be chosen while the lower bound is fixed to be either 0 &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:C_Sharp_programming_language|C#]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]])&lt;/small&gt; or 1 &lt;small&gt;([[FORTRAN 66]], [[w:R_Programming|R]])&lt;/small&gt;.

In other programming languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]], [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]])&lt;/small&gt; both the upper and lower bound can be freely chosen &lt;small&gt;(even negative)&lt;/small&gt;.

=== Bounds check ===

The third aspect of an array index is the check for valid ranges and what happens when an invalid index is accessed. This is a very important point since the majority of [[w:Computer_worm|computer worms]] and [[w:Computer_virus|computer viruses]] attack by using invalid array bounds.

There are three options open:

# Most languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]], [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]], [[w:C Sharp|C#]])&lt;/small&gt; will check the bounds and raise some error condition when an element is accessed which does not exist.
# A few languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]])&lt;/small&gt; will not check the bounds and return or set some arbitrary value when an element outside the valid range is accessed. 
# Scripting languages often automatically expand the array when data is written to an index which was not valid until then.

=== Declaring Array Types ===

The declaration of array type depends on how many features the array in a particular language has.

The easiest declaration is when the language has a fixed lower bound and fixed index type. If you need an array to store the monthly income you could declare in [[C Programming|C]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;typedef double Income[12];&lt;/source&gt;

This gives you an array with in the range of 0 to 11. For a full description of arrays in C see [[C Programming/Arrays]].

If you use a language where you can choose both the lower bound as well as the index type, the declaration is -- of course -- more complex. Here are two examples in [[Ada Programming|Ada]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;
type Month is range 1 .. 12;
type Income is array(Month) of Float;
&lt;/source&gt;

or shorter:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;type Income is array(1 .. 12) of Float;&lt;/source&gt;

For a full description of arrays in Ada see [[Ada Programming/Types/array]].

=== Array Access ===

We generally write arrays with a name, followed by the index in some brackets, square '[]' or round '()'.  For example, &lt;tt&gt;august[3]&lt;/tt&gt; is the method used in the C programming language to refer to a particular day in the month.

Because the C language starts the index at zero, &lt;tt&gt;august[3]&lt;/tt&gt; is the 4th element in the array.  &lt;tt&gt;august[0]&lt;/tt&gt; actually refers to the first element of this array.  Starting an index at zero is natural for computers, whose internal representations of numbers begin with zero, but for humans, this unnatural numbering system can lead to problems when accessing data in an array.  When fetching an element in a language with zero-based indexes, keep in mind the ''true'' length of an array, lest you find yourself fetching the wrong data.  This is the disadvantage of programming in languages with fixed lower bounds, the programmer must always remember that &quot;[0]&quot; means &quot;1st&quot; and, when appropriate, add or subtract one from the index.  Languages with variable lower bounds will take that burden off the programmer's shoulder.

We use indexes to store ''related'' data. If our C language array is called &lt;tt&gt;august&lt;/tt&gt;, and we wish to store that we're going to the supermarket on the 1st, we can say, for example

 august[0] = &quot;Going to the shops today&quot;

In this way, we can go through the indexes from 0 to 30 and get the related tasks for each day in &lt;tt&gt;august&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Grammar - Preterite (el pretérito indefinido) ==

The following table shows the preterite of regular verbs. Regular '''-er''' and
'''-ir''' verbs follow the exact same pattern. Note that the '''nosotros'''
form is the same as in the present tense for '''-ar''' and '''-ir''' verbs, so you have to know the context to
figure out the time. Also, note that the last letter of '''comí''' and '''viví''' has an accent mark.

== Grammar - Imperfect (el pretérito imperfecto)==

The following table shows the imperfect of regular verbs. Note that regular '''-er''' and
'''-ir''' verbs follow the exact same pattern:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
!  
! habl''ar'' &lt;br&gt;(-ar)
! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to talk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
! com''er'' &lt;br&gt;(-er)
! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to eat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
! viv''ir'' &lt;br&gt;(-ir)
! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to live&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| yo || hablaba       || ''I was talking''
| comía || ''I was eating'' || vivía      || ''I was living''
|-
| tú || hablabas      || ''you were talking''
| comías || ''you were eating'' || vivías     || ''you were living''
|-
| Ud./él/ella || hablaba         || ''he/she was talking''
| comía || ''he/she was eating'' || vivía      || ''he/she was living''
|-
| nosotros/as || hablábamos    || ''we were talking''
| comíamos || ''we were eating'' || vivíamos   || ''we were living''
|-
| vosotros/as || hablabais     || ''you (all) were talking''
| comíais || ''you (all) were eating''

|-
| Uds./ellos/as || hablaban     || ''they were talking''
| comían || ''they were eating'' || vivían     || ''they were living''
|}

There are only three verbs that are irregular in the imperfect:

== Grammar - Preterite vs. Imperfect ==

Spanish has two tenses that correspond to the English ''simple past''. Roughly speaking,
the '''Preterite''' is used to tell '''What happened''' - it refers to a '''specific''' event.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Beginning exercises|Pointers and arrays}}

Arrays in C act to store related data under a single variable name with an index, also known as a ''subscript''.  It is easiest to think of an array as simply a list or ordered grouping for variables of the same type.  As such, arrays often help a programmer organize collections of data efficiently and intuitively.

Later we will consider the concept of a ''pointer'', fundamental to C, which extends the nature of the array (array can be termed as a constant pointer). For now, we will consider just their declaration and their use.

== Arrays ==

C arrays are declared in the following form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
type name[number of elements];
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, if we want an array of six integers (or whole numbers), we write in C:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int numbers[6];
&lt;/source&gt;

For a six character array called ''letters'',

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char letters[6];
&lt;/source&gt;

and so on.

You can also initialize as you declare. Just put the initial elements in curly brackets separated by commas as the initial value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
type name[number of elements]={comma-separated values}
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, if we want to initialize an array with six integers, with &lt;tt&gt;0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0&lt;/tt&gt; as the initial values:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int point[6]={0,0,1,0,0,0};
&lt;/source&gt;

Though when the array is initialized as in this case, the array dimension may be omitted, and the array will be automatically sized to hold the initial data:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int point[]={0,0,1,0,0,0};
&lt;/source&gt;
This is very useful in that the size of the array can be controlled by simply adding or removing initializer elements from the definition without the need to adjust the dimension.

If the dimension is specified, but not all elements in the array are initialized, the remaining elements will contain a value of 0. This is very useful, especially when we have very large arrays.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int numbers[2000]={245};
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example sets the first value of the array to 245, and the rest to 0.

If we want to access a variable stored in an array, for example with the above declaration, the following code will store a 1 in the variable &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int x;
x = point[2];
&lt;/source&gt;

Arrays in C are indexed starting at 0, as opposed to starting at 1.  The first element of the array above is &lt;tt&gt;point[0]&lt;/tt&gt;.  The index to the last value in the array is the array size minus one.
In the example above the subscripts run from 0 through 5. C does not guarantee bounds checking on array accesses. The compiler may not complain about the following (though the best compilers do):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char y;
int z = 9;
char point[6] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
//examples of accessing outside the array. A compile error is not always raised
y = point[15];
y = point[-4];
y = point[z];
&lt;/source&gt;

During program execution, an out of bounds array access does not always cause a run time error. Your program may happily continue after retrieving a value from point[-1]. To alleviate indexing problems, the sizeof() expression is commonly used when coding loops that process arrays.

Many people use a macro that in turn uses sizeof() to find the number of elements in an array,
a macro variously named
&quot;lengthof()&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
Pádraig Brady.
[http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/gcc/c_c++_notes.html &quot;C and C++ notes&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;MY_ARRAY_SIZE()&quot; or &quot;NUM_ELEM()&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
[[C Programming/Pointers and arrays]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;SIZEOF_STATIC_ARRAY()&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
[[MINC/Reference/MINC1-volumeio-programmers-reference]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
etc.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int ix;
short anArray[]= { 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 };
 
for (ix=0; ix&lt; (sizeof(anArray)/sizeof(short)); ++ix) {
  DoSomethingWith(&quot;%d&quot;, anArray[ix] );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice in the above example, the size of the array was not explicitly specified. The compiler knows to size it at 5 because of the five values in the initializer list.  Adding an additional value to the list will cause it to be sized to six, and because of the sizeof expression in the &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loop, the code automatically adjusts to this change.  Good programming practice is to declare a variable &lt;i&gt;size &lt;/i&gt;, and store the number of elements in the array in it.
&lt;p&gt;
size = sizeof(anArray)/sizeof(short)
&lt;/p&gt;

C also supports multi dimensional arrays (or, rather, arrays of arrays). The simplest type is a two dimensional array. This creates a rectangular array - each row has the same number of columns. To get a char array with 3 rows and 5 columns we write in C
 char two_d[3][5];

To access/modify a value in this array we need two subscripts:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char ch;
ch = two_d[2][4];
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
two_d[0][0] = 'x';
&lt;/source&gt;

Similarly, a multi-dimensional array can be initialized like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int two_d[2][3] = {{ 5, 2, 1 },
                   { 6, 7, 8 }};
&lt;/source&gt;

The amount of columns must be explicitly stated; however, the compiler will find the appropriate amount of rows based on the initializer list.

There are also weird notations possible:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int a[100];
int i = 0;
if (a[i]==i[a])
{
  printf(&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
----

a[i] and i[a] refer to the same location. (This is explained later in the next Chapter.)

== Strings ==
[[Image:Merkkijono.svg|thumb|300px|String &quot;Merkkijono&quot; stored in memory]]
C has no string handling facilities built in; consequently, strings are defined as arrays of characters. C allows a character array to be represented by a character string rather than a list of characters, with the null terminating character automatically added to the end. For example, to store the string &quot;Merkkijono&quot;, we would write

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char string[] = &quot;Merkkijono&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char string[] = {'M', 'e', 'r', 'k', 'k', 'i', 'j', 'o', 'n', 'o', '\0'};
&lt;/source&gt;

In the first example, the string will have a null character automatically appended to the end by the compiler; by convention, library functions expect strings to be terminated by a null character.  The latter declaration indicates individual elements, and as such the null terminator needs to be added manually. 

Strings do not always have to be linked to an explicit variable.  As you have seen already, a string of characters can be created directly as an unnamed string that is used directly (as with the printf functions.)  

To create an extra long string, you will have to split the string into multiple sections, by closing the first section with a quote, and recommencing the string on the next line (also starting and ending in a quote):
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char string[] = &quot;This is a very, very long &quot;
                &quot;string that requires two lines.&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

While strings may also span multiple lines by putting the backslash character at the end of the line, this method is deprecated. 

There is a useful library of string handling routines which you can use by including another header file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;  //new header file
&lt;/source&gt;

This standard string library will allow various tasks to be performed on strings, and is discussed in the [[../Strings|Strings]] chapter.

I think the book needs more Japanese characters. I.e. besides the romaji it needs at least the hiragana and katakana.
But I haven't figured out how to type them yet... Maybe someone can give me some hints/links. I'm using the latest KDE on a Gentoo Linux system. Oh, and I'm happy to help the project with my very limited knowledge of Japanese. [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 19:49, 19 Aug 2003 (UTC)

== Focus of the book ==

I would like to see some agreements on what this book is for in a bit more specific terms. Maybe not right now, but sooner or later, it should be clear. 

*Do we want to include a lot of modern Japanese for travel, daily conversation? Many idioms, potentially some slangs, etc.? 
*Do we want to offer a good book for someone who is seriously interested in business Japanese ?
*Do we want to offer a good book for someone who would study Japanese history, literature, and/or language, so that we would want to emphasize historical backgrounds, old forms of writing, etc, and less about speaking or conversations? Do we possibly explain the language in linguistics' terms, and include some comparative perspective? 
*Do we want to make the book useful for a typical university, so that we would want to develop more specific lesson-plans, exercises, etc. for each class? Or is this more of a well-organized reference? 
*Do we assume the readers are native speakers of English? Or do we also expect some other people, who cannot get a Japanese textbook writtein in their own native languages? (Then we might use less culture-specific references, use simpler English, etc.)

[[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 21:57, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:I personally see it as a lesson on the language and how to speak/write it.  The [[Japanese/Vocabulary/Everyday Phrases|Everyday Phrases]] section covers business and travel.  [[Japanese_History|History]] covers the history aspect.  The rest is a lesson on Japanese and how to speak/write it.  The basics are covered here, and the more advanced concepts are covered in the [[Japanese/Advanced Topics|Advanced Topics]] section.  The basic section should cover enough to speak and write, but probably should only cover enough for a 4 kyuu　(4級) on the JLPT (日本語能力試験), if even that...  The advanced section can focus on the JLPT and more advanced language structures and could eventually even cover up to 1 kyuu (1級). -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 03:09, 28 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::sounds good to me :) [[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 07:05, 29 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:: At the moment it seems the Japanese Wikibook is still in the early stages. I don't see any actual &quot;Lessons&quot; (1, 2, 3, 4, etc) listed yet. Is anyone qualified to write such lessons? '''Tomos''' has asked some very good questions. I hope as the level of Japanese increases, those topics can be covered, in Japanese, such as travel, history, business, etc. [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 23:54, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::: At the moment, it seems our goal has become to allow the student to pass the JLPT. We could probably enrich this with additional material later, but at the moment, that is our goal. Again I say we should put our policies and goals on the [[Japanese/Contributor's Guide]] page. 

===Japanese Slang and curses===
I think it would be best if Japanese slang and curse words were reserved for a seperate wikibook.  Sound like a good idea?&lt;br&gt; [[User:Greyweather|Greyweather]] 14:05, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)

: I agree slang and curse words are not appropriate for a standard Japanese wikibook. Maybe a ''Casual Japanese'' wikibook could be made, having connection to popular culture such as music, animation, etc where such language is used. [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 23:54, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Romanization style ==

Which romanization method are we going to use in this course? Kunrei or Hepburn? For what I've seen, different lessons use different romanization methods, which may confuse the readers. I vote for Hepburn because it's closer to Western languages and especially English, and this being a guide to Japanese for ''gaijin'', Hepburn will seem more ''natural''. [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 09:55, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:Well, since people seemed to have been replacing the Kunrei-Shiki that I have entered in, I guess the everyone has already decided on Hepburn, so I guess we will use Hepburn...  I have attempted to change all of the Kunrei I entered in back to Hepburn, but I probably missed a few... -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 16:08, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Having had a quick look through the book, I have 2 points:

1. romanization is not constant accross pages.
&lt;BR&gt;2. the links to following pages should be at the bottom.

Otherwise looking good!

:: We should vote and decide on the romanization style to adopt on the [[Talk:Japanese/Basic Japanese sounds]] page. That is the page that will set the standard for the rest of the document. I cast my vote for Hepburn, because pronunciation is most important, and the kana will be nect to the romaji anyway. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 14:47, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Just a comment, so far everyone I've seen comment on this have gone for Hepburn. I'll assume hepburn then, until someone complains. If this comment is left undisturbed for a week, I'll delete the discussions concerning which romanization to use, and state that our policy has become hepburn. We should use the &quot;contributer's guide&quot; page as our standard. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 06:37, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Answer to focus of this book ==

This is my answer to what the focus of this book should be. Am I correct in the understanding that this book is supposed to be a language textbook for modern-day Japanese?  If so, I have a couple suggestions.

1 Focus on the language.
&lt;BR&gt;The whole culture section, Japanese history, anything that is not directly related to the language should be removed.  I have no problems in learning about culture, etc. in the context of learning the language. However,  whole separate sections on Japanese culture or whatnot should be moved to Wikipedia under the appropriate section. They don't belong here.

2 Romaji is not Japanese
&lt;BR&gt;As an extension of focusing on the languge, there is currently way too much material on romaji. Learning about different systems of romaji is of absolutely no use in learning Japanese because romaji is NOT Japanese.  Go over just enough so that people can learn to type and even then, throw it into a miscellaneous section or something to clearly indicate that _nobody_ in Japan uses romaji to communicate.

3 Language (especially Japanese) is for the dedicated
&lt;BR&gt;You don't want to attract lazy people by using romaji letting them get away with never having to learn kana or kanji. If someone is too lazy to learn at least hiragana (I mean c'mon), he/she is doomed to fail in learning Japanese anyway.  In the meantime, we can cater to those who are actually dedicated enough to at least learn the _alphabet_.  The same goes for people who are too lazy to install japanese display.

-- [[User:Taekk|Taekk]] 14:05, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)


'''Criticism noted.  Reply in sections:'''

1. I agree.  Perhaps we should have [[History of Japan]] and [[Culture of Japan]] Wikibooks instead?

2. Romaji is not Japanese at all, I agree...  (I should have really written a note to say that Romaji is not &quot;real 日本語&quot;)  On the other hand, it is a useful tool for beginners to become accustomed to the idea of Kana characters if used along side them in the beginners stage.  This book is as I envision it will only use Romaji/Kana for the 4級 level...  The advanced sections will cover the higher level topics and will be SOLELY in Kana and Kanji beyond 3級.

3. Admittedly so, however if we keep the lazy people away, will this book have as much utility as a basic language guide so someone can start off and see if they wish to continue?  Will it have the utility for the businessman who only needs some basic Japanese to converse with a client?

In order to learn a new script, you must first have lessons that use both the basic transition script (Romanization) and the native script (Kana) so that someone can get the &quot;feel&quot; of what the syllables sound like.  After they &quot;gain their sea legs&quot;, you can stick them on the real boat in the typhoon and see if they float.

Finally, I am not admittedly the best tutor on this topic.  First, since I am only a Junior contributor, but secondly since I am not &quot;officially versed in the language&quot; (i.e. JLPT).  This does not stop me from being able to make useful contributions, and therefore we should not exclude someone from being able to make contributions just because they are learning how to use the script properly, although we should quite certainly use pure Kana scripts in the Middle School or higher level lessons.

If Push should come to Shove, perhaps we should write &quot;[[Romaji: a primer to Japanese Scripts]]&quot;.  But seriously do we need to make Kindergarden level Kanji lessons, when even 日本人 are learning their Kana, written in ALL Kana? :P

'''''ADDENDUM'''''&lt;br&gt;
This can also open the can of worms that we should split all Language wikibooks into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced levels...  That is also a possibility we can consider.

-- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 07:17, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)

1. If you have the time to write one, I'll read it.  Though, I don't know if you can make a wikibook out of Japanese culture.

2. I'm not against using romaji to teach hiragana and sure you can throw some romaji in at the very beginning if you must.  However, we must forego romaji when it becomes more of a crutch than training wheels.  And seriously, how hard is it to learn hiragana? I think one or two lessons is more than enough for the reader to get the hang of it.  In this respect, I think all this talk about kunrei/hepburn, blah, blah is just silly and moot. It really belongs in the appendix.

3. I don't see how teaching hiragana first won't help starters see if they want to continue. I think it's worse for the reader to invest all her time getting used to reading romaji only to find out later that she was learning the wrong thing.

Wikibooks is a free textbook project and if my idea of &quot;textbook&quot; is correct, than our only goal should be to teach real modern-day Japanese in the most accurate, complete, and easiest way possible. If you want to write another wikibook called &quot;Easy business Japanese&quot; or &quot;Handy Japanese phrasebook&quot; then be my guest.

4. I don't think a separate primer for romaji is necessary.  Like I said, you can just throw it in a miscellaneous section. I also don't feel it's necessary to make Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced into separate wikibooks.  You can just split it up inside one book. 

--[[User:Taekk|Taekk]] 13:07, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I was just voicing my reasons for the way that I have contributed.  If you think it will work better without the Romaji or the Splash page (and everyone else agrees) then by all means do so.  I would be happy to see the Wikibook rewritten if it is more effective at teaching the lessons.  As I have said before, I am not anything close to a qualified educator on any topic, most especially a foreign language.  I only have a reluctance to abandon what has not demonstrably been shown to be broken.

Yes, the Romaji is overused a quite bit...  but you are dealing with mostly 外人 people who have never seen a Kana in their life.  You have already covered most of my concerns with regard to this, but I would add that not everyone uses Windows...  and some other Operating Systems don't make it easy to install the input method and font.  As a result, you may have some people unable to read it even if they wanted to provide a reasonably decent effort.  A useful solution would be a section on &quot;how to install Japanese fonts and input&quot;.  We should never abandon people because they don't know how to do something...

We agree that the only the first few basic lessons should touch on Romaji to teach the sound of Kana, so you have no arguement there. I would merely state that since we have not even reached the advanced lessons yet I didn't notice that I overdid it quite a bit.

As you see, I am not trying to stop you from fixing the problems, I was only voicing my hesitation to abandon the ''status quo'' completely.  Frankly, I would like to hear some other views since you and I are the only two who have made comments.  Meanwhile, if you feel that these changes must be made, this is a wiki...  please feel free to make them.  In fact, I think we both practically agree that it is quite unprofessional as I had written it.  (That is why Verbs was totally rewritten as a matter of fact...)

Cool, you can sign me on.  Since I work the regular salary-man hours, I usually don't get home until at ''least'' 8:00pm so not much time to work on this but... Oh, and for the record, I am not Japanese either. 日本語入力チェックです。テスト、テスト。本日は晴天なり

One more comment from a 外人... I have a couple of Japanese books, one for a beginners level and the other one for an intermediate level. The former one uses kanji, hiragana and romaji in all the Japanese text, and the latter one uses kanji with its corresponding kana and no romaji. I agree with that way of teaching Japanese, and of course it's importante to tell beginners to start forgetting about the Roman alphabet ^^ [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 16:09, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Re: Romaji. My inclination, too, would be to avoid romaji where possible. The problem is, we can't use furigana, which is a better way of helping learners read unfamiliar kanji. As far as kana go, I think romanisation is probably unhelpful (I agree that the scope of the book shouldn't be 'Intro to Japanese', but a full language course, and this being the case, people using all but the early chapters will have to learn kana), but when it comes to kanji, they might be a necessary evil until furigana-display is possible...

Can I also suggest that wherever possible we try to avoid translating 'X は ... ' to 'as for X...' ? (Or at least of making a habit of it...) Although it conveys the general topic-markeriness of は, 'as for' is a bad translation for the simple reason that we almost never say 'as for' in English.

:I would concur... outside the lesson for particles that should be unnneeded. (P.S. Where else besides the は lesson did you notice that?) -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 21:44, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::As for this comment about ''as for'', IMHO it's a standard part of Japanese English. ;) Personally, i just adapted to it. No culture owns the English language.

'''romaji vs kana, kanji discussion'''

i put a link to kdrill: IMHO this is '''excellent''' software for learning kanji and it seems to satisfy the free software (as in free speech) definition.

IMHO, in the spirit of the GFDL, we should encourage people to use GNU GPL (or other free software) for learning kanji (and kana of course, but that's quickly over and done with). This gets around the problem of whether this is ''easy'' or not: provide the software and it ''becomes'' easy.

In fact, my broader vision for wikipedia and wikibooks is that virtually all pages with any slightly technical content (maths, physics, language learning) should be accompanied with external links to GNU GPL or other free software. GFDL came from [[Wikipedia:GPL]]. i often fail to do this simply because i'm not (yet) aware of where GPL or other free software is available. [[User:Boud|Boud]] 15:34, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)

==Kanji drawing tips==
OK, time to seed the ground again...  I think we could consider having some basic kanji drawing lessons that show the (most commonly accepted) basic rules for drawing kanji, such as &quot;left to right, top to bottom&quot; and &quot;if boxed, outside first then inside (unless the box opens to the right)&quot;. -- [[User:Emperorbma|EmperorBMA]]|[[User talk:Emperorbma|&amp;#35441;&amp;#12377;]] 02:56, 22 May 2004 (UTC)

==Printed sources==

I found something interesting at a used bookstore today.  It's a copy of ''Reading Japanese'' by Eleanor Harz Jorden and Hamako Ito Chaplin.  It provides a solid start on not only learning to read kana and (425) kanji, but writing them as well.  What is most useful to us though, is the following:

 Copyright is claimed until December 31, 1990.  Thereafter
 all portions of this work covered by this copyright will
 be in the public domain.

Is it then safe for me to copy the contents to Wikisource, or do I need to contact the publisher (Yale University) first to be sure?

:It's fine to copy it. If it's public domain, we can use it. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 10:43, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Something missing: Dialogues... ==

This Wikibook seems to be coming along nicely. There's just one gaping hole: There aren't any dialogues yet. Without dialogues, we've got a phrasebook. Unfortunately I don't know enough Japanese to contribute a dialogue.

I have an idea that making the dialogues the main entrance point to the study of Japanese would be an effective teaching technique. You first learn the basics (hiragana, katakana, basic kanji concepts). Then you dive into conversations which have links to grammar notes, vocabulary, and maybe even cultural notes. I think it's important to keep the conversations in Hiragana/katakana, maybe progressing to using more and more kanji as they are learned.

I think a discussion of the structure of the material might be interesting.
* It makes sense to group vocabulary into related groups, like they are now.
* Dialogues would rather benefit from being divided into lessons, getting progressively more complicated.
* Grammar is an interesting one. Do we make grammar into groups, or lessons? Do we make it run parallel to the Dialogues?

How should we approach the learning of kanji?

Some food for thought. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 10:59, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: I hope you don't mind that I reverted this page to bring back your commentary, GoodStuff. I feel that this commentary is very important and shouldn't be removed yet :)

: I've also noticed that dialogues are missing, it's really an important aspect to a language book. At the moment this wikibook is just like reference material without any real lessons being offered.

: I think there's too much information about the writing scripts in this wikibook, which is covered already in wikipedia articles. However, as this is a book for studying a foreign language, I think there should be allowance for romaji inclusion. Otherwise we might be pushing away readers who are true beginners to the language. JLPT 4 allows romaji, JLPT 3 to JLPT 1 uses only Japanese.

: As for grammar and particles, I believe it should be explained briefly when first introduced in a lesson so the reader has an understanding and feel for the language. There's already a grammar reference list at {{bad link|Parts of Speech}}. But most pages here needs to be made more clear for ease of reading.

: On kanji, it should be introduced according to JLPT kanji. We have [[JLPT Guide/Contents/JLPT 4 Kanji|JLPT Level 4 Kanji]] which is good for a print out. Although other websites provide a better resource to study kanji. Also, there's a wikibook on East Asian orthography at [[East Asian Calligraphy|CJK]] which will be useful for readers to understand how kanji is written. &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 10:45, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:: I do not mind at all! No one responded to my comments, and this discussion page is already cluttered. I did not want to contribute to the clutter.

::I must say I disagree with the current &quot;Japanese writing system&quot; page layout. The page is somewhat overspecialized, and as a summary, it is not clear enough. It uses far too much jargon as well. I edited it somewhat.

:: Okay, dropped the {{bad link|Japanese/Basic Japanese}} page from menu, added {{bad link|Japanese/Basic Japanese sounds}} which should introduce our chosen romaji style. Again, I vote for Hepburn aka Hebon-shiki. Feel free to edit my (terrible) introduction to the sounds of the Japanese language. The sounds and mora concepts so introduced gives us a nice platform to explain the writing system from. This is that I've attempted to do with my slight editing of the [[Japanese/Japanese writing system]] page. We can't throw newbies into the deep end on that page, even if there are great references for Kana and Kanji. See my comments at the writing system discussion page. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 16:32, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Layout and Focus ==

I think one of the main things needed right now is a better overall layout.  If someone who wishes to learn japanese comes to the main page of the Japanese wikibook, they're not going to know where to start.  &quot;What, do I just read top-to-bottom?&quot;

Having sections seperated up into grammar, vocabulary lists, and such is useful if you know what you're looking for, but if you're trying to learn the language, it needs to be more structured.  

I think a neat approach would be to have sequentially numbered vocabulary lists, with the more useful vocab in the earlier lists.  At the top of each grammar/usage lesson, we could specify which vocabulary lists are going to be used in the dialogues and with the examples in the lesson.  Finally, you bundle a certain amount of vocabulary and grammar into a 'chapter' (where nothing from a later chapter is used within, all of the vocab in the grammars are contained in the vocab lists or have already been learned, and where it makes sense to be learning all of that as one unit).  It would also be useful (though I'm not quite sure what the capability of the wiki books software is) to have quizzes at the end of each chapter, quizzing on everything contained within.  It would also be nice to have the chapters planned out a couple in advance, similar to how the Korean wikibook does it: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Korean

It would also give the book discrete units in which you could only put romaji within the first 3 lessons, or something like that.  So, it's very obvious where one should and shouldn't use romaji.    The list of chapters should probably be the main focus of the book, following just after the intro and such.  After the list of chapters could be an index of grammars and vocab and such.

Also, on a different topic, it might not be possible to use furigana in the wikibook as it is, but it'd be nice to have a very strict standard  to express furigana, so that when converting to print or to another format, a preprocessor of some sort could very easily convert all of the kana to furigana.  Something simple like the word in kanji followed by the word in kana in parenthesis would do.
--[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 19:21, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I took an hour or so and wrote up what I think would be decent for the first few chapters and intro.  I didn't want to just modify the main page, as I'm still relatively new here, but take a look at this, see whacha think, feel free to post it as the main page.  It's a pretty rough outline, but I think it's fairly well though-out: [[JapaneseTable_of_ContentsTest]]

--[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 20:29, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Um, I don't mean to intrude, but the Table of Contents is totally off right now.  To get to many sub pages, I have to jump into certain pages and use internal &quot;next&quot; or &quot;previous&quot; links to get to the pages that I refer to rather often.

: I'm sorry Xepo, that's my fault I guess. I was editing the TOC list. Which pages in particular are troublesome? (d'ah, forgot to sign... also I'll try to add links back to TOC in the subpages if that helps) &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 02:19, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Great new layout! Still, dialogues would be nice. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 09:07, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)


Yea, the new TOC looks a lot better, btw.  Good job.  I think it could still use a bit of direction, but that'll come as the book progresses. --[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 05:21, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== In the interests of better communication... ==

Hi. I think we have a serious problem here. In Wikipedia people don't need to communicate as much to fix a spelling mistake, or to add content, because each page is well defined and about a specific topic.

Here however, I think we have the additional problem of the organization and layout of the Wikibooks. I suggest therefore that we start a mailinglist and/or IRC chatroom to discuss the issues of this wikibook. I feel the discussion page is inadequate. I made the effort to start such a mailinglist. Here's the link: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/japanese_wiki/ Take note that my nick on Yahoo is BraineX and not GoodStuff. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 08:35, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kanji ({{furi|漢字|かんじ}}) characters are based on Chinese characters transmitted to Japan during the spread of Buddhism in the 5th century. A large percentage (approx. 70%) of Japanese vocabulary comes from Chinese or Chinese-derived words. While the meaning of individual characters is fairly consistent between the languages, compound words often have different meanings.

Kanji are inflected by hiragana that follow and particles give the case. Most words are written using kanji, though some have none and loan-words from other languages are generally written in katakana. The large number of homophones makes it highly desirable to use kanji and knowing them can help with memorising new words.

Note that ''writing'' kanji skillfully is significantly harder than ''reading'' kanji skillfully, since one must ''recall'' characters, not simply ''recognize'' them. Further, with Input Methods allowing one to write Japanese on a computer phonetically (by recognizing the kanji, not needing to produce them), the practical need for kanji writing skills is lower than in the past, but it is still fundamental to mastery of Japanese.

== Study methods ==
{{wikipedia|Kanji#Kanji education}}
Kanji can form a difficult hurdle for some in their study of Japanese. Their nature as graphic representations of concepts translating to sounds gives rise to the particularly diverse methods employed for the study of kanji.

Fundamentally, one’s goal is to learn ''Japanese,'' not ''kanji'' per se and this has two main implications. Firstly, as many words are written as compounds of multiple kanji it is not sufficient learn the individual two thousand odd characters, but also their combinations. Furthermore, just as learning vocabulary in any language, these must be learnt in the context of the language. Not only does it aid memorisation of terms, but enforces the understanding of their nuance. It is finally worth mentioning that one can learn to speak Japanese without learning to read or write it, just as with any language. If one is, however, ever to learn to read, it is advisable to start right away and learn the characters in parallel with vocabulary and phrases.

Throughout, understand that one’s mastery of any skill is imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete (see [[wikt:侘寂|侘寂]], ''[[w:wabi-sabi|wabi-sabi]]'') – while perfection is a worthy goal, it should not be expected nor demanded – mistakes should be expected, and accept that there are further levels of mastery: not 300 people a year pass the [[w:Kanji kentei|Kanji kentei]] level 1.

Basic issues, regardless of study method:
;start early
: Kanji take a long time to learn; if you start early, kanji will not be the limiting factor, but if you start later in your studies, there will be a dispiriting quantity of catch-up to do.
: It is not simply an issue of memorizing 1,945 characters (or more for names) – the same character is pronounced in different ways and used in different contexts. Kanji are simply a large amount of data, and this is best learned over a long period of time.
;review regularly
: Kanji are easily forgotten, and subtle details and differences fade without review. Regular review, particularly via electronic [[w:flashcard|flashcard]] programs such as [[w:Anki|Anki]] or [[w:Mnemosyne (software)|Mnemosyne]], are essential to mastery.
;make connections: Rather than learning characters in isolation, drawing ''connections'' helps memory. For example, learning a character as part of several words, or learning graphically similar or etymologically related characters can help make them more easily remembered.
; detail: It is easy to make minor mistakes with kanji, be it missing a stroke or forgetting a rarely used kanji. A high level of mastery requires attention to detail, as detailed below.

Because there are so many kanji, and they are relatively sparse (of 1,945 kanji, most will not be used and reinforced in any sample of text, unlike kana) simply memorizing the forms and pronunciations (as one does for the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet or the 46 kana, twice) is less practical and effective, and one instead uses more structured mnemonic methods.

There are three aspects to a particular kanji:
;form: The character shape – the strokes.
;sound: The pronunciations, of which there are generally many.
;meaning: The meanings, both of the individual kanji and its combinations.

There are a number of ways to learn the kanji. Rather than pick one, try to see how each of these works for you and combine them in your study.

=== Rote ===
The most straight forward way of learning kanji is by [[w:rote learning|rote]]. While few will succeed in retaining even a portion of the two thousand basic characters — not to mention their compounds — rote learning is a good way to practice mnemonic devices such as those mentioned in the following sections. Writing reinforces character details, builds [[w:muscle memory|muscle memory]] and improves handwriting. Thus, regardless of learning system, practicing ''writing'' the kanji is a valuable aspect of learning.

{{Japanese related|software|
* [http://ichi2.net/anki/ Anki]
* [http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/ Mnemosyne]}}
Make flash-cards with one or more characters on one side, the meaning and reading on the other and drill yourself. Make another set of cards with the meaning on one side and the characters and readings on the other and drill yourself on writing the kanji. There are several programs and website applications that offer kanji drilling. Notable spaced recognition software include Anki and Mnemosyne.

Forgetting a rarely used kanji is easy so it is important to regularly review these.

=== Handwriting ===

{{Japanese related|product|
* [http://www.thejapanshop.com/product.php?productid{{=}}17578 Practice notebook] from [http://www.thejapanshop.com/ The Japan Shop].
}}

Note that characters have a generally accepted stroke order.  While this may seem an extra burden at first, the order is highly regular and will vastly improve your ability to read other people's handwriting, not to mention make yours more intelligible.

As with the handwriting of most scripts, Japanese calligraphy has a long history and is greatly revered to this day. As kanji are somewhat more intricate than Latin characters, the quality of handwriting and the order the strokes are written in matter a great deal. In fact, without a commonly accepted system, cursive styles and hurried handwriting would be illegible, indeed.

There is, of course, only one way to practice handwriting: By writing. Get yourself a nice notebook, preferable one with good sized squares, and practice, practice, practice.

=== Context ===
The ''Kanji in Context'' texts from the Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies emphasizes the value of learning not so much kanji characters in isolation, but ''kanji-based vocabulary,'' particularly as part of phrases or idioms. In this approach, when learning a kanji, one learns important words that it is part of. Further, one will learn kanji that make up a given word at the same time – for example, one will learn the ''word'' 日本 (Nihon, Japan) and, at the same time, the characters 日 (nichi, ni, sun) and 本 (hon, root).

=== Recognising the constituent parts ===
{{Japanese related|on-line resources|
* [http://kanji-web.com/ Kanji ABC]
* [http://kanji.koohii.com/index.php Reviewing the Kanji]
* [http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/self/self.en.html Genki] [Japan Times]
}}
As you progress in learning kanji, you'll start to see patterns emerge; constituent parts of characters that are common among many characters. Recognising these will allow you to see the characters as made up of shapes rather than just strokes and thus simplify retaining them. The general method is to systematically break up characters into graphical components, some of which may not be used as separate characters. Next, one systematically maps these elements to some mnemonic, and then builds a picture or story combining these.

The principles at work are:
;analytic
: Break up a complex character into simple components.
: Example: The character 認 which means to notice or to judge is made up of 15 strokes but may be a little bit easier to remember it as a combination of 言, 刃 and 心; word, blade and heart, respectively.
;associative
: Associate components across characters.
: Example: 売 means &quot;to sell&quot;, but along with &quot;word&quot;, 読, it becomes &quot;to read&quot; and along with &quot;thread&quot;, 続, it becomes to continue. This further builds links between characters that share graphical elements or compositional similarities.
;narrative
: Associating stories with characters is a powerful method to remember which components it is made up of.
: Example: The character 暖 means &quot;warm weather&quot; and can be broken down into the components 日, 爫, 一 and 友 meaning &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;caress&quot;, &quot;one&quot; and &quot;friend&quot;. This can then be memorised as warm weather being when &quot;the sun caresses a friend&quot;.

Useful resources for diagnosing these constituent parts are the book and [http://kanji-web.com/ online version] of ''Kanji ABC''. James Heisig's well-known series ''[[w:Remembering the Kanji|Remembering the Kanji]]'' is the best known study aid that uses this method. Alternatives include [http://smartkanjibook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/free_sample.pdf Smart Kanji Book] which only includes common kanji and the primitives that form them and the [http://www.amazon.com/Kana-Pict---Graphix-Mnemonics-Japanese/dp/1880656183/ Kanji Pictographix] which uses a graphic approach instead of mnemonic stories.'' A further such resource is Genki’s [http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/lookandlearn_en.html Kanji Look and Learn]. These may not be sufficient in themselves, as they focus purely on the characters, but can be valuable components of one’s learning, helping with remembering character forms and especially minor details.

=== Chinese-derived reading ===
The vast majority of Chinese characters are composed as ''phono-semantic compounds'': one component (generally the radical) is semantic (about the meaning), and the other component is used for its phonetic value (sound) called . Note that this is how the character as used in ''Chinese'' is composed. As kanji usually have several readings, including a Chinese-derived one, this can be used to remember the character and one of its readings.

Understanding this, and decomposing characters into Phonetic + Semantic components and relating them to similar characters using either of these components helps with remembering the character’s form, its meaning, and a Chinese-derived pronunciation (''on yomi,'' 音読み).

For example, the character for small is 小 which has the Chinese-derived reading shō. The characters 少, 炒, 抄, 省, 称, 鈔 and 渉 all share that same Chinese reading. Again, keep in mind that these are only the ''Chinese'' readings and the each of these has other different readings as well.

=== Attention to detail ===

It is easy to make minor mistakes with both recognizing and writing kanji. A high level of mastery requires attention to detail and continual polish (see [[wikt:改善|改善]], ''[[w:kaizen|kaizen]]''). Even at lower levels, attention to detail yields [[w:overlearning|overlearning]] and deepens understanding; if you are worrying about the stroke order, you are likely not forgetting the character outright.

Minor errors can be made in writing (e.g. incorrect strokes, strokes touching when they should not, or incorrect stroke order) and pronunciation (e.g. incorrect voicing; especially ''rendaku''/''euphonic changes''). To achieve a high level requires ''detecting'' and ''correcting'' such errors. Realizing that one has forgotten a kanji is easy enough. For other errors, one may not notice them, or one may feel a ''lack of confidence'' reflecting imperfect mastery. To detect such errors one must review regularly and ensure that all these details are correct.

Particularly useful in subtle errors is to study the character in question with various related characters (both graphically, as in [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Easily confused Chinese characters]], and etymologically), and in the context of various words: this allows one to ''contrast'' the character, rather than trying to retain it in isolation.

== Readings ==
A single Kanji letter can be read (pronounced) in many different ways, depending on its context. These readings are categorized into two main groups - that of Chinese origin (on-yomi, {{furi|音読|おんよ|み}}) and Japanese origin (kun-yomi, {{furi|訓読|くんよ|み}}). A third group, the nanoriyomi, is used for the names of people and places.

It is often the case that a Kanji letter has more than one reading of Chinese origin. This is because the importing of Chinese letters (with their readings) did not occur just at one time from one region.

=== Onyomi ===
Onyomi (音読み) is the Chinese-derived reading, which is most commonly used in compound words and for the numbers.

It may be useful to note that in most kanji databases, the ''on'' reading is written in katakana instead of hiragana.

一 (イチ), 二 (ニ), 三 (サン), 四 (シ) are the first four numbers and all are onyomi.

=== Kunyomi ===
Kunyomi (訓読み) is the Japanese reading, which can be read as a separate word or can be used in compounds.

This reading is generally written in hiragana in kanji lists.

月 (つき, tsuki) and 日 (ひ, hi) are the moon and sun and are in kunyomi.

=== Nanoriyomi ===
Nanoriyomi (名乗り読み) is the name reading, which is used for people's names and for places.

Both &quot;康&quot;, read as &quot;やす&quot; (e.g. [[w:Tokugawa Ieyasu|徳川家康]]), and &quot;信&quot;, read as &quot;のぶ&quot; (e.g. [[w:Oda Nobunaga|織田信長]]), are written in nanoriyomi.

== Kanji Repetition ==
The noma: (々), symbol indicates the repetition of a Kanji. The word われわれ indicates &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our group&quot; and is written as &quot;我々&quot; instead of &quot;我我&quot;, although they are both the same.  The same is true with &quot;人々&quot; (ひとびと), meaning people).

== JLPT ==

{{wikipedia|Japanese Language Proficiency Test}}

The JLPT has five levels beginning at level N5 and progressing to level N1 - the most difficult.

Each level has a certain set of kanji.

=== JLPT level N5 ===
The N5 test tests students' recognition of about 100 kanji.

==About==

==Intended Audience==

The intended auidence of this wikibook:
* native speakers of English
* advanced learners of English as a second language

==Various==

Hey Empororbma, what is the audience for your English book ? American high school students, English as a second language students .. ? Do you intend it to be a bit unique in structure and goals than most traditional books on the English language ? Maybe a brief outline of your goals for the book would help me understand. Maybe we could do this for many or all books .. or at least it becomes more useful when there are more gray areas .... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

There's a big problem with trying to make a textbook for English on the English version of Wikibooks, and that is that there is no focused audience, apart from a very high competence level. Wait until other language versions are started. [[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 16:53, 21 Aug 2003 (UTC)

[[English:Time]] was moved from wikipedia and should be incorporated somewhere. --[[User:67.118.0.241|67.118.0.241]] 22:57, 26 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Learn English in English? ==

It seems strange to have a &quot;learn English&quot; wikibook in English. I think that this wikibook could be used to gather some lessons written by English native-speakers, which could then be translated into other languages. A language wikibook could always use some native-speaker input, and the other language versions of this seem rather fragmented.
:did a quick test page at [[User:Nateji77/ESL]], poorly formatted tho. i'd prefer pictorial instructions to &quot;highlight with compter mouse to see words&quot; but cant make images where i'm at, but non-english wikis could take those and translate the instructions. [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 00:15, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

::I strongly disagree with the idea that an English textbook should not be here.  I would say that 80-90% of ''native'' English speakers do not know English.  Obviously, they can speak it, and generally, they do so correctly.  But they cannot tell you why they do so, because they do not know the rules of English.  That is what this book is for.  Next time you're confused about the difference between a conjunction and a preposition (and you might be surprised how hard it is to define the difference), thank the writers here that there's a place with an answer.  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 23:10, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

Me too.  So many native speakers have a poor command of the language and this article would be very useful.  I am a teacher of English as a Foreign Language and most students learn English only using English coursebooks (i.e. with no translations).  Learning English in English is the most common way to learn the language

::I agree with it. For example: I am Czech. You probably have no idea how horrible Czech textbooks for learning English are. Most of them were written in communistic times and it seems, that writing of these books was part of fight against capitalism. All better teachers are telling children to buy English textbooks from Oxford, Cambridge, or something similar. So long live this textbook!  --[[User:Milhaus|Milhaus]] 17:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Broken links ==

I am observing bad things happen to this Wikibook... For example, content moved from the [[English:Gerund]] page to the [[English/Grammar/Gerund and participles]] page. The [[English:Gerund]] page is now blank.

But some things still link to [[English:Gerund]] instead of [[English/Grammar/Gerund and participles]], so readers get a blank page sometimes.

I suggest that users stop moving material until we understand how it broke and how to fix it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:18, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

I have posted to [[User talk:201.50.79.58]] because that user blanked [[English:Gerund]] and [[English/Grammar/Gerund]] while trying to move material. However, I might have missed the user. That IP address belongs to [[Wikipedia:Telemar|Telemar]], a large Brazilian Internet Service Provider, and might be dynamically assigned. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:29, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:It sounds like the pages are not so much broken as they are simply not correctly moved.  The links to the previous page should simple by changed over to the new page, and all will be well.  I'll see what I can do.  It shouldn't be too hard.  I'd like to continue the process of standardization of pages here also.  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 04:31, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:Well, I found out that the links to the &quot;English:Gerund&quot; page were almost entirely on the English navigation template, so I changed the template.  Now all of the links on those pages (on the template) link to the right place, but this problem may appear again in the future.  I don't know if this is a big deal, but I also couldn't get the pages which link to the template to disappear from the &quot;English:Gerund&quot; whatlinkshere page.  Maybe that will be fixed at a certain time each day or something, because another page I had the same trouble on a couple weeks ago is now the way it should be (this is the first time I've checked it since then).  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 06:28, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Refocus ==

In conjunction with my comments earlier on this talk page, I feel that this Wikibook should not necessarily be so much directed toward second-language learners, and much more toward people who do not know the rules of English.  This includes second-language learners, but also includes native speakers who know how to speak it but don't know the rules.  For that reason I think we should move the references to EAL to the bottom of the page, with a new introduction showing this new focus.  How do the rest of you feel about the idea?  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 04:29, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:So the book isn't broken (as I said above), but it is still in need of cleanup.  We have a &quot;Grammar&quot; page which is not being used on the ToC and pages like &quot;Adjectives and Adverbs&quot; which do not exist but ''are'' on the ToC.  Added to all this is that the ToC listed here and the navigation template ([[Template:English]]) do not match in a variety of ways.  Overall, the issues here are ugly.  I personally think that all parts of speech should be under &quot;Grammar&quot; as subcategories, and that each part of speech should have its own page (with no larger category putting them together except &quot;Grammar&quot;).  Where two or more are related closely or could be confused, etc. (such as adjectives and adverbs), there should be a subpage (or description on a page) of the potential confusion, etc., but this should be (if it is a separate page) under &quot;Grammar&quot; immediately after the two things as the next page to read.  At the moment, the book is rather disorganized, which is worsened by the fact that some pages are of the colon standard and others of the forward-slash standard.  We've got our work cut out for us.  Happy editing!  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 05:42, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Restructure ==

I would like to separate this into two distinct books:
* [[English]] - Structured like a grammar and uasge book for native English speakers. 
* [[English as an Additional Language]] - Structured like a traditional foreign language book

I also would like to change the navigation template and create an exercise template.

Here's my proposed structure for [[English]]. Each page should be about the same size. If there are no comments in a few days I'll go ahead with it, so please give your opinion.

The vocabulary and glossary sections will go to [[English as an Additional Language]]. Comments are appreciated! --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:27, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

:What are your plans for [[English as an Additional Language]]? My idea for it, as I said oh-so-long-ago under &quot;Learn English in English&quot;, would be to write a progressive, bottom-up textbook that pretends that it is written not in English, but in some other language, and presupposes no knowledge of English. For example, the first chapter would introduce nouns and the present progressive tense and tell a short, simple story (in English) for the reader to try their hand at translating. The goal would be to produce a text for the German, Japanese, Spanish, etc. Wikibook authors to translate into their respective languages. --[[User:209.6.213.142|209.6.213.142]] 01:55, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

:: I don't know how EAL classes are traditionally taught and don't have any experience with them, so I won't be able to help there. But to me that sounds like it would be an excellent method. Now that this book is split up, each book will be able to fully concentrate on its own goals and audience, so that should hopefully increase contributors for both projects. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:14, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

::: I've gotten a username (I was 209.6.213.142) and started drawing up an outline at [[Talk:English as an Additional Language]]. You're welcome to help contribute, since activity in this area seems rather sparse. --[[User:Krestom|Krestom]] 20:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

I have provided an example page and discussed my intentions with this book at [[English in Use/Introduction]]. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 00:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== Why Not in PDF? ==

It's written there that creating a truly pdf book from the printable version is easy with the help of open software such as Adobe PDF Creator. Why don't you make it yourself rather than offer users to do this?

== My Plans ==

There are several books on Wikibooks about &quot;English&quot;.  There is this book.  There is the book for &quot;English as an additional language&quot; (which is a term that few people use - &quot;English as a Foreign (or Second) Language&quot; is more universal).  There is a book I am creating for &quot;FCE Studies&quot; (First Certificate in English by Cambridge University) and another book I may eventually try to develop which is targetted towards level B2 students studying English as a foreign language.  My plan would be to have all of those books as links from &quot;English&quot; and have most of the material presently on &quot;English&quot; moved to something like &quot;English Language in Use&quot;

ENGLISH BOOK -&gt; linking to the following books:
1. English Language in Use (guide to grammar and use of language for English natives and advanced learners of English [native speakers and levels C1 and C2]
2. English as a Second Language (present English as an Additional Language book) - targetted towards elementary and lower intermediate students [level A1 and A2]
3. English for Upper Intermediate Students (currently being planned in my head) [level B1 and B2]
4. FCE English - guide for students taking the FCE exam. [level B2]

The level codes I have used are the Common European Framework for languages and understood by all learners of foreign languages in Europe and much of Asia.  Obviously a brief about what the level codes mean will also be needed.  

Does anyone have any comments or problems about such a change?  This book seems quite inactive so unless I hear any dissent I may go ahead soon (safe in the knowledge that changes could be reverted).

==Style==

Perhaps titles should start from level two like in Wikipedia (two equal signs). The verbs article differs in that respect. The nouns article has too deep hierarchy, I think hierarchy should not be deeper than 3 levels. [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 14:15, 8 April 2009 (UTC)

I fully appreciate the contributions of everyone here. I'm by far not an expert in grammar, but still I don't understand why some want to break the Goold Brown's grammar. Like, one added an article about appositives, without even reading the syntax article before, and noticing that appositions are already mentioned there. In my opinion, the value of the Goold Brown's grammar is that it is comprehensive grammar, if one thinks that he knows something which is not mentioned there at all, he is most likely wrong, except when he is a very good grammarian. I don't know that much about grammar, and I am only able to copy and adjust that which others have written, but still I don't think that anyone here is good enough to be able to write a comprehensive grammar from scratch. I think that the advanced grammar must be a comprehensive grammar. If one considers this book to be just another grammar, then this book would not make any sense. And as much as I know, Goold Brown's grammar is the only comprehensive public domain grammar, so there is no other grammar which could be the basis of this book. Of course the Goold Brown's grammar is old and partly outdated, but why not edit it and make it a modern comprehensive grammar? Just my thoughts... [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 14:09, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

The article on articles is also missing, it is there: [[English_in_Use/Articles|Articles]]. [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 19:21, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

==Scope of this grammar==

I think I should explain more the scope of this grammar. This is what supposed to be a '''comprehensive grammar''', though using the word ''comprehensive'' may be somewhat unsafe. One may think that a comprehensive or complete grammar should contain everything about grammar, but when we for example compile all scientific works on grammar, then such grammar would likely consist of hundreds of volumes. This grammar is comprehensive in a sense that it covers everything in grammar, but is at that as short as possible. Whatever such grammar should be called, one thing is clear&amp;mdash;this grammar cannot be simplified or made shorter by omitting complicated parts or terms. It is therefore a '''level C grammar''', while the grammar in [[Rhetoric and Composition]] is '''level B grammar'''. Maybe it should be called a Complete English Grammar, but again some may misunderstand what the ''complete'' there means.[[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 22:36, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

This grammar is based on Goold Brown's grammar and I think it should be, as this gives it a value, and is also a certain guarantee of quality. It can be partly based on any newer grammars as well, but Goold Brown wrote the first comprehensive English grammar, and his grammar is because of that a kind of classical source.[[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 12:45, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

== Grammar - Formal Commands (el imperativo) ==

Commands are used when you ask someone to do something
or give instructions to people. In this lesson we learn the
formal commands, which are the ones you say to persons where
you use the '''usted''' or '''ustedes''' form. The following
table shows the endings for the regular verbs. Note that the
stem changes that occur in the yo form, ('''e-&gt;ie''', '''e-&gt;i''', '''o-&gt;ue''', '''ar/er/ir-&gt;go''' '''cer-&gt;zco''' '''etc.''', ) apply for formal commands:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; 
! hablar  
! comer  
! pedir  
|-
| Usted || habl&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;   || com&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;   
| pid&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;  
|-
| Ustedes || habl&lt;u&gt;en&lt;/u&gt;  || com&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;  
| pid&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt; 
|}

The following verbs have irregular formal commands:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; 
! dar  
! estar  
! ir  
! saber  
! ser  
|-
| Usted || dé      || esté    || vaya   || sepa   
| sea  
|-
| Ustedes || den     || estén   || vayan  || sepan  
| sean  
|}

Like in English, the command is usually put in the beginning of the sentence:

'''Examples''':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
'''Piense''' antes de hablar.
|
Think before you speak.
|-
|
'''Terminen''' sus tareas escolares.
|
Finish your homework.
|-
|
'''Dejen''' la casa inmediatamente.
|
Leave the house immediately.
|}

== Grammar - Informal Tú-Commands ==

In this lesson we learn the commands you say to someone
you would address in the '''tú''' form. Spanish distinguishes
two different types of '''tú'''-commands, the '''affirmative'''
(''do something'') and the '''negative''' (''don't do something'').
Like the formal commands, we also apply stem changes here:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp;  
! hablar  
! comer  
! pedir  
|-
| Affirmative || habl&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;   || com&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;   
| pid&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;  
|-
| Negative || no habl&lt;u&gt;es&lt;/u&gt;  || no com&lt;u&gt;as&lt;/u&gt;  
| no pid&lt;u&gt;as&lt;/u&gt; 
|}

The following verbs have irregular informal '''tú'''-commands for the affirmative and negative.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp;  
! decir  
! hacer  
! ir  
! poner  
|-
| Affirmative || di         || haz    
| ve/andá (Chile, Argentina) || pon  

To remember these, arrange them in this order:

Ven Di Sal Haz Ten Ve Pon Se

Which can also be read as &quot;Vin Diesel has ten weapons, eh?&quot;
   
|-
| Negative || no digas   || no hagas
| no vayas || no pongas 
|-
! &amp;nbsp;  
! salir  
! ser  
! tener  
! venir  
|-
| Affirmative || sal        || sé     
| ten || ven     
|-
| Negative || no salgas   || no seas 
| no tengas || no vengas
|}&lt;br&gt;
This can be memorized with the rhyming mnemonic device
&quot;''di haz pon ten, sal sé ve ven.''&quot;

'''Examples''':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
'''Piensa''' antes de hablar.
|
Think before you speak.
|-
|
'''Termina''' tus tareas escolares.
|
Finish your homework.
|-
|
'''No dejes''' la casa.
|
Don't leave the house.
|}

== El vocabulario (''Vocabulary'') - La salud (''Health'') ==


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;

|-

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''infinitive''' is the simple, unconjugated form of a verb. It does not indicate who is doing the action or any time reference. &quot;To be&quot; is a verb in the English infinitive form. &quot;Ser&quot; is a verb in the Spanish infinitive form. When you look up a verb in the dictionary it is found in the infinitive form.

In Spanish the infinitive forms always end with &quot;ar&quot;, &quot;er&quot; or &quot;ir&quot;. Examples: &quot;amar&quot; (to love), &quot;temer&quot; (to fear), &quot;partir&quot; (to leave).

The infinitive can be used for a lot of things in Spanish grammar.  It functions as a gerund in Spanish.  In the following examples, I will use &quot;nadar&quot; (to swim):
*Yo quiero &quot;nadar&quot;.--- I want to swim.
*Yo pensaba que &quot;nadar&quot; era divertido---I used to think that swimming was fun

Grammar.
Gender of nouns in Spanish.

In Spanish all the nouns are masculine or feminine.

For nouns that express entities with gender (people, animals..) there is both a feminine form and a masculine form (example: profesor (m), profesora (f))

The nouns that express entities without gender (objects, abstract concepts) have only one form. This form can be masculine or feminine.

Normally, the feminine words finalize with the letter 'a' and the masculine words end with the letter 'o'.

Examples:

Masculine words:
     caballo         horse
     perro           dog
     libro           book
     amor            love

Femenine words:     
     paloma          dove
     hierba          grass
     casa            house
     libertad        freedom

-----
Grammar.
The definite article:

As you know, in Spanish, the nouns can be feminine or masculine.

In English the definite article is always “the”.

In Spanish, the definite article is different - depending on the noun being feminine, masculine, singular or plural.

Hi Wintermute, this looks really nice! Great work! I have restructured Lesson 2 a little bit so that you can put your grammar section right in the beginning (the gender of nouns should definitely go before doing 'matching adjectives' - my fault, I didn't think of that before...) [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]] &lt;br&gt;
P.S. your English is very good, I just made some minor changes.

==Vocabulary Project==
Hi there,
I saw you contributed to the Spanish wikibook, so I thought it might be of interest to you that I have written a [http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444e1w/vokeng.htm program for learning vocabulary]. I think for this purpose a program is more useful than a website, although maybe one day we can make this a java project. 
It is based on the belief that it is best to learn foreign words by learning typical sentences. The program can also be used for learning other stuff that works with the question/answer scheme, e.g. the theory for the driving licence or anatomy. Unfortunately I wrote it in qbasic, which can be downloaded [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/download/olddos.exe here]. It also uses images and sound files for alternation and in order to work on the pronunciation. Let me know what you think about it. I currently have files in English, French (with sound), and Spanish. Catalan and Portuguese are in the planning. Corrections or additions are very welcome. The easiest thing to start with for improvements would be adding new vocabulary, sound files or images. A guide to the program will follow soon, although I think it is rather self-explanatory. In the long run the program should be rewritten in a better language like Visual Basic. Afterwards it should be possible to switch languages within the program. Up to now there is a different version of the program for each language. [[User:Get-back-world-respect|Get-back-world-respect]] 23:21, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Wintermute. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Wintermute~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

===Oxidation and reduction===
Two important types of reactions in organic chemistry are '''oxidation''' and '''reduction'''.

In '''oxidation reactions,''' the oxidized species ''loses electron density.''

In '''reduction reactions,''' the reduced species ''gains electron density.''

Of course, these two actions happen in unison as one species is reduced and the other is oxidized. The term '''redox''' was coined from the fragments ''red'' (reduction) and ''ox'' (oxidation).

===Oxidation===
'''Oxidation''' was first observed when oxygen drew electrons off of metals, which were then referred to as &quot;oxidized&quot;. (Oxygen is more elecronegative than most other elements.) The term was then applied later to the part of any reaction where electrons are drawn off. Other elements that commonly oxidize in organic reactions include halogens like chlorine and bromine.

===Reduction===
'''Reduction''' of a chemical species results in the gain of electrons for that species. This does not necessarily include any change in charge; any time an atom increases its electron density even a little bit it is said to be reduced. For example, if an oxygen is removed from a carbon and replaced by a hydrogen (assume the oxygen is also bonded to another atom), the formal charge of the carbon does not change. However, the carbon &quot;sees&quot; a greater share of the electrons from the single bond to hydrogen than it did for the single bond to oxygen. That is because hydrogen is less electronegative than oxygen and gives up its electrons a bit more easily than oxygen does. So a carbon bonded to hydrogen can take up more of its electron density than the same carbon bonded to oxygen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is Usenet ?

If your familiar with mailing lists or web-based forum, then the general principle of Usenet is simple so you may just want to skim over this first section.

To explain what Usenet is, I'll try and make analogies with real-life that most people are familiar with. Imagine Usenet as a pin-up board, where anyone can come along and stick a message up, people can then come by read the original message and attach a reply to the board, and then someone els can come along and look at the messages written, and if they want add their own message.

In a basic view that's all that Usenet is, an exchange point for messages.

Now imagine that about 25 million people were reading and writing messages for this pin-board, with one pin-board it would get overcrowded very quickly, the obvious solution is to have more pin-boards, say one for every topic

The technically correct name for Usenet's pin-boards is &quot;newsgroups&quot;, currently there are approximately 25,000 active(active meaning in-use) newsgroups, with overall somewhere between 150,000 and 250,000 that currently are dead (dead meaning they are not in use currently).

Returning to our pin-board analogy, it would be very busy if all 25 million users were in the same area, so instead we have replicas created, meaning there are copies of these pin-boards all over the world.

(From now on I'll be calling the pin-boards &quot;newsgroups&quot; as that's the most commonly used term)

I'll introduce some more terminology here, as it makes the explaination go easier later.

News server = These are the places where copies of the newsgroups are held, there is no central news server from where all copies are held, but rather</text>

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
[[Organic_Chemistry/Introduction_to_functional_groups|'''Functional groups''']] in reactions make your life easier as an organic chemist because they draw your attention right to where the action is. Any time a reaction is going to occur, you can be almost certain that it is going to take place at a functional group.

There are many functional groups of interest to organic chemists. Here are a few:

1. Halides

These groups are all made up of a single atom in Group 17 of the Periodic Table, which is known as the halogen group, bonded to a carbon atom. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Astatine is also a halogen, but it is rarely discussed because it is not readily found in nature and is radioactive. Their electronegativities vary from fluorine with 4.0 to iodine with 2.5, which is approximately the same value that carbon has. Each of these atoms are able to form a single bond with a carbon atom, replacing hydrogen in alkanes and adding across multiple bonds in alkenes and alkyne. Of the four, fluorine is the most reactive and iodine is the least. Because of their intermediate reactivity, chlorine and bromine are often more useful in many reactions.

2. Carbonyl

This group consists of an oxygen atom doubly bonded to a carbon atom. Carbonyl groups are important because the oxygen atom, with an electronegativity of 3.5, shifts electron density away from the rest of the molecule and towards itself. Carbonyls are a key ingredient in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides.

3. Hydroxyl

This group consists of a hydrogen atom singly bonded to an oxygen atom. The electronegativity difference between hydrogen, which has an electronegatity of 2.1, and oxygen, 3.5, pulls electrons away from the hydrogen and makes it somewhat acidic. This acidic character varies depending on the composition of the rest of the molecule.  Hydroxyl groups are found in alcohols, phenols, enols, and carboxylic acids.

==Drawing reactions==
There are various techniques you will run across for notation of organic reactions.

==Arrows==
'''Curved arrows''' are used to show '''movement of electrons'''. They are not used to show where atoms, ions, or molecules move, just electrons.  A curved arrow with two &quot;hooks&quot; on the end indicated movement of a pair of electrons.  A curved arrow with one &quot;hook&quot; indicated movement of one electron.

[[Image:Curvedarrow.png|center|Two &quot;hooks&quot; represents movement of two electrons.]] [[Image:half-arrow.png|center|One &quot;hook&quot; represents movement of one electron.]]

'''Double-headed arrows''' are used to represent equivalence between resonance structures.

[[Image:Arrows2.png]]

'''Two-way double half arrows''' are represent a reaction that can go forward or reverse. If one of the half arrows is longer than the other it means that the reaction pathway favors that direction with the longer arrow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== elements and members ==
Should the discussion under notation refer to the example number as '''an '''element''' of the set of a member''' of the set? ... [[User:LouI|LouI]]

: I assume you mean to say that 3 is an element of the set ''or'' a member of the set? Yes, either terminology is acceptable...thank you for jogging my memory :) 
: If that's ''not'' what you meant, please clarify, as I don't think I understand you correctly. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:46, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)

== page moved ==

I have moved Set theory back to where it was before. [[Discrete mathematics/Set theory|Set theory]] is intended as a purely introductory text, and putting further higher level article links with Set theory disturbs the gradual nature of increase of difficulty as the articles will follow...
I hope this is okay with everyone :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:27, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)

== questions / answers numbering ==

The numbering of the questions (section 2.6) doesn't make sense, and some of the answers don't seem to match the questions.

There was a stupid error (probably of mine :) that inserted a carriage return which mucked up the ordering of the numbers. It should be better now. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:30, 8 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Venn diagrams==
Shall I draw some ? If yes what would you like ? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:42, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Don't ask it, do it. And put them here, too. The one you are asking if she/he would like you drawing pictures to may not look at this section never again. You cannot know. So go and do it (supposing that you know about what you are doing).

== ambiguity in section 2.4 ==

I think that section 2.4 is a little unclear

the line reading 

Now, B contains some elements of A, but not necessarily all.

could be interpreted to mean that B contains some elements of A in addition to some other elements
(not belonging to A) 

I suggest

Now, B is made up of elements of A, but not necessarily all

: I've reworded it in a different way, so it's a bit more clear. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:02, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

How about we say that B is a subset of A if every element of B is also an element of A? Or, equivalently, B doesn't have any elements that aren't also elements of A? (The formation with the double negative makes it clearer that the empty set is a subset of all sets.)

== overstatement ==

&quot;Note that :
: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{N}|\, ax^2+bx+c = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a completely different set!&quot;

Is a bit of an overstatement...it's actually a subset, not a completeley different set.

: That is nitpicking a bit. The idea is still there. Though a different example might be called for. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:15, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== problem set: proper subset ==

I changed the &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; signs in problems 3 and 4 to &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; signs. You can show that A &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; B is false by showing that A = B in addition to showing that there is an element of A that is not in B.

problem set: no pun intended?


== pointing ==

In the first paragraph, I changed &quot;your pointing is called a set&quot; to &quot;what you are pointing to is called a set&quot;.  A set consists of its members.  A pointing consists of a (possibly metaphorical) extension of the index finger.  Actually, there is a lot of pointing talk in this module that strikes me as a little troubling.  Perhaps this should be changed.


(I also added titles to the first two comments of this talk page so the contents box would appear in the right place.)

== set comprehension, problem 3 ==

I'm kind of a newbie, so maybe I'm missing something obvious, but in number 3 the first set would start with 2, whereas the second set would start with 1 as the minimum value. Why are they equal?

Never mind, I got it. Duh.


== Definitions of Union, Intersection and Difference ==


I have simplified the definitions of union and intersection, making them more consistent with the notation used in logic, and clarified the example of difference, where the definition referred to B - A, but the example showed A - B. [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 20:56, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

PS I'm new to using LaTeX.  There must be an easier way of writing ''A'' - ''B'' to get the font and size right![[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 07:28, 9 November 2008 (UTC)


== Introductory Section and Notation ==
I've attempted a simple introduction, defining a set in terms of 'things' and 'rules'.  Have included in the Notations section &amp;isin; and &amp;notin;, and used simple text rather than LaTeX where possible.  (IMHO LaTeX looks a bit naff in the default font size!) --[[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 17:28, 9 November 2008 (UTC)
== Special Sets ==
Introduce these special sets before introducing relations between sets and operations on sets, so that an exercise can follow to allow consolidation of basic ideas.  [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 20:17, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

== Russell's Paradox ==

As I understand it, this page is intended as introductory teaching material on Set Theory as part of a Discrete Maths book. Introducing Russell's paradox may be interesting as a bit of background material for Set Theory in general, but I don't really think that it belongs in this text at all. Is there anyone who would vote to keep it in?  If not, I propose to remove it. (If anyone wants to keep it, I think it needs re-writing...) [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 12:01, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

== I've finished editing for the time being ==

I seem to have pretty well completely re-written this stuff on Set Theory. No-one seems to have objected so far.  As far as I'm concerned, it's fairly complete.  At any rate it will provide a way in to Relations and Functions, Logic, etc.  Does anyone else think there's more to do at this stage?  If not, what happens to it now? [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 12:34, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

== Page now split into Four Sections ==

Following a warning message about the size of the file exceeding 32KB, I have split the text up into four sections: the original Set Theory page containing the first half of the teaching material, Page 2 (the remaining teaching material), Exercises and Answers.  [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 12:06, 25 November 2008 (UTC)

== Euler diagrams ==

Venn diagrams are a special case of Euler diagrams, and half of the diagrams in the Venn diagrams section are not Venn diagrams.  Some of the instruction also shows how to convert a Venn diagram to a simpler Euler diagram, though it does not use this terminology.

For those who don't know the difference, an Euler diagram may or may not show intersections between sets which are empty, and if an region of exclusivity or intersection between sets is not shown then this is an assertion that the region is empty.  For example, if set A is circumscribed by set B, this indicates that all members of A are also members of B.  In some cases, Euler diagrams assert that regions which are shown must be non-empty, or at least it is not yet known whether the region is empty.

A Venn diagram is a special case of an Euler diagram that must show all possible intersections and exclusions.  So there is only one Venn diagram for three sets (a token of this diagram is shown in Figure 4), but there are many possible Euler diagrams for three sets (in general, 2^2^(n-1) for n sets).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Wikibook Introduction to computers and communications technology.

==Scope and Audience==
This textbook is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the field, useful to those who will practice in it, and those who need to deal with it peripherally.
While it is not a technical work it does deal with technology and describes its structure, background, content, and business in some detail.
This means that it while it can be a general survey, it cannot be necessarily simple.
Every attempt is made to add no more complex details than are necessary to place a part of the field in context.
But context here also means having a general understanding of the internals of an area, and so some complexity is unavoidable.

Thus there are three goals established:
#To be comprehensive and complete in terms of the areas covered.
#To provide enough detail for each area so that the reader can understand what work is accomplished by its practitioners and how that area relates to the rest of the field.
#To avoid enough technical detail so that a reader who isn't involved in an area does not get trapped in it.

These goals may at first seem contradictions, but they are not mutually exclusive.
Instead they serve as boundaries to identify the material included for each topic.
Another limit is imposed with respect to large or ''mainframe'' computers. The mainframe environment and history are briefly discussed in the introducyion to each part, but most material is based on the now ubiquitous personal or desktop computer  environment.

===Professional Readers===
Those who actively work in computers and communications tend to increase the depth of their knowledge and skills within a limited domain.
As they accumulate greater experience and skill, their viewpoint tends to become increasingly that of a single role or area within the discipline.
While this text can serve them for an initial survey of the field, its greatest value will be as a continued reference and context to provide a higher level view of those areas outside of their specialty.

An online, collaborative text may be particularly valuable in this second role.
All of the areas, disciplines, roles, and uses of this technology are changing.
Indeed, the rate of change seems to increase geometrically, while the number of areas or specialties increases exponentially.
Unlike a paper text, an online one can be maintained rapidly and constantly.
Once the reader is familiar with the format and content of the work, future reference is easier.
So when presented with a new feature, function, or technology there is an updated textbook that's just like the one they used before.
While some may prefer a paper copy for initial use, an updated copy may be continually available.
===Non-Professional Readers===
Very few professions today escape being affected by the application of computers and the related communication technology.
For those who work in other disciplines an up to date survey and reference may also be valuable when they must deal with the impact of the technology within their own field.
When forced to interact with the high priests of technology, they need not compete to get their viewpoint recognized while ignorant of the goals, practices, and terminology of the ordained.
When a piece of these technologies interacts with your own business, this will not replace a user manual, or even the level of the ''Topic X for Dummies''.
What it does is to provide the background and context that make those materials more useful.
==Terminology==

There are four words used in this work that require some explanation.
The words ''platform, entity, element,'' and ''component'' are used loosely, but with some intent.
Generally the term '''''entity''''' is used to describe the thing being considered or addressed by a topic,
'''''element''''' is used to describe a feature or function of the entity being discussed,
and '''''component''''' is used to describe a unit that is considered as a whole, and stands alone for some functions,
while '''''platform''''' refers to the group of components that are prerequisite to the entity under discussion.
Each term frequently represents the specific being discussed and its peers or similar units that operate at the same level.

A specific area or topic may be treated at all four levels.
Consider a single Web Page as an example.
When describing the Client–Server model of the Internet, it is a ''component''.
When considering HTML it is a part of the ''platform''.
In a part of the discussion of Web Site Construction it is first an ''element'' of the site, and then an ''entity'' since there are several topics that directly discuss Web Pages.

==Structure==

The question of how to organize a comprehensive technology overview is both fundamental and complex.
You can probably think of ways to improve the organization chosen (I know I do every time I look at it).
This section outlines of the survey's major organization into parts and breiefly identifies the main subject for each part.

The overview is organized into a decomposition hierarchy.
The hierarchy is presented two layers at a time.
Subject definitions are always presented twice, once with their parent subject and again in their own introduction.

''For full detail, see the:'' [[CACS:Contents]]

Subject areas and major parts are listed below:
*Hardware – The machines that are computers and their supporting attachments.
**Computing Machines – The fundamental engines of the revolution.
**Peripherals – The things that tie the computers to worthwhile work.
**Architectures – The structure that ties things together.
**Communications – The hardware that couples computers and components.

*Software – The program components that make the computer world accessible.
**Platforms – Operating Systems and basic Tool Suites.
**Middleware – The attachment layer.
**Construction Tools – Languages, Environments, and builders of all kinds.
**Applications – Tool sets that are used to do real work.
**Architecture – Structures for coupling components.

*Communications – Things that let computers and people connect to each other.
**Architecture – In communications, the Structure comes first.
**Networks – Computers and users coupled to gain processing power and leverage.
**Internet – The virtual structure that ties networks together.
**Content – The information that makes the structure worth having. 

*Applications – Applying the computer world to get things done.
**Desktop – Direct support of human efforts.
**Departmental – Those applications that support a single function or functional area.
**Process – Applications that support a broader work effort.
**Platforms – Generic applications, structures, and architectures for all kinds of work. 
**Vertical – Organizing applications by Industry Group.

*Services – How work gets done.
**Skills, specialties, and expertise.
**Methods and Life Cycles.
**Analysis and Programming – Specialties, Languages.
**Education and training, certification.
**Related functions: project management, business planning, consulting.

*Business – How computers, software, and applications are bought and sold.
**Manufacturers –
**Software Vendors –
**Support Structures –
**Service Providers –
**Newly Enabled Functions – Call centers, knowledge base, Supplier-company-customer integration.
**Packaging – Retailing, OEM, Integrators, Alliances.

Some things fell off this hierarchy, and are contained in other areas of topics. These are:
*History –
*Miscellaneous Topics – Stray interesting topics that affect multiple areas.
*Lists –
**Glossary – An industry full of buzzwords, a consolidated glossary.
**Reference Data –

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When we talk of '''set theory''', we generally talk about ''collections'' of certain mathematical objects. In this sense, a ''set'' can be likened to a bag, holding a finite (or conceivably infinite) amount of things. Sets can be sets of sets as well (bags with bags in them). However, a set cannot contain duplicates -- a set can contain only one copy of a particular item.

When we look at sets of certain types of numbers, for example, the natural numbers, or the rational numbers, for instance, we may want to speak only of these sets. These collections of numbers are, of course, very important, so we write special symbols to signify them.

We write sets in curly brackets -- { and }. We write all of the ''elements'', or what the set contains, in the brackets, separated by commas. We generally denote sets using capital letters.

For example, we write the set containing the number 0 and the number 1 as {0,1}. If we wish to give it a name, we can say B={0,1}. 

== Special sets ==
The aforementioned collections of numbers, the naturals, rationals, etc. are notated as the following:
* the ''natural'' numbers are written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
: {0,1,2,...}
* the ''integers'' are written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
: {0,1,-1,2,-2,...}
* the ''rational'' numbers are written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
: {0,1,1/2,1/3,...,2,2/3,2/4,...}
* the ''real'' numbers are written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
: {0,&lt;math&gt;-\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;,...}

Here we will generally write these in standard face bold instead of the doublestruck bold you see above. So we write here '''N''' instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; (NB following Wikipedia conventions).

== Notations ==
We can write some special relations involving sets using some symbols.

=== Containment relations ===
To say that an element is in a set, for example, 3 is in the set {1,2,3}, we write:
:&lt;math&gt;3\in\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also express this relationship in another way: we say that 3 is a ''member'' of the set {1,2,3}. Also, we can say the set {1,2,3} ''contains'' 3, but this usage is not recommended as it is also used to refer to subsets (see following).

We can say that two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. For example, the sets {2,3,1} and {3,1,2} both contain the numbers 1, 2 and 3.
We write:
:&lt;math&gt;\{2,3,1\}=\{3,1,2\}&lt;/math&gt;

We write the set with ''no'' elements as &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;, or {}. Here, we use the notation {} for the ''empty set'' (NB following Wikipedia conventions).

=== The concept of the subset ===
A very important concept in set theory and other mathematical areas is the concept of the '''subset'''. 

Say we have two sets A={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, and B={0,1,2,3,4,5}. 
Now, B ''contains some elements'' of A, but not all. We express this relationship between the sets A and B by saying B is a ''subset'' of A.  
We write this
:&lt;math&gt;B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;

If B is a subset of A, but A is not a subset of B, B is said to be a ''proper subset'' of A.
We write this
:&lt;math&gt;B\subset A&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if &lt;math&gt;B\subset A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;

=== Intersections and unions ===
There are two notable and fundamental special operations on sets, the ''intersection'' and the ''union''. These are somewhat analogous to multiplication and addition.

==== Intersection ====
The intersection of two sets A and B are the elements ''common'' to both sets.
For example, if A={1,3,5,7,9} and B={0,1,3}, their intersection, written &lt;math&gt;A\cap B&lt;/math&gt; is the set {1,3}. 

If the intersection of any two sets are empty, we say these sets are ''disjoint''. 

==== Unions ====
The union of two sets A and B are the ''all'' elements in ''both'' sets. For example if A={1,3,5,7,9} and B={0,2,4,6,8}. We say the union, written &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

=== Set comprehensions ===
When we write a set, we can do so by writing all the elements in that set as above. However if we wish to write an ''infinite'' set, then writing out the elements can be too unwieldy. We can solve this problem by writing sets in ''set comprehension'' notation. We do this by writing these sets including a ''rule'' and by a relationship to an ''index set'', say I. That is;
: &lt;math&gt;S=\{x \in I | rule\}&lt;/math&gt;
where rule can be something like ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or ''x''=3''x''.

For example, this set forms the set of all even numbers:
: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{N}| x \mod 2 = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

This set forms the set of all solutions to the general quadratic:
: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{C}| ax^2+bx+c = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Universal sets and complements ===
==== Universal sets ====
When we do work with sets, it is useful to think of a larger set in which to work with. For example, if we are talking about sets {-1,0,1} and {-3,-1,1,3}, we may want to work in '''Z''' in this circumstance. When we talk about working in such a larger set, such as '''Z''' in that instance, we say that '''Z''' is a ''universal set'', and we take all sets to be subsets of this universal set. 

We write the universal set to be &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;, however it may be simpler to denote this as '''E'''. 

==== Complements ====
Given a set A in a larger universal set '''E''', we define the complement of A to be all elements in E that are not in A, that is the complement of A is:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x\in \mathcal{E}|x\not\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;
We write the complement as A' or A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;. In this document we will use A'.

=== Problem set ===
Based on the above information, write the answers to the following questions
(Answers follow to even numbered questions)
# Is &lt;math&gt;3/4\in\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;?
# Is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}\in\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;? &lt;!--2 --&gt;
# Is &lt;math&gt;\{x\in\mathbb{N}|2x\}=\{x\in\mathbb{N}|{x \over 2}\in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;?
# True or false? If false, give an example of an element in the first set which is not in the second. &lt;!--4 --&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
# True or false? If false, give an example of an element in the first set which is not in the second.
## &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
# Is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\} \subset \{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;? &lt;!--6 --&gt;
# Is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,5\} \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;?
# Write the 5 elements of&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{x\in\mathbb{Z}|x-3 \mod 2 = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--8 --&gt;
# Write the elements of&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{x\in\mathbb{C}|x^2+4x-3=0\}&lt;/math&gt;
# Find a universal set such that these sets are subsets thereof: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{Z^+}|a=x^2 and\ \sqrt{a}\in\mathbb{N}\},\{x \in \mathbb{N}|x/3\} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- 10 --&gt;
# Given &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}&lt;/math&gt;, find A' given &lt;math&gt;A={1,4,7,9}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Answers ====
2. No, the square root of 2 is ''irrational'', not a rational number&lt;br&gt;
4.1. Yes &lt;br&gt;
4.2. No&lt;br&gt;
6. Yes.&lt;br&gt;
8. 5 elements could be {3,5,7,9,11}.&lt;br&gt;
10. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}=\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Further ideas ==
These mentioned concepts are not the only ones we can give to set theory. Key ideas that are not necessarily given much detail in this elementary course in set theory but later in abstract algebra and other fields, so it is important to take a grasp on these ideas now.

These may be skipped.

=== Power set ===
The ''power set'', denoted P(S), is the set of ''all'' subsets of S. 
'''''NB''''': The empty set is a subset of '''all''' sets.

For example, P({0,1})={{},{0},{1},{0,1}}

=== Cardinality ===
The ''cardinality'' of a set, denoted |S| is the amount of elements a set has. So |{a,b,c,d}|=4, and so on. The cardinality of a set need not be finite: some sets have infinite cardinality.

==== The cardinality of the power set ====
If P(S)=T, then |T|=2&lt;sup&gt;|S|&lt;/sup&gt;.

==== Problem set ====
Based on the above information, write the answers to the following questions. (Answers follow to even numbered questions)
# |{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}|
# |P({1,2,3})|
# P({0,1,2})
# P({1})

==== Answers ====
2. 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=8&lt;br&gt;
4. {{},{1}}

== Set identities ==
When we spoke of the two fundamental operators on sets before, that of the ''union'' and the ''intersection'', we have a set of rules which we can use to simplify expressions involving sets. For example, given:
:&lt;math&gt;(A\cup B)'\cap B'\cap A&lt;/math&gt;
how can we simplify this?

Several of the following set identities are similar to those in standard mathematics

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure if this is a good idea for building a Wikibook or not. For a while I'll be using it to sort of mirror a technique I used when building very large word documents. During construction we used the expanded index as a tool to aid internal consistancy for the document as a whole. But part of that utility came from the ability to pop open an insert box for a new entry while editing any page.

Wiki page editing has the advantage of being text only, but page separation makes maintaining this list cumbersome at best. If it proves too difficult, I'll find another solution. Of course, suggestions are welcome! ..[[User:LouI|LouI]] 06:00, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)

The '''Polish language''' is a member of the '''Western Slavic''' group of the [[w:Indo-European|Indo-European]] family of languages. It is easiest to learn if one already knows some other related language.

The most closely related are other Western [[w:Slavic languages|Slavic languages]]: [[w:Czech language|Czech]], [[w:Slovak language|Slovak]], [[w:Silesian language|Silesian]], [[w:Kashubian language|Kashubian]] and [[w:Sorbian languages|Sorbian]]. More distant are the Southern and Eastern Slavic languages like [[w:Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[w:Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[w:Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], [[w:Slovenian language|Slovenian]] and [[w:Russian language|Russian]], [[w:Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[w:Belorusian language|Belorusian]], respectively. 

Polish is spoken by a total of approximately 40 million people, making it the second most widely spoken Slavic language in the world, next to Russian. Speakers of related languages can pick it up with not much effort. 

Someone who doesn't speak any Slavic language, but speaks some other Indo-European language, may still find many similarities between Polish grammar and the grammar of that language, as well as many similar words. 

This Wikibook is designed for anyone who wants to learn the basics of the Polish language.  It is suitable for beginners and those who've been learning the language for a few years.

Not doing so makes things messier and doesn't allow to save edit history.

However I've moved some things around, if you are interested... please see [[Talk:Discrete mathematics:Set theory]] for the rationale

Hey again :) I really appreciate the edits to the Group theory article, however could you be a little more &quot;instructional&quot; in the way you write? We need to explicate the ideas for group theory in an extensive way. 

Thanks, and keep contributing! [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:16, 10 Oct 2003 (UTC)</text>

It usually refers either to a given time period or to a completed project phase, activity, or task. Some management techniques compare it to a budget to determine a ''variance'' or status. In other cases, when it is usually called ''earned value'', ACWP may be used to determine interim payments to a contractor.

The encapsulated message is sent over a public network while received messages are stripped of the ''wrapper'' and processed.
This permits non-standard data (from an application like ''Notes'' or ''AppleTalk'') and totally encrypted messages to use the Internet.
The technology is an important element in ''Virtual Private Network'' (VPN) offerings.

The protocols and their overall use are documented by the ''IETF'' in [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3031.txt RFC3031].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article examines the concepts of the ''function'' and the ''relation''.

A '''''relation''''' is any association or link between elements of one set, called the '''''domain''''' or (less formally) the ''set of inputs'', and another set, called the '''''range''''' or ''set of outputs''.  Some people mistakenly refer to the range as the ''codomain''(range), but as we will see, that really means the ''set of all possible outputs''—even values that the relation does not actually use.  (Beware: some authors do not use the term ''codomain''(range), and use the term ''range'' instead for this purpose.  Those authors use the term '''''image''''' for what we are calling ''range''.  So while it '''is''' a mistake to refer to the ''range'' or ''image'' as the ''codomain''(range), it is '''not necessarily''' a mistake to refer to ''codomain'' as ''range''.)

For example, if the ''domain'' is a set Fruits = {apples, oranges, bananas} and the ''codomain''(range) is a set Flavors = {sweetness, tartness, bitterness}, the flavors of these fruits form a relation: we might say that apples are related to (or associated with) '''both''' sweetness and tartness, while oranges are related to tartness only and bananas to sweetness only.  (We might disagree somewhat, but that is irrelevant to the topic of this book.)  Notice that &quot;bitterness&quot;, although it is one of the possible Flavors (codomain)(range), is not really used for any of these relationships; so it is not part of the ''range'' (or ''image'') {sweetness, tartness}.

Another way of looking at this is to say that a relation is a ''subset of ordered pairs'' drawn from the ''set of all possible ordered pairs'' (of elements of two other sets, which we normally refer to as the ''Cartesian product'' of those sets).  Formally, R is a relation if

: R ⊆ X × Y = {(x, y) | x ∈ X, y ∈ Y}

for the domain X and codomain(range) Y.  The '''''inverse relation''''' of R, which is written as R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, is what we get when we interchange the X and Y values:

: R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = {(y, x) | (x, y) ∈ R}

Using the example above, we can write the relation in set notation: {(apples, sweetness), (apples, tartness), (oranges, tartness), (bananas, sweetness)}.  The inverse relation, which we could describe as &quot;fruits of a given flavor&quot;, is {(sweetness, apples), (sweetness, bananas), (tartness, apples), (tartness, oranges)}.  (Here, as elsewhere, the order of elements in a set has no significance.)

One important kind of relation is the ''function''.  A '''''function''''' is a relation that has '''exactly one output''' for every possible input '''in the domain'''.  (The domain does not necessarily have to include all possible objects of a given type.  In fact, we sometimes intentionally use a ''restricted domain'' in order to satisfy some desirable property.)  The relations discussed above (flavors of fruits and fruits of a given flavor) are '''not''' functions: the first has two possible outputs for the input &quot;apples&quot; (sweetness and tartness); and the second has two outputs for both &quot;sweetness&quot; (apples and bananas) and &quot;tartness&quot; (apples and oranges).

The main reason for not allowing multiple outputs with the same input is that it lets us apply the same function to different forms of the same thing without changing their equivalence.  That is, if f is a function with a (or b) in its domain, then a = b implies that f(a) = f(b).  For example, z - 3 = 5 implies that z = 8 because f(x) = x + 3 is a function defined for all numbers x.

The converse, that f(a) = f(b) implies a = b, is not always true.  When it is, there is never more than one ''input'' x for a certain ''output'' y = f(x).  This is the same as the definition of function, but with the roles of X and Y interchanged; so it means the ''inverse relation'' f&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; '''must also''' be a function.  In general—regardless of whether or not the original relation was a function—the inverse relation will ''sometimes'' be a function, and sometimes not.

When f and f&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; are both functions, they are called '''''one-to-one''''', '''''injective''''', or '''''invertible functions'''''.  This is one of two very important properties a function f might (or might not) have; the other property is called '''''onto''''' or '''''surjective''''', which means, for any y ∈ Y (in the codomain), there is some x ∈ X (in the domain) such that f(x) = y.  In other words, a ''surjective'' function f ''maps onto'' every possible output '''at least once'''.

A function can be '''neither''' one-to-one nor onto, '''both''' one-to-one and onto (in which case it is also called '''''bijective''''' or a '''''one-to-one correspondence'''''), or just one and not the other.  (As an example which is neither, consider f = {(0,2), (1,2)}.  It is a function, since there is only one y value for each x value; but there is more than one input x for the output y = 2; and it clearly does not &quot;map onto&quot; all integers.)

== Relations ==
In the above section dealing with functions and their properties, we noted the important property that all functions must have, namely that if a function does map a value from its domain to its co-domain, it must map this value to only one value in the co-domain.

Writing in set notation, if ''a'' is some fixed value:
: |{f(x)|x=a}| ∈ {0, 1}

The literal reading of this statement is: the ''cardinality'' (number of elements) of the set of all values f(x), such that x=a for some fixed value a, is an element of the set {0, 1}.  In other words, the number of ''outputs'' that a function f may have at any fixed ''input'' a is either zero (in which case it is ''undefined'' at that input) or one (in which case the output is unique).

However, when we consider the ''relation'', we relax this constriction, and so a relation may map one value to more than one other value. In general, a relation is '''any''' subset of the Cartesian product of its domain and co-domain.

All functions, then, can be considered as relations also.

=== Notations === 
When we have the property that one value is related to another, we call this relation a ''binary relation'' and we write it as
: x R y
where R is the relation.

For arrow diagrams and set notations, remember for relations we do not have the restriction that functions do and we can draw an arrow to represent the mappings, and for a set diagram, we need only write all the ordered pairs that the relation does take: again, by example
:f = {(0,0),(1,1),(1,-1),(2,2),(2,-2)} 
is a relation and not a function, since both 1 and 2 are mapped to two values, 1 and -1, and 2 and -2 respectively)
example let A=2,3,5;B=4,6,9 then
A*B=(2,4),(2,6),(2,9),(3,4),(3,6),(3,9),(5,4),(5,6),(5,9)
Define a relation R=(2,4),(2,6),(3,6),(3,9)
add functions and problems to one another.

=== Some simple examples ===
Let us examine some simple relations.

Say f is defined by
: {(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,3),(3,1),(2,1),(3,2),(1,3)}

This is a relation (not a function) since we can observe that 1 maps to 2 and 3, for instance.


Less-than, &quot;&lt;&quot;, is a relation also. Many numbers can be less than some other fixed number, so it cannot be a function.

=== Properties ===
When we are looking at relations, we can observe some special properties different relations can have.

==== Reflexive ====
A relation is ''reflexive'' if, we observe that for all values a:
: ''a'' R ''a''
In other words, all values are related to themselves.

The relation of equality, &quot;=&quot; is reflexive. Observe that for, say, all numbers a (the domain is '''R'''):
: ''a'' = ''a''
so &quot;=&quot; is reflexive.

In a reflexive relation, we have arrows for all values in the domain pointing back to themselves:
:[[Image:Arrow diagram reflexive.png]]

Note that ≤ is also reflexive (a ≤ a for any a in '''R'''). On the other hand, the relation &lt; is not (a &lt; a is false for any a in '''R''').

==== Symmetric ====
A relation is ''symmetric'' if, we observe that for all values of a and b:
: ''a'' R ''b'' implies ''b'' R ''a''

The relation of equality again is symmetric. If ''x''=''y'', we can also write that ''y''=''x'' also.

In a symmetric relation, for each arrow we have also an opposite arrow, i.e. there is either no arrow between ''x'' and ''y'', or an arrow points from ''x'' to  ''y'' and an arrow back from ''y'' to ''x'':
:[[Image:Arrow diagram symmetric.png]]

Neither ≤ nor &lt; is symmetric (2 ≤ 3 and 2 &lt; 3  but neither 3 ≤ 2 nor 3 &lt; 2 is true).

==== Transitive ====
A relation is ''transitive'' if for all values ''a'', ''b'', ''c'':
: ''a'' R ''b'' and ''b'' R ''c'' implies ''a'' R ''c''

The relation ''greater-than'' &quot;&gt;&quot; is transitive. If ''x'' &gt; ''y'', and ''y'' &gt; ''z'', then it is true that ''x'' &gt; ''z''. This becomes clearer when we write down what is happening into words. ''x'' is greater than ''y'' and ''y'' is greater than ''z''. So ''x'' is greater than both ''y'' and ''z''.

The relation ''is-not-equal'' &quot;≠&quot; is not transitive. If ''x'' ≠ ''y'' and ''y'' ≠ ''z'' then we might have ''x'' = ''z'' or ''x'' ≠ ''z'' (for example 1 ≠ 2 and 2 ≠ 3 and 1 ≠ 3 but 0 ≠ 1 and 1 ≠ 0 and 0 = 0). 

In the arrow diagram, every arrow between two values ''a'' and ''b'', and ''b'' and ''c'', has an arrow going straight from ''a'' to ''c''.
:[[Image:Arrow diagram transitive.png]]

==== Antisymmetric ====
A relation is ''antisymmetric'' if we observe that for all values ''a'' and ''b'':
: ''a'' R ''b'' and ''b'' R ''a'' implies that ''a''=''b''
'''Notice that antisymmetric is not the same as &quot;not symmetric.&quot;'''

Take the relation ''greater than or equal to'', &quot;&amp;ge;&quot;
If ''x'' &amp;ge; ''y'', and ''y'' &amp;ge; x, then ''y'' must be equal to ''x''.
a relation is anti-symmetric if and only if a∈A, (a,a)∈R

==== Trichotomy ====
A relation satisfies ''trichotomy'' if we observe that for all values ''a'' and ''b'' it holds true that:
''a''R''b'' ''or'' ''b''R''a''

The relation ''is-greater-or-equal'' satisfies since, given 2 real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', it is true that whether ''a'' ≥ ''b'' or ''b'' ≥ ''a'' (both if ''a'' = ''b'').

==== Problem set ==== 
Given the above information, determine which relations are reflexive, transitive, symmetric, or antisymmetric on the following - there may be more than one characteristic. (Answers follow.)
''x'' R ''y'' if 
# x = y
# x &lt; y
# x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
# x &amp;le; y

===== Answers =====
#Symmetric, Reflexive,and transitive
#Transitive, Trichotomy
#Symmetric, Reflexive, and Antisymmetric (x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is just a special case of equality, so all properties that apply to x = y also apply to this case)
#Reflexive, and Antisymmetric (and satisfying Trichotomy)

=== Equivalence relations ===
We have seen that certain common relations such as &quot;=&quot;, and congruence (which we will deal with in the next section) obey some of these rules above. The relations we will deal with are very important in discrete mathematics, and are known as ''equivalence relations''. They essentially assert some kind of equality notion, or ''equivalence'', hence the name.

==== Characteristics of equivalence relations ====
For a relation R to be an ''equivalence relation'', it must have the following properties, viz. R must be:
* symmetric
* transitive
* reflexive
(A helpful mnemonic, S-T-R)

In the previous problem set you have shown equality, &quot;=&quot;, to be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. So &quot;=&quot; is an equivalence relation.

We denote an equivalence relation, in general, by &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example proof ====
Say we are asked to prove that &quot;=&quot; is an equivalence relation.
We then proceed to prove each property above in turn (Often, the proof of transitivity is the hardest).

* '''Reflexive''': Clearly, it is true that ''a'' = ''a'' for all values a.  Therefore, = is reflexive.
* '''Symmetric''': If ''a'' = ''b'', it is also true that ''b'' = ''a''.  Therefore, = is symmetric
* '''Transitive''':  If ''a'' = ''b'' and ''b'' = ''c'', this says that ''a'' is the same as ''b'' which in turn is the same as ''c''. So ''a'' is then the same as ''c'', so ''a''  = ''c'', and thus = is transitive.

Thus = is an equivalence relation.

==== Partitions and equivalence classes ====
It is true that when we are dealing with relations, we may find that many values are related to one fixed value. 

For example, when we look at the quality of ''congruence'', which is that given some number ''a'', a number congruent to ''a'' is one that has the same remainder or ''modulus'' when divided by some number ''n'', as ''a'', which we write
:a &amp;equiv; b (mod n)
and is the same as writing
:''b'' = ''a''+''kn'' for some integer k.
(We will look into congruences in further detail later, but a simple examination or understanding of this idea will be interesting in its application to equivalence relations)

For example, 2 &amp;equiv; 0 (mod 2), since the remainder on dividing 2 by 2 is in fact 0, as is the remainder on dividing 0 by 2.

We can show that congruence is an equivalence relation (This is left as an exercise, below '''Hint''' use the equivalent form of congruence as described above).

However, what is more interesting is that we can group all numbers that are equivalent to each other. 

With the relation congruence ''modulo'' 2 (which is using n=2, as above), or more formally:
: x ~ y if and only if x &amp;equiv; y (mod 2)
we can group all numbers that are equivalent to each other. Observe:
: &lt;math&gt;0 \equiv 2 \equiv 4 \equiv \ldots \pmod{2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;1 \equiv 3 \equiv 5 \equiv \ldots \pmod{2}&lt;/math&gt;
This first equation above tells us all the ''even'' numbers are equivalent to each other under ~, and all the ''odd'' numbers under ~.

We can write this in set notation. However, we have a special notation.
We write:
:[0]={0,2,4,...}
:[1]={1,3,5,...}

and we call these two sets ''equivalence classes''.

All elements in an equivalence class by definition are equivalent to each other, and thus note that we do not need to include [2], since 2 ~ 0.

We call the act of doing this 'grouping' with respect to some equivalence relation ''partitioning'' (or further and explicitly ''partitioning a set S into equivalence classes under a relation ~''). Above, we have partitioned '''Z''' into equivalence classes [0] and [1], under the relation of congruence modulo 2.

==== Problem set ====
Given the above, answer the following questions on equivalence relations (Answers follow to even numbered questions)
# Prove that congruence is an equivalence relation as before (See hint above).
# Partition {x | 1 &amp;le; x &amp;le; 9} into equivalence classes under the equivalence relation 
&lt;math&gt; x \sim y\ \mbox{iff}\ x \equiv y \pmod{6}&lt;/math&gt;

===== Answers =====
2. [0]={6}, [1]={1,7}, [2]={2,8}, [3]={3,9}, [4]={4}, [5]={5}

=== Partial orders ===
We also see that &quot;&amp;ge;&quot; and &quot;&amp;le;&quot; obey some of the rules above. Are these special kinds of relations too, like equivalence relations? Yes, in fact, these relations are specific examples of another special kind of relation which we will describe in this section: the ''partial order''.

As the name suggests, this relation gives some kind of ordering to numbers.

==== Characteristics of partial orders ====
For a relation R to be a partial order, it must have the following three properties, viz R must be:
* reflexive
* antisymmetric
* transitive
(A helpful mnemonic, R-A-T)

We denote a partial order, in general, by &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Question:'''
# Suppose R is a relation on a set of integers Z then prove that R is a partial order relation on Z iff a=b raise to power r.

==== Example proof ====
Say we are asked to prove that &quot;&amp;le;&quot; is a partial order.
We then proceed to prove each property above in turn (Often, the proof of transitivity is the hardest).

===== Reflexive =====
Clearly, it is true that ''a'' &amp;le; ''a'' for all values a.
So &amp;le; is reflexive.

===== Antisymmetric =====
If ''a'' &amp;le; ''b'', and ''b'' &amp;le; ''a'', then a ''must'' be equal to ''b''.
So &amp;le; is antisymmetric

===== Transitive =====
If ''a'' &amp;le; ''b'' and ''b'' &amp;le; ''c'', this says that ''a'' is less than ''b'' and ''c''. So ''a'' is less than ''c'', so ''a'' &amp;le; ''c'', and thus &amp;le; is transitive.

Thus &amp;le; is a partial order.

==== Problem set ====
Given the above on partial orders, answer the following questions
# Prove that divisibility, |, is a partial order (a | b means that a is a factor of b, i.e., on dividing b by a, no remainder results).
#  Prove the following set is a partial order: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''c'', ''d'') implies ''ab''&amp;le;''cd'' for ''a'',''b'',''c'',''d'' integers ranging from 0 to 5. 

===== Answers =====
2. Simple proof; Formalization of the proof is an optional exercise.
:Reflexivity: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''a'', ''b'') since ''ab''=''ab''. 
:Antisymmetric: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''c'', ''d'') and (''c'', ''d'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''a'', ''b'') since ''ab''&amp;le;''cd'' and ''cd''&amp;le;''ab'' imply ''ab''=''cd''. 
:Transitive: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''c'', ''d'') and (''c'', ''d'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''e'', ''f'') implies (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''e'', ''f'') since ''ab''&amp;le;''cd''&amp;le;''ef'' and thus ''ab''&amp;le;''ef''

==== Posets ====
A partial order imparts some kind of &quot;ordering&quot; amongst elements of a set. For example, we only know that 2 &amp;ge; 1 because of the partial ordering &amp;ge;.

We call a set A, ordered under a general partial ordering &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, a ''partially ordered set'', or simply just ''poset'', and write it (A, &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;).

===== Terminology =====
There is some specific terminology that will help us understand and visualize the partial orders. 

When we have a partial order &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, such that ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''b'', we write &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; to say that a &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; but ''a'' &amp;ne; ''b''. We say in this instance that a ''precedes'' b, or ''a'' is a predecessor of ''b''.

If (A, &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;) is a poset, we say that ''a'' is an immediate predecessor of ''b'' (or ''a'' immediately precedes ''b'') if there is no ''x'' in A such that ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; ''b''.

If we have the same poset, and we also have ''a'' and ''b'' in A, then we say ''a'' and ''b'' are ''comparable'' if ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' or ''b'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''a''. Otherwise they are ''incomparable''.

==== Hasse diagrams ====
''Hasse diagrams'' are special diagrams that enable us to visualize the structure of a partial ordering. They use some of the concepts in the previous section to draw the diagram.

A Hasse diagram of the poset (A, &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;) is constructed by
* placing elements of A as points
* if ''a'' and ''b'' &amp;isin; A, and ''a'' is an immediate predecessor of b, we draw a line from ''a'' to ''b''
* if ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; ''b'', put the point for ''a'' lower than the point for ''b''
* not drawing loops from ''a'' to ''a'' (this is assumed in a partial order because of reflexivity)

=== Operations on Relations ===

There are some useful operations one can perform on relations, which allow to 
express some of the above mentioned properties more briefly.

==== Inversion ====
Let R be a relation, then its inversion, R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is defined by

R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; := {(a,b) | (b,a) in R}.

==== Concatenation ====
Let R be a relation between the sets A and B, S be a relation between B and C. We can concatenate
these relations by defining

R &amp;bull; S := {(a,c) | (a,b) in R and (b,c) in S for some b out of B}

==== Diagonal of a Set ====
Let A be a set, then we define the diagonal (D) of A by

D(A) := {(a,a) | a in A}

==== Shorter Notations ====
Using above definitions, one can say (lets assume R is a relation between A and B):

R is ''transitive'' if and only if R &amp;bull; R is a subset of R.

R is ''reflexive'' if and only if D(A) is a subset of R.

R is ''symmetric'' if R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is a subset of R.

R is ''antisymmetric'' if and only if the intersection of R and R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is D(A).

R is ''asymmetric'' if and only if the intersection of D(A) and R is empty.

R is a ''function'' if and only if R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;bull; R is a subset of D(B).

In this case it is a function A &amp;rarr; B.
Let's assume R meets the condition of being a function, then

R is ''injective'' if R &amp;bull; R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is a subset of D(A).

R is ''surjective'' if {b | (a,b) in R} = B.

== Functions ==
A function is a relationship between two sets of numbers. We may think of this as a ''mapping''; a function ''maps'' a number in one set to a number in another set.  Notice that a function maps values to '''one and only one''' value. Two values in one set could map to one value, but one value '''must never''' map to two values: that would be a relation, ''not'' a function.

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Allowed_mapping_for_a_function.png]]
|}

For example, if we write (define) a function as:
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;
then we say:
:'f of x equals x squared'
and we have
: &lt;math&gt;f(-1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(7)=49&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(1/2)=1/4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(4)=16&lt;/math&gt;
and so on.

This function f maps numbers to their squares.

=== Range and codomain ===
If D is a set, we can say
: &lt;math&gt;f(D) = \{f(x) |\ x \in D\}&lt;/math&gt;

which forms a nee of f is usually a subset of a larger set. This set is known as the ''codomain'' of a function. For example, with the function f(''x'')=cos ''x'', the range of f is [-1,1], '''but''' the codomain is the set of real numbers.

=== Notations ===
When we have a function f, with domain D and range R, we write:
:&lt;math&gt;f : D \longrightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;

If we say that, for instance, ''x'' is mapped to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, we also can add
:&lt;math&gt;f : D \longrightarrow R;\ x \longmapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that we can have a function that maps a point (''x'',''y'') to a real number, or some other function of two variables -- we have a set of ordered pairs as the domain. Recall from set theory that this is defined by the ''Cartesian product'' - if we wish to represent a set of all real-valued ordered pairs we can take the Cartesian product of the real numbers with itself to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}^2=\{(x,y)|\ x\ \mbox{and}\ y \in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;.
When we have a set of ''n''-tuples as part of the domain, we say that the function is ''n''-ary (for numbers ''n''=1,2 we say unary, and binary respectively).
=== Other function notation ===
Functions can be written as above, but we can also write them in two other ways. One way is to use an arrow diagram to represent the mappings between each element. We write the elements from the domain on one side, and the elements from the range on the other, and we draw arrows to show that an element from the domain is mapped to the range.

For example, for the function f(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the arrow diagram for the domain {1,2,3} would be:
[[Image:Arrow diagram example.jpg]]

Another way is to use set notation. If f(''x'')=''y'', we can write the function in terms of its mappings. This idea is best to show in an example.

Let us take the domain D={1,2,3}, and f(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then, the range of f will be R={f(1),f(2),f(3)}={1,4,9}. Taking the Cartesian product of D and R we obtain F={(1,1),(2,4),(3,9)}.

So using set notation, a function can be expressed as the Cartesian product of its domain and range.
 f(''x'')
This function is called ''f'', and it takes a ''variable'' ''x''. We substitute some value for ''x'' to get the second value, which is what the function maps x to.

===Types of functions===
Functions can either be '''''one to one (injective), onto (surjective), or bijective'''''.
 
''&lt;u&gt;'''INJECTIVE Functions'''&lt;/u&gt;'' are functions in which every element in the domain maps into a unique elements in the codomain.

''&lt;u&gt;'''SURJECTIVE Functions'''&lt;/u&gt;'' are functions in which every element in the codomain is mapped by an element in the domain.

&lt;u&gt;''''''BIJECTIVE''' Functions&lt;/u&gt;''' are functions that are both injective and surjective.

---onto functions '''&lt;/u&gt;''' a function f form A to B is onto ,

----
=The Myth of the User=
There are several terms widely used in the computer industry that are not clearly defined. The result is that everyone understands them and uses them, but the use may tend to complicate rather than illuminate a discussion. This outline looks just two of these terms in the context of an application within a fairly large corporation. Then it draws some conclusions about the impact of context on the use of terminology.

Consider the terms User and Application. The '''User''' is defined as ''the person who uses a computer''. The '''Platform''' is ''the hardware or software that supports an application or a system''. The suggested application is one of monitoring and use of a particular resource pool across an area of the company. 
==The Application==
Project and unit managers share a common resource pool. They budget and track the use of the pool in their area. They use a series of spreadsheets that show their planned vs. actual use of many resources. The data is extracted for their status reports. The data is also uploaded through the company's networks for use in other summaries of the effective use of the resource pool. These support the manager and planning staff that are responsible for the pool.

To make this work, a set of spreadsheet macros are in place to ensure data validity and consistency. These templates are put in place by the corporate IT staff. The ''end-user'' needs to record their work results, using the spreadsheets by an arbitrary cutoff time on Friday. 
==The Software Hierarchy==
Now consider the hierarchy of software engineering that puts this application in place.
# The Spreadsheet application has a programming team that work for the software vendor. They assume an Intel Pentium running Windows NT as their platform. They produce a set of software that integrates the work of the Visual Basic for Applications team with the next release of the operating system software and their own code (written in C++) to produce a working application.
# The vendors packaging team puts this together with the other desktop embedded applications to produce an integrated version or release of the composite operating system.
# The corporate IT department takes this software, along with the company ''standard'' network, Operating System,, and desktop applications as their platform. They add the VBA macros with  upload and reporting utilities that will make the aggregate set of applications work. Then they ''lock'' the results to ensure that no bad input comes from the end-users. They deliver their work to the system administrators.
# The system administrators in each division install the results. Some of these are on department servers, and some on individual desktops. The entire assembled application is their platform, and the desktops of the affected staff the target domain for their work.
# The individual manager now uses the entire work product as a seamless platform to do their work.
The example could be extended further. The extensions in Step 3 could be produced by an outside ''Value Added Reseller'' to produce a resource planning system. Step 1 could look into the earlier history in Hardware for PC Configuration, BIOS, Operating Systems, The C++ compiler, etc. But these 5 layers are quite complex enough to illustrate the terminology problems.

''For those who are have never worked in this situation, this is NOT an uncommon example. Millions of people work in this environment every day at your bank, your university, or the manufacturer of your automobile.''
==The Confusion==
The above example is fine when it works. But, what about when it fails? As the end-user, I've got a problem in my spreadsheet, and an error message. I find something from the 1st level, the ''User's Guide'', and try to find a solution. But it is a hopeless quest. I can't use most of the options they discuss. I can't even inspect the VBA code that the guide says my error message comes from. The usually helpful System Admin who put this new update on my desk is equally puzzled, and other users haven't reported a problem. So, '''what went wrong?'''

Every layer in the hierarchy has their own viewpoint. Everything in the layers above them is viewed as a ''Platform'' and constitutes a given. Every participant in the layers below them is the '''User''' and is considered with the same monolithic view.

In some cases, the monolithic view is correct, but even then it is usually distorted. When I buy a new PC for home use, I have the seemingly unfiltered copy of the spreadsheet. But even here, the software was preinstalled by the people I bought the PC from. They chose certain options left by the 1st level spreadsheet team to make the installed software work with this particular configuration. Certain other options may be precluded by their choices.

A really good practitioner working in the hierarchy will be partially aware one layer above and below their own level. They can influence the layer above them, through user groups or other methods. They can consider the needs of those one layer below them, and improve their product and documentation to help out, but only as limited by budgets and competitive factors.
==Conclusions==
If you begin to understand the problem, then '''''Welcome to the world of Computers!'''''. But you can also understand how many niches in this world open opportunities for integrators and vendors. How a ''Peoplesoft'' vendor can package and sell an integrated solution for a business function. How a high-powered consulting firm can charge high prices to help corporate management try to cope. Why the industry keeps looking for something like an ''XML'' magic wand to make it fit together. 

And most of all, how some kind of mental framework is needed before you can see how the pieces fit together. This kind of a framework is called an ''Architecture'', and several of them are needed to see how the pieces fit together.

Why use square brackets for the differential operator? 
IMHO, round brackets are just fine... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:17, 16 Aug 2003 (UTC)

: My calc book uses square brackets when differentiating an expression, like &lt;math&gt;{d \over dx} [x^2]&lt;/math&gt;.  Some is style, some is real theory.  Ex.: what is &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} {\Delta y \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;?  Why it's &lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx}&lt;/math&gt; of course.  It would look wierd to have &lt;math&gt;{\Delta \over \Delta x} y&lt;/math&gt;; delta what, right?  So I guess that's the reason.  However, that's also why I think that the equation for the derivative should be &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} {f(x + \Delta x) - f(x) \over \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt; because it correctly shows what dy/dx really means.[[User:Boothinator|Boothinator]] 02:17, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)
==question==

How do the last two steps listed for ''f'(sin(x))'' work? [[User:Ugen64|Ugen64]] 01:09, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)

: You mean D sin(''x'')? The second summand should be clear (from sin(x)/x -&gt; 1 as x-&gt;0), and the second is a result from that limit, though I should point that out in the article (and leave it to the Trig page ;). [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:20, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::Is it worth it to prove the product rule, division rule, or chain rule here? Do prove the mean value theorem in this book?
--[[User:Cronian|Cronian]] 07:43, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:::OK, am I the only one who can't see the apostrophe in &lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt;'(x)?  If not, should I put a space after the &lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt;, or is there a better way to make it more readable? --Xhad

If you itallicize the 'f' and the 'prime' you can read it a bit more clearly: &lt;I&gt;f'&lt;/I&gt;(x).
The whole bit itallicized: &lt;i&gt;f'(x)&lt;/i&gt;. Maybe that's better? &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#347235&quot;&gt;ChaoticLlama&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:59, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

==question==

In the differentiation rules (d/dx)c=0 and (d/dx)mx=m, what exactly does &quot;d&quot; stand for?  does it stand for change in x and y???  could somebody please explain these rules more clearly?
--[[Elpenmaster]]
:I think of the letter d as meaning &quot;a tiny '''d'''ifference&quot;.&lt;br&gt;..... (d/dx)c means a tiny difference of a constant (obviously there is none, or else it would not be a constant!) divided by a tiny difference in x is zero.&lt;br&gt;..... And (d/dx)mx means (a tiny difference of the product m times x) divided by (a tiny difference in x) is m, where m, by the way, is the trigonometric tangent of the angle of that line (y = mx + any constant) against the horizontal.

::First: The power rule is used in an example (about the addition rule) before it is introduced. Would people new to calculus be confused by the sudden transformation and miss the point of the example as a whole?

::Second: Regarding proofs, in my opinion, lengthy proofs (read, &quot;90% of proofs&quot;) are not overly important to the average reader. I believe that important proofs (chain rule, product rule, etc.) could all be placed on a seperate page in order to keep the text from becoming cluttered. If the goal is to reach people who don't already understand calculus, too much notation all at once becomes confusing and distracting.

== power rule ==
I noticed that the power rule section said &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^n\right]=nx^{n-1}, n\ne0&lt;/math&gt;. If you work it out when &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;, you get &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^0\right]=0x^{0-1}=0x^{-1}=0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;x^{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;, you get &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[1\right]=0&lt;/math&gt;, which is true. Unless I made a mistake, the &lt;math&gt;n\ne0&lt;/math&gt; is not needed. Should it be taken out of the equation? [[User:DanielLC|DanielLC]] 00:28, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

While often &lt;math&gt;x^{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;, there is some confusion over the special case of ''x=0'' (''0^0'') [http://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/10005.3-5.shtml][http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.09.99/J322711.html][http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58214.html][http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.0.to.0.power.html].

The &lt;math&gt;n\ne0&lt;/math&gt; keeps us far, far away from that one point of confusion.

== bold new words ==
Should new words like &quot;derivative&quot; and &quot;differentiable&quot; (Section 2.1) be emphasized (bold/italic) for clarity? --anonymous

I think the first thing that should be included on this page is the definition of the derivative of a function by First Principles, ie. limit of the gradient of secants, and then possibly explain some of the derivatives pulled, apparently, out of the blue, in terms of that.

Second, for those asking what the d in (d/dx)c is all about - d/dx is a &quot;differential operator&quot;, which means it's something that acts on a function to differentiate it, in this case with respect to x. It follows ''some'' of the rules of normal fractions, so you have (d/dx)(f(x)), which means &quot;the derivative (with respect to x) operator applied to the function f of x&quot;, and write it df/dx, which means &quot;the derivative of f with respect to x&quot; (ie. pretty much the same thing). Then if f(x) = c, ie. a constant function, then you can write either (d/dx)c or dc/dx, both of which equal 0. [[User:203.26.177.2|203.26.177.2]] 18:52, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

==High school==
I'm a bored high school student currently in Precalc, trying to teach myself derivatives, so hopefully I can contribute to this project.  I had to read the old Sales Example several times to figure out exactly what was going on, so I tried to make it more clear, based on what I gathered from the article, and also tried to make it more text-bookesque.  Someone please check the changes in that section, because I'm not entirely sure I'm correct.
--[[User:SimRPGman|SimRPGman]] 03:44, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:Well done for deciding to contribute, it is a great way to learn the subject.   That example looks correct to me.  My only concern is the sentence
&quot;Because the functions are defined for all n &gt;= 0 and are only differentiable in n &gt; 0, the only points that can be minima or maxima are those above.&quot;

:Actually it is defined and differentiable for all ''n''.  But we are only concerned with positive ''n'' (as it makes no sense to produce -5 items).  
:Also here are some idead which might make the example clearer
* Instead of 8.1n maybe use (8.1)n.   When I first read it I thought it mean 8.(1n)
* It is implicit by using the integer ''n'' that we are dealing with whole numbers. (otherwise we should use a letter like x,y,z).     Since the max is 3.97.... the seller really has to produce 4 units (as that is the nearest whole number) [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 11:34, 27 October 2005 (UTC)


::The previously quoted sentence was like that when I had it.
::The example states that all amounts are in thousands, so 3.797 thousand units would be a valid amount  at 3,797 units.

:::My mistake, you are right. [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 23:52, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

==Confused==
Hey folks, the section on the Maxima and Minima confused the heck out of me.  I tried to re-word the first paragraph, as I thought I grasped the point, but the second paragraph eluded me.  If someone with more math knowledge than me (I'm trying to learn this stuff) could take a look I'd appreciate it.  It almost seems as though it were written by someone with English as a second language, or just someone who knows their math but perhaps isn't as smooth with English.  Not that I'm criticising the effort!  Thanks all.--Dave
: Agreed.  These two paragraphs need to be expanded (it might take a few pages in an ordinary textbook).  One way to learn is to write.  Do you want to get involved? [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 12:43, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
:: (This is me, the same as above--I just got an account) Well, that sounds like a challenge...sure, I'm game.  Let me give it a shot and then get a critique. [[User:Dubitable|Dubitable]] 13:52, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
Also on the subject of Maxima and Minima, I &quot;stole&quot; some info from Wikipedia and formed it into a introduction to the concept.  A picture would really be nice.  Should we use Wikipedia's picture? --[[User:SimRPGman|SimRPGman]] 05:41, 7 November 2005 (UTC)
::: Sure, take any material from wikipedia if you think it is suitable.  You should maybe add a line at the bottom of the page to say you have taken material from wikipedia, and put in a link (although I am not 100% sure what is really necessary) [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 02:18, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
Ok, I took a swing at that last paragraph on Maxima and Minima and actually made two paragraphs out of it.  Please review and see if it's any clearer and if I'm right (because I'm not entirely certain I am). --[[User:SimRPGman|SimRPGman]] 04:27, 21 November 2005 (UTC)


Whoever is editing this book needs to stop adding &quot;Example&quot; as a category - it appears in the table of contents and looks very cumbersome. If each subcategory extended for more than page - THEN it might be good to add example to the table of contents - but as it stands it just looks horrible. I fixed a couple of them.

== Better exercises needed ==

I've already been through the mill on learning derivatives and can practically do them in my sleep (I'm a AP Calculus C student), but I had to read the exercise at the bottom of the page twice to understand what it's asking. To someone who's just learning differentiation it's a horribly ambiguous question to ask. I've added some simpler straightforward differentiation exercises above the existing one, which is now at the bottom of the list (if someone could clean up my LaTEX equation syntax, I'd appreciate it; I've never used it myself). It's better to go through the process itself a few times from a few different approaches before getting that in-depth into the workings of it--asking a student to use the definition of derivative to prove the theories discussed in the article before having them actually do any differentiation independently of running it through the definition of derivative is a bit of a stretch. I also reworded the exercise that was already there to make it a little more clear in what it's asking. --[[User:Jesse Hannah|Jesse Hannah]] 05:38, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

== What is Differentiation? ==

This section is a little bit in depth for someone who is just being introduced to derivatives. While those of us who have already taken calculus would understand it fine, I am a little worried that those who have not taken calculus will be lost as soon as you start introducing syntax. I think this section should just mention that differentiation is a way of solving the tangent problem, and leave it at that. Maybe mentioning the difference quotient would be good.

== Overall Structure ==

I've been reading through the differentiation article several times making edits as I go, however I've noticed there is little flow in this article; Even from sentence to sentence.
As I finish finalizing the notes I am creating, I will post the structure and teaching method that I believe to be most effective. I would appreciate any comments in modifying this layout, yet do not reply if you merely wish to comment on this post.

== Section Removed ==

&lt;code&gt;This may be surprising, because &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; fits &lt;math&gt;y=mx+c&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;m=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c=0&lt;/math&gt;, and taking the derivative treating &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; as a constant gives &lt;math&gt;f'(x)=m&lt;/math&gt;, then putting back &lt;math&gt;m=x&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;f'(x)=x&lt;/math&gt;. This is '''wrong''' because here &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is not constant! It is indeed identical to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by our own definition, and its influence on the curve must also be considered when taking the derivative. For a correct analysis, you would need to apply the product rule to both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; which would give &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = m + x = 2x&lt;/math&gt;, matching the above result.&lt;/code&gt;

I don't see how this hand-waving argument adds to the article. Any comments otherwise? [[User:ChaoticLlama|ChaoticLlama]] 14:53, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

== Moving Sections Around ==

IMO, this article should be focused on describing the theory of differention, and its techniques.
Topics such as Maxima &amp; Minima or the Sales Example are clearly applications of differentiation.
I'd move Max &amp; Mins to applications, and put the sales example under Mean Value Theorem.
Thoughts?

:Well, I agree sales and extrema are application, but the concept of local extrema, and their relation to differentiation, is very important. So if and when they are moved, they should receive their own clearly defined section, preferably at the very top of the application section. cheers. --[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:56, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

:I agree with both. The extrema section is (now) well written, but it doesn't flow with the rest of this page. More importantly it relies on [[Calculus/Higher Order Derivatives]], which is a later module. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 01:16, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

== addition and subtraction ==
In the very first line of the section on addition and subtraction rules, the brackets in the expression in the numerator are imbalanced. There are 2 open brackets and 1 close bracket. I would think we need a close bracket just to the left of the first minus sign.

==Unusual Terminology==
Hi, I find the use of the term &quot;Gradient&quot; a bit unusual.  I have not often encountered the phrase, and most calculus books I have encountered stick with the term slope.  I am fine with keeping the first sentence of section &quot;The Definition of Slope&quot; but I think after that it would be wise to use the term slope.  Does anyone mind if I make this change?

I don't have time to implement this now, but if someone else would like to, it would be nice to have a brief discussion of where the power rule for non-integer exponents comes from.

'''Ordinary differential equations''' involve equations containing:
* variables
* functions
* their derivatives
and their solutions.

In studying integration, you ''already'' have considered solutions to very simple differential equations. For example, when you look to solving
: &lt;math&gt;\int f(x) \,dx=g(x)&lt;/math&gt;
for g(x), you are really solving the differential equation
: &lt;math&gt; g'(x) = f(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Notations and terminology ==
The notations we use for solving differential equations will be crucial in the ease of solubility for these equations. 

This document will be using '''three''' notations primarily:
* f' to denote the derivative of f
* D ''f'' to denote the derivative of ''f''
* &lt;math&gt;{df \over dx}&lt;/math&gt; to denote the derivative of ''f'' (for separable equations).

=== Terminology ===
Consider the differential equation
: &lt;math&gt;3 f^{\prime \prime}(x)+5xf(x)=11&lt;/math&gt;

Since the equation's highest derivative is 2, we say that the differential equation is of ''order'' 2.

== Some simple differential equations ==
A key idea in solving differential equations will be that of [[Calculus/Definite integral|integration]].

Let us consider the second order differential equation (remember that a function acts on a value).
:&lt;math&gt;f''(x)=2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

How would we go about solving this? It tells us that on differentiating twice, we obtain the constant 2 so, if we integrate twice, we should obtain our result. 

Integrating once first of all: 	

:&lt;math&gt;\int f''(x) \,dx = \int 2 \,dx&lt;/math&gt; 	
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=2x+C_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; 	

We have transformed the apparently difficult second order differential equation into a rather simpler one, viz.

:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=2x+C_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation tells us that if we differentiate a function once, we get &lt;math&gt;2x+C_1&lt;/math&gt;. If we integrate once more, we should find the solution.

:&lt;math&gt;\int f'(x) \,dx = \int 2x+C_1 \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2+C_1x+C_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; 

This is the ''solution'' to the differential equation. We will get &lt;math&gt;f''=2 \,&lt;/math&gt; for ''all'' values of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The values &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are related to quantities known as ''initial conditions''.

Why are initial conditions useful? ODEs (ordinary differential equations) are useful in modeling physical conditions. We may wish to model a certain physical system which is initially at rest (so one initial condition may be zero), or wound up to some point (so an initial condition may be nonzero, say 5 for instance) and we may wish to see how the system reacts under such an initial condition. 

When we solve a system with given initial conditions, we substitute them after our process of integration.
===Example===
When we solved &lt;math&gt;f''(x)=2 \,&lt;/math&gt; say we had the initial conditions &lt;math&gt;f'(0)=3 \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(0)=2 \,&lt;/math&gt;. (Note, initial conditions need not occur at f(0)).

After we integrate we make substitutions:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(0)=2(0)+C_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3=C_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int f'(x) \,dx = \int 2x+3 \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2+3x+C_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(0)=0^2+3(0)+C_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2=C_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2+3x+2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Without initial conditions, the answer we obtain is known as the ''general solution'' or the solution to the ''family of equations''. With them, our solution is known as a ''specific solution''.

== Basic first order DEs ==
In this section we will consider ''four'' main types of differential equations:
* separable
* homogeneous
* linear
* exact

There are many other forms of differential equation, however, and these will be dealt with in the next section

=== Separable equations ===
A ''separable'' equation is in the form (using dy/dx notation which will serve us greatly here)
:&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx} = f(x)/g(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Previously we have only dealt with simple differential equations with g(''y'')=1. How do we solve such a separable equation as above?

We group ''x'' and ''dx'' terms together, and ''y'' and ''dy'' terms together as well.
:&lt;math&gt;g(y)\ dy = f(x)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;
Integrating both sides with respect to y on the left hand side and x on the right hand side:
:&lt;math&gt;\int g(y)\,dy=\int f(x)\,dx+C&lt;/math&gt;

we will obtain the solution.

==== Worked example ====
Here is a worked example illustrating the process.

We are asked to solve
:&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx} = 3x^2y&lt;/math&gt;

Separating
:&lt;math&gt;{dy \over y} = (3x^2)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
Integrating
:&lt;math&gt;\int {dy \over y} = \int 3x^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ln{y}=x^3+C \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y=e^{x^3+C}&lt;/math&gt;
Letting &lt;math&gt;k = e^C&lt;/math&gt; where k is a constant we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;y=ke^{x^3}&lt;/math&gt;
which is the general solution.

==== Verification ====
This step does not need to be part of your work, but if you want to check your solution, you can verify your answer by differentiation.

We obtained
:&lt;math&gt;y=ke^{x^3}&lt;/math&gt;
as the solution to
:&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx} = 3x^2y&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating our solution with respect to x,
:&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx} = 3kx^2e^{x^3}&lt;/math&gt;

And since &lt;math&gt;y=ke^{x^3}&lt;/math&gt;, we can write
:&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx} = 3x^2y&lt;/math&gt;
We see that we obtain our original differential equation, thus our work must be correct.

=== Homogeneous equations ===
A ''homogeneous'' equation is in the form 
:&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx} = f(y/x)&lt;/math&gt;

This looks difficult as it stands, however we can utilize the substitution
:&lt;math&gt;v = {y \over x}&lt;/math&gt;
so that we are now dealing with F(v) rather than F(y/x).

Now we can express y in terms of v, as ''y''=''xv'' and use the product rule.

The equation above then becomes, using the product rule
:&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx} = v+x{dv \over dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Then
:&lt;math&gt;v+x{dv \over dx} = f(v)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x{dv \over dx} = f(v)-v&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{dv \over dx} = {f(v)-v \over x}&lt;/math&gt;
which is a separable equation and can be solved as above.

However let's look at a worked equation to see how homogeneous equations are solved.

==== Worked example ====
We have the equation
:&lt;math&gt; {dy \over dx} = {y^2 + x^2 \over yx}&lt;/math&gt;

This does not appear to be immediately separable, but let us expand to get
:&lt;math&gt; {dy \over dx} = {y^2 \over yx} + {x^2 \over yx}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {dy \over dx} = {x \over y} + {y \over x}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting ''y''=''xv'' which is the same as substituting ''v''=''y''/''x'':
:&lt;math&gt; {dy \over dx} = 1/v + v&lt;/math&gt;

Now
:&lt;math&gt; v+x{dv \over dx} = 1/v + v&lt;/math&gt;
Canceling ''v'' from both sides
:&lt;math&gt; x{dv \over dx} = 1/v&lt;/math&gt;
Separating
:&lt;math&gt; v\, dv = dx/x&lt;/math&gt;
Integrating both sides
:&lt;math&gt; {1 \over 2}v^2+C= \ln(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {1 \over 2}\left({y \over x}\right)^2= \ln(x)-C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y^2 = 2x^2 \ln(x) - 2Cx^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = x\sqrt{2 \ln(x) - 2C}&lt;/math&gt;

which is our desired solution.

=== Linear equations ===
A linear first order differential equation is a differential equation in the form
:&lt;math&gt; a(x){dy \over dx} + b(x)y=c(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying or dividing this equation by any non-zero function of ''x'' makes no difference to its solutions so we could always divide by ''a''(''x'') to make the coefficient of the differential 1, but writing the equation in this more general form may offer insights.

At first glance, it is not possible to integrate the left hand side, but there is one special case. If ''b'' happens to be the differential of ''a'' then we can write

:&lt;math&gt;a(x){dy \over dx} + b(x)y = a(x){dy \over dx} + y{da \over dx}
= {d \over dx}a(x)y &lt;/math&gt;

and integration is now straightforward.

Since we can freely multiply by any function, lets see if we can use this freedom to write the left hand side in this special form.

We multiply the entire equation by an arbitrary, ''I''(''x''), getting

:&lt;math&gt; aI{dy \over dx} + bIy=cI&lt;/math&gt;

then impose the condition

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}aI = bI &lt;/math&gt;

If this is satisfied the new left hand side will have the special form. Note that multiplying ''I'' by any constant will leave this condition still satisfied.

Rearranging this condition gives

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{I}\frac{dI}{dx} = \frac{b-\frac{da}{dx}}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

We can integrate this to get

:&lt;math&gt; \ln I(x) = \int \frac{b(z)}{a(z)}dz - \ln a(x) + c \quad
I(x)=\frac{k}{a(x)}e^{\int \frac{b(z)}{a(z)}dz}&lt;/math&gt;

We can set the constant ''k'' to be 1, since this makes no difference.

Next we use ''I'' on the original differential equation, getting

:&lt;math&gt; e^{\int \frac{b(z)}{a(z)}dz}{dy \over dx} + 
e^{\int \frac{b(z)}{a(z)}dz} \frac{b(x)}{a(x)}y
=e^{\int \frac{b(z)}{a(z)}dz}\frac{c(x)}{a(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Because we've chosen ''I'' to put the left hand side in the special form we can
rewrite this as 

:&lt;math&gt; {d \over dx}(ye^{\int \frac{b(z)}{a(z)}dz}) = 
e^{\int \frac{b(z)}{a(z)}dz}\frac{c(x)}{a(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating both sides and dividing by &lt;math&gt;e^I&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the final result

:&lt;math&gt; y = e^{-\int \frac{b(z)}{a(z)}dz}
\left(\int e^{\int \frac{b(z)}{a(z)}dz}\frac{c(x)}{a(x)}dx + C\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

We call ''I'' an ''integrating factor''. Similar techniques can be used on some other calculus problems.

====Example====

Consider

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} + y \tan x = 1 \quad y(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;

First we calculate the integrating factor.

:&lt;math&gt;I=e^{\int \tan x dx} = e^ {\ln \sec x} = \sec x &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying the equation by this gives


:&lt;math&gt;\sec x \frac{dy}{dx} + y \sec x \tan x = \sec x &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} y\sec x = \sec x &lt;/math&gt;

We can now integrate

:&lt;math&gt; y = \cos x \int_0^x \sec z \, dz = \cos x \ln (\sec x + \tan x) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Exact equations ===
An exact equation is in the form
: f(''x'', ''y'') d''x'' + g(''x'', ''y'') d''y'' = 0
and, has the property that
: D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; f = D&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; g
(If the differential equation does not have this property then we can't proceed any further).

As a result of this, if we have an exact equation then there exists a function h(''x'', ''y'') such that 
: D&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; h = f and D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; h = g

So then the solutions are in the form
: h(''x'', ''y'') = c
by using the fact of the total differential.
We can find then h(''x'', ''y'') by integration

&lt;!-- === Worked example ===
Consider the differential equation 
: (3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) d''x'' + ( (3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+4''y'') d''y''

It is exact since
: D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 6''x''
: D&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+4''y'') = 6''x''

Now, there exists a function h such that
: 1) D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; h = f = (3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
: 2) D&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; h = g = (3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+4''y'') 

Integrate D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; h, with treating ''y'' as a constant:
: h(''x'', ''y'') = 2''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''+r(''y'')
(We have the function r(''y'') because on differentiating with respect to ''x'' of the above expression, r(''y'') disappears - this is the similar procedure of adding an arbitrary constant)

So now, 
: D&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; h = 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+6''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+r'(x)
Comparing with (2), we see r'(''y'')=4''y'', so r(''y'')=2''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''C''

So substituting above, we get 
: h(''x'', ''y'')2''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''+2''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''C'' = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant, and our most general solution is then 
: 2''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''+2''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=''k''
and we have simply moved the two constants to the one side of the expression and made this one constant
--&gt;

==Basic second and higher order ODE's==

The generic solution of a ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order ODE will contain ''n'' constants of integration. To calculate them we need ''n'' more equations.
Most often, we have either
:boundary conditions, the values of ''y'' and its derivatives take for two different values of ''x'' 
or
:initial conditions, the values of ''y'' and its first ''n-1'' derivatives take  for one particular value of ''x''.

===Reducible ODE's===

1.  If the independent variable, ''x'', does not occur in the differential equation then its order can be lowered by one. This will reduce a second order ODE to first order.

Consider the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;F\left(y,\frac{dy}{dx},\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
Define
:&lt;math&gt;u=\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\frac{du}{dx}=\frac{du}{dy}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{du}{dy}\cdot u&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute these two expression into the equation and we get
:&lt;math&gt;F\left(y,u,\frac{du}{dy}\cdot u\right)&lt;/math&gt;=0
which is a first order ODE

====Example====
Solve
:&lt;math&gt;1+2y^2\operatorname{D}^2y=0&lt;/math&gt;
if at ''x''=0,&amp;nbsp; ''y''=D''y''=1

First, we make the substitution, getting
:&lt;math&gt;1+2y^2 u \frac{du}{dy}=0&lt;/math&gt;
This is a first order ODE.
By rearranging terms we can separate the variables
:&lt;math&gt;udu=-\frac{dy}{2y^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Integrating this gives
:&lt;math&gt;u^2/2=c+1/2y&lt;/math&gt;
We know the values of ''y'' and ''u'' when ''x''=0 so we can find ''c''
:&lt;math&gt;c=u^2/2-1/2y=1^2/2-1/(2\cdot 1)=1/2-1/2=0&lt;/math&gt;
Next, we reverse the substitution
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}^2=u^2=\frac{1}{y}&lt;/math&gt;
and take the square root
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}&lt;/math&gt;
To find out which sign of the square root to keep, we use the initial condition, D''y''=1 at ''x''=0, again, and rule out the negative square root.
We now have another separable first order ODE,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}&lt;/math&gt;
Its solution is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}y^\frac{3}{2}= x+d&lt;/math&gt;
Since ''y''=1 when ''x''=0, ''d''=2/3, and 
:&lt;math&gt;y=\left(1 + \frac{3x}{2} \right)^\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

2.  If the dependent variable, ''y'', does not occur in the differential equation then it may also be reduced to a first order equation.

Consider the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;F\left(x,\frac{dy}{dx},\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
Define
:&lt;math&gt;u=\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\frac{du}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute these two expressions into the first equation and we get
:&lt;math&gt;F\left(x,u,\frac{du}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;=0
which is a first order ODE

===Linear ODEs===
An ODE of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}+a_1(x)\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}}+ ... +a_n y=F(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is called '''linear'''. Such equations are much simpler to solve than typical non-linear ODEs. Though only a few special cases can be solved exactly in terms of elementary functions, there is much that can be said about the solution of a generic linear ODE. A full account would be beyond the scope of this book &lt;!-- This book covers up to 1st year undergraduate, per intro. Save special functions (Bessel, Legendre etc), Sturm-Liouville problem, eigenfunctions, orthonormal bases, etc for a later book --&gt;


If ''F(x)=0'' for all ''x'' the ODE is called '''homogeneous'''

Two useful properties of generic linear equations are
#Any linear combination of solutions of an homogeneous linear equation is also a solution.
#If we have a solution of a nonhomogeneous linear equation and we add any solution of the corresponding homogenous linear equation we get another solution of the nonhomogeneous linear equation

====Variation of constants====

Suppose we have a linear ODE,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}+a_1(x)\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}}+ ... +a_n y=0&lt;/math&gt;
and we know one solution, ''y=w(x)''

The other solutions can always be written as ''y=wz''. This substitution in the ODE will give us terms involving every differential of ''z'' upto the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, no higher, so we'll end up with an ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order linear ODE for ''z''.

We know that ''z'' is constant is one solution, so the ODE for ''z'' must not contain a ''z'' term, which means it will effectively be an ''n-1''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order linear ODE. We will have reduced the order by one.

Lets see how this works in practice.

=====Example=====

Consider
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\frac{2}{x}\frac{dy}{dx}-\frac{6}{x^2}y=0&lt;/math&gt;

One solution of this is ''y=x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', so substitute ''y=zx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' into this equation.

:&lt;math&gt;\left( x^2\frac{d^2z}{dx^2}+4x\frac{dz}{dx}+2z\right) 
+\frac{2}{x} \left( x^2\frac{dz}{dx}+2xz \right) -\frac{6}{x^2}x^2 z=0&lt;/math&gt;

Rearrange and simplify.
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 D^2 z + 6xD z=0&lt;/math&gt; 
This is first order for D''z''. We can solve it to get
:&lt;math&gt;z=A x^{-5} \quad y=A x^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the equation is linear we can add this to any multiple of the other solution to get the general solution,

:&lt;math&gt;y=A x^{-3} + B x^2&lt;/math&gt;

====Linear homogeneous ODE's with constant coefficients====

Suppose we have a ODE
:&lt;math&gt; (D^n+a_1 D^{n-1}+ ... + a_{n-1}D+a_0)y=0&lt;/math&gt;
we can take an inspired guess at a solution (motivate this)
:&lt;math&gt;y=e^{px}&lt;/math&gt;
For this function D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''y''=p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;y so the ODE becomes
:&lt;math&gt; (p^n+a_1 p^{n-1}+ ... + a_{n-1}p+a_0)y=0&lt;/math&gt;

''y=0'' is a trivial solution of the ODE so we can discard it. We are then left with the equation
:&lt;math&gt; p^n+a_1 p^{n-1}+ ... + a_{n-1}p+a_0)=0&lt;/math&gt;
This is called the ''characteristic'' equation of the ODE.

It can have up to ''n'' roots, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,  p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;hellip;  p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, each root giving us a different solution of the ODE.

Because the ODE is linear, we can add all those solution together in any linear combination to get a general solution
:&lt;math&gt;y=A_1 e^{p_1 x} +A_2 e^{p_2 x} + ... + A_n e^{p_n x}&lt;/math&gt;

To see how this works in practice we will look at the second order case. Solving equations like this of higher order uses exactly the same principles; only the algebra is more complex.

=====Second order=====

If the ODE is second order,
:&lt;math&gt;D^2 y + bDy+cy=0&lt;/math&gt;
then the characteristic equation is a quadratic,
:&lt;math&gt;p^2+bp+c=0&lt;/math&gt;
with roots
:&lt;math&gt;p_{\pm}=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4c}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

What these roots are like depends on the sign of ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-4''c'', so we have three cases to consider.

''1) b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 4c''

In this case we have two different real roots, so we can write down the solution straight away.
:&lt;math&gt; y=A_{+}e^{p_{+}}+A_{-}e^{p_{-}}&lt;/math&gt;


''2) b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 4c''

In this case, both roots are imaginary. We could just put them directly in the formula, but if we are interested in real solutions it is more useful to write them another way.

Defining k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=4c-b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the solution is
:&lt;math&gt;y=A_{+}e^{ikx-\frac{bx}{2}}+A_{-}e^{-ikx-\frac{bx}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

For this to be real, the ''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s must be complex conjugates
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\pm}=A e^{\pm ia}&lt;/math&gt;

Make this substitution and we can write,
:&lt;math&gt;y=A e^{-bx/2}\cos (kx+a)&lt;/math&gt;

If ''b'' is positive, this is a damped oscillation.


''3) b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4c''

In this case the characteristic equation only gives us one root, ''p=-b/2''. We must use another method to find the other solution.

We'll use the method of variation of constants. The ODE we need to solve is,
:&lt;math&gt;D^2 y -2pDy+p^2y=0&lt;/math&gt;
rewriting ''b'' and ''c'' in terms of the root. From the characteristic equation we know one solution is &lt;math&gt;y=e^{px}&lt;/math&gt; so we make the substitution &lt;math&gt;y=ze^{px}&lt;/math&gt;, giving
:&lt;math&gt; (e^{px}D^2z+2pe^{px}Dz+p^2e^{px}z)-2p(e^{px}Dz+pe^{px}z)+p^2e^{px}z=0 &lt;/math&gt;
This simplifies to D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''z''=0, which is easily solved. We get
:&lt;math&gt;z=Ax+B \quad y=(Ax+B)e^{px}&lt;/math&gt;
so the second solution is the first multiplied by ''x''.

Higher order linear constant coefficient ODE's behave similarly: an exponential for every real root of the characteristic and a exponent multiplied by a trig factor for every complex conjugate pair, both being multiplied by a polynomial if the root is repeated.

E.g., if the characteristic equation factors to
:&lt;math&gt;(p-1)^4(p-3)(p^2+1)^2=0&lt;/math&gt;
the general solution of the ODE will be
:&lt;math&gt;y=(A+Bx+Cx^2+Dx^3)e^x + Ee^{3x}+ F \cos (x+a) +Gx \cos(x+b)&lt;/math&gt;

The most difficult part is finding the roots of the characteristic equation.

====Linear nonhomogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients====

First, let's consider the ODE
:&lt;math&gt;Dy-y=x&lt;/math&gt;
a nonhomogeneous first order ODE which we know how to solve.

Using the integrating factor ''e&lt;sup&gt;-x&lt;/sup&gt;'' we find
:&lt;math&gt;y=c e^{-x} +1 -x&lt;/math&gt;

This is the sum of a solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation, and a polynomial.

Nonhomogeneous ODE's of higher order behave similarly.

If we have a single solution, ''y&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the nonhomogeneous ODE, called a ''particular'' solution,
:&lt;math&gt; (D^n+a_1 D^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n)y=F(x)&lt;/math&gt;
then the general solution is ''y=y&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''y&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the general solution of the homogeneous ODE. 

Find ''y&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' for an arbitrary ''F(x)'' requires methods beyond the scope of this chapter, but there are some special cases where finding ''y&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is straightforward.

Remember that in the first order problem ''y&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a polynomial ''F(x)'' was itself a polynomial of the same order. We can extend this to higher orders.

''Example:''
:&lt;math&gt;D^2y+y=x^3-x+1&lt;/math&gt;
Consider a particular solution
:&lt;math&gt;y_p=b_0+b_1 x+b_2 x^2 + x^3&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute for ''y'' and collect coefficients
:&lt;math&gt;x^3 + b_2 x^2 +(6+b_1)x +(2b_2+b_0)=x^3-x+1&lt;/math&gt;
So ''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0'', ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=-7'', ''b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=1'', and the general solution is
:&lt;math&gt;y=a \sin x + b \cos x + 1 -7x + x^3&lt;/math&gt;

This works because all the derivatives of a polynomial are themselves polynomials.

Two other special cases are
:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=P_n e^{kx} \quad y_p(x)=Q_n e^{kx}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=A_n \sin kx +B_n \cos kx \quad 
y_p(x)=P_n \sin kx +Q_n \cos kx&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are all polynomials of degree ''n''.

Making these substitutions will give a set of simultaneous linear equations for the coefficients of the polynomials.

# Click Regional and Language Options - a new window will pop up 
# Click the Languages tab 
# Click on the Details button 
# Click the Add button - a new window will pop up 
# Select &quot;United States-International (keyboard layout menu)&quot; or &quot;United States-Dvorak (International)&quot;
# Click OK 
# Click Apply 

Now you should see a keyboard icon at your task bar at the bottom. 
Click on this icon to switch to the United States International keyboard layout. 
This keyboard layout has a new key (AltGr) and 5 ''dead keys''. The dead keys are explained [[Spanish/Typing Spanish Characters#Dead_Keys|below]]. An interactive diagram of this layout can be found in [http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/keyboards/kbdusx.htm].

The US International keyboard has two different Alt keys.
The left Alt key continues to be the regular Alt key, normally associated with Windows menus. The right Alt key becomes what is called AltGr (or graphic Alt) key.
This key lets you type very quickly special characters in Spanish and other languages by using ''AltGr'' and then typing a character from the list below.

Note: + indicate typing one key after the other. - is typing two keys at the same time.

===== Lower-Case Characters =====
 á -&gt; AltGr+a
 é -&gt; AltGr+e
 í -&gt; AltGr+i
 ó -&gt; AltGr+o
 ú -&gt; AltGr+u
 ü -&gt; AltGr+y
 ñ -&gt; AltGr+n

 ç -&gt; AltGr+,
 &amp;aring; -&gt; AltGr+w

===== Upper-Case Characters =====
 Á -&gt; AltGr+Shift-a
 É -&gt; AltGr+Shift-e
 Í -&gt; AltGr+Shift-i
 Ó -&gt; AltGr+Shift-o
 Ú -&gt; AltGr+Shift-u
 Ü -&gt; AltGr+Shift-y
 Ñ -&gt; AltGr+Shift-n

 Ç -&gt; AltGr+Shift-,
 &amp;ETH; -&gt; AltGr+Shift-d

===== Other Symbols =====
 ¿ -&gt; AltGr+?
 ¡ -&gt; AltGr+!
 « -&gt; AltGr+[      Spaniards prefer «angular» quotes
 &amp;raquo; -&gt; AltGr+]      Latin Americans prefer the &amp;ldquo;curly&amp;rdquo; ones
 ° -&gt; AltGr+:      Degree sign; ordinal sign, as in ''4° año = cuarto año''
 &amp;euro; -&gt; AltGr+5
 &amp;cent; -&gt; AltGr+Shift-c
 &amp;pound; -&gt; AltGr+$
 &amp;yen; -&gt; AltGr+-

===== Dead Keys =====

The US International keyboard has five ''dead keys''. They add the symbol they have marked at the top of the following letter.

 '+a = á; '+e = é; ...
 &quot;+a = ä; ...; &quot;+u = ü
 ~+a = ã; ~+n = ñ
 ^+a = â; ...
 `+a = à; ...
 '+Shift-a = Á; '+Shift+e = É; ...
 &quot;+Shift-u = Ü; ...
 ~+Shift-n = Ñ; ...

To enter what's written on a dead key you need to add a space. 
' followed by space generates an actual apostrophe.

==== Other Operating Systems ====
Information on some other operation systems can be found
[http://www.studyspanish.com/accents/typing.htm here].

=== Alt Number Codes ===
You can type a special character by pressing and holding down
the ''Alt'' button and then typing a number code on the number
pad of your keyboard. The most frequently used characters have both a three-digit
and a four-digit code. Less frequent characters (such as Á)
have only a four-digit code. This page contains a good overview of
[http://www.starr.net/is/type/altnum.htm special characters] for different languages

==== Lower Case Characters ====
 á -&gt; Alt-160 or Alt-0225
 ç -&gt; Alt-135 or Alt-0231 
 é -&gt; Alt-130 or Alt-0233
 í -&gt; Alt-161 or Alt-0237
 ñ -&gt; Alt-164 or Alt-0241
 ó -&gt; Alt-162 or Alt-0243
 ú -&gt; Alt-163 or Alt-0250 
 ü -&gt; Alt-129 or Alt-0252

==== Upper Case Characters ====
 Á -&gt;            Alt-0193  
 Ç -&gt; Alt-128 or Alt-0199
 É -&gt; Alt-144 or Alt-0201  
 Í -&gt;            Alt-0205
 Ñ -&gt; Alt-165 or Alt-0209
 Ó -&gt;            Alt-0211
 Ú -&gt;            Alt-0218  
 Ü -&gt; Alt-154 or Alt-0220

==== Punctuation Marks ====
 ¿ Alt-168 or Alt-0191
 ¡ Alt-173 or Alt-0161

=== Copy &amp; Paste ===
This method can be useful if you are just writing a short
text (for example an e-mail) and don't have a computer
where you can/want change language settings. Just try to
pull up a web page or a document that contains the special
characters and paste them into your text. For longer texts,
however, this can become quite tedious.

=== Search &amp; Replace ===
If you are working with a text editor you have the option to
search for text and replace it with other text. This feature
can be used to 'type' special characters. The idea is to
''mark'' a character for becoming a special character, for
example typing ''~a'' when you mean ''á''. After you have written
your text you replace marked characters (the ''~a'') with
special characters (the ''á''). Of course you have to either
type in the Alt number code or paste the character,
but the point is that you only have to do it ''once'' for
the whole text and not for every single ''á'' that you want to
type.

==== Automated Search &amp; Replace ====
If you know a programming language that allows string processing
you can automate the ''Search &amp; Replace'' process by a computer
program which automatically replaces all your marked characters with 
the appropriate special characters after you are done with typing
your text.

==Macintosh==

Compared to Windows, typing Spanish characters on a Macintosh is relatively easy. So long as you are using a standard American or UK-style QWERTY keyboard, you may just use the following keyboard commands. (Note that you should release the Option (Opt) key before striking the second letter; for example, for á, hold down Option, strike E, release Option, strike A.)

One good way to practice typing Spanish characters on a Mac is to use the Key Caps program, which should be in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder. This simple program will show you what characters you can type next if you hold down the Option and/or Shift keys.

=== Lower-Case Characters ===
 á -&gt; Opt+E, A
 é -&gt; Opt+E, E
 í -&gt; Opt+E, I
 ó -&gt; Opt+E, O
 ú -&gt; Opt+E, U
 ü -&gt; Opt+U, U
 ñ -&gt; Opt+N, N

 ç -&gt; Opt+C
 &amp;aring; -&gt; Opt+A

=== Upper-Case Characters ===
 Á -&gt; Opt+E, Shift+A
 É -&gt; Opt+E, Shift+E
 Í -&gt; Opt+E, Shift+I
 Ó -&gt; Opt+E, Shift+O
 Ú -&gt; Opt+E, Shift+U
 Ü -&gt; Opt+U, Shift+U
 Ñ -&gt; Opt+N, Shift+N

 Ç -&gt; Opt+Shift+C

=== Other Symbols ===
 ¿ -&gt; Opt+Shift+/ (forward slash; same key as ?)
 ¡ -&gt; Opt+1
 « -&gt; Opt+\ (back slash; under the Delete key)
 &amp;raquo; -&gt; Opt+Shift+\
 *Note that Spaniards prefer «angle quotes,» whereas Latin Americans prefer &amp;ldquo;curly quotes&amp;rdquo; as in English.
 ° -&gt; Opt+Shift+8      Degree sign; ordinal sign, as in ''4° año = cuarto año''
 &amp;euro; -&gt; Opt+Shift+2
 &amp;cent; -&gt; Opt+4
 &amp;pound; -&gt; Opt+3
 &amp;yen; -&gt; Opt+Y

== KDE/GNOME ==
In KDE and GNOME you can choose the international US keyboard layout.  

In KDE, go to Regional &amp; Accessibility - Keyboard Layout in the ''KDE Control Center''. Add the international US keyboard layout to your active layouts. With the flag icon in your taskbar you can now switch between different layouts.

In GNOME, find preferences in the system menu, and select ''keyboard'' from the preferences menu. Add the US English International layout to your layouts. Alt+Alt will cycle through the various layouts you have added. Alternatively, keyboard layout selection and management may be done via the GNOME ''keyboard indicator'' applet, which may be added to your panel.

With the appropriate keyboard layout selected, you can type á by typing ' and then a:

 'a á
 'e é
 'i í
 'o ó
 'u ú
 &quot;u ü
 ~n ñ

== X Windows ==
In X Windows (the default windowing system for Linux which both KDE and Gnome run on top of) you can create a custom X keyboard layout with the special Spanish letters added; more information is [http://www.samiam.org/typing.spanish.characters.html#linux here].

Wow this whole thing is pretty exciting dont you think ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Yep, when looking back it is quite amazing how much has been already done
in two weeks. If the number of contributers keeps increasing steadily
then the book might become pretty good ;) -- [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

I've updated the history because now it's about two months since the Spanish
Wikibook started. I'm really glad how far it has developed by now. But as
it's always the case with a Wiki Website: there is always a lot that can
be improved. So keep up the good work! [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

== Periodic Updating of History ==

It looks like the history was being updated weekly when this Wikibook started.  This only continued for five weeks.  Then it was not updated again for two years and eight months!  So, if we're going to update this regularly again, how often does everyone think it should be updated?  --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 14:55, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

Someone who knows, please rearrange this from alphabetical order into a logical order for learning, such as from simplest to most complex. 

I think having an alphabetic order for this appendix is OK since it would be used more likely for quick look-ups (learning the tenses from simple to complex should be done with the lessons structure).


----
I'm going to add all the forms of the typical 1st, 2nd and 3rd conjugation verbs in Spanish: am'''ar''', tem'''er''' and part'''ir'''. There should also be a page for the irregular verbs. [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 10:20, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</text>

== Why Do Substances React? ==
Chemical (and thus, biochemical) reactions only occur to a significant extent if they are energetically favorable.  If the products are more stable than the reactants, then in general the reaction will, over time, tend to go forward.  Ashes are more stable than wood, so once the energy of activation is supplied (e.g., by a match), the wood will burn.  There are plenty of exceptions to the rule, of course, but as a rule of thumb it's pretty safe to say that &lt;u&gt;if the products of a reaction represent a more stable state, then that reaction will go in the forward direction.&lt;/u&gt;

There are two factors that determine whether or not reactions changing reactants into products are considered to be ''favorable'': these two factors are simply called '''enthalpy''' and '''entropy'''.

=== Enthalpy ===
Simply put, '''enthalpy''' is the heat content of a substance (''H'').  Most people have an intuitive understanding of what heat is... we learn as children not to touch the burners on the stove when they are glowing orange.  Enthalpy is '''not''' the same as that kind of heat.  Enthalpy is the sum of all the internal energy of a substance's matter plus its pressure times its volume.  Enthalpy is therefore defined by the following equation:


&lt;!-- this equation taken from wikipedia article on Enthalpy --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H = U + PV \,&lt;/math&gt;
where (all units given in SI)
*''H'' is the enthalpy
*''U'' is the internal energy, (joules)
*''P'' is the pressure of the system, (Pascals)
* and ''V'' is the volume, (cubic meters)


If the enthalpy of the reactants while being converted to products ends up decreasing (&amp;Delta;''H'' &lt; 0), that means that the products have less enthalpy than the reactants and energy is released to the environment. This reaction type is termed ''exothermic''.  In the course of most biochemical processes there is little change in pressure or volume, so the change in enthalpy accompanying a reaction generally reflects the change in the internal energy of the system. Thus, exothermic reactions in biochemistry are  processes in which the products are lower in energy than the starting materials.  

As an example, consider the reaction of glucose with oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water.  Strong bonds form in the products, reducing the internal energy of the system relative to the reactants. This is a highly exothermic reaction, releasing 2805 kJ of energy per mole of glucose that burns (&amp;Delta;''H'' = -2805 kJ/mol).  That energy is given off as heat. 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;
|-
! &amp;Delta;''H''
! reactants/products
! environment
! favorable
|-
| &amp;lt; 0 || releases heat || heats up || yes
|-
| &amp;gt; 0 || gains heat || cools down || no
|}

=== Entropy ===
'''Entropy''' (symbol ''S'') is the measure of randomness in something.  It represents the most likely of statistical possibilities of a system, so the concept has extremely broad applications.  In chemistry of all types, entropy is generally considered important in determining whether or not a reaction goes forward based on the principle that a less-ordered system is more statistically probable than a more-ordered system.

What does that mean, really?  Well, if the volcano Mt. Vesuvius erupted next to a Roman-Empire era Mediterranean city, would the volcano be more likely to destroy the city, or build a couple of skyscrapers there?  It's pretty obvious what would happen (or, rather, what ''did'' happen) because it makes sense to us that natural occurrences favor randomness (destruction) over order (construction, or in this case, skyscrapers).  Entropy is just a mathematical way of expressing these essential differences.

When it comes to chemistry, there are three major concepts based on the concept of entropy:
# ''Intramolecular'' states (''Degrees of freedom'')
#* The more degrees of freedom (how much the molecules can move in space) a molecule has, the greater the degree of randomness, and thus, the greater the entropy.  
#* There are three ways molecules can move in space, and each has a name: rotation = movement around an axis, vibration = intramolecular movement of two bonded atoms in relation to each other, and translation = a molecule moving from place to place. 
# ''Intermolecular'' structures
#* When molecules can interact with each other by forming non-covalent bonds a structure is often created. 
#* This tends to reduce randomness (and thus entropy) since any such association between molecules stabilizes the motion of both and decreases the possibilities for a random distribution.
# Number of possibilities
#* The more molecules present, the more ways of distributing the molecules in space - which because of statistical probabilities means more potential for randomness. 
#* Also, if there is more space available to distribute the molecules within, the randomness increases for precisely the same reason 
#* ''solid matter (least entropy)'' &lt;&lt; ''liquids'' &lt;&lt; ''gases (most entropy)''
 

Changes in entropy are denoted as &amp;Delta;S. For the reasons stated above (in the volcano situation), the increase of entropy (&amp;Delta;S &gt; 0) is considered to be favorable as far as the Universe in general is concerned.  A decrease in entropy is generally not considered favorable unless an energetic component in the reaction system can make up for the decrease in entropy (see free energy below).

===Gibbs Free Energy===
Changes of both '''enthalpy''' (&amp;Delta;H) and '''entropy''' (&amp;Delta;S) combined decide how favorable a reaction is.  For instance, burning a piece of wood releases energy (''exothermic'', favorable) and results in a substance with less structure (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O gas, both of which are less 'ordered' than solid wood).  Thus, one could predict that once a piece of wood was set on fire, it would continue to burn until it was gone.  The fact that it does so is ascribed to the change in its '''Gibbs Free Energy'''.

The overall favorability of a reaction was first described by the prominent chemist [[w:Willard Gibbs|Josiah Willard Gibbs]], who defined the ''free energy'' of a reaction as
::&amp;Delta;G = &amp;Delta;H - T &amp;Delta;S

where T is the temperature on the Kelvin temperature scale.  The formula above assumes that pressure and temperature are constant during the reaction, which is almost always the case for biochemical reactions, and so this book makes the same assumption throughout. 

The unit of &amp;Delta;G (for ''Gibbs'') is the &quot;joule&quot; in SI systems, but the unit of &quot;calorie&quot; is also often used because of its convenient relation to the properties of water.  This book will use both terms as convenient, but the preference should really be for the SI notation.

===What Does &amp;Delta;G Really Mean?===
If &amp;Delta;G &lt; 0 then the reactants should convert into products (signifying a forward reaction)... eventually.  (Gibbs free energy says nothing about a reaction's ''rate'', only its ''probability''.)  Likewise, for a given reaction if &amp;Delta;G &gt; 0 then it is known that the reverse reaction is favored to take place. A state where &amp;Delta;G = 0 is called '''equilibrium''', and this is the state where the reaction in both the forward and reverse directions take place at the same rate, thus not changing the '''net''' effect on the system.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
How is equilibrium best explained?  Alright, as an example set yourself on the living room carpet with your most gullible younger relative (a little nephew, niece or cousin will work fine).  Take out a set of Monopoly, take one ten dollar bill for yourself and give your little relative the rest.  Now both of you give the other 5% of all that you have.  Do this again, and again, and again-again-again until eventually... you both have the same amount of money.  This is '''precisely''' what the equilibrium of a reaction means, though equilibrium only very rarely results in an even, 50-50% split of products and reactants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&amp;Delta;G naturally varies with the concentration of reactants and products. When &amp;Delta;G reaches 0, the reaction rate in the forward direction and the reaction rate in the reverse direction are the same, and the concentration of reactants and products no longer appears to change; this state is called the ''point of chemical equilibrium''.  You and your gullible little relative have stopped gaining and losing Monopoly money, respectively; you both keep exchanging the same amount each turn.  Note again that equilibrium is ''dynamic''.  Chemical reaction does not cease at equilibrium, but products are converted to reactants and reactants are converted to products at exactly the same rate.

A small &amp;Delta;G (that is, a value of &amp;Delta;G close to 0) indicates that a reaction is somewhat reversible; the reaction can actually run backwards, converting products back to reactants. A very large &amp;Delta;G (that is, &amp;Delta;G &gt;&gt; 0 or &amp;Delta;G &lt;&lt; 0) is precisely the opposite, because it indicates that a given reaction is irreversible, i.e., once the reactants become products there are very few molecules that go back to reactants.

== Metabolic pathways ==
The food we consume is processed to become a part of our cells; DNA, proteins, etc. If the biochemical reactions involved in this process were reversible, we would convert our own DNA back to food molecules if we stop eating even for a short period of time. To prevent this from happening, our ''metabolism'' is organized in ''metabolic pathways''. These pathways are a series of biochemical reactions which are, as a whole, irreversible. The reactions of a pathway occur in a row, with the products of the first reaction being the reactants of the second, and so on:
:A &amp;#8652; B &amp;#8652; C &amp;#8652; D &amp;#8652; E
At least one of these reactions has to be irreversible, e.g.:
:A &amp;#8640; B &amp;#8652; C &amp;#8652; D &amp;#8640; E
The control of the irreversible steps (e.g., A &amp;rarr; B) enables the cell to control the whole pathway and, thus, the amount of reactants used, as well as the amount of products generated.

Some metabolic pathways do have a &quot;way back&quot;, but it is not the same pathway backwards. Instead, while using the reversible steps of the existing pathway, at least one of the irreversible reactions is bypassed by another (irreversible) one on the way back from E to A:
:E &amp;#8640; '''X''' &amp;#8652; C &amp;#8652; B &amp;#8640; A
This reaction is itself controlled, letting the cell choose the direction in which the pathway is running.


== Free energy and equilibrium ==
For &amp;Delta;G, the free energy of a reaction, standard conditions were defined:
*concentration of reactants and products at 1M
*temperature at 25&amp;deg;C
*acidity at pH 7.0
Under these standard conditions, '''&amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt;''' is defined as the '''standard free energy change'''.

For a reaction
:A + B &amp;#8652; C + D
the ratio of products to reactants is given by &lt;b&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'&lt;/b&gt; (=k&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; at pH 7.0):
:&lt;math&gt;k_{eq}^\prime = {products \over reactants} = {[C][D] \over [A][B]}&lt;/math&gt;
The relationship of &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;' is
:&amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; = - R T ln k&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;' = - R T 2.030 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; k&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'
with
:R = 8.315 [J mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;] ([[w:molar gas constant|molar gas constant]])
:T = temperature [K]

In theory, we can now decide if a reaction is favorable (&amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 0). However, the reaction might need a ''catalyst'' to occur within a reasonable amount of time. In biochemistry, such a catalyst is often called an ''enzyme''.

The purpose of DNA melting or DNA denaturation is emphasizing and demonstrating the life cycles of all organisms and the origin of replication. The origin of replication specific structure varies from species to species. Furthermore, the particular sequence of the origin of replication is in a genome which is the human genes. Nevertheless, DNA replication is also part of origin of replication which examen in the living organism such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 

Thermodynamically, there are two important contributions on the DNA denaturation. One of them is the breaking all of the hydrogen bonds between the bases in the double helix; the other one is to overcome the stacking stability/energy of bases on top of each other. There are several methods to denature DNA; heat is known as the most common one use in laboratory. We just have to heat the sample to reach above its melting point, the unstack ability of DNA can be then monitored. Melting point and denaturation of DNA depend on several factors: the length of DNA, base-composition of DNA, the condition of the DNA and also the composition of buffer. For instance, the longer DNA will contain more H-bonds and more intermolecular forces compared to the shorter one; therefore, denaturations of longer DNA requires more time and more heat. Base-composition of DNA can also play as a key factor because A:T requires two hydrogen bonds and G:C interaction requires three hydrogen bonds. The region of DNA which contains more A:T will melt/denature more rapidly compared to G:C. We can also see how the condition of DNA is important because condition of DNA is related to whether the DNA is relax, supercoiled, linear or heavily nicked. It is important because it allow us to examine how much intermolecular forces existing in the double helix. Finally, condition of buffer is also playing an essential role to study DNA denaturation because it allow us to control the amount of ions present in the solution during the entire process.

Biologically, DNA denaturation can happen inside the cell during DNA replication or translation. In both cases, DNA denaturation is an essential step and a beginning to start each of the process. Most of the time, denaturation happened because of binding of protein or enzymes to a specific region of DNA, the binding will likely lead to open or denature of the helix. However, the actual meaning of the DNA melting is the denaturation of DNA which changes the structure of DNA from double stranded into single stranded. The processes of DNA denaturation is unwinding the double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid and breaks it into two single stranded by breaking the hydrogen bonding between the bases. DNA denaturation is also known of DNA annealing because it is reservable . The main steps DNA annealing are double helical will go through the denaturation to become partially denatured DNA then it will separated the strands into two single strand of DNA in random coils.</text>

[[image:biological_cell.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of typical animal cell, showing subcellular components.]] Organelles: (1) nucleolus (2) nucleus (3) ribosome (4) vesicle (5) rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (6) Golgi apparatus (7) Cytoskeleton (8) smooth ER (9) mitochondrion (10) vacuole (11) cytoplasm (12) lysosome (13) centrioles

==Nucleus==
The nucleus contains genetic material or DNA in the form of chromatin, or, during mitosis or late interphase, chromosomes.  All transcription and replication of genetic material takes place within the nucleus, as does RNA processing.  The nucleolus also resides within the nucleus, and is responsible for RNA transcription and folding.  Translation of  RNA transcripts takes place outside of the nucleus.

==Mitochondria==
A mitochondrian is the organelle responsible for a cell's metabolism. It synthetizes ATP through a protein called ATP synthase. Mitochondria have a double membrane. An outer membrane and a folded inner membrane. The internal membrane, called the '''cristae''' is invaginated (folded or creased), to maximize surface area enabling it to hold more ATP synthases.

==Ribosomes==

Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis.  They are comprised of interacting protein and nucleic acid chains.  Broadly, ribosomes are comprised of a large and a small subunit.  The small subunit functions to attach to the mRNA strand and hold it in place during translation, while the large subunit holds and manufactures the growing polypeptide chain.  The large subunit is further subdivided into the A (aminoacyl), P (peptidyl), and E (exit) binding sites.

'''Aminoacyl Binding Site'''
The aminoacyl binding site binds a charged tRNA whose anticodon matches the codon in the A site.

'''Peptidyl Binding Site'''
The peptidyl binding site contains the molecular machinery that transfers the bound polypeptide from the tRNA to the polypeptide chain, and holds the growing chain in place.

'''Exit Site'''
The exit site is the terminal binding site for tRNA, where discharged tRNA's are released from the translation complex.

==Endoplasmic Reticulum==

The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) acts as a transport from the nucleus and ribosomes to the Golgi apparatus. 
There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum:

===Smooth ER===
Smooth ER act as transport for various things, mainly the RNA from the nucleus to the ribosomes (RNA is a small piece of the DNA code specifically designed to tell the ribosomes what to make). Smooth ER appears smooth in texture, hence the name.  Smooth ER plays an important role in lipid emulsification and digestion in the cell.

===Rough ER===
Rough ER are &quot;rough&quot; because of the ribosomes embedded in them. The rough ER takes the protein to the Golgi apparatus to be packaged into vacuoles

==Golgi Complex==
The Golgi Complex basically functions as a &quot;packaging center&quot; for the cell, attaching &quot;address labels&quot; (functional groups) to various cell products to direct them to their respective locations, and &quot;packaging&quot; the products into vacuoles to ensure delivery.  Anatomically, the Golgi Complex consists of layers of lipid membrane stacked one one top of another, with a cis face and a trans face.  As the molecular product being packaged moves through the complex, various enzymes act upon it to induce vacuole formation and functional group attachment.

==Vacuole==
[[Image:Paramecium_contractile_vacuoles.jpg|thumb|right|Paramecium, with contractile vacuoles indicated using arrows.]]
Vacuoles are cellular storage places.  Like the cell membrane, they are comprised of a lipid bilayer that functions as a selectively permeable barrier to regulate movement of materials into and out of the compartment.  They can serve a variety of purposes, storing food, water, or waste products, or immune functions such as containing dangerous materials or maintaining turgor pressure (in plants).  Vacuoles serve very different purposes in plant cells than they do in animal cells.

'''Plant Cells'''  In plants, vacuoles comprise a significant portion of the cell's total volume and often contribute significantly to the function of a differentiated cell.  For example, vacuoles in stomata cells contain large numbers of potassium ions, which can be pumped in or out to open or close the stomata.

'''Animal Cells'''  In animal cells, vacuoles serve more subordinate roles, such as assisting in endo- and exocytosis or basic storage of food and waste.

'''Central Vacuole'''
The central vacuole is found only in plant cells. It is filled with water and is pressurised, like a balloon.  This forces all the other organelles within the cell out toward the cell wall. This pressure is called ''turgor pressure'' and is what gives plants their &quot;crisp&quot; and firm structure.

==Peroxisomes== 
Peroxisomes perform a variety of metabolic processes and as a by-product, produce hydrogen peroxide.  Peroxisomes use peroxase enzyme to break down this hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.

==Lysosomes==
Lysosomes are vacuoles containing digestive and destructive membranes. In white blood cells, these are used to kill the bacteria or virus, while in tadpole-tail cells they kill the cell by separating the tail from the main body.

They also do much of the cellular digestion involved in [[w:Apoptosis|apoptosis]], the process of programmed cell death.

Chloroplasts are the organelles used for photosynthesis (a process that incorporates light energy into storage as chemical energy) whereas mitochondria used in respiration (a process that releases stored chemical energy). It assumed that you already know the information about these organelles explained in the [[Cell Biology/Organelles|organelles]] section. If you have not read the entries on chloroplasts and mitochondria from there yet, please go back and read them now.

What all living cells have in common is that they are small 'sacks' composed mostly of water.  The 'sacks' are made from a [[Cell Biology/Membranes|phospholipid bilayer]] membrane. This membrane is semi-permeable (allowing some things to pass in or out of the cell while blocking others). There exist other methods of transport across this membrane that we will get into later.

So what is in a cell? Cells are 90% fluid (called cytoplasm) which consists of free amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and numerous other molecules.  The cell environment (i.e., the contents of the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as well as the way the DNA is packed) affect gene expression/regulation, and thus are VERY important aspects of inheritance.  Below are approximations of other components (each component will be discussed in more detail later):

=== Elements ===
* 59% Hydrogen (H)
* 24% Oxygen (O)
* 11% Carbon (C)
* 4%  Nitrogen (N)
* 2%  Others - Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S), etc.

=== Molecules ===
* 50% protein
* 15% nucleic acid
* 15% carbohydrates
* 10% lipids
* 10% Other

=== Components of cytoplasm ===

The following is optional reading, as all cell components will be discussed in subsequent chapters.

* '''Cytosol''' - contains mainly water and numerous molecules floating in it- all except the organelles.
* '''Organelles''' (which also have membranes) in 'higher' eukaryote organisms:
** '''Nucleus''' (in eukaryotes) - where genetic material (DNA) is located, RNA is transcribed. 
** '''Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)''' - Important for protein synthesis. It is a transport network for molecules destined for specific modifications and locations. There are two types:
*** '''Rough ER''' - Has ribosomes, and tends to be more in 'sheets'.
*** '''Smooth ER''' - Does not have ribosomes and tends to be more of a tubular network.
** '''Ribosomes''' - half are on the Endoplasmic Reticulum, the other half are 'free' in the cytosol, this is where the RNA goes for translation into proteins.
**'''Golgi Apparatus''' - important for glycosylation, secretion. The Golgi Apparatus is the &quot;UPS&quot; of the cell. Here, proteins and other molecules are prepared for shipping outside of the cell.
** '''Lysosomes''' - Digestive sacks found only in animal cells; the main point of digestion.
** '''Peroxisomes''' - Use oxygen to carry out catabolic reactions, in both plant and animals. In this organelle, an enzyme called catalase is used to break down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas. 
** '''Microtubules''' - made from tubulin, and make up centrioles,cilia,etc.
** '''Cytoskeleton''' - Microtubules, actin and intermediate filaments.
** '''Mitochondria''' - convert foods into usable energy. (ATP production) A mitochondrion does this through aerobic respiration. They have 2 membranes, the inner membranes shapes differ between different types of cells, but they form projections called cristae. The mitochondrion is about the size of a bacteria, and it carries its own genetic material and ribosomes.
** '''Vacuoles''' - More commonly associated with plants.  Plants commonly have large vacuoles.
*'''Organelles found in plant cells and not in animal cells:'''
** '''Plastids''' - membrane bound organelles used in storage and food production. These are similar to entire prokaryotic cells - for example, like mitochondria they contain their own DNA and self-replicate. They include:
*** '''Chloroplasts''' - convert light/food into usable energy. (ATP production)
*** '''Leucoplasts''' - store starch, proteins and lipids.
*** '''Chromoplasts''' - contain pigments. (E.g. providing colors to flowers)
** '''Cell Wall''' - found in prokaryotic and plant cells; provides structural support and protection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Size of Cells == 
[[Image:Cellsize.jpg|frame|Cells are so small that even a cluster of these cells from a mouse only measures 50 microns]]
Although it is generally the case that biological cells are too small to be seen at all without a microscope, there are exceptions as well as considerable range in the sizes of various cell types. [[Cell Biology/Cell types/Eukaryotes|Eukaryotic]] cells are typically 10 times the size of [[Cell Biology/Cell types/Prokaryotes|prokaryotic]] cells (these cell types are discussed in the next Chapter). Plant cells are on average some of the largest cells, probably because in many plant cells the inside is mostly a water filled vacuole.
{{clear}}
So, you ask, what are the relative sizes of biological molecules and cells? The following are all approximations:

 0.1 nm (nanometer) diameter of a hydrogen atom
 0.8 nm Amino Acid
   2 nm Diameter of a DNA Alpha helix
   4 nm Globular Protein
   6 nm microfilaments
  7 nm thickness cell membranes 
  20 nm Ribosome
  25 nm Microtubule
  30 nm Small virus (Picornaviruses)
  30 nm Rhinoviruses
  50 nm Nuclear pore
 100 nm HIV
 120 nm Large virus (Orthomyxoviruses, includes influenza virus)
 150-250 nm Very large virus (Rhabdoviruses, Paramyxoviruses)
 150-250 nm small bacteria such as Mycoplasma
 200 nm Centriole
 200 nm (200 to 500 nm) Lysosomes
 200 nm (200 to 500 nm) Peroxisomes
 800 nm giant virus Mimivirus
   1 µm (micrometer)
 (1 - 10 µm) the general sizes for Prokaryotes
   1 µm Diameter of human nerve cell process
   2 µm E.coli - a bacterium
   3 µm Mitochondrion
   5 µm length of chloroplast
   6 µm (3 - 10 micrometers) the Nucleus
   9 µm Human red blood cell
  10 µm
        (10 - 30 µm) Most Eukaryotic animal cells
        (10 - 100 µm) Most Eukaryotic plant cells
  90 µm small Amoeba
 120 µm Human Egg
 up to 160 µm Megakaryocyte
 up to 500 µm  giant bacterium Thiomargarita
 up to 800 µm  large Amoeba
   1 mm (1 millimeter, 1/10th cm)
   1 mm Diameter of the squid giant nerve cell
 up to 40mm Diameter of giant amoeba Gromia Sphaerica
   120 mm Diameter of an ostrich egg (a dinosaur egg was much larger)
   3 meters Length of a nerve cell of giraffe's neck

What limits cell sizes?
* Prokaryotes — Limited by efficient metabolism
* Animal cells (eukaryotic) — Limited by surface area to volume ratio
* Plant cells (eukaryotic) — Have large sizes due to large central vacuole, which is responsible for their growth

      <text xml:space="preserve">The various elements that make up the cell are:

* 59% Hydrogen (H)
* 24% Oxygen (O)
* 11% Carbon (C)
* 4% Nitrogen (N)
* 2% Others - Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S), etc.

The difference between these elements is their respective atomic weights, electrons,
and in general their chemical properties. A given element can only have so many
other atoms attached. For instance carbon (C) has 4 electrons in its
outer shell and thus can only bind to 4 atoms; Hydrogen only has 1 electron
and thus can only bind to one other atom. An example would be Methane which
is CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Oxygen only has 2 free electrons, and will sometimes form a
double bond with a single atom, which is an 'ester' in organic chemistry (and is typically scented).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The question, &quot;What is life?&quot; has been one of many long discussions and the answer may depend upon your initial definitions.

Life is cells.
Cell theory consists of three basic points.
#All living things are made of cells.
#The cell is the smallest living thing that can perform all the functions of life.
#All cells must come from preexisting cells. 

Some definitions of life are:
# The quality that distinguishes a vital and functional being from a non-living or dead body or purely chemical matter.
# The state of a material complex or individual characterized by the capacity to perform certain functional activities including metabolism, growth, and reproduction.
# The sequence of physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual.

==Seven Criteria==
[[Image:Mitosis.jpg|thumb|left|A cell undergoing mitosis.  Reproduction is one of the seven criteria for life.]]
In biology, whether life is present is determined based on the following seven criteria:

#It should maintain some balanced conditions in its inner structure. This is called '''Homeostasis'''
#Its structure is highly organized.
#It should be able to break down or build up nutrients to release or store energy based on need. This is called '''Metabolism'''
#It should ''grow'', which means its structure changes as time goes by in an advantageous manner.
#It should show adaptation to the environment.
#It should be able to respond to environmental stimuli on demand (as opposed to adaptation, which occurs over time).
#It should be able to reproduce itself.

Another way of remembering the seven life processes for children is:-

 Movement
 Respiration
 Sensitivity
 
 Growth
 Reproduction
 Excretion
 Nutrition

Note the beginning letter of all the seven life processes, it spells out MRS GREN.

==Virus Controversy==
[[Image:Phage.jpg|thumb|right|Are these bacteriophages technically alive?]]
This definition of life has got some problems to it though: As an example, let's take viruses. Just by your intuition, what would you say: Are viruses alive or dead? Most people's intuitive answer is: Viruses are alive. When we suffer from any viral infection, we have the feeling that these viruses that cause or infection are alive. According to the seven principles as shown above, viruses are dead, as dead as a piece of plastic: They can't reproduce themselves. To understand that, we want to make a quick excursion to the replication mechanism of viruses:
Viruses are really strange in their reproduction technique. Humans and other animals reproduce by the means of sexual intercourse, bacteria do something called binary fission: They divide. One cell divides itself into two, the two daughter cells divide again an so on. The point here is that both bacteria and animals or humans reproduce actively without any help from outside. Keep this point in mind as we move on to the viruses.
Viruses need other cells to reproduce. They &quot;drill&quot; their way into another cell, called the host cell. Here, they release the genetic material they carry and, by a complex mechanism that shouldn't be explained further at this point, force their host cell to produce exact copies of the virus. After some time, the host cell is full of viruses and bursts, releasing the new viruses into the environment. Thus viruses need help to reproduce. They can't reproduce at all without a host cell and therefore do not fulfill the  requirement &quot;It should be able to reproduce itself&quot;.
Looking at the other parts of the definition we find that viruses maintain some degree of homeostasis (1), being able to keep its protenatious and nucleic machinery separated from the outside world.  Viruses also show adaptation(5), with their ability to mutate in order to affect new organisms. In addition to the reproduction problem, they also fail to meet the other requirements, showing no cellular organization (2) (or indeed cells at all), metabolism (3), or growth (4).

This example is just to illustrate the problems that arise using this definition. Life is not something one can define as any other technical term in science. Life arose from dead matter around 4 billion years ago. When life can arise from dead matter, there can't be a precise border line between these two.

==The cell is alive, what about parts of it?==

Organelles are parts of eukaryotic cells (ones having a nucleus). They help the cell carry out its task. But, are they alive? Do they meet 7 criteria?

When a cell divides into two, organelles also 'reproduce'. They also age from young to old and then die. Some of them carry out the task of taking food, converting it to nutrients and energy. They can also react to stimuli, and surely they can evolve. Of course one can argue that all the above are coordinated by the nucleus. But it seems there are some signs of life there.

Yes, there are! Scientists have proven that some bacteria, in its evolutionary way, had found a home in other cells. They felt comfortable when living there, and gradually, they have become a part of that cell. Chloroplasts, for example, used to be bacteria. At some point in their evolutionary history these cyanobacteria formed a mutual symbiosis with the proto-eukaryote ancestors of algae. Since that time, chloroplasts have been helping plant cells photosynthesize.

Another example is mitochondria, organelles that produce energy for eukaryotes. Very likely a parasitic organism originally, the ancestor of the mitochondria we see today colonized the larger proto-eukarotes. It is unknown if the mitochondrial ancestor originally had a metabolic role in its life cycle or if it adapted to the changing conditions after it was engulfed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What makes [[en:Cell biology|Cell Biology]] particularly interesting is that there is so much that is not fully understood.  A cell is a complex system with thousands of molecular components working together in a coordinated way to produce the phenomenon we call &quot;[[w:en:Life|life]]&quot;. During the 20th century these molecular components were identified (for example, see [[w:en:Human Genome Project|Human Genome Project]]), but research continues on the details of cellular processes like the control of [[w:en:Cell division|cell division]] and [[w:en:Cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]]. Disruption of the normal control of cell division can cause abnormal cell behavior such as rapid [[w:en:Brain tumor|tumor cell]] growth.

Cells have complex interactions with the surrounding environment.   Whether it is the external world of a single celled organism or the other cells of a multicellular organism, a complex web of interactions is present. Study of the mechanisms by which cells respond appropriately to their environments is a major part of cell biology research and often such studies involve what is called [[w:en:Signal transduction|signal transduction]]. For example, a hormone such as [[w:en:Insulin|insulin]] interacting with the surface of a cell can result in the altered behavior of hundreds of molecular components inside the cells. This sort of complex and finely tuned cell response to an external signal is required for normal metabolism and to prevent metabolic disorders like [[w:en:Type II diabete|Type II diabetes]].  

Most of the cells of a multi-cellular organism have the same [[w:en:Genetic material|genetic material]] in every cell; yet, there may be hundreds of different [[w:en:List of distinct cell in the adult human body|types of cells]] that make up the organism's body each with its own distinctive shape, size, and function.  In any case, all of these cells were developed from one special cell, a [[w:en:Zygote|zygote]]. The study of how the many cell types develop during embryonic development ([[w:en:Developmental biology|Developmental Biology]]) is a branch of Biology that is heavily dependent on the use of microscopy. Much of the control of cell differentiation is at the level of the control of gene [[w:en:Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], the control of which [[w:en:MRNA|mRNAs]] are made. Muscle cells make muscle proteins and nerve cells make brain proteins. Geneticists, molecular biologists and cell biologists are working to discover the details of how cells specialize to accomplish hundreds of functions from [[w:en:Muscle|muscle]] contraction to [[w:en:Memory|memory]] storage.

==Summary==
* Complexity in:
** inter-relations between cells 
** signal transduction pathways inside cells  
** control of cell death and cell reproduction
** control of cell differentiation 
** control of cell metabolism.

      <text xml:space="preserve"> [[image:prokaryotes.png|thumb|300px|'''The structures of two prokaryotic cells.'''  The bacterium (shown at the top) is a ''heterotroph'', an organism that eats other organisms.  Cyanophytes are ''autotrophs'', organisms that make their food without eating other organisms.]]

Most of these  prokaryotic cells are small, ranging from 1 to 10 [[w:micron|microns]] with a diameter no greater than 1 micron.
The major differences between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells are that prokaryotes do not have a nucleus as a distinct organelle and rarely have any membrane bound organelles [mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, a cytoskeleton of microtubules and microfilaments] (the only exception may be a bacterium discovered to have vacuoles). Both types contain DNA as genetic material, have a surrounding cell membrane, have ribosomes[70 s], accomplish similar functions, and are very diverse. For instance, there are over 200 types of cells in the human body, that vary greatly in size, shape, and function.

Prokaryotes are cells without a distinct nucleus.They have genetic material but that material is not enclosed within a membrane. Prokaryotes include bacteria and cyanophytes. The genetic material is a single circular DNA strand and is located within the cytoplasm. Recombination happens through transfers of plasmids (short circles of DNA that pass from one bacterium to another). Prokaryoytes do not engulf solids, nor do they have centrioles or asters.  Prokaryotes have a cell wall made up of peptidoglycin.

In majority of prokaryotes, the genome consists of a circular chromosome whose structure includes fewer proteins that found in the linear chromosomes of eukaryotes. Their chromosome is located in the nucleoid, a region of cytoplasm that appears lighter than surrounding cytoplasm in electron micrographs. Also, a single chromosome have much smaller rings of separately replication DNA called plasmids. 

== Cell Surface ==
Prokaryotic cell walls maintain cell shape, provide physical protection, and prevents the cell from bursting in a hypotonic environment. In hypertonic environment, most prokaryotes lose water and shrink away from their wall (plasmolyze). The cell walls of prokaryotes differ in molecular composition and construction from those of eukaryotes. The bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, a network of modified-sugar polymers cross linked by short polypeptides. This molecular fabric encloses the entire bacterium and anchors other molecules that extend from its surface. Archaeal cell walls contain a variety of polysaccharides and proteins but lack peptidoglycan. 

'''Gram-positive bacteria''' have simpler walls with a relatively large amount of peptidoglycan. It has a thick cell wall that traps the crystal violet in the cytoplasm. The alcohol rinse does not remove the crystal violet which masks the added red safanin dye. 

'''Gram-negative bacteria''' have less peptidoglycan and are structurally more complex, with an outer membrane that contains lipopolysaccharides. It has a thinner layer of peptidoglycan, and it is located in a layer between the plasma membrane and an outer membrane. The crystal violet is easily rinsed from the cytoplasm, and the cell appears pink or red. 

The cell wall of many prokaryotes is covered by a capsule, a sticky layer of polysaccharide or protein. The capsule enables prokaryotes to adhere to their substrate or to other individuals in a colony. Some capsules protect against dehydration, and some shield pathogenic prokaryotes from attack by their host's immune system. Some prokaryotes stick to their substrate or to one another by means of hair like protein appendages called fimbriae. They are also known as attachment pili. Fimbriae are usually shorter extension of the plasma membrane. 

In uniform environment, flagellated prokaryotes move randomly, but in heterogeneous environment, many prokaryotes exhibit taxis, movement toward or away from a stimulus. For example, prokaryotes that exhibit chemotaxis change their movement pattern in response to chemicals. They move toward nutrients or oxygen (positive chemotaxis) or away from a toxic substance (negative chemotaxis). 

== Reproduction and Adaptation ==
Prokaryotes reproduce quickly in a favorable environment. By binary fission, a single prokaryotic cell divid into 2 cells, which then divide into 4, 8, 16, and on. Under optimal conditions, many prokaryotes can divide every 1-3 hours. However the cells eventually exhaust their nutrient supply, poison themselves with metabolic wastes, face competition from other microorganisms, or are consumed by other organisms. The prokaryotes are small, they reproduces by binary fission, and they have short generation times. The ability of some prokaryotes to withstand harsh conditions also contributes to their success. Certain bacteria develop resistant cell called endospores when an essential nutrient is laking. The original cell produces a copy of its chromosome and surrounds it with a tough wall, forming the endospore. Water is removed from the endospore, and its metabolism halt. The rest of the original cell then disintegrates, leaving the endospore behind. Most endospore are so durable that they can survive in boiling water. In less hostile environments, endospore can remain dormant but viable for centuries, able to rehydrate and resume metabolism when their environment improves. 

Due to their short generation times, prokaryotic populations can evolve substantially in short periods of time. The ability of prokaryotes to adapt rapidly to new conditions highlights the fact that although the structure of their cells is simpler than that of eukaryotic cells, prokaryotes are not &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot; in an evolutionary sense. They are highly evolved, and their population have responded successfully to many different types of environmental challenges. 

'''Rapid reproduction and mutation'''
In sexually reproducing species, the generation of a novel allele by a new mutation is rare at any particular gene. Instead, most of the genetic variation in sexual populations results from the way existing alleles are arranged in new combinations during meiosis and fertilization. Prokaryotes do not reproduce sexually, so at first glance their extensive genetic variation may seem puzzling. 

After repeated rounds of division, most of the offspring cells are genetically identical to the original parent cell; however owing to insertions, deletions, and base-pair substitutions in their DNA, some of the offspring cells may differ genetically. The new mutations, though individually rare, can greatly increase genetic diversity in specie that has short generation times and large population sizes. This diversity, in turn, can lead to rapid evolution: individuals that are genetically better equipped for their local environment tend to survive and reproduce more prolifically than less fit individuals.

== Transformation and Transduction ==
In transformation, the genotype and possible phenotype of a prokaryotic cell are altered by the uptake of foreign DNA from its surroundings. For example, bacteria from a harmless strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae can be transformed to pneumonia causing cells if they are placed into a medium containing dead, broken-open cells of the pathogenic strain. This transformation occurs when a live nonpathogenic cell takes up a piece of DNA carry the allele for pathogenicity. The foreign allele is then incorporated into the cell's chromosome, replacing the existing nonpathogenic allele- an exchange of homologous DNA segments. The cell is now a recombinant: Its chromosome contains DNA derived from two different cells.

In transduction, bacteriophage carry bacterial genes from one hose cell to another; transduction is a type of horizontal gene transfer. For most phages, transduction results from accidents that occur during the phage reproductive cycle. A virus that carries bacterial DNA may not be able to reproduce because it lacks its own genetic material. However, the virus may be able to attach to another bacterium (a recipient) and inject the piece of bacterial DNA acquired from the first cell (the donor). Some of this DNA may subsequently replace the homologous region of the recipient cell's chromosome by DNA recombination. In such case, the recipient cell's chromosome becomes a combination of NA derived from two cells; genetic recombination has occurred. 

''' Conjugation and Plasmids'''
In a process called conjugation, genetic material is transferred between two bacterial cells ( of same or different species) that are temporarily joined. The DNA transfer is one way: One cell donates the DNA,a nd the other receives ti. The donor uses sex pili to attach to the recipient. After contacting a recipient cell, each sex pilus retracts, pulling the two cells together, much like a grappling hook. A temporary &quot;mating bridge&quot; then forms between the two cells, providing an avenue for DNA transfer. In most cases, the ability to form sex pili and donate DNA during conjugation results from the presence of a particular piece of DNA called F factor. The F factor consists about 25 genes, most required for the production of sex pili. The F factor can exist either as a plasmid or as a segment of DNA within the bacterial chromosome

The F factor in its plasmid form is called F plasmid. Cells containing the F plasmid, designated F+ cells, function as DNA donors during conjugation. Cells lacking the F factor, designated F-, function as DNA recipients during conjugation. The F+ condition is transferable in the sense that an F+ cell converts and F- cell to F+ is a copy of the entire F+ plasmid is transferred.

Chromosomal genes can be transferred during conjugation when the donor cell's F factor is integrated into the chromosome. A cell with the F factor built into its chromosome is called an Hfr cell. Like an F+ cell, an Hfr cell functions as a donor during conjugation with an F- cell. When chromosomal DNA from an Hfr cell enters and F- cell, homologous regions of the HFr and F- chromosomes may align, allowing segments of their DNA to be exchanged. This results in the production of a recombinant bacterium that has genes derived from two different cells- a new genetic cariant on which evolution can act. Though theses processes of horizontal gene transfer have so far been studied almost exclusively in bacteria, it is assumed that they are similarly important in archaea. 

== Diverse nutritional and metabolic adaptations ==
The mechanisms discussed in the previous section- rapid reproduction, mutation, and genetic recombination- underlie that extensive genetic variation found in prokaryotic populations. This variation is reflected in the nutritional adaptations found in prokaryotes. Like all organisms, prokaryotes can be categorized by their nutrition; how they obtain every and the carbon used in building the organic molecules that make up cells. Nutritional diversity is greater among prokaryotes than among eukaryotes: Every type of nutrition observed in eukaryotes is represented among the prokaryotes, along with some nutritional modes unique to prokaryotes. Phototrophs are the organisms that obtain energy from light. Chemotrophs are the organisms that obtain energy from chemicals. Organisms that need only an inorganic compound are called autotrophs. Heterotrophs require at least one organic nutrient to make other organic compounds. Combining these possibilities for energy sources and carbon sources results in four major modes of nutrition.

''' Photoautotrophs''': photosynthetic organisms that capture light energy and use it to drive the synthesis of organic compounds and other inorganic carbon compounds. Cyanobacteria and many other groups of prokaryotes are photoautotrophs, as are plants and algae.

'''Chemoautotrophs''': also need only an inorganic compound; however, instead of using light as an energy source, they oxidize inorganic substance, such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, or ferrous ions. This mode of nutrition is unique to certain prokaryotes.

'''Photoheterotrophs''': Harness energy from light but must obtain carbon in organic form. This mode is unique to certain marine and halophilic (salt-loving) prokaryotes. 

'''Chemoheterotrphs''': must consume organic molecules to obtain both energy and carbon. This nutritional mode is widespread among prokaryotes. Fungi, animals, most protists, and even some parasitic plants are also chemoheterotrophs.

== The Role of Oxygen In Metabolism ==
Prokaryotic metabolism also varies with respect to oxygen. Obligate aerobes use oxygen for cellular respiration and cannnot grow without it. Obligate anaerobes, however, are posioned by oxygen. Some obligate anaerobes live exclusively by fermentation; other extract chemical energy by anaerobic respiration, in which substance other than oxygen such as nitrate ions or sulfate ions accept electrons at the &quot;downhill&quot; end of electron transport chains. Facultative anaerobes use oxygen if it is present but can also carry out anaerobic respiration or fermentation in an anaerobic environment. 

''' Nitrogen Metabolism'''
Nitrogen is essential for the production of amino acids and nucleic acids in all organisms. Whereas eukaryotes can obtain nitrogen from only a limited group of nitrogen compounds, prokaryotes can metabolize nitrogen in a wide variety of forms. For example, some cyanobacteria and some methanogens covert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, a process called nitrogen fixation. The cells can then incorporate this &quot;fixed&quot; nitrogen into amino acids and other organic molecules. In terms of their nutrition, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are some of the most self-sufficient organisms, since they need only light, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water and some minerals to grow. Nitrogen fixation by prokaryotes has a large impact on other organisms. For example, nitrogen -fixing prokaryotes can increase the nitrogen but can use the nitrogen compounds that the prokaryotes produce from ammonia. 

''' Metabolic Cooperation'''
Cooperation between prokaryotes allows them to use environmental resource they could not use as individual cells. In some cases, this cooperation takes place between specialized cells of a colony. For instance, the cyanobacterium Anabaena has genes than encode proteins for photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation, but a single cell cannot carry out both processes at the same time. The reason is that photosynthesis produces oxygen which inactivates the enzymes involved in nitrogen fixation. Instead of living as isolated cells, anabaena forms filamentous colonies synthesis while a few specialized cells called heterocytes carry out only nitrogen fixation. Each heterocyte is surrounded by a thickened cell wall that restricts entry of oxygen produced by neighboring photosynthetic cells. Intercellular connections allow heterocytes to transport fixed nitrogen to neighboring cells and to receive carbohydrates. 

Metabolic cooperation between different prokaryotic species often occurs in surface-coating colonies known as biofilms. Cells in a biofilm secrete signaling molecules that recruit nearby cells, causing the colonies to grow. The cells also produce proteins that stick the cells to the substrate and on to another. Channels in the biofilm allow nutrients to reach cells in the interior and wastes to be expelled. Biofilm damage industrial and medical equipment, contaminate products, and contribute to tooth decay and more serious health problems. In another example of cooperation between prokaryotes, sulfate-consuming bacteria coexist with methane-consuming archaea in ball- shaped aggregates on the ocean floor. The bacteria appear to use the archaea's waste products, such as organic compounds and hydrogen. In turn, the bacteria produce compounds that facilitate methane consumption by the archaea. This partnership has global ramifications.

'''Eukaryotes''' house a distinct nucleus, a structure in which the genetic material (DNA) is contained, surrounded by a membrane much like the outer cell membrane. Eukaryotic cells are found in most algae, protozoa, all multicellular organisms (plants and animals) including humans. The genetic material in the nucleus forms multiple chromosomes that are linear and complexed with proteins that help the DNA  'pack' and are involved in regulation of gene expression.

The cells of higher plants differ from animal cells in that they have large vacuoles, a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a lack of lysosomes, centrioles, pseudopods, and flagella or cilia. Animal cells do not have the chloroplasts, and may or may not have cilia, pseudopods or flagella, depending on the type of cell. 

== Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells ==
All cells have several basic features in common: they are all bounded by a selective barrier, plasma membrane. Cytosol is a jellylike substance that is semifluid. All cells contain chromosomes which carry genes in the form of DNA, and ribosomes that make proteins according to instructions from the gene. The major difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is the location of their DNA. In eukaryotic cell, DNA is found at the nucleus, which is bounded by a double membrane. (the word eukaryotic is from the Greek eu, true, and karyon, kernel, here referring to the nucleus). 

Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotic cells; size is general aspect of cell structure that relates to function. The logistics of carrying out cellular metabolism sets limits on cell size. At the lower limit, the smallest cells, known are bacteria called mycoplasmas have diameters between 0.1 and 1.0mm. These are the smallest packages with enough DNA to program metabolism and enough enzymes and other cellular equipment to carry out the activities necessary for a cell to sustain itself and reproduce. 

Metabolic requirements also impose theoretical upper limits on the size that is practical for a singel cell. Plasma membrane functions as a selective barrier that allows sufficient passage of oxygen, nutrients, and wastes to service the entire cell. For each square micrometer of membrane, only a limited amount of a particular substance can cross per second, so the ratio of surface area to volume is critical. As a cell increases in size, its volume grows proportionately more than its surface area. Area is proportional to a linear dimension squared, whereas volume is proportional to the linear dimension cubed. Therefore a smaller object has a greater ration of surface area to volume. 

The need for a surface area sufficiently large to accommodate the volume helps explain the microscopic size of most cells, and the narrow, elongated shapes of others, such as nerve cells. Larger organisms has more cells compare to smaller cells. High ratio of surface area to volume is especially important in cells that exchange a lot of material with their surroundings such as intestinal cells. Such cells may have many long, thin projections from their surface called microvilli, which increase surface area without an appreciable increase in volume.

== Animal Cells==

In animal cells, lysosomes, centrosomes with centrioles, and flagella are present but not in plant cells. 

== Plant Cell ==
'''Cell Wall''': outer layer that maintains cell's shape and protects cell from mechanical damage; made of cellulose, other polysaccharide, and protein. 

'''Plasmodesmata''': channels through cell walls that connect the cytoplasms of adjacent cells.

'''Chloroplast''': photosynthetic organelle; converts energy of sunlight to chemical energy stored in sugar molecules.

In plant cell, chloroplasts, central vacuole, cell wall, and plasmodesmata are present but not in animal cells.
Chromatin in the plant cell is a primary protein

== Nucleus ==
The nucleus contains most of the genes in the eukaryotic cell; some genes are located in mitochondria and chloroplast. It is generally the most conspicuous organelle in a eukaryotic cell. The nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus, sparating its contents from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope is a double membrane, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The envelope is perforated by pore structure that are about 100nm in diameter. At the lip of each pore, the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are continuous. Pore complex lines each pore and regulates the entry and exit of most proteins and RNAs, as well as large complexes of macromolecules. Except at the pores, the nuclear side of the envelope is lined by the nuclear lamina, a netlike array of protein filaments that maintains the shape of the nucleus by mechanically supporting the nuclear envelope. Also nuclear matrix, a framework of fibers extending throughout the nuclear interior, present. 

Chromosomes are organized DNA units that carry the genetic information. Each chromosome is made up of material called chromatin, a complex of proteins and DNA. Stained chromatic usually appears as a diffuse mass, byt as a cell prepares to divide, the thin chromatin fibers coil up and condense thick enough to be distinguished as chromosomes. Each eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes. For example human has 46 chromosomes. 

Nucleolus is a  prominent structure within the nondividing nucleus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized from instructions in the DNA; in nucleolus, proteins imported from the cytoplasm are assembled with rRNA into large and small ribosomal subunits. Theses subunits then exit the nucleus through the nuclear pores to the cytoplasm, where a large and a small subunit can assemble into a ribosome. the number depends on the species and the stage in the cell's reproductive cycle. 

The Nucleus directs protein synthesis by synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA) according to instructions provided by the DNA. The mRNA is then transported to the cytoplasm via the nuclear pores. Once an mRNA molecule reaches the cytoplasm, ribosomes translate the mRNA's genetic message into the primary structure of a specific poly peptide.

== Ribosomes ==
Ribosomes are complexes made of ribosomal RNA and protein; ribosomes are the cellular components that carry out proteins synthesis, also known as protein factories. Cells that have high rates of protein synthesis have particularly large number of ribosomes. Cells active in protein synthesis also have prominent nucleoli. Ribosomes build proteins in two cytoplasmic locales. Free ribosomes are suspended int he cytosol, while bound ribosomes are attached to the outside of the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope. Bound and free ribosomes are structurally identical, and ribosomes can alternate between the two roles. Most of proteins are made on free ribosomes function within the cytosol. Bound ribosomes generally make proteins that are destined for insertion into membranes, for packaging within certain organelles such as lysosomes, or for export from the cell (secretion). 

== The Endomembrane System ==
Endomembrane system carries out a variety of tasks in the cell. These tasks include synthesis of proteins and their transport into membranes and organelles or out of the cell, metabolism and movement of lipids, and detoxification of poisons. The membrane of this system are related either through direct physical continuity or by the transfer of membrane segments as tiny vesicles. The various membranes are not identical in structure and function; the thickness, molecular composition, and types of chemical reactions carried out in a given membrane are not fixed but modified several times during the membrane's life. The endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, various kinds of vacuoles, and the plasma membrane.

== Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) ==
'''Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)''' is an extensive network of membrane that it accounts for more than half the total membrane in many eukaryotic cells. The word endoplasmic means &quot;within the cytoplasm&quot;, and reticulum is Latine for &quot;little net&quot;. The ER consists of a network of membranous tubules and sacs called cisternae. The ER membrane separates the internal compartment of the ER, ER lumen (cavity) or cisternal space, from the cytosol. Since ER membrane is continuous with the nuclear envelope, the space between the two membranes of the envelope is continuous with the lumen of the ER. Smooth ER lacks ribosomes on its outer surface, and Rough ER has ribosomes on the outer surface of the membrane. Ribosomes are also attached to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope's outer membrane.

'''Smooth ER'''- The smooth ER functions in diverse metabolic processes, which vary with cell type. Theses processes include synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons. Enzymes of the smooth ER are important in the synthesis of lipids, including oils, phospholipids, and steroids. Sex hormones of vertebrates and the various steroid hormones are produced by the smooth ER in animal cells. Other enzymes of the smooth ER help detoxify drugs and poisons in liver cells. Detoxification involves adding hydroxyl groups to drug molecules, making them more soluble and easier to flush from the body. For example, sedative phenobarbital and other barbiturates are the drugs that metabolized in this manner by smooth ER in liver cells. Barbiturates, alcohol, and many other drugs induce the proliferation of smooth ER and its associated detoxification enzymes, therefore, increasing tolerance to the drugs; in other words, higher doses are required to achieve a particular effect. Also, because some of the detoxification enzymes have relatively broad action, the proliferation of smooth ER in response to one drug can increase tolerance to other drugs as well. The smooth ER also stores calcium ions; in muscle cells, a specialized smooth ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the ER lumen. When a muscle cell is stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium ions rush back across the ER membrane into the cytosol and trigger contraction of the muscle cell. 

'''Rough ER'''- Many times of cells secrete proteins produced by ribosomes attached to rough ER. As a polypeptide chain grows from a bound ribosomes, it is threaded into the ER lumen through a pore formed by a protein complex in the ER membrane. As the new protein enters the ER lumen, it folds into its native shape. Most  secretory proteins are glycoproteins, which have carbohydrates covalently bonded to them. After secretory proteins are formed, the ER membrane keeps them separate from proteins that are produced by free ribosomes and will remain in the cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER wrapped in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from a specialized region called transitional ER. Transport vesicles are the vesicles in transit from one part of the cell to another. Rough ER is also a membrane factory for the cell; it grows in place by adding membrane proteins and phospholipids to its own membrane. As polypeptide destined to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane and are anchored there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER makes its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes build into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids from precursors in the cytosol. The ER membrane expands and is transferred in the form of transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.

== Golgi Apparatus ==
Golgi is a center of manufacturing, warehousing, sorting, and shipping. The products of the ER are modified and stored and then sent to other destinations. Golgi apparatus is extensive in cells specialized for secretion. The Golgi apparatus consists of flattened membranous sac, cisternae. The membrane of each cisterna in a stack separates ints internal space from the cytosol. Besicles concentrated in the vicinity of the Golgi apparatus are engaged in the transfer of material between parts of the Golgi and other structures. Golgi stack has a distinct structural polarity with the membrane of cisternae on opposite side of the stack different in thickness and molecular composition. The two poles of a Golgi stack are referred to as the cis face and the trans face; cis is the receiving and trans is shipping departments of the Golgi apparatus. The cis face is usually located near ER. Transport vesicles move material from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. A vesicle that buds from the ER can add its membrane and the contents of its lumen to the cis face by fusing with a Golgi membrane. The trans face give rise to vesicles, which pinch off and travel to other sites. The products of ER are usually modified during their transit from the cis region to the trans region of the Golgi. Various Golgi enzymes modify the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins; carbohydrates are first added to proteins int he rough ER during the process of polypeptide synthesis. The carbohydrate on the resulting glycoprotein is then modified as it passes through the rest of the ER and the Golgi. The Golgi removes some sugar monomers and substitutes other, producing a large variety of carbohydrates. In addition, the Golgi apparatus manufactures certain macromolecules by itself. Many polysaccharides secreted by cells are Golgi products, including pectins and certain other non-cellulose polysaccharides made by plant cells and incorporated along with cellulose into their cell walls. Similar to secretory proteins, non-protein Golgi products will be secreted depart from the trans face of the Golgi inside transport vesicles that eventually fuse with the plasma membrane.

The Golgi manufactures and refines its products in stages, with different cisternae containing unique teams of enzymes. Recent research has give rise to a new model of the Golgi as a more dynamic structure; According to the cisternal maturation model, the cisternae of the Golgi actually progress forward from the cis to the tras face of the Golgi, carrying and modifying their cargo as they move. Before a Golgi stack dispatches its products by budding vesicles fromt he trans face, it sorts these products and targets them for various parts of the cell. Molecular identification tags, such as phosphate groups added to the Golgi products, aid in sorting. Transport vesicles budded fromt he Golgi may have external molecules on their membranes that recognize &quot;docking site&quot; on the surface of specific organelles or on the plasma membrane, therefore, targeting the vesicle appropriately. 

== Lysosomes ==
Lysosome is a membranous sac of hydrolytic enzymes that an animal cell uses to digest macromolecules. Lysosomal enzymes work best in the acidic environment found in lysosomes. If a lysosome breaks open or leaks its contents, the released enzymes are not very active because the cytosol has a neutral pH. However, excessive leakage from a large number of lysosomes can destroy a cell by autodigestion. Hydrolytic enzymes and lysosomal membrane are made by rough ER and then transferred to the Golgi apparatus for further processing. Proteins of the inner surface of the lysosomal membrane and the digestive enzymes are spared from destruction by having three dimensional shapes that protect vulnerable bonds from enzymatic attack. 

Phagocytosis is a process that amoebas and many other protists eat by engulfing smaller organisms or other food particles. The food vacuole formed , and then fuses with a lysosome and digests the food. Digestion products pass into cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. In human body, white blood cell helps defend the body by engulfing and destroying bacteria and other invaders.

Lysosome use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's own organic material; this is called autophagy. During autophagy, damaged organelle or small amount of cytosol become surrounded by a double membranes, and lysosome fuses with the outer membrane of their vesicle. The lysosomal enzymes dismantle the enclosed material, and the organic monomers are returned to the cyotosol for reuse. The lysosomes become engorged with indigestible substrates, which begin to interfere with other cellular activities. 

== Vacuoles ==
Vacuoles are membrane-bounded vesicles whose functions vary in different kinds of cells. Food vacuoles are formed by phagocytosis. Many freshwater protists have contractile vacuoles that pump excess water out of the cell, thereby maintaining a suitable concentration of ions and molecules inside the cell. In plants and fungi, which lacks lysosomes, vacuoles carry out hydrolysis;

The central vacuole develops by the coalescence of smaller vacuoles, themselves derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The vacuolar membrane is selective in transportin solutes. As result, the solution inside the central vacuole is called cell sap, is different in composition from the cytosol. It can hold reserves of important organic compounds such as proteins stockpiled in the vacuoles of storage cells in seeds. Also it is the plant cell's main repository of inorganic ions, such as potassium and chloride. Many plant cells use their vacuoles contain pigments that color the cells. Vacuoles may also help protect the plant against predators by containing compounds that are poisonous or unpalatable to animals. The vacuole has a major role in the growth of plant cells, which enlarge as their vacuoles absorb water, enabling the cell to become larger with a minimal investment in new cytoplasm. 

== Mitochondria and Chloroplasts ==
Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the organelles that convert energy to forms that cells can use for work. Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration, the metabolic process that generates ATP by extracting energy from sugars, fats, and other fuels with the help of oxygen. Chloroplasts, are found in plants and algae, and they are the sites of photosynthesis. They convert solar energy to chemical energy by absorbing sunlight and using it to drive the synthesis of organic compounds such as sugar from carbon dioxide and water. Both of them are not part of endomembrane system. Mitochondria have two membrane separating their innermost space from the cytosol, and chloroplasts have three. The membrane proteins of mitochondria and chloroplasts are made not by ribosomes bound to the ER, but by free ribosomes in the cyotosol and by ribosomes contained within these organelles themselves. They also contain small amount of DNA that programs the synthesis of the proteins made on the organelle's ribosomes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts are semiautonomous organelles that grow and reproduce within the cell. 

'''Mitochondria'''
Mitochondria are found in all eukaryotic cells; Some cells have a singel large mitochondrion, but more often a cell has hundreds or thousands of mitochondria. The number correlates with he cell's level of metabolic activity. The mitochondrion is enclosed by two membranes, each a phospholipid bilayer witha unique collection of embedded proteins. The outer membrane is smooth, but the inner membrane is convoluted, with infolding called cristae. The inner membrane divides the mitochondrion into two internal compartments. The first is the inter-membrane space, the narrow region between the inner and outer membranes. The second compartment, the mitochondrial matrix, is enclosed by the inner membrane. the matrix contains many different enzymes as wellas the mitochondrial DNA and ribosomes. Enzymes in the matrix catalyze some steps of cellular respiration. Other proteins that function in respiration, including the enzyme that makes ATP are built into the inner membrane, As highly folded surface, the cristae give the inner mitochondrial membrane a large surface ares, thus enhancing the productivity of cellular respiration. 

'''Chloroplasts'''
The chloroplast is a specialized member of related plant organelles called plastids. Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll, along with enzymes and other molecules that function in the photosynthetic production of sugar. Its shape is lens-shaped and found in leaves. The contents of a chloroplast are partitioned from the cytosol by an envelope consisting of two membranes separated by a very narrow intermembrane space. Inside the chloroplast is another membranous system in the form of flattened, intern=connected sacs called thylakoids. Thylakoids are stacked like poker ships, and each stack is called granum. The fluid outside the thylakoids is the stroma which contains the chloroplast DNA and ribosomes as well as many enzymes. The membranes of the chloroplast divide the chloroplast space into three compartments: the intermembrane space, the stroma, and the thylakoid space. 

== Cytoskeleton ==
Cytoskeleton is a network of fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm. It plays a major role in organizing the structure and activities of the cell. It is composed of three types of molecular structure: microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. The main function of the cytoskeleton is to give mechanical support to the cell and maintain its shape. Cytoskeleton is stabilized by balance between opposing forces exerted by its elements. The cytoskeleton is more dynamic than an animal skeleton; it can be quickly dismantled in one part of the cell and reassembled in a new location, changing the shape of the cell. Also several types of cell motility involve the cytoskeleton. the cell motility encompasses both changes in cell location and more limited movements of parts of the cell. Cell motility require the interaction of the cytoskeleton with motor proteins. Cytoskeletal elements and motor proteins work together with plasma membrane molecules to allow whole cells to move along fibers outside the cell. The cytoskeleton is also involved in regulating biochemical activities in the cell in response to mechanical stimulation forces exerted by extracellular molecules via cell-surface proteins are apparently transmitted into the cell by cytoskeletal elements, and the forces may even reach the nucleus. 

'''Microtubules'''- thickest

All eukaryotic cells have microtubules; the wall of the hollow tube is constructed from a globular protein called tubulin. Each tubulin protein is a dimer, a molecule made up of two subunits. A tubulin dimer consists of two slightly different polypeptides, alpha-tublin, and beta-tubulin. Microtubules grow in length by adding tubulin dimers. Due to the architecture of a microtubules, its two ends are slightly different; one end can accumulate or release tubulin dimers at a much higher rate than the other, therefore, growing and shrinking significantly during cellular activities. This is called the &quot;plus end&quot;, not because it can only add tubulin proteins but because it's the end where both &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; rates are much higher. Microtubules shape and support the cell and also serve as tracks along which organelles equipped with other proteins can move. 

In animal cells, microtubules grow out from a centrosomes, a region that is often located near the nucleus and considered a &quot;microtubule-organizing center&quot;. Theses microtubules function as compression-resisting girders of the cytoskeleton. Within the centrosome are a pair of centrioles, each composed of nine sets of triplet microtubules arrange in a ring. Before division, the centrioles replicate; although centrosomes with centrioles may help organize microtubule assembly in animal cell,s they are not essential for this function in all eukaryotes. 

Also specialized arrangement of microtubules is responsible for the beating of flagella and cilia. Thees are microtubule containing extensions that project from some cells. When cilia or flagella extend from cells that are held in place as part of a tissue layer, they can move fluid over the surface of the tissue. Flagella and cilia different in their beating patterns. A flagellum has an undulating motion that generates force in the same direction as the flagellum's axis. However cilia work more like oars, with alternating power and recovery strokes generating force in a direction perpendicular to the cilium's axis. A cillium may also act as a signal-receiving &quot;antenna&quot; for the cell. Cilia that have this function are nonmotile, and there is only one per cell. Membrane proteins on this kind of cilium transmit molecular signals from the cell's movement to its interior, triggering signaling pathways that may lead to changes int he cell's activities. Cillia-based signaling appears to be crucial to brain function and to embryonic development. Motile cilia and flagella share a common ultrastructure; each has a core of microtubules sheathed in an extension of the plasma membrane. Nine doublets of microtubules, the members of each parit sharing part of their walls, are arranged in a ring. This arrangement, referred to as the &quot;9+2&quot; pattern, is found in all eukaryotic flagella and motile cilia. Non-motile primary cilia have &quot;9+0&quot; pattern, lacking the central pari of microtubules. The microtubule assembly of a cilium or flagellum is anchored in the cell by a basal body, which is structurally very similar to a centriole.

In flagella and motile cilia, flexible cross-linking proteins, evenly spaced along the length of the cilium or falgellum, connect the outer doublets to each other and to the two central microtubules Each outer doublet also has paris of protruding proteins spaced along its length and reaching toward the neighboring doublet; These are large motor proteins called dyneins, composed of several polypeptides. Dyneins are responsible for the bending movements of the organelle. A dynein molecule performs a complex cycle of movements cause by changes in these shape of the proteins, with ATP providing the energy for these changes. The mechanics of dynein-based bending involve a process that resembles walking. A typical dynein protein has two &quot;feet&quot; that &quot;walk&quot; along the microtubule of the adjacent doublet, one foot maintaining contact while the other releases and reattaches one step further along the microtubules. Without any restraints ont he movement of the microtubules doublets, one doublet would continue to &quot;walk&quot; along and slide past the surface of the other, elongating the cilium or flagellum rather than bending it. 

'''Microfillaments'''- thinnest

Microfilaments are solid rods about 7nm in diameter. They are also called as actin filaments because they are build from molecules of actin, a globular protein. A microfilament si a twisted double chain of  actin subunits. Microfilaments can form structural networks, due to the presence of proteins that bind along the side of an actin filament and allow a new filament to extend as a branch. The structure role of microfilaments in the cytoskeleton is to bear tension. A cortical microfilaments, a three-dimensional network formed by microfilaments just inside the plasma membrane, helps support the cell's shape. This network give the outer cytoplasmic layer of a cell called the cortex. 

In animal cells specialized for transporting materials across the plasma membrane, such as intestinal cells, bundles of microfilaments make up the core of microvilli. Microfillaments are well known for their role in cell motility, particularly as part of the contractile apparatus of muscle cells (myosin). Localized contraction brought about by actin and myosin also plays a role in amoeboid movement, which a cell such as an amoeba crawls along a surface by extending and flowing into cellular extension called pseudopodia. pseudopodia extend and contract through the reversible assembly of actin subunits nto microfilaments and of microfillaments into networks that convert cytoplasm fro a sol to a gel. The pseudopodium extends until the actin reassembles into a network.

In plant cells, both actin-myosin interactions and sol-gel transformations brought about by actin may be involved in cytoplasmic streaming, a circular flow of cytoplasm within cells.

'''intermediate filaments'''- middle range
intermediate filaments are larger than the diameter of microfilaments but smaller than that of microtubules. Specialized for bearing tension (like microfilaments), intermediate filaments are a diverse class of cytoskeletal elements. Each type is constructed from a different molecular subunit such as keratins. Intermediate filaments are more permanent fixture of cells than are microfilaments and microtubules. Even after the death of the cell, intermediate filament networks often persist. Intermediate filaments are important in reinforcing the shape of a cell and fixing the position of certain organelles. For instance, the nucleus commonly sits within a cage made of intermediate filaments, fixed in location by braches of the filaments that extend into the cytoplasm. Other intermediate filaments make p the nuclear lamina that lines the interior of the nuclear envelope. In case where the shape of the entire cell is correlated with function, intermediate filaments support that shape.  

== Cell Wall ==
Cell wall is an extracellular structure of plant cell that distinguishes them from animal cells. The wall protects the plant cell, maintains its shape, and prevents excessive uptake of water. The strong walls of specialized cells hold the plant up against the force of gravity. Plant cell walls are much thicker than the plasma membrane, and the exact chemical composition of the wall varies from species to species and even from one cell type to another in the same plant, but basic design of the wall is consistent. Microfibrils made of the polysaccharide cellulose are synthesized by an enzyme called cellulose synthase and secreted to the extracellular space, where they become embedded in a matrix of other polysaccharides and proteins. This combination of materials, strong fibers in a &quot;ground substance&quot; (matrix), is the same basic architectural design found in steel-reinforced concrete and in fiberglass. 

A young plant cell first secrets a thins and flexible wall called the primary cell wall; as the cell grows, the cellulose fibrils are oriented at right angels to the direction of cell expansion, possibly affecting the growth pattern. Between primary walls of adjacent cell is the middle lamella, which is a thin layer rich in sticky polysaccharides pectins. The middle lamella flues adjacent cells together. When the cell mature and stops growing, it strengthens its wall. Some plant cells do this simply by secreting hardening substances into the primary wall, but other cells add a secondary cell wall between the plasma membrane and the primary wall. Then secondary wall, often deposited in several laminated layer, has a strong and durable matrix that afford the cell protection and support.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phospholipids | [[../Cholesterol|Cholesterol &gt;&gt;]]

Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules that are made up of a hydrophilic  head and a hydrophobic  tail. The head group has a 'special' region that changes between various phospholipids. This head group will differ between cell membranes [types of cells] or different concentrations of specific 'head groups'. The fatty acid tails are also differ, but there is always one saturated and one unsaturated 'leg' of the tail.

[[image:phospholipids.png]]

Phospholipids are 2 fatty acids one saturated and one unsaturated (shown by the double bond) that are linked to a glycerol.

==The Noncovalent Assemblies==
For the phospholipid bilayer, even though it consists of hydrophilic heads on the outer membrane, the non-covalent hydrophobic tails of the inner membrane is the key to hold the entire membrane together because there are Van der Waals attractive forces within the cell membrane in which the hydrocarbon tails are closely packed together. With its non-covalent character inside the cell membrane, the hydrophobic molecules can easily pass through the cell membrane through passive diffusion. With this, the cell has control the molecules' movement through the transmembrane proteins complexes such as pores and gates. As for the hydrophilic molecules (such as ions, carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, and nucleic acids), they require active diffusion in order to pass through the cell membrane because of their polarity and because they are hydrophilic (most non-covalent assemblies of the cell membrane are hydrophobic, such as hydrocarbon chains). 

The non-covalent assemblies of the cell membrane can help give rise to bubbles such as liposome, or lipid vesicle, that can deliver drugs into a specific part of the body. The structure of liposome is very similar to the cell membrane's lipid bilayer, and the materials that compose the liposome is identical to cell membrane. Because liposome is a bubble, the structure is shaped like a ring, where the hydrophilic heads are the outer and inner ring while the hydrophobic tails are in between the hydrophilic heads' rings. Because of the ring structure, the liposomes are able to trap aqueous materials such as drugs into their rings. Once the materials are within the ring, the liposomes would deliver them to a specific location in the body, such as cancer cells.

Cholesterol is a major component of cell membranes and serves many other functions as well. Cholesterol helps to 'pack' phospholipids in the membranes, thus giving more rigidity to the membranes. In colder conditions cholesterol also serves to keep the fluidity in the cell membrane, by keeping space in between the phospholipids. Also cholesterol serves diverse functions such as: it is converted to vitamin D (if irradiated with Ultra Violet light, modified to form steroid hormones, and is modified to bile acids to digest fats.

The membranes of cells are a fluid, they are semi-permeable, which means some things can pass through the membrane through osmosis or diffusion. The rate of diffusion will vary depending on the its: size, polarity, charge and concentration on the inside of the membrane versus the concentration on the outside of the membrane. When something is permeable it means that something can spread throughout, like (The perfume is permeating the room.). Here is a list of some molecules and how they relate to passing through the membrane without assistance, in other words, through diffusion:

=== Hydrophobic Molecules ===
* O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - Oxygen 
* N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - Nitrogen 
* benzene

=== Small uncharged Polar Molecules ===
* H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O - Water 
* urea 
* glycerol 

=== Large Uncharged Polar Molecules ===
* Glucose 
* Sucrose
* nucletide

=== Ions ===
* H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - Hydrogen ion 
* Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - Sodium ion 
* K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - Potassium ion 
* Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; - Calcium ion 
* Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; - Chloride ion

Various substances will pass through the membranes at varying rates through diffusion.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called WouterVH. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name WouterVH~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Tomos, apolgies for not seeing your WikiU comment sooner. A general answer that seems to apply to all your questions would be: ''Nobody knows yet since Wikiversity is just an idea some of us are kicking around''. I've offloaded your question list to give it some thought, and will post some responses soon. Good work so far on Japaneese! Again, thanks for the thoughts,  [[User:LouI|LouI]] 13:04, 7 Sep 2003 (UTC)

::Thanks. And one more thanks for your comments! [[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 16:19, 8 Sep 2003 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The number of known organic compounds is quite large.  In fact, there are many times more organic compounds known than all the other (inorganic) compounds discovered so far, about 7 million organic compounds in total.  Fortunately, organic chemicals consist of a relatively few similar parts, combined in different ways, that allow us to predict how a compound we have never seen before may react, by comparing how other molecules containing the same types of parts are known to react.

These parts of organic molecules are called '''functional groups'''.  The identification of functional groups and the ability to predict reactivity based on functional group properties is one of the cornerstones of organic chemistry.

Functional groups are '''specific atoms, ions, or groups of atoms''' having consistent properties. A functional group makes up part of a larger molecule.

For example, '''-OH''', the hydroxyl group that characterizes alcohols, is an oxygen with a hydrogen attached. It could be found on any number of different molecules.

Just as elements have distinctive properties, functional groups have '''characteristic chemistries'''. An '''-OH''' group on one molecule will tend to react similarly, although perhaps not identically, to an '''-OH''' on another molecule.

'''Organic reactions usually take place at the functional group''', so learning about the reactivities of functional groups will prepare you to understand many other things about organic chemistry.

==Memorizing Functional Groups==

Don't assume that you can simply skim over the functional groups and move on. As you proceed through the text, the writing will be in terms of functional groups. It will be assumed that the student is familiar with most of the ones in the tables below. It's simply impossible to discuss chemistry without knowing the &quot;lingo&quot;. It's like trying to learn French without first learning the meaning of some of the words.

One of the easiest ways to learn functional groups is by making flash cards. Get a pack of index cards and write the name of the functional group on one side, and draw its chemical representation on the other.

For now, a list of the most important ones you should know is provided here. Your initial set of cards should include, at the very least: Alkene, Alkyne, Alkyl halide (or Haloalkane), Alcohol, Aldehyde, Ketone, Carboxylic Acid, Acyl Chloride (or Acid Chloride), Ester, Ether, Amine, Sulfide, and Thiol. After you've learned all these, add a couple more cards and learn those. Then add a few more and learn those. Every functional group below is eventually discussed at one point or another in the book. But the above list will give you what you need to continue on.

And don't just look at the cards. Say and write the names and draw the structures. To test yourself, try going through your cards and looking at the names and then drawing their structure on a sheet of paper. Then try going through and looking at the structures and naming them. Writing is a good technique to help you memorize, because it is more active than simply reading. Once you have the minimal list above memorized backwards and forwards, you're ready to move on. But don't stop learning the groups. If you choose to move on without learning the &quot;lingo&quot;, then you're not going to understand the language of the chapters to come. Again, using the French analogy, it's like trying to ignore learning the vocabulary and then picking up a novel in French and expecting to be able to read it.

===Functional groups containing ...===

In [[organic chemistry]] '''functional groups''' are submolecular structural motifs, characterized by specific elemental composition and connectivity, that confer reactivity upon the molecule that contains them.

Common functional groups include:

''Note: The table above is adapted from the Functional Groups table on [[w:Functional_groups|Wikipedia.]]''


Combining the names of functional groups with the names of the parent [[w:Alkanes|alkanes]] generates a powerful [[w:systematic name|systematic nomenclature]] for naming [[w:organic compound|organic compounds]].

The non-hydrogen atoms of functional groups are always associated with each by [[w:covalent bond|covalent bond]]s, as well as with the rest of the molecule. When the group of atoms is associated with the rest of the molecule primarily by ionic forces, the group is referred to more properly as a [[w:polyatomic ion|polyatomic ion]] or [[w:complex ion|complex ion]]. And all of these are called [[w:radical|radical]]s, by a meaning of the term ''radical'' that predates the [[w:free radical|free radical]].

The first carbon after the carbon that attaches to the functional group is called the [[w:alpha carbon|alpha carbon]].

==Mnemonics for Functional Groups==
These are possible mnemonics for the common functional groups.

&lt;b&gt;Vowels&lt;/b&gt;: Remember the vowels &quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot; for Alkane, Alkene, and Alkyne. Alkanes have only single covalent bonds. Alkenes have at least one double bond. Alkynes have at least one triple bond. The letters &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, and &quot;U&quot; are not used. Furthermore, &quot;O&quot; and &quot;U&quot; would result in awkward pronunciations.

&lt;b&gt;Alcohol&lt;/b&gt;: Look for the &quot;C-O-H&quot; in &quot;Alcohol.&quot;

&lt;b&gt;Ether&lt;/b&gt;: Ethers were anesthetics used in the 1800s. Dr. Kellogg also lived at the same time. Corn Flakes are made by Kellogg's. A rooster or cock (C-O-C) is the cornflake mascot.

&lt;b&gt;Amine&lt;/b&gt;: Remember the &quot;N&quot; stands for nitrogen.

&lt;b&gt;Aldehyde&lt;/b&gt;: This sounds like &quot;Adelaide,&quot; the Australian city. Australia is at the end of the Asian islands, and aldehydes are at the end of the hydrocarbon chain. The &quot;Y&quot; indicates a C=O double bond.

&lt;b&gt;Ketone&lt;/b&gt;: Imagine the diagonal strokes of &quot;K&quot; forming the C=O double bond. [[File:Ketone_Functional_Group_Mnemonic_K.png]]

&lt;b&gt;Carboxylic Acid&lt;/b&gt;: &quot;Box&quot; stands for boxed wine or C-O-H, alcohol. The &quot;Y&quot; indicates a C=O double bond.

&lt;b&gt;Ester&lt;/b&gt;: This sounds like &quot;Estelle&quot; George Costanza's mother in the TV show &lt;u&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/u&gt;. George's nickname was Koko or Coco. So think of O=C-O-C.

&lt;b&gt;Amide&lt;/b&gt;: Amine with a &quot;D&quot;. D for double.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Japanese language}}
Japanese is spoken by 130 million people. This makes it the [[w:List of languages by total speakers|ninth most spoken language]] by native speakers. Linguists debate over the classification of the Japanese language, and one general theory asserts that Japanese is an isolated language and thus a language family of its own, known as  Japonic languages. Another major theory includes Japanese as part of a hypothetical Altaic language family which spans most of Central Asia and would also include Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, and Korean languages. Neither of these theories has yet been generally accepted.

Japan is the only country where Japanese is the sole official language (though the island of  [[w:Angaur|Angaur]] has Japanese as one of three official languages). There are, however, numerous speakers in other countries. These are largely due to emigration, most notably to the United States of America (California and Hawaii, in particular), Brazil and the Philippines. Furthermore, when Japan occupied and colonized much of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, the locals were educated in the Japanese language. Many elderly locals in Korea, Taiwan, and parts of China still speak Japanese.

Japan has steadily developed for many centuries and, unlike many other cultures, has not been seriously affected by any major invasions until recent times. A substantial part of the vocabulary, though, has been borrowed over the years from Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, German, French, and most recently English.

== Grammar ==
{{wikipedia|Japanese grammar}}
{{Further|Japanese/Grammar|l1=Grammar}}
While Japanese grammar is very regular, it is markedly different from English. Japanese has been deemed a subject&amp;ndash;object&amp;ndash;verb (SOV) and topic-prominent language, whereas English is a subject&amp;ndash;verb&amp;ndash;object (SVO) and subject-prominent language.

To illustrate, the English sentence “Cats eat mice” contains a subject (cats), a verb (eat), and an object (mice), in an SVO order, where the “-s” is a ''plural marker'', and “mouse” &amp;rarr; “mice” is a plural marker by [[w:Apophony|ablaut]], but only the word order indicates which is the subject and the object&amp;mdash;i.e. which is dining and which is the meal.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{furi|猫|ねこ|}}
| は
| {{furi|鼠|ねずみ|}}
| を
| {{furi|食|く|う}}
|-
| Neko
| wa
| nezumi
| o
| kū
|-
| Cat
|
| mouse
|
| eat
|}

The topic-prominence is not obvious in this example; “cat” is the subject (the agent) in English, but it is the topic (what the sentence is ''about'') in Japanese. In the above example, “{{furi|猫|ねこ|}}は” is the topic, and “{{furi|鼠|ねずみ|}}を{{furi|食|く|う}}” is the comment.

The verb “kū” means “eat” in the sense of one animal consuming another. To speak about a person eating, it would make more sense to use the word “taberu” which means “eat,” as in to consume a meal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/3016/what-is-the-difference-between-「食う」-and- 「食べる」]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese does not have articles (the words, “a” or “an”, or “the”), nor is it mandatory to indicate number (singular versus plural.) In the sentence above, “{{furi|猫|ねこ|}}” could mean either “cat” or “cats.” The “mouse/mice” ablaut does not occur in Japanese, which is an agglutinative language (inflecting by appending) and highly regular. In Japanese, the plural is formed by adding the ending “-tachi,” or “-ra.” Thus, the word, “cats” would be “nekotachi,” and is always plural, but the word “neko” can be either singular or plural. “Nekora,” however, would sound rather strange, as “-ra” and “-tachi” are not necessarily interchangeable. For the beginner, therefore, it is best not to worry about learning plural endings.

For the English speaking student of Japanese grammar, the greatest hurdles to cross are probably the thought process of the Japanese sentence and learning the seemingly endless variety of endings available for modifying verbs and the order in which they can be strung together. 

The grammatical paradigm of SVO or SOV is completely irrelevant in the study of Japanese and other languages outside the Indo-European family of languages. In truth, it is not only unimportant, it is untrue, and will cause the student of the language to fail in acquiring fluency, because it is an artificial imposition of an Indo-European construct on a non-Indo-European language. Japanese, like [[w:Tagalog|Tagalog]] and many other languages, uses affixes to explicitly demonstrate grammatical relationships instead of using syntax. In Japanese, word order will not change the meaning of the sentence. However, it will change the emotional character. An SVO word order is not incorrect in Japanese, and native speakers use it frequently, as a matter of fact to heighten the emotional charge. Thus, “あれは何だ” is a simple question: “What is that?” But “何だあれは” should receive an exclamation point at the end because the word order indicates that the speaker is clearly upset or at least annoyed by whatever “that” is.

Japanese sentences thus are not SOV. They are TV: T stands for topic and V for verb. Verbs are really the secret to success in acquiring fluency in Japanese. Thus, greatest attention should be given to learning the verb forms.

There are two tenses of time: past and present. The present tense is used to describe future events. All past tense verbs have the ending “-た” (“-ta”) or “-だ” (“-da.”) The present tense always ends in the vowel “-u” in the positive and “-nai” in the negative. There is only one exception: the word, “だ” (“da”), which is the present tense of “be” (“am,” “are,” “is.”) As in probably all languages, this verb is highly irregular in Japanese and its usage must simply be memorized. For the English speaker the two time tenses should be quite easy to remember because in English the past tense is usually indicated by a final “-t” or “-d,” and the present tense of the basic positive present tense verb “do” ends in the “u” sound. The “-nai” ending sounds similar to “nay” in English. In conversational Japanese, a complete sentence will end in a present tense or past tense verb. As indicated earlier, there are many other possible endings, but they are not used in the final position to complete a sentence, nor are they used at the end of the active verb.

Beyond the verb, there are words that indicate the function of words and phrases as they relate to the verb. The most important of these are “は” (“wa”), “が” (“ga”), “に” (“ni”), “の” (“no”), “を” (“o”), and “で” (“de.”) “は” marks what is being discussed. “が” follows the word that is the agent of the verb. This means who is doing something is the active tense, and who is receiving the action of a passive verb. In both cases, they mark “the who.” “に” indicates the direction toward and is usually translated as “in,” “to,” “at.” “の” indicates possession or source and usually is translated as “-’s” or “of.” “を” is only appropriate with active transitive verbs because it marks the direct object. Finally, “で” at the end of a place word indicates where a verb happened. It is usually translated “at,” “on,” or “in.” Added to the end of word that represents an object, it marks the instrument of the verb, what was used to perform the verb. It is translated, “with.” 

猫は、ピッちゃんが家に帰ってきて、台所で犬のえさを食った. “Cats-wa, Pitchan-ga house-ni came-and, kitchen-de dog-no chow-o ate.” (The “て” verb ending indicates incompletion.) “Speaking of cats, Pitchan came home and ate the dog’s food in the kitchen.”

Thus, every word or phrase in a Japanese sentence takes an ending that explicitly denotes the function of that word or phrase and how it relates to the verb.

== Levels of politeness ==
{{Wikipedia|Keigo}}
{{further|Japanese/Grammar/Politeness|l1=Politeness}}
Japanese culture and society is based on a hierarchy of higher status (目上 ''meue'') and lower status (目下 ''meshita''). As such, there are three varying levels of politeness. Because Japanese is primarily a &quot;vertical&quot; society, all relationships contain an element of relative station. For example, a student is a lower station than a teacher, and therefore a student would use polite language when speaking to a teacher, but the teacher would use plain language when speaking to a student. A salesperson talking to a customer would place himself far below the customer, and would therefore use honorific language, whereas the customer would use either plain or polite language.

Honorific language is not a separate category from plain and polite language, but a separate concept that uses different rules. When using honorific language, a Japanese speaker modifies nouns, verbs, and adjectives to either lower himself and his associates, or exalt someone else and that individual's associates. Whereas the use of plain or polite language is determined by the relative station of the person ''to'' whom you are speaking, the use of honorific language is determined by the relative station of the person ''about'' whom you are speaking. Exalted language is applied when you are speaking about someone who is due respect, such as a professor, an executive, a political official, or a customer. Exalted language is only applied to other people, never to oneself. Humble language, however, is ''only'' applied to oneself and people associated with oneself. It would be inappropriate, for example, to use humble language to describe a beggar, even though he would be extremely low on the social ladder.

== The Japanese writing system ==
{{wikipedia|Japanese writing system}}
{{further|Japanese/Japanese writing system|l1=Japanese writing system}}
Japanese is written mostly using three writing scripts, ''kanji'', ''hiragana'' and ''katakana''. Kanji are Chinese characters that were first introduced to Japan in the 4th century. Unlike Chinese, Japanese is a highly inflected language with words changing their ending depending on case, number, etc. For this reason, the hiragana and katakana syllabaries were created. The hiragana serve largely to show the inflection of words, as conjunctions and such. The katakana are mainly used for loan-words from other languages.

=== Kanji ===
{{further|Japanese/Kanji|l1=Kanji}}
The Japanese writing system is derived from the Chinese ideographic character set (Japanese: 漢字 ''kanji'', Mandarin: 汉字 ''hanzi''). They are usually very similar to Traditional Chinese characters. Though kanji are Chinese in origin their use is dictated by Japanese grammar. Each character may be read in different ways depending on the context it is in. 

The number of existing Chinese characters has been variously estimated at between 40,000 and 80,000; however, only a small subset is commonly used in modern Japanese. An educated Japanese person will generally be able to read between 2,000 and 4,000 characters. In order to be literate in the Japanese language, the student should strive to master at least the 2,136 general-use characters (常用漢字 &amp;ndash; ''[[w:Jōyō kanji|jōyō kanji]]'') established by the Ministry of Education.

=== Hiragana and katakana ===
{{further|Japanese/Kana|l1=Kana}}
The syllabaries, known as ''kana'' ({{furi|仮名|かな}}), were developed around 900 AD by simplifying kanji to form the ''hiragana'' (ひらがな, or 平仮名) and the more angular ''katakana'' (カタカナ, or 片仮名). Hiragana can be recognized by the characteristic curved shapes, while katakana are identifiable by their sharp edges and straight lines. The creation of one of the scripts has been attributed to Kūkai (774-835, alias Kōbō Daishi) the famous monk who introduced Shingon Buddhism to Japan.

Hiragana and katakana are almost completely phonetic&amp;mdash;much more so than the English alphabet. Each set, however, is referred to as a ''syllabary'' rather than an alphabet because each character represents an entire syllable with only a single consonant (which is a more recent addition) (see [[../Pronunciation/]] for more). The syllabary charts in Japanese are referred to as the ''gojūon'' ({{furi|五十音|ごじゅうおん}}), meaning &quot;fifty sounds&quot; because they are written in a five by ten chart. However, there are a few gaps in the table where certain sounds have fallen out of use. Modern Japanese can be written using 46 kana.

In practical use, hiragana is used to write, for example, [[w:Inflection|inflectional]] endings for adjectives and verbs (送り仮名 ''okurigana''), grammatical particles (助詞 ''joshi'') and auxiliaries (助動詞 ''jodōshi''), Japanese words that have no kanji (or not commonly known kanji), and annotations to kanji to indicate pronunciation (振り仮名 ''furigana''). Katakana is used to write, for example, foreign words and names, [[w:Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeia]], emphasized words (somewhat like italicized words in English text), and technical and scientific words, such as plant, animal, and mineral names.

:Much clearer now. This page is beginning to feel like it should be interpreted as 'Requests for banning', analagous to 'Votes for deletion'. I'm wondering if we shouldn't perhaps adopt the more traditional format of the VfD page, where new requests are placed at the bottom with '==' headings, using the '&amp;section=new' hack, and get processed incrementally by admins.

::: I'll leave it for now, since there are more important things to do, and no-one actually seems to use the page except you and I, especially now that we have sufficient admins in place to swiftly block vandals. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:19, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

== Ass Pus attacks ==

There must be something more that can be done about this idiot.  Is it possible to track him down?  Certainly where I am living the last image he uploaded (the infamous goatse image) would be considered porn and potentially he could be charged with illegal distribution of pornography as a criminal charge.  Any other ideas?  Kicking him off his ISP to make life harder ''for him''?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:56, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

: I've already spoken to the server administrators. The problem is with [[m:Privacy policy]]. If a user registers for an account, then we can't do an IP block, so he can create infinite numbers of accounts, and retain his anonymity. Perhaps if the community voted to remove this restriction? I'll check if it can be negotiated. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:17, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

:: '''Update''': Under point '5' of [[m:Privacy policy#Policy on release of data derived from page logs]], it seems this information can be released, but doesn't specify a means for doing so. I'm attempting to find out the correct process for releasing this info. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:30, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

::: '''Update''': After having chatted to some of the devs/sysadmin types (who must really hate me by now), it seems they all come from different IP addresses with different open proxies. Point is, there's no reasonable way to block the person (or people) who are doing it completely, without compromising the ability for newbies to use the system in a valid fashion. The best we can do is get IP addresses for users vandalising via open web proxies, and block those. See also [[m:Proxy blocking]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:30, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

::::I am wondering if with the IP address we can do something like [http://spamcop.net SpamCop] where we will send annoying e-mails to the ISP complaining about vandalizing web pages.  It seems as though that is also by itself illegal in many juristictions, perhaps even Florida (where these servers are physically located) as this is a form of assult.  Certainly if somebody put up some of the images that this vandal has been using in a supermarket, newspaper page, or other public forum they could get arrested for public lewdness.  Even with open proxies (except for awful places like Chinanet that don't care about the rest of the world...only if it affects chinese citizens will they complain) they do have tracelogs to find the dial-up phone number or DSL connection at some point in the routing.  If it is a corporate internet, the dude would be instantly fired.  It is possible to find out exactly who is doing this, if the ISPs will only cooperate.  As the server farm is in Florida, the [http://www.ftc.gov U.S. Federal Trade Commission] may also be able to help out in terms of applying legal pressure, or sending a goatse image to a senator might just do the trick (if you can explain this is the garbage kids are seeing on supposedly &quot;kid friendly&quot; internet pages like the Wikijunior page that was attacked in the last round).  Since we would know the time and the IP address, this information can be traced to a specific individual.  Technically the data is available, and I do think there would be people that could help out and put this idiot behind bars.  If there needs to be a law written to stop an idiot like this, I am politically active enough I might be able to get some action... particularly on how shocking images like this would be to a typical legislator.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:14, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::Because this guy is an attention seeking vandal, the less attention they receive the, less active they will be. We can fix the damage caused quite easily, so I wouldn't worry about them too much. But, I agree that we should also be applying pressure to track them down too, because they are a poor example for new contributors to Wikibooks.

== New procedure ==

For account-based vandalism attacks (especially ass pus), if you email the details to &lt;code&gt;brion AT pobox DOT com&lt;/code&gt; then he will attempt to mass-block the IP on all Wikimedia wikis. Be sure to include:

* The fact it originated on en.wikibooks.org
* The username of the vandal

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;
Japanese verbs, (動詞; &lt;span title=&quot;dōshi&quot;&gt;どうし&lt;/span&gt;), inflect heavily to indicate ''formality'', ''tense'' or ''mood'', primarily in their ending. There are two tenses, several levels of formality and three classes of verbs, depending on their inflection. The two tenses are perfective (often considered past tense) and present (or technically, non-past, as the future tense is not indicated). Out of the several levels of formality, two are the most common: plain and polite.

Japanese verbs are officially categorised into five classes,&lt;ref&gt;
These are
* {{furi|五段|ごだん}}
* {{furi|上一段|かみいちだん}} (the single-row conjugation verbs ending in iru)
* {{furi|下一段|しもいちだん}} (the single-row conjugation verbs ending in eru)
* カ{{furi|行|ぎょう}}{{furi|変格|へんかく}} (only {{furi|来|く|る}}
* サ{{furi|行|ぎょう}}{{furi|変格|へんかく}} (only する)
&lt;/ref&gt; but as two of these inflect much the same and another two only contain one verb each, these are usually merged into three when Japanese is taught as a foreign language. These are the ''consonant stem''-, ''vowel stem''- and ''irregular'' classes.&lt;ref&gt;These go by various names in English. The the consonant stem class is also called ''godan'' class or ''five-row'' class while the vowel stem class is also called ''ichidan'' class or ''one-row'' class. The irregular verbs are not known as such in Japanese, but {{furi|変格|へんかく}}, literally: different case, indicating that it's different from normal, but not irregular in itself.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dictionaries use the plain present positive form (commonly known as ''dictionary form'') as the headword for verbs.

Verbs are classed based on their conjugations. Their endings don't determine the class, but are a general indicator. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form !! Endings
|-
| '''vowel-stem verbs''' (''ichidan'')&lt;ref&gt;{{furi|一段動詞|いちだんどうし}}, also known as a type II verb.&lt;/ref&gt;
| All of these end with &lt;span title=&quot;(i)ru&quot;&gt;(い)る&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span title=&quot;(e)ru&quot;&gt;(え)る&lt;/span&gt;, but some with that ending are consonant stem verbs.
|-
| '''consonant-stem verbs''' (''godan'')&lt;ref&gt;{{furi|五段動詞|ごだんどうし}}, also known as a type I verb.&lt;/ref&gt;
| End in &lt;span title=&quot;u&quot;&gt;う&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span title=&quot;ku&quot;&gt;く&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span title=&quot;gu&quot;&gt;ぐ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span title=&quot;su&quot;&gt;す&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span title=&quot;tsu&quot;&gt;つ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span title=&quot;nu&quot;&gt;ぬ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span title=&quot;bu&quot;&gt;ぶ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span title=&quot;mu&quot;&gt;む&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span title=&quot;ru&quot;&gt;る&lt;/span&gt;.
|-
| ''irregular verbs'' 
| Only two verbs: &lt;span title=&quot;suru&quot;&gt;する&lt;/span&gt; (''e.'' to do) and &lt;span title=&quot;kuru&quot;&gt;{{furi|来|く|る}}&lt;/span&gt; (''e.'' to come).
|}

Different inflections can also have suffixes. These may also be verbs with their own conjugations.  Not all suffixes can be used on all verb inflections and others may only follow the verb stem.  Examples are  [[/te form/iru/|conjunctive + いる]], &lt;span title=&quot;seru&quot;&gt;せる&lt;/span&gt;・&lt;span title=&quot;saseru&quot;&gt;させる&lt;/span&gt; (causative), and &lt;span title=&quot;rareru&quot;&gt;られる&lt;/span&gt; (potential).

Ignoring the formality and the negative conjugations, the following is a list of verb conjugations
* non-past
* past
* causative
* causative-passive
* [[/te form/|conjunctive]]
* conditionals
* passive
* potential
* imperative
* volitional
* provisional

== Ichidan class ==

Vowel-stem verbs end on a full syllable (hence the term: ''vowel''-stem). In a sense, the final &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;ru&quot;&gt;る&lt;/span&gt;&quot; of the dictionary form is dropped and the respective endings just added on.

The Japanese term &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;ichidan&quot;&gt;{{furi|一|いち}}{{furi|段|だん}}&lt;/span&gt;&quot; refers to the fact that the stem ending occupies only one row in the [[Japanese/Kana Chart|kana chart]].

The following table shows a few forms of the verb &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;taberu&quot;&gt;食べる&lt;/span&gt;&quot; (&lt;span title=&quot;taberu&quot;&gt;たべる&lt;/span&gt;, ''e.'' to eat):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form !! Word
|-
| Plain present positive || &lt;span title=&quot;taberu&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;食べる&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| Plain past positive    || &lt;span title=&quot;tabeta&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;食べた&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| Plain present negative || &lt;span title=&quot;tabenai&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;食べない&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| Plain past negative    || &lt;span title=&quot;tabenakatta&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;食べなかった&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| Imperative  ||&lt;span title=&quot;tabeso&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;食べろ&lt;/span&gt; or&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span title=&quot;tabeyo&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;食べよ&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| Volitional  || &lt;span title=&quot;tabeyō&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;食べよう&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| Conjunctive || &lt;span title=&quot;tabete&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;食べて&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| Conditional || |&lt;span title=&quot;tabereba&quot; lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;食べれば&lt;/span&gt;
|}

== Godan class ==

Consonant-stem verbs end in the middle of a syllable (hence the term; ''consonant''-verb). That syllable changes depending on the form. The plain form has an {{lang|ja|う}} ''u'' sound (''&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;'', ''ts&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;'', ''r&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;'', ''k&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;'', ''g&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;'', ''b&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;'', ''m&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;'', ''s&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;''), the {{lang|ja|～ます}} ''-masu'' form has an {{lang|ja|い}} ''i'' sound (''&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'', ''ch&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'', ''r&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'', ''k&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'', ''g&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'', ''b&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'', ''m&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'', ''sh&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;''), and the negative form has an {{lang|ja|あ}} ''a'' sound (''w&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'', ''t&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'', ''r&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'', ''k&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'', ''g&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'', ''b&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'', ''m&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;'', ''s&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;''). The potential form has an {{lang|ja|え}} ''e'' sound (''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'', ''t&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'', ''r&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'', ''k&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'', ''g&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'', ''b&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'', ''m&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'', ''s&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;'') and the volitional form has an {{lang|ja|おう}} ''ō'' sound (''&lt;u&gt;ō&lt;/u&gt;'', ''t&lt;u&gt;ō&lt;/u&gt;'', ''r&lt;u&gt;ō&lt;/u&gt;'', ''k&lt;u&gt;ō&lt;/u&gt;'', ''g&lt;u&gt;ō&lt;/u&gt;'', ''b&lt;u&gt;ō&lt;/u&gt;'', ''m&lt;u&gt;ō&lt;/u&gt;'', ''s&lt;u&gt;ō&lt;/u&gt;''), so putting these together with the sounds above shows that verb conjugations follow the vowel syllabary of the Japanese character set:　あ ''a'', い ''i'', う ''u'', え ''e'' and お ''o''.

The Japanese term &quot;{{furi|五|ご}}{{furi|段|だん}}&quot; comes from the fact that the stem's last syllable spans all five rows of the [[Japanese/Kana Chart|kana chart]] in at least one form.

The following table shows a few forms of the consonant-stem verb &quot;話す&quot; (はなす ''e.'' to speak).
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form !! Word !! Row !! Syllable Morph !! Conjugation Suffix
|-
| Plain present positive || 話す        || う || || 
|-
| Plain past positive    || 話した      || い || す -&gt; し || た/った/いた/んだ
|-
| Plain present negative || 話さない    || あ || す -&gt; さ || ない
|-
| Plain past negative    || 話さなかった || あ || す -&gt; さ || なかった 
|-
|Imperative&lt;ref&gt;The plain imperative as seen above is quite rude, and its use is generally limited to close male friends or colleagues if the intent is not to insult.&lt;/ref&gt;
| 話せ || え || す -&gt; せ ||
|-
| Volitional&lt;ref&gt;The volitional indicates a presumption or suggestion on the speaker's part to do something, and in addition to being used in a few verb phrase constructions, a verb in volitional form corresponds to &quot;let's {verb}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
| 話そう || お || す -&gt; そ || う
|-
| Conjunctive || 話して || い || す -&gt; し || て/って/いて/んで
|-
| Conditional || 話せば || え || す -&gt; せ || ば
|}

The て-form (conjunctive) and past positive form of a consonant-stem verb change the root for euphony according to the last syllable of the root (example in parentheses):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! stem || て-form || past
| rowspan=10 |
! style=&quot;background: #e5e7bF;&quot; | example || style=&quot;background: #e5e7bF;&quot; | て-form || style=&quot;background: #e5e7bF;&quot; | past || style=&quot;background: #e5e7bF;&quot; | reading (meaning)
|-
| 〜う  || って || った || 買う || 買って || 買った || かう (to buy)
|-
| 〜く  || いて || いた || 書く || 書いて || 書いた ||  かく (to write)
|-
| 〜ぐ  || いで || いだ || 泳ぐ || 泳いで || 泳いだ || およぐ (to swim)
|-
| 〜す  || して || した || 話す || 話して || 話した || はなす (to speak, to talk)
|-
| 〜つ  || って || った || 勝つ || 勝って || 勝った || かつ (to win)
|-
| 〜ぶ  || んで || んだ || 学ぶ || 学んで || 学んだ || まなぶ (to study)
|-
| 〜ぬ  || んで || んだ || 死ぬ || 死んで || 死んだ || しぬ (to die)
|-
| 〜む  || んで || んだ || 佇む || 佇んで || 佇んだ || ただずむ (to stand still)
|-
| 〜る  || って || った || 去る || 去って || 去った || さる (to leave)
|}

行く (いく) (to go) has an exceptional て-form 行って (いって).

If the verb stem ends on &quot;う&quot; such as in the verb 買う(かう, ''e.'' to buy) then its negative stem becomes -わ as in 買わない (&quot;to not buy&quot;). This is because the root is treated as '''kawu''' (despite the &quot;wu&quot; syllable not existing in modern Japanese).

== Irregular verbs ==

Two common verbs do not share a conjugation pattern with any other verb. They are therefore commonly classed as &quot;irregular&quot; verbs. Formally, they are called &quot;変格&quot; (へんかく) verbs, as opposed to the regular &quot;正格&quot; (せいかく) verbs. These are &quot;する&quot; (''e.'' to do) and &quot;{{furi|来|く|る}}&quot; (''e.'' to come). The following table shows some of their conjugation forms.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form || する || 来る
|-
| Plain present positive || する || くる
|-
| Plain past positive    || した || きた
|-
| Plain present negative || しない || こない
|-
| Plain past negative    || しなかった || こなかった
|-
| Imperative  || せよ or しろ || こい
|-
| Volitional  || しよう || こよう
|-
| Conjunctive || して   || きて
|-
| Conditional || すれば || くれば
|}

Many verbs end on &quot;〜する&quot; and can be grouped in three categories:
* ''Verbalised nouns''. These are nouns which form verbs by appending &quot;〜する&quot;. Examples: {{furi|勉強|べんきょう|する}}, {{furi|注意|ちゅうい|する}}, &quot;{{furi|過労死|かろうし|する}}, {{furi|長生|ながい|きする}} and {{furi|値|あたい|する}}.
* Verbs that cannot stand alone without the &quot;する&quot; suffix. Examples: {{furi|発|はっ|する}}, {{furi|接|せっ|する}} and {{furi|達|たっ|する}}.
* Verbs that cannot stand alone, end on an &quot;ん&quot; and therefore take the ''voiced'' &quot;ずる&quot;. Examples: {{furi|存|ぞん|ずる}}, {{furi|感|かん|ずる}}, {{furi|先|さき|んずる}} and {{furi|重|おも|んずる}}. These verbs are commonly inflected the same as the ''ichidan'' forms, with &quot;ずる&quot; being replaced by &quot;じる&quot; thus: {{furi|存|ぞん|じる}}, {{furi|感|かん|じる}}, {{furi|先|さき|んじる}} and {{furi|重|おも|んじる}}.

The only commonly-used combination with &quot;来る&quot; is &quot;やってくる&quot;, meaning &quot;to come&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;やる&quot; is a common prefix with flexible meaning that implies action.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polite forms ==

The polite (or formal) forms are simple as all of the consonant-stem verbs sit in the い-line (行く→行き) and the inflections are the same for consonant- and vowel-stem verbs.

The following table shows the polite forms for &quot;行く&quot; (いく, ''e.'' to go):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form !! Word
|-
| Polite present positive || 行きます
|-
| Polite past positive    || 行きました
|-
| Polite present negative || 行きません
|-
| Polite past negative    || 行きませんでした
|-
| Polite volitional  || 行きましょう
|-
| Polite conjunctive || 行きまして&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot;&gt;The polite conjunctive and -conditional are rarely used. The plain forms are usually used in their place.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Polite conditional || 行きますれば&lt;ref name=&quot;historical&quot; /&gt;
|}

The imperative (〜ませ) is not used in formal forms except for a few polite verbs (see below).

== Other irregularities ==

A small number of verbs tend to be conjugated differently from the groups that they are normally placed in.

=== Polite language ===

The verbs below are all consonant stem verbs but conjugate differently. While the regular forms also exist, they are seldom used.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Verb !! polite present positive !! Imperative
|-
| くださる     || くださいます    || ください
|-
| なさる      || なさいます      || なさい
|-
| いらっしゃる || いらっしゃいます || いらっしゃい
|-
| おっしゃる   || おっしゃいます   || おっしゃい
|}

The conjunctive and past forms of the first two verbs, &quot;くださる&quot; and &quot;なさる&quot;, also have the alternative forms &quot;くだすって／くだすった&quot; and &quot;なすって／なすった&quot;, in addition to the normal regular conjugations &quot;くださって／くださった&quot; and &quot;なさって／なさった&quot;. These alternative forms have, however, fallen into disuse. While they are often encountered when reading texts from a few decades ago, the regular conjugations are usually used today.

The first three of the above verbs are also the only ones where the imperative form &quot;ませ&quot; of the auxiliary verb, &quot;ます&quot;, is used to add an extra level of politeness:
{{Japanese example|
: くださいませ, なさいませ, いらっしゃいませ}}

Additionally, ございます, which originally came from the now-defunct ''yodan'' (四段, ''e.'' four-row) classical Japanese verb &quot;ござる&quot;, is also used, although in modern usage, it is always used with the ます auxiliary verb ending. There is no imperative form (i.e. you cannot use ませ like above).

=== 得る ===
得る (うる/える, ''e.'' to get, or to be able to) is the only surviving ''nidan'' (二段, ''e.'' two-row) class verb in modern Japanese. It has conjugations as in the below table:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Form !! Word !! Reading
|-
|Non-past || 得る || うる／える
|-
|Past || 得た || えた
|-
|Negative non-past || 得ない || えない
|-
|Negative past || 得なかった || えなかった
|-
|Imperative || 得ろ || えろ
|-
|Volitional || 得よう || えよう
|-
|Conjunctive || 得て || えて
|-
|Conditional || 得れば || うれば
|}

&quot;得る&quot; can be read both as &quot;える&quot; in its ''terminal form'' (at the end of the sentence, or in situations such as attaching to べき). The &quot;うる&quot; reading is also used in those situations and in the ''attributive form'' (e.g. when attached to nouns). It is therefore incorrect to say &quot;えるもの&quot; as the correct form would be &quot;うるもの&quot;. The combination &quot;あり得る&quot; is normally read &quot;ありうる&quot; in the present forms. All other conjugations follow the table above.

=== Miscellaneous irregularities ===

The vowel stem verb &quot;呉れる&quot; (くれる ''e.'' ) imperative form &quot;くれ&quot; (rather than the expected &quot;くれろ&quot;). Other &quot;くれる&quot; verbs of other unrelated meanings conjugate to the usual &quot;くれろ&quot;.

The consonant stem verb &quot;ある&quot; expresses existence, but absence is expressed with the adjective &quot;ない&quot;. Note that many textbooks also treat &quot;ない&quot; as a verb. The reader may also wish to be aware that more formal &quot;ぬ&quot; negative form and its conjunctive form, &quot;ず&quot;, are still used: &quot;あらぬ&quot;/&quot;あらず&quot;.

*{{note|SummaryTable1a|a|Since the polite ～ます ''-masu'' form ends with ～す ''-su'', the polite past form mostly follows the ～す ''-su'' rules. So for example the polite form of 話す ''hanasu'' is 話します ''hanashimasu'', and the polite past form is 話しました ''hanashimashita'', but the polite negative form is 話しません ''hanashimasen''. See other examples of the polite form at the [[wikipedia:Japanese_grammar#The_copula_.28.E3.81.A0_da.29|Japanese grammar]] Wikipedia entry.}}
*{{note|SummaryTable1b|b|Since the negative ～ない ''-nai'' form ends with ～い ''-i'', any further inflection of the negative form will behave as an [[wikipedia:Japanese_equivalents_of_adjectives#i-adjectives|''i''-adjective]].

*{{note|SummaryTable1d|d}}The only exception is {{lang|ja|行く}} ''iku'' which conjugates to {{lang|ja|いって}} ''itte''.
*{{note|SummaryTable1e|e}}Not all verbs ending with {{lang|ja|いる}} ''iru'' or {{lang|ja|える}} ''eru'' are vowel stems, some are consonant stems instead like 走る ''hash&lt;u&gt;iru&lt;/u&gt;'' &quot;run&quot; and 帰る ''ka&lt;u&gt;eru&lt;/u&gt;'' &quot;return&quot;.

Newcomers are prospective members of the Wikibooks community and therefore a valuable resource. We must treat newcomers with kindness and patience&amp;mdash;nothing scares potentially valuable contributors away faster than a hostile atmosphere. Newcomers, by definition, lack knowledge about the way we do things. We were all newcomers once, and most of us were enthusiastic, but lacked knowledge of how the project worked, and how to find that information. Many of us still consider ourselves newcomers after months (or years) of contributing.

Even if you never were a typical newcomer&amp;mdash;perhaps you were just super careful to read up on everything before even making slight contributions&amp;mdash;understand that we do encourage contributors (yes, also newcomers) to [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] and keep in mind the value of others in the community. Pride for your successful contributions to Wikibooks is hardly cause for looking down on enthusiastic newcomers.

== Correcting mistakes ==
When newcomers make mistakes, try to correct them and politely point out some avenues for reading up on [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|best common practices]]. Also consider leaving a welcome note on the newcomer's [[Help:talk page|talk page]] to let them know that they are welcome here (there are some useful ones available on [[Wikibooks:Templates/User messages]]).

New contributors are often hesitant to make changes, especially major ones, such as [[WB:NPOV|NPOV]]ing and moving. Rather than being annoyed by their timidness, kindly encourage them to [[Wikibooks:Be bold|be bold in updating pages]]. Avoid hostile comments about the newcomer's ignorance. Be very careful with the wording of your edit summaries as these cannot be reworded later.

When you give advice to new contributors, tone the rhetoric down even a few notches from the usual mellow discourse that dominates Wikibooks. Try to make the newcomer feel genuinely welcome, not as though they must win your approval in order to be granted membership into an exclusive club.

== Stepping back and mentoring ==
If you find these frustrating, don't correct them and just ''let it pass''. Newcomers that stick around are usually the most diligent in hunting down all their early mistakes once they get to know the project. The best way to stop that is to drive them away before they learn.

Remember that writing a book is hard to do right. There are going to be a number of experiments that go way beyond even just learning how to edit. Newcomers need a ''mentor'' far more than a ''critic''.  If you see common mistakes being made, instead of complaining about recurring issues, consider supplementing or improving [[Help:Contents|our documentation]] for future newcomers; help by making it more accessible and point newcomers to it.

== Final thoughts ==
Stay on the safe side by always assuming that newcomers sincerely want to contribute positively (a fair assumption since most do). Just because they do not know much about our standard editing practices doesn't mean they aren't willing to learn. Give them a chance!

== Welcome committee ==
Do we have a wikibooks-specific
[[Welcoming committee]]
something like
[[w:Wikipedia:Welcoming_committee]]
set up at Wikibooks already?
Is there a better place to discuss adapting the
([[w:Wikipedia:Standard_user_greeting]])
for Wikibooks?
I see we already have a standardized welcome message:
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:anon}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
(See {{tl|welcome}} and {{tl|anon}} for details).
----
(copied from [[w:Wikipedia:Welcoming_committee]])

For quick welcomes, you can use {{tl|welcome}}, or your own version of that template. If you do, use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcome}}, not just {{welcome}}.&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Remember that doing this is less personal; it's a bit like handing someone a brochure instead of talking to them. As an alternative, you can use a cut-and-paste greeting, like [[w:User:Isomorphic/newuser|this one]].  That way you can avoid retyping generic text, but you can easily add a sentence or two that personalize it for the specific user you're greeting.

The greetings messages should be placed on the user's [[Wikipedia:talk page|talk page]], not their [[Wikipedia:user page|user page]], so that they will get the &quot;You have new messages&quot; box.

For anonymous IPs that you would like to suggest they get a user name, you can use either {{tl|welcomeip}} (which requires your user name as a parameter) or {{tl|anon}}.

NPOV ('''N'''eutral '''P'''oint '''O'''f '''V'''iew) content, is one that has been written without advocating a particular viewpoint on a subjective issue. This is especially important when dealing with controversial issues. In a neutral representation, the content is constructed in such a way none of the pertinent differing points of view are prominently presented. Wikibooks content needs to be based in facts not falsehoods, opinions or judgments.

&quot;Neutral point of view&quot; should not be confused with &quot;point of view espoused by an international body such as the United Nations&quot;; writing in NPOV style requires recognizing that even widely held or widely respected points of view are not necessarily all-encompassing.

== Tagging non-NPOV content ==
Modules under '''[[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|NPOV]] dispute''' are listed in [[:Category:NPOV disputes]]. An NPOV label not only indicates that the content is perceived as biased (not conforming to a ''neutral point of view'') by one or more Wikibookians, but that consensus on the expressed views is lacking. Should consensus be reached, the content is fixed or deleted.

If you find content that you think is biased, you can add {{tl|npov}} to the top of the page and leave a note with your rationale on the talk page. The label is meant to indicate that a discussion is ongoing, and hence that the module contents are disputed and volatile.

== Resolving NPOV disputes ==
Wikibooks is best served by trying to present a fair, neutral description of the facts — among which are the facts that various interpretations and points of view exist (of course, there are limits to what POVs are considered worth mentioning, which can be an area of conflict). Those criticizing content as biased, often do so on grounds that viewpoints are expressed as facts. In this case, citing sources to back these facts should solve the dispute.

There may also be a disagreement over what the facts represent. It should be noted that ''factual'' statements do not equal ''neutral'' statements.  Neutrality implies presenting competing versions fairly.  Personal conviction has ''no relevance''.  If a significant number of other interested parties ''really does'' disagree with us, no matter how wrong we think they are, the discussion will be recast as a fair presentation of the dispute between the parties.

Wording (including page titles), selective use of viewpoints or undue weight given to one are also versions of bias. This may be a harmless case of a book being still in progress, or limited expertise on the behalf of current contributors. Adding the missing content or making a note of it (for example in the {{tl|npov}} template) would constitute an acceptable interim solution.

If content that you think is objective has been tagged with the template message, '''don't panic'''. Views differ, and Wikibooks caters to everyone. As long as the content complies with [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] and can be backed by sources, there should be a way to represent it in a way that is fair to all sides. It may be tricky and compromises are probably needed, but it should be manageable.  Keep in mind that no edit is irreversible.  All versions are in the page history. [[WB:CIVIL|Be civil]] and [[WB:AGF|assume good faith]].

== A way of dealing with NPOV disputes ==

If there are biased points of view, each with valid points, perhaps it would be instructive to let the reader decide by presenting all points of view and allowing the reader to evaluate the merits of each case. Absorption of multiple valid points of view can be most instructive in my understanding, if each point of view is presented with rational thought, clear reasoning, and careful evidence.

== Make this page a unstable version of [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]] ==
I have some small simplification edits to the text, if no one objects I will attempt to further determine what has been said about the subject on project see if this text diverges from what is stated on the above source of the text and move it into a unstable branch of the [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]] policy (or similar action).  As it is its partial duplicating the policy (even if offers a consistent and more actual approach to the issue).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:45, 23 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

If a Wikibooks [[WB:MODULE|module]] links to this page, it is because someone is concerned that the module may be significantly inaccurate. You can use the following wiki-code to add such a header:

: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{disputed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The accuracy of an module may be a cause for concern if:
* It contains a lot of unlikely information, without providing references.
* It contains information which is particularly difficult to verify.
* In, for example, a long list, some errors have been found, suggesting that the list as a whole may need further checking.
* It has been written by a user who is known to write inaccurately on the topic.

If you come across a page with an accuracy dispute, the best way to solve the problem is to [[w:peer review|peer review]] the content, and check whether it's inaccurate. Once you've checked, edit the page to remove the header, and put something like the following in your [[WB:ES|edit summary]]:

: Verified module—removed accuracy dispute

Don't remove accuracy disputes simply because the material ''looks'' reasonable: please take the time to properly verify it. Please also add to the module any sources you used to verify the information in it.

== Transclude subpages? ==
I think we should transclude the subpage FAQs into one massive one with appropriate subsections.

==What is a wiki?==
A [[w:Wiki|wiki]] is a [[w:collaborative software|collaborative collection]] of interlinked open content web pages, all of which can be visited and edited by anyone at ''any'' time. You could even edit this page by clicking the &quot;edit&quot; link, the third tab at the very top of this page, or edit only a section by clicking on &quot;[edit]&quot; to its right. If you don't have anything to add or correct on this page and you just want to see how it works, try making some test edits in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|Sandbox]]. See [[w:Wiki|wiki]] and the [[Help:FAQ/Editing|Editing FAQ]] for more on wikis and editing.

==What is Wikibooks?==
Wikibooks is a project to produce a new kind of instructional resource that is comprehensive and [[w:free content|free]]. See [[Wikibooks:Welcome]] for more information.

==What are the aims of Wikibooks?==
Wikibooks's goal is to create a free instructional resource—indeed, the largest instructional resource in history, both in terms of breadth and depth, to become a reliable resource. It's an ambitious goal which will probably take many years to achieve.

==How did Wikibooks start?==
Wikibooks was started on July 10, 2003 as a sister project to [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]]. It was opened in response to a request by Wikipedia user Karl Wick for a place to start building open-content textbooks. Longtime Wikipedia contributor Daniel Mayer helped Karl advocate for starting such a project, and once the project was started, he helped set it up and coined the name &quot;Wikibooks&quot; and registered the domain names for the project. Soon the focus of the project was expanded to include any book resource that may be used in the classroom. This does not include encyclopedias, dictionaries or quote books, since there are specific [[w:Wikimedia|Wikimedia]] projects for those (see next FAQ entry).

==Who owns Wikibooks?== 
feelinɡ  ɡood   leran     about 
Wikibooks is managed by a non-profit parent organization, [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]], which also manages the operation of similar projects like [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] (a wiki encyclopedia), [[w:Wiktionary|Wiktionary]] (a wiki dictionary), and [[w:Wikiquote|Wikiquote]] (a wiki quote book), and owns all 

                            domain names  and servers that the Wikimedia projects run on. [[w:Bomis|Bomis]], Inc, a company mostly owned by [[w:User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]], c






















 are released by their authors under the [[WB:GFDL|GNU Free Documentation License]]; this means they are [[w:open content|open content]] and may be reproduced freely under the terms of the license. See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|Copyrights]] and [[Help:FAQ/Readers|Readers' FAQ]] for information on how you can use Wikibooks content.

It is important to note that the '''content''' of Wikibooks is not owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, but instead individually owned by each of the contributing authors, usually noted on the history tab on each page.  A notable exception to this is that content found elsewhere may be added here that has been either given copyright clearance by the original author or is already in the public domain.  In these cases, a responsible Wikibook contributor would note that in the discussion pages of the module.

==Who is responsible for pages on Wikibooks?==
[[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookians]]. Wikibooks is a [[w:collaborative|collaborative]] endeavor. Many people have contributed to different parts of this project, and anyone can do so, including you. All you need is to know [[Wikibooks:How to edit a page|how to edit a page]], and have some knowledge you want to share.

You can learn who is responsible for the most recent versions of any given page by clicking on the &quot;Page history&quot; link. For example, you can look at the full history of this FAQ [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Help:FAQ/Overview&amp;action=history just by clicking here]. You can also see who is most responsible for a particular Wikibook by reading that book's &quot;authors&quot; page (if it has one). If you spot an error in the latest revision of an module you are highly encouraged to [[Wikibooks:Be bold|be bold]] and correct it. This practice is one of the basic review mechanisms that maintains the reliability of this instructional resource.

If you are uncertain or find the wording confusing, quote the material on the associated [[Wikibooks:Talk page|talk page]] and leave a question for the next person. This helps eliminate errors, inaccuracies or misleading wording more quickly and is highly appreciated by the community.

==What software is used to run Wikibooks?==
:Wikibooks and its sister [[w:Wikimedia|Wikimedia]] projects all use the [[m:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] software. See [[mw:Installation|Installing MediaWiki]] for information on what's required to run mediawiki.

==How about the hardware?==
:See [[m:Wikimedia servers|Wikimedia servers]].

==How do I report bugs or suggest new features?==
[[mediazilla:|MediaZilla]] is used by mediawiki software developers to keep track of [[w:software bug|software bug]]s and feature requests. For more information, see [[w:WP:BUGS|bug reports and feature requests]]. If you don't report bugs or feature requests, then it will probably never be fixed or implemented. You can discuss feature ideas that would benefit Wikibooks with other Wikibookians at [[WB:PROPOSALS|proposals reading room]].

==What kind of [[w:markup language|markup language]] does Wikibooks use?==
:Wikibooks uses a very simple markup based on [[w:UseModWiki|UseModWiki]]. For more details, see [[Wikibooks:How does one edit a page]].

== Can you tell me anything about the Wikibooks logo? ==
More information about the logo and versions of it are best found at [[Meta:Wikibooks/Logo]].

== How is Wikibooks backed up? Could an accident destroy everything? ==
Database dumps are made periodically. Anyone can [[Help:Database download|store their own copies]].

==Is it possible to download the contents of Wikibooks?==
:Yes, the whole contents of Wikibooks can be downloaded.  See [[Help:database download]].

:Note that downloading the database dumps is '''much''' preferred over trying to spider the entire site. Spidering the site will take you much longer, and puts a lot of load on the Wikimedia server (especially if you ignore our [http://www.Wikibooks.org/robots.txt robots.txt] and spider over billions of combinations of diffs and whatnot). Heavy spidering can lead to your spider, or your IP, being barred with prejudice from access to the site. Legitimate spiders (for instance search engine indexers) are encouraged to wait about a minute between requests, follow the robots.txt, and if possible only work during less loaded hours (2:00-14:00 UTC is the lighter half of the day).

== Can I get wiki books on paper? ==
You are welcome to print out your own copy.
See [[Using Wikibooks/The Wikibooks Reader/Printing A Wikibook]] for tips.

==How can I contact the project by email?==
Given the massively collaborative nature of the project, there's no official email address. If you're looking for a project leader, it would be best to get in contact with [[w:User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] ([mailto:jwales@bomis.com jwales at bomis.com]). Otherwise, see the next question.  Note that if you want a faster response and from active participants in the project, you might want to send the e-mail to the mailing list.  You can also send an e-mail directly to [[Wikibooks:Administrators|some active Administrators]] through the web-based e-mail form.  Administrators are usually quite active and can be considered some of the project leaders.

==Where can I talk about Wikibooks with others?==
There are some [[Wikibooks:Mailing lists|mailing lists]], and also the [http://meta.wikipedia.com Meta-Wiki]. If you want to communicate with a specific user, leave a message on their talk page; you can find a list of personal pages (and link to your own) at the [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookians]] list (this list is by no means complete). Many Wikibookians have also registered their email addresses, which you can use by clicking the &quot;Email this user&quot; link from the personal pages. Finally, if you're looking to talk about a specific module or page, the best place to put your comments is on that page's Talk page. Use the ''discuss this page'' link in any module to get to the talk page. Every page has a talk page, even this one, so there is always a way to discuss the content with others. See also: [[Wikibooks:Contact us]]

== How should I link to Wikibooks? ==
We don't require you to do so in any particular way. Please use your own best judgment.

==Should I create an account? Can't I just edit anonymously?==
Users with account names enjoy several benefits, among them is the positive reputation that goes with quality work. Editors with an established history are respected especially with regard to neutralising module disputes. This is not to say there is a hierarchy ''per se''—though there are editors with administrative abilities (see [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]), these are approved by the community, and the goal of most Wikibookians is to maintain that [[w:democracy|democracy]], albeit with a little [[w:anarchy|anarchy]], remains the supreme power on Wikibooks. Also, Wikibookians with user names are in a sense ''more'' anonymous than contributors that are not logged in: while everyone can see the [[w:IP address|IP address]] of a user who did not log in when they edited, only server administrators can find the IP of a logged-in user. So if you're concerned about privacy and anonymity, you may prefer to create a username for yourself in order to hide your IP. See also [[WB:LOGIN|How to log in]].

== Is there any legal implications in allowing anyone to edit? Is it safe? ==
In practice, illegal material gets removed from active wikis quite quickly. See [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiAndIllegalMaterial this discussion] on [[w:Ward's Wiki|Ward's Wiki]] for more thoughts.

== I have a problem not on this list, where do I go? ==
: If you cannot find answers to your specific technical problems in this FAQ, try asking in the [[WB:TECH|technical reading room]].

== Problematic edition by anonymous user ==

Hey people, please take a look at the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikibooks:Overview_FAQ&amp;oldid=48177 new question added] by IP 63.229.84.90; I think this question should be placed on talk page, because it's a (weird) comment about our goals here, not a FAQ.

==Why should I expect Wikibooks to succeed?==
:If a text book is by popular definition a book you only read because it is required, why should Wikibooks garner sufficient reader/editor interest to succeed?  People want to know how to size the pipes in their sprinkler system, not learn about fluid mechanics or hydraulics engineering.  They want to figure how much they have to save to retire at age 50, not learn about mathematics.  But Wikibooks needs reader-editors to succeed.  So why should I expect it to succeed?

== text from GNU sites ie Wikipedia ==

I've been searching around to no avail, so I'll just breakdown and throw this out there. Whats the policy on importing work from Wikipedia into Wikibooks? Are there any special steps that need to be considered? [[User:RichMac|RichMac]] 03:59, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

==How do I search Wikibooks?==
Use [[Special:Search]] or use the search box in the sidebar. See [[Help:Navigating#Searching]] for more.

You can also use Google to search Wikibooks by [http://www.google.com/custom?sa=Google+Search&amp;domains=wikibooks.org&amp;sitesearch=Wikibooks.org following this link]. Google's index will, however, not be up to date.

== Where can I request new entries? ==
After you've exhausted [[WB:SEARCH|searching]] for the content, you may ask for more help in locating it in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance|assistance reading room]], or add an entry to [[Wikibooks:Requested books]].

==What license does Wikibooks use for contents?==
The text of each page is covered by at least the [[WB:GFDL|GNU Free Documentation License]]. Some contents (notably images and other media files) may use compatible licenses for which you will need to check the terms. These may be public domain, use a copyleft license like Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike, or are used under [[w:fair use|fair use]] terms.

See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] and [[Wikibooks:Media]] for more.

==How do I cite a Wikibooks module?==
Cite it as you would any other web page in accordance with the normal citation practice the publication you are submitting the paper to follows. Because Wikibooks modules are constantly edited, you should include the URL for the specific version of the module you accessed. You can determine this URL by clicking the &quot;Page history&quot; link and clicking on the date of the version you want (likely the one at the top). The URL of the resulting page is a permanent link back to that version no matter what changes are made afterwards. Citing the individual authors is not necessary.

== How do I print a wikibook? ==
Newer browsers will be able to access the &quot;''print stylesheet''&quot; which removes the Wikibooks interface and some colors. Try a print preview (if your browser has this function) to see how it will print.

Alternatively, you can click the &quot;printable version&quot; link in the toolbox at the bottom of the menu on your left.

Some books provide special [[Help:Print versions|print versions]].

== Can I mirror Wikibooks on my website? ==
You can use, copy, redistribute, modify or mirror as much as you wish, as long as you follow the provisions of the GNU Free Documentation License and the licenses of any images or media you use.

See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]], and [[Wikibooks:Media]].

== Can I get Wikibooks on CD, or download it for offline use? ==
There are no CDs currently available. You can however [[Help:Database download|download the database]]. Some books, furthermore, have [[Help:Print versions|print versions]].

== Am I required to use the GFDL for my site if I quote Wikibooks? ==
Citing Wikibooks is sufficient if you're quoting small bits (under the fair use doctrine). If you wish to quote substantial portions of it, you may wish to consult with a lawyer as it may constitute a derivative work. You are welcome to drop by the [[Wikibooks:Reading room]] to seek the opinion of Wikibookians. We're usually a good bunch and try not to bite. :-D

==How do you know if information is correct?==
As anyone can edit any module, it is of course possible for biased, out-of-date or incorrect information to be posted. However, because there are so many other people reading the modules and monitoring contributions using the [[WB:RC|Recent Changes]] page, incorrect information is usually put right quickly. Thus the overall accuracy of this instructional resource is improving all the time as it attracts more and more contributors. You are encouraged to help by correcting modules and passing on your own knowledge.

== Is there any peer-review process to validate included information? ==
In general, Wikibooks depends on contributors like you to fix any incorrect information, though Wikibooks does have a [[WB:REVIEW|system to review page revisions]]. Content should generally be easy to verify by checking other sources or through being able to reproduce similar results yourself.

== Download articles ==

The question '''Can I get Wikibooks on CD, or download it for offline use?''' really needs a better answer.  I can think of several textbooks that I have spent well over a hundred hours reading.  That is an insane amount of time to spend online for something that is probabably about 100 KB in length (a sub minute download time).  Downloading the entire database and setting up a mysql database, a http server, php ... is a huge overkill for one book.  I should be able to choose a book, download a zip or pdf of the html and then browse at my leisure later.  Many people who use these books will want to not pay per minute connection fees or will want to use it on their laptop away from a network connection.  I personally consider wikibooks useless from a reader's point of view until there is someway to download '''One''' text book and read it later offline.  Ditto for being able to print one text book. --Anon

:That requires software that has not been coded yet. But all that is planned. It will be some time before we have our first nearly complete book anyway so this isn't a pressing issue ''right now''. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 08:48, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::Has this question been re-examined yet? There are now several books that are more or less complete, and at the very least, those should be packaged up and be made available for download in a nice pdf (or whatever, ps if it floats one's boat). This could be done manually, but I don't see why there couldn't be a simple script to convert the wiki markup into LaTeX (add in all the nicities like a chapter index and such automatically), then use that to generate both a PDF and HTML document. Zip those up, upload them to the site, and there you go. Run that once a day or so, and things should be up to date as well. --[[User:Kobold|Kish]] 08:10, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:::Two years after the beginning of this discussion, there seems to be still no way to get a PDF/LaTex/whatever file containing a wikibook. Is it still planned or should we forget about that and remain with reduced usability for these books? -- 20 Jul 2005

: Until one can download a book this site is really pretty useless ''as a &quot;book site&quot;'' compared to old-fashioned sites.  Other book-like documents, even when split up in multiple pages, can usually be downloaded somehow - e.g. with wget of a directory and its subdirectores.  Text here can be read on-line, but ''not'' conveniently as books which is what the site claims to provide.  For authors to &quot;prepare a print version&quot; or whatever isn't very good either since that will presumably become outdated.  Asking people do download the whole site doesn' scale well either, even if you get it to work without needing to run SQL and whatnot.  My guess is that however much work it is, you need to reorganize so each book resides in its own directory.  That way wiki pages get auto-sorted into their correct book. [[User:129.240.186.42|129.240.186.42]] 13:31, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

Related to the above discussion, the answer to '''How do I print a wikibook?''' is not really very helpful for printing a whole book. Nearly every book is broken up into separate URLs, which means printing each URL separately. Obviously this isn't the end of the world, but it's not exactly user-friendly either. - [[User:Qaphsiel|Qaphsiel]] 19:58, 3 October 2005 (UTC)


=== Possible replacement ===

I have to say, as a long time &quot;linux&quot; user, I am truly horrified by that section on downloading a wikibook. First off, it seems like fully half of it is involved in setting up a directory in the root directory (bad bad bad bad!) and then in ''undoing'' it rather then simply create the directory in one's home directory in the first place and never have to worry about permissions and ownership thereafter; then it goes on to suggest that you should manually download each and every HTML page (badly!) and then cluelessly explains about a quoting error (which must then immediately be rectified). This last line just makes me want to wail in agony and tear out my eyes: &quot;You can place a new item on yor dektop for your wikibook. To do this you hit the right mouse key on a free space of your desktop frame. Choose New , File and Link to (URL). As the URL adress just put in /wiki/nameofthebook.&quot;

Here's a replacement, dependent on having wget installed.
 cd ; mkdir wikibooks/ ; mkdir wikibooks/NAME_OF_WIKIBOOK/ &amp;&amp; cd wikibooks/NAME_OF_WIKIBOOK/ &amp;&amp; mkdir en.wikibooks.org &amp;&amp; touch en.wikibooks.org/robots.txt  &amp;&amp; wget -kp --recursive --html-extension -l 2 --no-clobber -np -- http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/NAME_OF_WIKIBOOK &amp;&amp; cp -r en.wikibooks.org/wiki/NAME_OF_WIKIBOOK/* en.wikibooks.org/ &amp;&amp; rm -rf en.wikibooks.org/wiki

One could script this as well. The body of the script would be:
 cd ; mkdir wikibooks/ ; mkdir wikibooks/$1/ ; cd wikibooks/$1/ &amp;&amp; mkdir en.wikibooks.org &amp;&amp; touch en.wikibooks.org/robots.txt  &amp;&amp; wget -kp --recursive --html-extension -l 2 --no-clobber -np -- http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/$1 &amp;&amp; cp -r en.wikibooks.org/wiki/$1/* en.wikibooks.org/ &amp;&amp; rm -rf en.wikibooks.org/wiki
and then a 
 chmod +x script-name.sh ; sh script-name.sh NAME_OF_WIKIBOOK 

(This is a bit baroque, so I'll explain; the mkdir and touch are necessary so that the robots.txt file will exist before wget begins its download with the --no-clobber option forcing it to accept our fake blank robots.txt and ignore the real one on wikibooks which would tell wget to ''not'' do any recursive downloads. Of course, that's exactly what we want to do. The wget invocation does a two-level recursive download which appends .html to all HTML files and downloads all prerequisites for viewing a file while rewriting all URL links to point to the local copy if possible. However, a two-level recursive download has the major defect that many many files under the en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ will be downloaded but not needed! However, if you change &quot;-l 2&quot; to the much faster and fewer downloads of &quot;-l 1&quot;, then any subdirectories would fail to be downloaded. For example, in the Haskell book, -l 1 would not download [[Haskell/Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours]].) 

Obviously, some testing would be good. This leaves a mess in the en.wikibook.org subdirectory and so far I've only tested it on Bash and my system. --[[User:Marudubshinki|maru]]  [[User talk:Marudubshinki|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki|contribs]] 03:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

I started a new link: Polish Idioms and Expressions. But I need someone else to write in it! Please, be a Polish person =) or someone who speaks Polish REALLY fluently :-) Dziewcyna Gwiazda

I'm from Poland and I can help you. Just say, what do you want?

----

Hi Dziewcyna Gwiazda, some of my friends on pl.wikipedia and other online forums might well enjoy making a list of boud-ish idioms and expressions in Polish ;), before they get lost because i forget my old errors... But that would be too cult-ish. [[User:Boud|Boud]] 13:49, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)

There is an idiomatic expression in Polish which literally translates into English as: ''&quot;He is from Pipiduvec.&quot;'' Pipiduvec (sp.?) is a mythical town where only &quot;stupid people&quot; live, so the expression means, ''&quot;He is stupid,&quot;'' or ''&quot;he is an idiot.&quot;''  Do you know this expression?

: As far as I know (I'm native speaker but not a linguist), it's not exactly like that. &quot;pipidówa&quot; (pipi-doova) is a term for a small, primitive village. You could say &quot;damn, what a ''pipidówa'', they don't even have a shop here&quot;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:04, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

== Naming convention change ==

Would anyone have something agains changing naming convention from archaic colon style to new slash style ([[Polish:Introductions]] would become [[Polish/Introductions]])? This change would provide readers with backlinks to the table of contents on top of every chapter.

This change can be done by a bot, with no need to edit anything manually. I just need consensus of book contributors. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:12, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

== Forum ==

If this is a book for the people who want to learn Polish, maybe it would be a good idea to create a sister-forum to this book? I mean, to create a forum where people who learn Polish could ask questions and some netives (like me) would answer them?

== Too focused in grammar ==

Hello. I am writing the polish wikibook in portuguese language and I would just like to say to the english writers that this course is too focused in grammar. A beginners course should have a more vocabulary then grammar. Take a look at the German wikibook for some inspiration. thanks --[[Special:Contributions/201.81.159.119|201.81.159.119]] ([[User talk:201.81.159.119|talk]]) 01:17, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

== Babelprog ==

Suppose I know how to do something in one language, and I want to translate it to another language. For example, I know how to sprintf in C, and I want to do the same in Haskell. Or I know lapply in R and I want to do it in Visual Basic. Is there any babelfish-like tool that could be used to help me? [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] 14:20, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

There exists a few specific translation tools:

* &quot;f2c&quot; ([[w:f2c]]), which translates from Fortran77 to the C programming language.
* there are several [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22pascal+to+C%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search Pascal to C/C++] translaters.
* http://jython.org/ lets you write code in Python and run it on a Java virtual machine.

Please add to this list.
While translating from one programming language to another is much easier than natural-language translation, I imagine that translation into a completely different language family ( &quot;imperative&quot; C to &quot;functional&quot; Haskell) is much more difficult than the above same-family imperative-to-imperative translations.

Is there a better place for this list of translation tools somewhere in this book on programming?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 20:33, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

BTW, I have just found an interesting resource: [http://merd.sourceforge.net/pixel/language-study/syntax-across-languages/Mthmt.html http://merd.sourceforge.net/pixel/language-study/syntax-across-languages/Mthmt.html].

== Tables ==
I have found 2 tables that are almost identical, the task of maintaining the information on both is very hard, they should be merged (as one has 2 more rows) and a template should be elaborated so it will be easier to extend and update. I will get to it as time allows but if someone could take a shot at it, please do... txs.&lt;br&gt;
[[Computer programming/Language concepts]]  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:28, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

:Yeah, splitting the tables was my fault.  I wanted to avoid the kind of sprawl that made this book feel really mediocre and unhelpful.  This was probably not the best way to go about it, but to get an idea, compare this [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_programming&amp;oldid=571075 hyper-sprawl version] with its [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_programming&amp;oldid=841594 leaner and meaner counterpart].  Still not quite lean and mean enough.  I think that if we want to make this book halfway decent, we might need some radical surgery.  The book isn't any good if it's just everybody trying to squeeze in their favourite thing (i'm probably guilty of that too).  We need to cut and steer.  For example, could you live with the tables just being a subpage and not on the front page?  Or how about a show/hide link?  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 05:44, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

:I started updating the Table with some pages and noticed that the template didn't have the Perl section in so I updated it. One problem however is the [[Visual Basic .NET]] stuff. Doesn't seem to want to link to the pages no matter what I enter. The heading works fine just not the individual pages. Anyone got any ideas??

== it is useful to have a strong programming culture ==

In the present text, there is this awkward, although very understandable phrase &quot;...but it is useful to have a strong programming culture.&quot; I would assume this means '' '''cultural''' '', as in having a strong background of knowledge and or experience in programming, perhaps including pseudo-code, logic, etc... 
From Wikipedia entry [[culture]]: ...anthropologists commonly use the term &quot;culture&quot; to refer to the universal human capacity and activities to classify, codify and communicate their experiences symbolically.
Unfortunately as used as a noun here- it sounds analogous to &quot;culture&quot; as in a &quot;bacterial culture.&quot; he-heh!  And it may be a teleogy- what is a &quot;programming culture&quot; other than a culture/climate that consists of programmers programming?  I am afraid to replace the word as it might have common usage in the programming community that I am unaware of.???  There are surely better ways to phrase the usefulness of learning more than one computer language. [[User:Cuvtixo|Cuvtixo]] ([[User talk:Cuvtixo|talk]]) 16:03, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

:Probably '''background''' ?!? it seems at least on that phrase to make better sense (as I didn't search the context where it is being used), go ahead and change it... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:49, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Development platforms ==

This article seems to be specificall about programming on the personal computer.  Although there are some suggestions about including how to program FOR another device (cell phone, mainframe, etc) ON a personal computer, this is significantly different from programming directly from a terminal on a VAX or mainframe, for example. I think there should be some specific information about what a development environment on a PC (IDE) is, what target platforms one can program for.  I can't imagine that there isn't some public domain printed material that has a more inclusive overview of all electronic computer programming and what programming languages are.

Some mention of scientific calculators, for example, and programming in languages like FORTH and assembler for Boot ROMs would be a lot more informative [[User:Cuvtixo|Cuvtixo]] ([[User talk:Cuvtixo|talk]]) 22:10, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== book name ==

I see that recently this book was renamed from &quot;Computer programming&quot; (&quot;sentence casing like Wikipedia does&quot;) to &quot;Computer Programming&quot; (&quot;title casing like books often do&quot;).

Currently the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] proposed guideline and the [[Wikibooks:Local manuals of style]] essay both specifically mention both of these styles as perfectly acceptable for a WikiBook.

Is there a reason to prefer one over the other for this specific book?
(Reasons to prefer one over the other, in general, should be discussed in the talk pages of the above guidelines).

If ever change the name of this book again, what name would you prefer?
Perhaps a more specific name, such as &quot;Comparing Computer Programming Languages&quot;?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 08:44, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

:I have been using (the casing) &quot;Computer programming&quot; for categories and &quot;Computer Programming&quot; for WIkibooks as to avoid commissions in general categories and book categories, that is &quot;Computer Programming&quot; as a Wikibook can have it's own category and coexist with &quot;Computer programming&quot; as a general category were various Wikibooks belong (in realty we are using &quot;Programming&quot;), hope that this helps and can be used to come up with a more consistent manual of style...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:56, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

== merge ==
I suggest merging the near-stub book [[The Complete Programming FAQ]] into a section of [[Computer Programming]].
Both seem to have the same scope -- a general overview of all programming languages, but not an in-depth tutorial on how to learn any one of them.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 14:03, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

:It seems logical, the [[The Complete Programming FAQ]] has no real structure and no defined scope...
:One thing that the outcome of the VfD indicated is that people have been moving/deleting content out of this book in place of trascluding or reusing it. It seems without giving any attribution to the source book. If I had the time I would also examine all programming books and rebuild this book with the generalist/conceptual information...    --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:37, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

== Programming skills ==

I am an old programmar. I am not sure how to go about it, but programming is mostly language independent. I learned machine code first. Then assembly. Coded more in assembly then high level languages. I can say however that I havn't coded in a high level language in which I havn't written a compiler.

The two most basic constructs can be explained and shown in many languages.

The simplest is a list of instructions. A linear construct. Steps executed in sequence.

Step 1, Do a.
Step 2, Do b.
Step 3, Do c.

A loop is a circular construct directing that something is to be repeated.

Step 1, Do a
Step 2, Do b
Step 3, Do c
Step 4, Go back to Step 1

Conditional constructs. Conditional loops.
Exceptions. Interupts. Modules and linkers. Etc. 

I have written metacompilers. One used to write a COBOL compiler. A metacompiler grammar rule. Illustrates some constructs.

 expr = term $(('+':ADD|'-':SUB) term!2);

The above metacompiler rule generates an expr function that returns success or failure. It Illustrates the two basic constructs above. The first instruction is to call the term function that returns a boolean value (success or failure). If successful the remaining is a loop. This example is far more advanced than the two basics above. Thing is that a declarative language may be seen as or in terms of general concepts. We have linear, circular, conditional,  and subroutines in the one line rule above.

The basic programming concepts are in all general purpose programming languages. Maybe because when I started programming, assembly was common. I learned machine code for many computers. LGP-30 machine code, IBM 1400 autocoder assembly, Honeywell H-200 Easycoder. As well as the H-1200, H-3200 and Honeywell 800 and 8200. DEC-10 macro 10, PDP-11 and most all micro processors.

My point is that if you can really program you can do it in any programming language.

== Programming:C Contributor style guide and discussion ==

I've trimmed the outline here. Specific details such as if, for statements and so on should go under their parent article. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:56, 20 Aug 2003 (UTC)

I think lots of work needs to be done in reorganizing the Beginning C section. The variables section needs to be reorganized quite a bit, and I think the compilation page should go away. [[User:Thunderbunny|Thunderbunny]] 22:53, 13 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::: i meant do we need a separated chapter for that? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 17:01, 28 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Pages should be limited to the context of the title, for example the &quot;Programming:C&quot; page should be restricted to the language itself: the history of the language is appropriate, the tutorial is not.  Anything that isn't universally &quot;the C language&quot; should be relocated to the appropriate page.

Additionally, C programs are not limited to unix environments.

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 04:15, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

----
Hi there,

Let me start by saying that from what I have seen so far, I like this book very much. So much so, that I recommended it be featured on the front page after some polishing, as an example of what a textbook should look like.

However, there is one thing that seems to be severely lacking to me. In the introduction of this book, it is written: &quot;This book is intended to teach C programming, from beginning to advanced.&quot; This would seem to indicate to me that this is a book that teaches you how to program in C. However, from what I have seen so far, this is more like a reference manual for the C language. What's lacking is a C tutorial, something that explains concepts to me by letting me code small programs, and compile and test them. Is this intentional? 

I am not a coder myself, I cannot fill in perceived gaps in this manual, I am afraid.--[[User:Branko|Branko]] 17:26, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:Perhaps there should be seperate tutorial and reference books?
----
I completely agree, and would like to add that some kind of assumptions need to be made about the user's level of programming experience and then &lt;i&gt;standardised throughout&lt;/i&gt; the book. I found it difficult to understand what I was expected to know reading this book. Though it supposedly takes you &quot;from beginning to advanced&quot;, I found that each chapter appears completely disconnected and independant of every other chapter. While some assume you don't know things that have already been covered, others seem far advanced to any previous chapters (e.g. the libraries section, which utterly confused me after a somewhat pleasent introduction to functions in C).

:Ok, I think this should be a high priority issue as the book in its present state is half unusable to both beginners and advanced coders. How about divide it to two parts: I Basics (intro to programming languages in general), II Advanced (C-specific topics and other advanced stuff: scopes, idioms, nothing platform-dependent though), III Appendix (C-keywords, precedence tables, ASCII charts etc.)? [[User:Epikuros|Epikuros]] 13:24, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Perhaps change history section a bit ==

I think the history section is slightly misleading, slightly innacurate and slightly inappropriate.

- The advent of the solid state era at Bell Labs is irrelevant to the software research done there. Computing (FotranAlgol etc) was developed on thermionic equipment, and the advent of C was on machines decades later. There is no direct link between the two. More important and germane would be the research done there by Shannon on encoding and information theory around 1950. C could have happened without solid satate, but not without information theory.

- The lineage from Fortran is innacurate. Algol weas created as a reaction to the multiplicity Fortran and all of the other high level languages at the time (there were many). Fortran was the most popular, but this &quot;begat&quot; is misleading. In the letter from the GAMM  committee on the higher level lanugage, written after a tour of America in 1957:
''&quot;We have endeavored from the beginning to avoid the possibility of  deviations from existing earlier proposals (Rutishauser 1951, FORTRAN, partly also PACT). Guided by tbe news and reports that Bauer and Bottenbruch have brought back from America, we have decided that our hitherto existing proposals also largely agree structurally with Perlis' IT language and the Remington-Rand Math-Matic. This agreement is most striking with Math-Matic, the most recent of the listed proposals.&quot;'' (cited in Bemer 1969)

This passage is important not only because of its explicit distancing from Fortran as a sole solution, but also of its mention of the many other language systems - including some excellent Eurpoean ones - that existed at the time.



- it is inappropriate in that ignores the rich tradition of programming language research being done at Bell in the period - notable languages are

1955 Wolontis-Bell Interpreter

1955 L3

1958 L2

1959 Bell SAP

1959 Macro SAP

1961 Music

1962 SNOBOL

1962 SCL

1963 ALPAKA

1963 ALPAK

1963 L6

1963 ALTRAN

1964 Process III

1965 OEDIPUS

1966 EPL

1966 ALPAKB

1966 VPRPAK

1966 IBMAP

1966 BEFAP

1967 MULTILANG

1967 GRIN

1967 AMPL

1968 B-LINE

1969 FASE

1970 SWAP

1971 BELL-CODE

All of which were in their way influential on the development of C. In particular, the tradition of macro-languages and macro-extensions to languages at Bell certainly was vital to the style and design of C. (Can you imagine C without the preprocessor?)

== Resources added ==

Added a resources link to the [[Pelles C]] page and [[Open Source]] page I created - Hope that is appropriate [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 06:17, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Why are thereTWO tables of contents??? ==

I don't understand.  In the table of contents at the top of the page, there is a link halfway down to another table of contents with a nested subtree of data.  IMO, this adds unneeded complexity.  I want to flatten this out and just have one table of contents at the top, like 99% of the other texts on this site.

Any objections?  If not, I will make the change next weekend.  --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 15:49, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== A beginner learning C ==

(moved to [[C Programming/Simple Input and Output]] )


== merge the cover page and the table of contents? ==

Someone recently split apart the cover page and the table of contents
( [[Programming:C]] and ).
I find it reminiscent of &quot;splash screens&quot;.
Many people recommend *not* using &quot;splash screens&quot;[http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/splash/] [http://www.newfangled.com/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/3429].

Do those objections *not* apply to wikibooks, or should we merge the cover page and the table of contents?

:Hi, I'm the bastard that moved everything around :-). You raise a good point though, I absolutley hate splash screens on most websites. That being said I think the rules are a little different for books. As of right now the cover does suck though. So if we do decide to keep it a nifty graphic or something would be need to be added. But if you really think the pages should be merged than I'm all for it. Just as long as the first page isn't like what it was before I made my changes. That page was disorganized, had two tables of contents, and looked more like a long essay than a well organized online book. --[[User:Astone42|Astone42]] 13:09, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

You might want to consider the [[WB:NP]]. You current naming convention is depreciated and has several disadvantages - like it has no navigational links. Also you worthy effort is neiter considered a book nor a section inside a book. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which implements an exstensive book and section detector.

== Compilers ==

Just a logical question here--Wouldn't it be better to teach C by standardizing a single compiler across platforms? We can be more in-depth in how things work, for example, if everyone uses GCC (either by means of direct install or MinGW).

Does anyone have any objections to me re-writing some of the string function implementations?
Frankly including meaning-less variable names, along with the ternary conditional operator, is not the way to instruct others on C programming or on how the string functions work.

== In addition to ==

Few days ago I started writing [[et:Programmeerimiskeel_C|C Programming book in Estonian]] and i would like to link all the pages here. So could someone write [[et:Programmeerimiskeel C/Keelereeglid|&quot;Standard language rules&quot;]], so that I could verify what i have written and link it here? 

It should contain at least:
* syntax, something like: 
** C has free design
** Code segment is ended by &quot;;&quot;
** C differs capitals
* C needs the code segment to be defined or valuated before use, and also how it differs from
** recursion
** linked list data structure  
* Parts of code, where to write them and short description what thy are, something like
** comments on the written program
** pragma/include directives
** define directives
** structures
** global variables
** prototypes
** main function (with short overview how data is passed &amp; how value differs from reference)
** other functions 
* Unwritten rules (or links to them, like [[:C Programming/Structure and style|Element of style]])

== Exercises, anyone? ==

I think there should be some exercises at the end of each lesson - so that the reader can practice. # [[User:Peteturtle|Brandon Johnsonn]] 12:43, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

== Topics ==

It seems to me that the topics in this ebook are drifting around.  Is this book going to teach C programming language or the standard C library?  In my experience of teaching C it is best to start as simple as possible and cover the language and include only the bare minimum library calls, like printf, scanf, getc, etc.

I would suggest to start very slow with a general introduction then follow though with more specific topics such as types and variables, operators and expressions, flow control, functions, pointers and arrays, structures, and IO.  There is defiantly a need for a book on the standard library, more advanced topics such as macros, error handling, and whatnot, but not in an introductory text.

Remember that people will be reading this book because they don't know C and most likely very little about programming.  Jumping into advanced topics like error handling before you even cover what a variable will not get the response you are after.

I have had the most success when topics are covered in this order:  introduction, types and variables, operators and expressions, flow control, functions, pointers and arrays, structures, and IO.  Topics should be brief and general without getting to deep to avoid overloading the student. All other material should be moved to a new text or placed in an intermediate or advanced section of the book.

What does everyone else think? I can see that this book has been pretty slow so if I don't get any responses within a few days I will restructure the beginning C section and start hacking away...  I would rather have some community involvement with this rather then just a me thing. --[[User:Karl McClendon|Karl McClendon]] 02:37, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

== Use of the &quot;source lang&quot; tag ==

I've seen the use of the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inetd wikipedia] in order to achieve source code highlighting and was woundering what was preventing the use of it here ? is a call for a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt; , &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; etc. tag replacer bot in place ?

I think its a problem of information and history.

I think we shall change little by little to this &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to get a consistent style.--[[User:Hoxel|Hoxel]] 14:12, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

== C99 reference ==

As the WWW is a bit lacking in the &quot;good C99 reference&quot; department, I've decided to start out a section dedicated to it [[C Programming/C99 Reference|here]]. Thoughts? [[User:Mecanismo|Mecanismo]] ([[User talk:Mecanismo|talk]]) 18:40, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

:I noted the same thing as [[User:Mecanismo|Mecanismo]].  I have started filling in the gaps, starting with assert.h/assert().

[[User:Electrobadger|Electrobadger]] ([[User talk:Electrobadger|talk]]) 22:31, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

== Something to consider ==

I just noticed, this book is a bit misleading. If you look at the Programming Bookshelf it says it's 50% completed, but it doesn't say so in any place in the book itself.

== Formatting of Examples in the PDF Version ==

The examples in the PDF version use indented paragraphs rather than tab/space characters, so that when copy-pasted to a text editor you lose the formatting.

For example, the following code:
&lt;code&gt;

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main(void) {
    printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);
    return 0;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

when copied from the on-line or print version, pastes OK into a text editor.

However, if you copy-paste from the PDF file, you get:
&lt;code&gt;

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main(void) {
 printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);
 return 0;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

How can this be fixed?

It could use a large amount of restructuring, a consistent style across the book, full coverage of topics, exercises, standardizing the experience level of the reader across the book, etc. etc. Not that it isn't a great book so far, but I think it could be much more with some more work.

== list of standard library header files ==

: Which section of this book is the best for the list of standard library header files?
: I see a list of standard library header files at [[C Programming/Reference Tables]], [[C_Programming/Standard_libraries]], [[C Programming/C Reference/List of C functions]], and [[C Programming/C Reference]].
: If, for pedagogical reasons, a student reading through a printed copy of this book really needs that list repeated in various sections,
: would it be OK if someone made a template for that list?
: (Templates for text that is repeated in various parts of this book are listed at [[:category:C Programming/Templates]]).

== Collaboration ==

Please go to [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wikiversity the Meta-Wiki] for discussions that involve the current formal proposal to make wikiversity an approved and independent wikimedia foundation project.

== Expansion ==
As we've all noticed, wikiversity is depressingly small. Why haven't student wikipedists asked their professors/teachers to come and contribute?
:That's a great idea, I'll do that as soon as I get back in school. The thing is, not all teachers are computer geeks like we are and may not want to :p --[[User:Tyciol|Tyciol]] 20:49, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
::Possibly they are waiting for a stable namespace and URL? Personally I get the impression only brilliant prose, the best of the best of the best etc. is wanted for unique &lt;b&gt;Textbooks only!&lt;/b&gt;  The subset of students having unpublished polished textbooks lying around idle is possibly vanishingly small.  Not everyone will ignore idiotic rules (for Wikiversity, not necessarily Wikibooks) while waiting for them to change. The current structure makes Wikiversity look subordinate to Wikibooks to anyone not familiar with the ongoing community sagas.  Who is going to add ugly incomplete personal notes to use as a starting substrate when anything but the best of the best textbooks must be deleted unless the author intends to complete the project in the nearterm?  I have attempted to start addressing this problem (as I currently percieve it) at policy here[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Productive_Forking_and_Tailoring_is_Encouraged], others insights welcome!  Let's have a good old fashioned discussion, debate, edit war, whatever sometime. [[User:70.110.35.3|70.110.35.3]] 01:13, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

== Another Idea ==

It would make sense, as to seperate wikiversity from wikibooks, to maybe have some audio or even video lectures in the course-work.  Feedback?  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]]
A very good idea indeed ... I have been thinking of creating/finding a linux livecd with tools for recording video and/or sound - that could be used by teachers to contribute with recorded lectures.

As soon as there is a prominent link to [[Wikibooks:Wikiversity]] this page can replace the existing redirect there. [[User:Akagu|Akagu]] 14:42, 19 May 2004 (UTC)

I began to move it, but... Shall we place the main page in [[Wikibooks:Wikiversity]] or in [[Wikiversity]]?. I think it is better the second option, if not it looks like Wikiversity is a wikibook, or like Wikiversity is a project of wikibooks. But, actually, they do work with a different scope. --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 18:12, 19 May 2004 (UTC)

:How about just Wikiversity?  Instead of Wikibooks:Wikiversity.  Because the background color becomes yellow if it is Wikibooks:Wikiversity.  I'll go ahead and change it, but feel free to change it back if you like.

== Wikimania! ==
Registration for Wikimania, the first international Wikimedia conference, is [http://wikimania.wikimedia.org now open].  It will be brilliant fun.  Everyone is invited to join the event this summer... attendees from Wikiversity in particular will be welcome.

See also the [[m:Call_for_papers|call for papers]]; propose sessions on how to use wikis for education, and pass this announcement on to others interested in education.

== Research community ==

Since revision as of 16:47, 8 Apr 2005 wikiversity is no longer a research community.
What are the intentions behind this? [[User:84.160.197.225|84.160.197.225]] 09:20, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== An Idea ==

I almost hate to suggest this, but I wonder if it's time for a sort of governing body of Wikiversity.  I agree it sounds sort of stupid, and I realize the idea is to move away from the traditional format, however, I feel like there's no direction.  There's no vision, it seems, and I feel that perhaps forming even a temporary leadership body to the entire Wikiversity might not be a terrible idea.  Although it maybe, but I wanted to share it.  [[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi]]
:People do need to be told the difference between a book and a university course. It needs to be made clear that these things are not text books, that is covered by other wikis. One of the main problems, is that as of yet, there are no examples. [[User:Abc123|Abc123]].

==Wikiversity's collapse==
Sadly, I think that the Wikimedia community has finally taken on a project too big for itself.  This project has collapsed.  There is little or no activity, and it is stalled as a Wikibooks module (that's how it operates technically anyway).  I feel like its time to either end this project, or rethink it entirely.  I think it has lost direction and is simply drawing away from Wikibooks in its present form.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 21:47, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I believe the same to be true of the traditional University. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 05:41, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:Wikiversity will find its feet. What is really needs is students, and it takes a while for ideas to spread. The other thing, is that people are expecting a completed site straight away. Apart from the fact that Wikiversity will never be &quot;completed&quot;, everyone is more than happy to benefit from free things - but few people seem to be contributing. Until everyone starts to contribute just a little bit, it will be hard to see significant changes in the university.[[User:Abc123|Abc123]].

:I wouldn't give up on this so easily. I know a few folks who would most likely be interested in a project like this, myself included.  In my opinion, wikiversity has the potential to be very successful. It is a brilliant idea. One of its  failures at the moment is that nobody seems to know it exists. I've been looking things up on wikipedia on an almost daily basis for months now, and I'd never even heard of wikiversity until earlier today. When I asked a few of my online friends (who also use wikipedia regularly) if they had heard of the wikiversity project they told me that they didn't know anything about it, or indeed any of wikipedia's &quot;sister&quot; sites.  I myself would love to become a student of some of the subjects offered here in wikiversity, and I urge the people involved not to give up on it. I feel it is only a matter of time before more people, students and teachers alike, become interested in this project and help to develop it. --[[User:CHanratty|Strummer]] 02:19, August 2, 2005 (UTC)

::I agree! I for one think Wikiversity is an AMAZING resource, but it was difficult to find. Like [[User:CHanratty|Strummer]], I have been using Wikipedia for a long time and just recently discovered Wikiversity last night. I've been hooked since! I think it's a brilliant idea and has the potential to do truly brilliant things for the world.  --[[User:Endless melee|Endless Melee]] 12:00pm July 13, 2006

::I also agree! I just found out about this program an hour ago and I'm incredibly excited about it.  I really am excited that I have a place not only to hone my skills as a teacher but also as a writer.  I think we just need to find a way to get the name out there so people will want to come and learn.  I really don't think we should focus all to much on becoming an &quot;accredited university&quot; so much as just offering great, free, and accessible information to the public. I wonder how long it took the wikipedia to get to the point its at. I imagine it took a bit of time for it to get off the ground at first, but look where it is now! Now just imagine seamless integration of the Wikipedia and the Wikiversity and all the other wikimedia out there with not only articles and wikibooks, but lessons on how to put this information to use. To me the possibilities are exhilarating. --[[User:Jechasteen|Jechasteen]] 23:32, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

== A Great Idea ==

Sure there isn't much content as I have been surfing around looking at Wikiversity project. But here is the thing imagine a world that is no longer bound by credentialism, and the high price of a university education! A place where access to a higher education is free, to me however stalled it is a begining.  - Marlin --[[User:66.82.9.65|66.82.9.65]] 12:43, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Rethinking the project ==

I have a lot ideas for a revisioning of the project. It would give it a very different focus and way of doing things, but I think it would work really well. My question is though, is something that drastic needed here? There's a lot of not very optimistic comments on this page, but I'm just wondering how accurate it all is. Is the project really stalled? Or just slow going? If it is stalled, I'd love to start trying to share my ideas here. [[User:Zach Alexander|Zach]] [[User_talk:Zach Alexander|(talk)]] 23:20, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Wikiversity sounds like a very ambitious idea. But I don't think it'll kick-off without people actually being able to &quot;graduate&quot; from it.

:: there are plenty of &quot;self taught&quot; people who would be happy for some quality, free textbooks.

== Other classes ==

It is great that wikiversity has an academic focus, orienting itself around different subjects like a university has departments, but it was cool if there was just one section that had eclectic topics like might be offered at the learning annex, classes teaching you how to cook, sew, and beat the legend of zelda.

:Funny you should bring Zelda up, I'd been thinking about that of late. Not about playing the games themselves, but imagine taking a course about the storylines and timeline theories and endings and mangas and whatnot, just as you would with any literary work. Could be fascinating.

:The other ideas could also be taught very easily with illustrations and maybe even a (live?) video feed to give Graham Kerr a run for his money!

:As for gaming, I doubt you could teach that better than a FAQ/Walkthrough does, unless you used webcams or a modified emulator with netplay support or something so you could watch what the player was doing wrong. But it's an interesting idea that will no doubt develop given time.

:I envision great things for Wikiversity, but I'm too busy with my real-world university study to start or participate in a course myself. But that doesn't mean I'm powerless, I will be here to give WV a good kick in the backside every few months to make sure it gets off the ground! [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 06:05, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Provisional Opening ==

It seems what this project lacks most is intiative. I've been building up the School of History and am considering opening that department for business by offering an experimental course on a topic that I am familiar with, and seeing whether people enroll. It will be a first attempt at Wikiversity style course and will provie ''some'' imitatable model that others can imitate and expand on. The topic is [[Wikiversity:The Great War and Versailles|The Great War and Versailles]].

--[[User:Polizano|Polizano]] 15:42, 17 June 2005 (EST)

Preparing courses (for Wikiversity) and writing content (as for Wikibooks) are two entirely different kinds of creative effort. Although I am new to the Wiki family, I would venture to suggest that Wikiversity isn't working   because potential contributers are assuming they have to provide textbook-type content as well as pedagogical support material -- study guides, PowerPoints, quizzes, etc.  Let Wikibooks provide the content and Wikiversity provide the curricular material.


== Initiative? ==

I've had this idea in my head for a while but someone should see if there are any problems with this approach. I've always held that the best way to remember something or &quot;prove&quot; that you've learned something is if you are able to teach it to someone else. Now, I will be taking courses (Psych, Communications, Political Science, Computer Science) next year at a university, and I thought Wikiversity could be a very useful tool, not just for myself but for others. I wouldn't know about books but class material from real lectures could be posted as soon as  I take them. I don't know if there is copyright information that is to be considered, not only for the information but also the &quot;style&quot; of teaching that certain professors use. I plan to remain anonymous throughout this process and plan to do the posting very thoroughly, mainly for my own sake. Another factor is that I am also a student, NOT a professor or an authority on the subject. I merely wish to transfer the  knowledge I gain at university and by doing so, use wikiversity as a study tool. Also I'll help others who wish to gain this information without the big bucks of a college education. I personally think information should be free. Any complaints?

:That's pretty much what it's all about. As long as you are prett y confident you are making sense, then you can't be too far away from the truth! One thing to note though: Be sure not to reproduce Wikipedia or Wikibooks material in Wikiversity. You don't want to just double up on material already written. [[User:Abc123|Abc123]].

== Questions ==
I really love the idea of Wikiversity, I've been trying to use online resources like MIT Open Courseware that just doesn't cut it due to the lack of a book and discussion boards for most subjects.  Are there any active classes going on?  Or a list of classes looking for TAs, or people looking for certain classes?  I'd be happy to run a class on programing or math, if people can live with me being somewhat incommunicado for September. I appologize if this is the wrong place for this, I'm not sure where the right page is.


: On a related note- one thing that struck me about the idea of classes here is the books.  They're a little sparse for textbooks.  I don't mean missing subjects, I mean they tend to have few, if any examples. Proofs are hard to come by (for the math ones) and are very terse.  You pretty much need to have some pre-existing knowledge to understand them.  Is this a design decision of the books, or just a reflection of the writing talent/time required ot make them better.  Writing a good textbook is not an easy undertaking, but its a necessity for something like a wikiversity. --[[User:Javariel|Javariel]] 21:28, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: I believe it is a reflection of the state of Wikiversity, rather than the design. First, many editors tend to try to cover a large section of material themselves. This leads to minimal content over a large area. Of course, it would make more sense to focus on a small area and do that well, before moving onto the next secion, but that is very difficult to do in practice. The other thing to remember, is that technically, Wikiversity is not the place for text books, that's Wikibooks. Wikiversity should encourage research and critical thinking, and show students where to find information. I believe that rhese two difficulties have led to the current status of Wikiversity. [[User:Abc123|Abc123]].

::: The other thing to remember is that only contributions will improve the site. If you think something is lacking, it is really up to you to improve it, or else more and more people will think that Wikiversity is failing. Good luck! [[User:Abc123|Abc123]].

:: I would like to recommend looking at the [http://www.aduni.org aduni.org] course materials as grounds for a first set of computer science courses.  I helped teach some of those courses back when they were first offered, and would be glad to help others transfer and use the materials effectively.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 10:57, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)


:We have no courses running at present. &quot;The Great War and the Treaty of Versailles&quot; is being planned as a test-bed course. The other courses probably would welcome more help, just look at their sections or the editing history to see who is &quot;in charge&quot;. And you're certainly welcome to write and teach a course yourself, the more the merrier! As for the month of September you could perhaps find a substitute to teach for that month. It will all work out I'm sure. :)
:The books here are intended to be comprehensive textbooks on any given subject, and indeed to accompany and accent the Wikiversity classes, but there's only so much you can do in your spare time. Certainly some more contributors would help but right now Wikipedia's getting all the attention.
:Overall, just go ahead! The moment we have something actually underway things will get going, but until that time Wikiversity is just fluffy ideas and dreams. We need some action. :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 21:44, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)


::Thanks for the advice, both of you.  I'm moving in September (new job in Seattle), so I've decided to forgo teaching until then, I'm not able to really estimate the amount of time I need yet.  After I'm settled, I will give it a go, I just need to decide with what.  In the meantime, I plan on following the WWI course when it starts and work on some wikibooks as a way to contribute until then.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] July 6, 2005 23:21 (UTC)

== Academic Journals ==
Have their been any discussions about access to Academic Journals?
Some of the most rewarding classes I've taken have involved a professor assembling a dozen or more essays from various journals into a reading packet.
While books are easily available at low prices (with fast shipping), journals are closely guarded secrets of the Illuminati.
I'm still a student, and this isn't so much a personal concern, as a concern for those who don't have easy access to a University library system.

:Um, that's a great idea of course, but the cost involved in setting up such a deal... it would be absolutely ruinous I would imagine. Especially considering the fact that we don't have a set roll. Thousands upon thousands of users could (potentially) sign up and access journals through us so any licensing fees would be unfair in their eyes. So we'll just have to make do I'm afraid. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:41, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

::There are increasing numbers of journals with free online content. For example, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=pmc PubMed Central] is an online archive of life sciences journal with free access to the full text of articles (note: some journals delay free access to recently published articles). Also, it is now possible to start new [http://academia.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page peer-reviewed academic journals in wiki format]. Wikiversity could start its own wiki journals. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 12:30, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:::Oh, OK, that's a good idea. Yes there are some around but I've found very few. Unfortunately some publishers offer free back issues of their magazines/journals then change their minds, for example the ''Viking Heritage Magazine'' has taken down the PDFs of their back issues --that's strange, I can still access the orphaned download page and its files. Hm.

:::That's interesting about that Journals wiki, I was just going to host everything I wrote here, but I'll certainly take a look at that. Sounds very interesting. I just hope something actually gets done, it's hard work to write a journal... [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:23, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:::UPDATE: Well they say if you want something done right you've got to do it yourself! There are big gaps in the subjects covered at the [academia.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page Academic Publishing Wiki] so I've begun turning some of my old university essays into journal articles to pad things out!

:::As for Wikiversity starting journals, for now I think it would be better to keep everything at the Academic Publishing Wiki. They (we?) are working on guidelines for journal creation and improvement, and it would make more sense to let everything be under their jurisdiction for now.

::: Any more help with creating journal content over there would be greatly appreciated, even if you've just got an essay or two to wikify. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:54, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::I suppose one negative about academic journals is that they are purely individual, rather than wiki orientated. It would be original thought. Personally, I don't have a problem with that, but may conflict with what a wiki is. Anyone with a better understanding of wiki conventions have an opinion? [[User:Abc123|Abc123]].

:::Actually I already have plans for some ''truly'' wiki journal articles. A topic will be selected, some point(s) it has to illustrate will be identified (although those too could adapt), and it will grow organically from there with the community controlling its growth and focus. Five years ago the idea of a from-scratch encyclopedia was laughable, so why should journals be different? [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:32, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

::::Interesting. It just seems to me that an academic journal's purpose is to put forward/explain new ideas and research. That wouldn't fit with Wikibooks. Then again, the more I think about it, if there was a pure Wikijournal site, the rules could be a little different. [[User:Abc123|Abc123]]

::::My initial response is that writing journal articles in true wiki format would be difficult to control (in the scientific sense of the word). It would likely require one person or entity to carry out experiments in a single controlled environment. Just sayin'. - [[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 03:08, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

== Enrollment ==

One of the things you should consider doing is making it really, really easy to enroll.  I would like to enroll in the School of Economics.  I searched for about an hour for a way to do this, but never did find a way.

Put a link right near the top of the Wikiversity home page; &gt;&gt;&gt;ENROLMENT&lt;&lt;&lt;.  I'm not saying there isn't a way, but I didn't find it.  Make it simple for simple people like me.  Wilbur Wilson  wilsonw@harbornet.com

:There's no such thing as enrolling into Wikiversity. There are no timetabled classes, or even classes etc. [[User:Abc123|Abc123]]

:The problem is that no classes are running except The Great War and Versailles. THAT is why you can't find anywhere to sign up, because nothing's running yet. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:05, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

== Sister Project ==

Hi - I'm posting via my IP (I'm User:Manning Bartlett from the 'pedia). I think the Wikiversity is one of the coolest things I've seen. The problem is - I'd never heard of it until I stumbled in by accident. If this thing was a sister project (as per Wiktionary, Wikinews, etc) you'd have a lot more interest/traffic. Have you approached Jimbo?

:We already ''are'' a sister project (we were spawned on Meta), but we haven't got anything to show for our work yet (a single class running is not very impressive) so until such time as we get going we're going to be invisible I suppose. Hmmm... [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:02, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

:: Well there you go. The Wikiversity is not listed as a sister project in anyplace **obvious** (like on Wikipedia's main page). A real shame. - Manning (User:Manning Bartlett at the 'pedia).

:::In a sense Wikiversity is a ''sister project'', but it's obviously not a fully-fledged one with its own users, admins, wiki and domain name. Instead it is ''hosted'' at Wikibooks. Personally, I'm doubtful we will separate from Wikibooks ever, as the projects have so much in common. But there seems a reasonable consensus that we need to grow a lot before separation will even be considered. 

:::Unfortunately, as the discussion above suggests, there's a chicken and egg situation here. We won't grow very fast until we are more visible, and we won't be more visible until we grow. That's a shame perhaps, but it's not hopeless. It's just possible we are still growing, slowly. But the graph is so noisy it's a bit hard to tell. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 09:39, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

::::My vote is to wait before we show ourselves to the world. We need to have a few example courses, from which others can set an example. There needs to be an emphasis that Wikiversity is not intended to reproduce material from other sources, but aid in learning that material. I think once we get a few example courses - there will be more cohesion, a greater sense of purpose, and then we can open Wikiversity up to the powers that be for &quot;Sisterhood&quot;. [[User:Abc123|Abc123]].

== Classes without teachers? ==

A friend and I have been planning a group-based teach-yourself style of a &quot;course&quot;.  We've been floundering around trying to find an acceptable way for online collaboration between ourselves and others that we either recruit or stumble across our page.  When I found wikiversity, I thought this might be a good place to do that.  I'm still really new to it and have little to no idea as to how to actually start up a normal class let-alone one that might not fit within the normal vision for this site.

In theory, this methodology would rely more heavily on blogging and open discussion rather than official reference material (but will likely link to wikibooks and other more official course material).  Is this idea compatible enough with the wikiversity vision?  If so, I'll need some instructions on how to get started. [[User:jhouse|jhouse]]

:Sounds fine. As for getting started, um, we haven't really laid anything out. What I think you need to do is first create a hubt with info about the class, a class list, etc. like [[Wikiversity:The Great War and Versailles]] has.
:You should also start a series of pages for each &quot;subject&quot;. Merely supply that &quot;day&quot;'s study topic etc. at the top and let people edit and discuss.
:Any other questions? Ask away. :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:30, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

I've created an initial attempt [[User:jhouse|jhouse]].  Comments Are Welcome - [[Wikiversity:Study_Group_For_Relativity|Relativity Study Group]]

== Mapping real world-&gt;wiki learning ==

I've been giving some thought lately on what helped to learn in the real world, and how that could be ported to the wiki world.  The idea being that any successful way of teaching via wiki ought to support as many of them as possible, in addition to any wiki-specific methods we can come up with.  Comments on the feasibility and additions to the list are welcome.  Especially ways to use the wiki that don't work in normal school, lets find a way to use our unique points to an advantage.

How I found I learned in school, in no particular order:

#Textbook.   Obviously here we have a wiki book

#Lectures.  Should be more informational, dive down into a subtopic of a book.  Example heavy.  Almost a second wikibook on the topic, in small 1 hour chunks.  Audio, video, or slideshow a helpful addition here?
#Office hours.  Hard to wiki-ize, as the point of office hours is being able to talk to an authority on the subject.  Perhaps IRC sessions, with transcripts wiki-ized?  FOr that matter, IRC lectures may be useful too.
#Homework.  Assignments uploaded to wiki, and commented on by teachers.  Need some system where people can upload to unique pages so they don't overwrite each other.
#newsgroups (hey, my school had them and they helped)-  a wiki forum, policed to keep it on topic.  Hopefully students and teachers will comment on questions
#discussion with/working with other students-  harder to do, provide ways for people studying the material to talk and collaborate.  The wikiboard idea will help, so will the idea below.  A page where you can people currently studying a topic can post their emails to discuss issues out of band may help too.

In addition, I was thinking of things a wiki can do uniquely

#Large projects.  Make a project that to an equivalent level student would take 100s of hours, but is breakable into parts.  Let people do parts via wiki, and work together to complete the whole thing.  For example, a programming course for novices could have them write a large program-  a web browser maybe.   We could design the framework and break it down into chunks, and the students could write the individual chunks.  The large project would need to be retired ocassionally, so it doesn't degrade to people copying the old version.

After additional thought-  the last idea isn't just for large projects.  In place of/in addition to homework, you could sprinkle smaller, less ambitious projects throughout.



Breaking it down to what needs to be done, there are 3 roles-  student, teacher, course designer.  

Course designer:  writes wikibook, writes lectures, designs homework or big projects.  Requires full knowledge of the subject and great organizational and teaching skills.  Almost needs to be 1 person or a small, tight group, to keep everything focused.  If the school itself (such as the school of math, or school of CS) has a goal for each course, the course designer needs to be in sych with the overall designer.

Teacher: runs office hours, looks over homework and advises student, monitors newsgroup, monitors and advises on large projects.  Requires a lot of knowledge of the subject and good teaching skills.  Can be a large number of people, although pairing people up to a teacher may be helpful.  Does not need to be the one designing anything although they may refine things, they are meant to help teach established material.

student: responsible for learning it all :)

The distinction between course designer and teacher is important-  a designer needs most of the skills of a teacher, and its own subset.  By separating the two roles, you can have the designer move on and design more material, rather than merely rehash things.  Once the base material is completed, its much easier to plug someone in to continue teaching it.


I know some of these require a lot of teacher interaction that may seem counter to a normal wiki.  This is on purpose.  I have taught internet courses before (I TAed them in college), and I found the hardest part was keeping people working, even when they were paying for the class.  The reason for this interaction is to keep students involved and on track.  Without something to do so, we'll see a lot of people read one or two lessons, and never come back.  If the true goal is to teach the subject, we want them engaged.

:That sounds like a reasonable collection of requirements.  My college experience had some teachers as the book writer/lecture planner with potentially little teaching ability, and the TA's grading homework and trying to give real-world explanations.  Of course, TA's are really just students a bit further than those in the class.
:I think the question really becomes &quot;How do we develop a culture such that past students help out new students in ways similar to how they were helped?&quot;.  I think it's a tough thing to develop that kind of culture on a website, especially when there's an attendence problem.  [[User:jhouse|jhouse]]

::Classes at MIT traditionally have a one-hour lecture a few times a week with up to a few hundred people in it, and then a one-hour recitation section, where you meet with a TA and 20-30 other students and ask questions and grind through problems.  At least one class has put the lecture up on the web instead, in video format.  This precludes the ability to interrupt and ask questions, but that's what recitation section is for, anyway.  It also makes it more convenient to see lecture and easier to catch up if you miss one.  In some classes, the lectures and the textbook are very different - almost complementary.  In others, they present the same material, and you can choose how you'd like it presented.

::As for communication channels, it's probably best to concentrate content.  That is, you shouldn't have a newsgroup, an e-mail list, and a wiki talk page all for the same class.  There should be one synchronous channel (IRC would work, certainly, and transcripts would be great, for future reference, and for those who miss class), and one asynchronous channel.  (I'd have to think about which might be best, but a LiquidThreads-enabled wiki might be nice.  And experience will tell.)

::In the short term, a good goal might be to actually partner with existing academic institutions.  I'm there are professors and TAs out there who would be able to make good use of Wikiversity content or collaboration mechanisms.  My guess is that there's just a lot of work to do before there's enough quality content to fill an entire class.  -- [[User:Beland|Beland]] 02:44, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

:: My friend Jason House ([[User:jhouse|jhouse]]) and I ([[User:Gonzosm|Gonzo]]) have started to put together a study group for Relativity ([[Wikiversity:Study_Group_For_Relativity|study group course on relativity]]), and we have a very simple plan: get a group of people together to focus on a topic, choose a book, and attempt to explain the book to each other via Wikiversity.  In order to actually learn you have to read the book, contribute to the wikipage, read peoples' feedback, rinse and repeat.  Jason and I call each other reguarly, and that of course would also be an option for future endeavors.  We may have chosen this format because there was no existing format, but there is so little involvement right now that things have to stay simple (KISS).

::The above essay mapping traditional training/educational processes is an excellent beginning.  I think it is important to keep in mind that initially the wikiversity will probably be serving nontraditional adult students (possibly with a lot of exposure or previous experience now formalizing their complete understanding of a subject or brushing up for more advanced impending work or in pursuit of specific goals) and traditional students &lt;b&gt;augmenting&lt;/b&gt; their studies in traditional environments.  We need to acknowledge and service the special requirements of interacting asynchronously, sporadically, on demand, on topic, with each individual student by allowing other students to firm up their understanding by helping less advanced students.  Personally I would not count on professional experts as teachers or instructors.  People with these qualifications have busy lives and careers.  When they get overloaded typically they will choose to impact volunteer activities at wikiversity rather than their family or professional career.  Thus in this forum and format they also will be drop in unreliable non realtime assets.  However, do not despair, every bit of time they manage to squeeze into their busy schedules can serve future students the second the student finds the correct link to the correct question or discussion regarding a matter he/she is studying or reviewing.  Development will be sporadic.  Delivery of properly mapped and structured material can be instantaneous to new study groups that are now ready by self selection (link mapping, quiz perequisites, browsing, etc.) for the specific material.  Notice that most of the material we need is already availalbe online, is being mapped by wikibooks, wikipedia, etc.  Our true challenge is to find presentation and format methods suited to the online tools available and supportable by the selected technology infrastructure.  It may be appropriate to explore the recent advances in peer to peer browser technology under development by the originator of freenet or mnet, gnunet, BOINC, oceanstore, and other low end grid components to enable each participant to help scale the delivery infrastructure as they participate.

== My thoughts on the project ==

First of all, I've noticed that the German version of Wikiversity seems to have its own wiki already at de.wikiversity.org. Since this would seem to indicate it's an official Wikimedia-supported project, perhaps we should make some noises at [[m:Requests for new languages]] to get an equivalent wiki for en.wikiversity.org? I've added a request at [[m:Requests for new languages#Requests for new Wikiversity languages]], but we need at least 5 people to take on the project, help build it up, and administer it. Be aware that if the wiki becomes inactive, it may get shut down, so there may be an advantage in leaving it here.

Secondly, we seem to be suffering again from another case of badly-defined scope. Some of the existent 'schools' seem more like a book than a structured course. Books are generally an integral part of courses, but we really don't want to be duplicating the role of Wikibooks on another project, else we'll end up having endless debates as to what goes where.

What I think might be a good idea is to clearly separate the two by introducing official course textbooks for each course. The textbooks would be hosted at Wikibooks (obviously), while the Wikiversity project would be confined to things like:

* Course syllabus (The scope of the course, and what topics it intends to cover. This should be kept brief to avoid duplicating the material in course textbooks.)
* Course structure (How is the learning divided up into sessions/classes/lectures/etc.)
* Links to official course textbooks (It's important that this is made highly visible, to ensure that newbie Wikiversity editors don't end up duplicating the functionality of the textbook)
* Details of practical experiments or other things which might be inappropriate for a theory textbook (We want to keep the existing Wikibooks generic enough that they can be used as either a course text, or as an independent book for other interested parties.)
* Anything else? (suggestions wanted)

::New technology.  There is a lot of interest in the free/open source community at large as well as academia in scalable peer based grid components.  There are ways to structure study groups such that a lot of the information should remain on the student's private network but be made available to trusted associates.  Many of these students are going to be working on potentially lucrative proprietary implementations of the technology or material they are studying.  They naturally would like this material protected and available only legitimate members of their virtual organization doing the R&amp;D or considering startup or other commerical exploitation. [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 19:24, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

The first thing to do when designing a new Wikiversity school ought to be writing the syllabus. Without this, it will be difficult to tell where one school ends, and the next begins.

::I disagree.  First thing is to find some students to achieve consensus on what they intend to study and how they would like to go about it. [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 19:24, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
:::I think there should be a prominent paragraph on the main Wikiversity page that discusses what a  Wikiversity student is. In my view, a Wikiversity student should be an active Wikiversity editor. Wikiversity students and teachers should be [http://collaboration.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikiversity#Collaborative_learning collaborators] in Wikimedia projects. These could be [http://education.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikiversity#Wikiversity_Core_Courses_Initiative existing projects] (such as Wikipedia) or new learning projects within Wikiversity oriented around the needs of particular students. New learning projects could start as new student-created pages attached to existing courses or as new student-created learning project pages where students describe their learning goals. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 16:19, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

For some courses there are already extensive Wikibooks on the subject (e.g. [[Physics]]), so we ought to take this into account. For courses which don't have such a textbook (please check thoroughly. I'm constantly finding many great texts hidden away at Wikibooks), I'd suggest beginning by writing such a text. Be sure to include textbook theory modules on everything covered in the course syllabus. This may require you to expand on existing Wikibooks to make them compliant, but it's easier than starting from scratch.

*I think it is premature to transwiki Wikiversity over to another server yet, as I don't see much activity here.  Certainly not substantial course work.  Most of the discussion about what is going to happen with Wikiversity is also happening on Meta, which is IMHO the completely wrong place to put it, as comments like yours here on Wikibooks are not getting to the full audience that may be involved in setting up the project on a seperate server.  Better integration between Wikibooks and a future English Wikiversity can and should happen, and in particular a Wikibook should be completed and available as a textbook before Wikiversity gets &quot;turned on&quot;.

:This is an &quot;official Wikimedia Project&quot; so far as any can be that isn't on its own server.  To call it a crazy new user project run amock is depreciating the efforts of many users who have tried to contribute to this project so far.  That the German effort is better organized than the English one is more a surprise, but that doesn't mean we have to follow lock-step in their lead either. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:01, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

==Just When I Thought I Was Out...==
...you folks manage to pull me back in!  I'm going to do my best to start putting the energy back into the [[Wikiversity:School of Literature and English Studies|School of Literature and English Studies]] and see if I can't get some courses better designed.  I had started some creative writing courses and even had one guy who sent me some poetry! I've added writers/poets to some of the classes I have in the Grad. area.  I was out, but I'm excited again, seeing how others seem to be excited and working as well!  [[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi]]

==Protection==
Despite claims to the contrary, [[Wikiversity]] was certainly '''not''' protected at the advice of the Wikimedia Foundation. 

Perhaps it was advised by one member of that foundation, but other Board members were not consulted. I am disgusted this approach would be taken with no consensus from the community. 

Wikiversity has been running for a long time on Wikibooks and I see no agreement whatsoever for it to be suddenly shut down like this. 

Protection is a defense against vandalism, not a way of expressing one person's point of view on whether or not a sub-project of Wikibooks should exist. Please remove the misleading statements about protection and explain why you ever thought the Foundation would propose such an awful measure on a popular set of pages like Wikiversity. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 03:00, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

: You are correct in that not all the board members were consulted. I apologize for this accidentally misleading use of language, and I have re-worded the page accordingly. You have evidently not been following the discussions on Meta, but to be fair, it's difficult to find anything on that site, so a bit of background might help.

: I also believe the Wikiversity project has great potential, which is why I made a request in [[m:Requests for new languages]] (now at [[m:Talk:Requests for new languages#Requests for new Wikiversity languages]]) to get it its own wiki at en.wikiversity.org (similar to one existent at de.wikiversity.org). If you read that section, you will find that I was refused due it being decided that the project was not official, which kinda annoyed me.

: Having ascertained its status, I then came to the conclusion that the Wikiversity project was in violation of Wikibooks policy as decided by its community (we are not a free-content provider for pet-projects not approved by the Foundation AND more fundamentally, we are trying to build open-content textbooks, not university courses), so I inquired on #wikimedia whether I should perhaps delete the content, or protect it. According to policy, I'm not allowed to post the logs from #wikimedia, but to be fair, you were logged onto this channel at the time, so you may have the logs yourself, but I assume I'm allowed to summarize the conversations. One of the Foundation members suggested that protecting it would be okay, so I made the edits and protected the page. I still felt that I'd get complaints, so I posted the URL into the channel to get a second opinion. When the founding member expressed his support, I left it at that.

: If you really wish to help the project, I suspect you would do more good to propose this as a new official Wikimedia project in the appropriate place, rather than complaining about myself executing policy as decided by the Foundation and the community. I will support any proposal for this project subsequently made by anybody here; in fact part of my reasoning for this protection was to persuade somebody to make it official. I was concerned that the project might never become authorized, and the poor editors here would have been wasting their time.

: The point is, this content should never have been put here in the first place. In the interim, you are also free to transwiki the project to a non-Wikimedia server if that is more suitable. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:22, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

::I've seen the IRC logs and I see no evidence of Anthere saying the page should be protected. The only mention of the word protection from her was &quot;but protect information&quot; - which I take to mean [[wiktionary:protect|protect]] as in &quot;keep safe&quot; rather than deleting it, not as in lock the page and state all further pages are candidates for speedy deletion. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 04:51, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

:::Yes, that is the correct interpretation. Sorry I was unclear in what I said, which could lead to a misunderstanding. [[User:Anthere|Anthere]]

::::Ah. Sorry. Seems this was all a misunderstanding. The word 'protect' has a very specific interpretation in the context of wiki pages. I also got the impression that Jimbo's comment was made rather half-heartedly. Perhaps it's best if I ignore the conversations in the IRC channel, especially considering most of the Wikibooks community are not a party to them. I should also have been more careful considering English is not Anthere's first language (although I assure you her English is far superior to my French). I suppose at the end of the day, the opinions of individual members of the Foundation should be considered equal to those of any other members of the community. Without a clear policy on who can make policy, it's difficult to tell whose opinions matter. Hopefully this is something I can tighten up on as time progresses, to prevent other admins from making similar mistakes in the future. I'd also appreciate it if you kept the discussions here, rather than posting them on mailing lists, since not all of the community follows the mailing lists. I shall re-word the page once more. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:46, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

That's correct. There's absolutely no justification for protecting this page and adding an ex cathedra announcement like this. Wikibooks is a wiki, and policies and decisions are made in consensus. Please unprotect it immediately.--[[User:Eloquence|Eloquence]] 04:12, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

: Okay. It seems as if many people have a problem with this, so I will unprotect the page. I still stick by what I've said above. I really hope someone can help make this project official. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:29, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

== CS school organization ==

I'm asking this here, because there was no reaction on the talk page for the school of CS.  Who is deciding the breakdown of classes and schools?  It seems a little arbitrary to me.  For example, programming is broken into a minimum of 2 schools-  CS and Infomatics.  I've been programming for 10 years and never even heard of the term infomatics.  While I can understand wanting to concentrate on theory rather than particular APIs (and agree with the point, in fact), I think that breaking down the subject with an artificial barrier like that is counterproductive.  You'll end up having to duplicate large sections of courses, and confusing the users.  In addition, a lot of the existing framework for those courses that have it are falling into the encyclopedia problem again.  It doesn't read like a course, it reads like an encyclopedia entry or textbook.

In addition to the setup found at [[Wikiversity:School_of_Computer_Science| School of CS]], we have the [[Wikiversity:CSC_Course_Catalog|CS Course Catalog]] with an entirely separate breakdown.  One which, IMO, goes too far the other way-  not enough theory, too much a &quot;learn programming in 40 days&quot; type deal.

So who decides the breakdown?  I don't want to just delete something that has obviously had a lot of work put into it.  On the other hand, we currently have 2 competing projects, neither of which is seeing a lot of activity.  And we have my ideas at [[Talk:Wikiversity:School_of_Computer_Science#Organization_comments]] that I honestly think gets a good mix of the two.  THis is a case where I think we need some organization and forethought.  I'm willing to put in time to design a general CS outline and start on courses, but we do *not* need 3 competing efforts.  

I think I'll start working on a rough draft of how I think the course outline should be on my user page (I'll add a link here when its done).  In the meantime, what do other community members think?  Especially those who worked on either fo the two other effort.

== Where is the Link ==

Where is the link to Wikiversity on the Wikibooks sidebar? School's out for the summer? I would suggest adding a second line to Wikibooks main page under Welcome to Wikibooks something like, Who's your teacher: [[Wikiversity]] [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 07:09, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
: If you care to read the text at the top of the page [[Wikiversity]], and earlier comments on this page, you will notice there is currently some debate as to whether this project will continue to be hosted on this site. In the interim, I felt it wise not to blatently advertise such a contraversial page. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:12, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
You don't mean it, I was about to rev up Gospel 101 under [[Wikiversity:School of Theology]], but I will wait the outcome. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 04:14, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

Ideally, wouldn't the substantial or finished Wikibook be the course book, and the assignments reside on the School page(s), whereby school and book are in the same project namespace, simple link not transwiki. That arrangement obviously takes time to develop. Example, for now, [[Gospel 101 Verses for the Week]] could put the Theology students into the New Testament of [[Christianity]] The Book.

: You are free to develop textbooks (such as [[Christianity]]), which would be appropriate in such a 'school'. This is in fact the whole point of this website. What I object to is using a textbook site to develop university courses, which are beyond the scope of this site. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:02, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

== Research papers==

How would you guys feel in terms of adding scientific papers to wikibooks, with categories such as &quot;topic&quot;, &quot;university of origin&quot;, &quot;authors&quot;...keywords and such ? [[User:Anthere|Anthere]] 07:53, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
:I'm not quite sure what you mean. Do you mean...:
:# Have a library-like list of published journal articles? It's unmaintainable without database software designed for it.
:# Provide ''copies'' of said articles? That's not very legal.
:# allow readers to post their ''own'' articles? Original Research is not welcome here, but try the [[wikicities:c:academia|Academic Publishing Wiki]].
:# Something completely obvious but I overlooked due to it being 1 AM over here?
:Well, it'll be one of those. Choose one! :) Either way there will no doubt be a home for it. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:05, 9 August 2005 (UTC)


==Question on VFD and content changes==

Question on the VFD voting.  Ignoring the question of what exactly should happen and where-  lets say its transikied somewhere (I don't think anyone is voting for straight up deletion, after all).  I'm working on some new content to add.  If I add it now, will it get transwikied with the rest if the project gets transwikied?  Or will it fall into the void?  If its the second, I'll just make the content on my user pages as a sandbox for now.

Also, some of the content is a change to existing content, and may get reverted depending on other opinion.  When a transwiki occurs, does all history get transwikied as well, or does history get lost?  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 22:01, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

:The idea is that everything at a certain cut-off date would be transwikied, and anything added after that would no doubt be frowned upon but probably moved as well.
:As for where yours should go, unless you're intending for others to read and edit it you could consider building it off-wiki (on your computer) until a new home is organised.
:You see, we don't actually move the actual page reversions as there's no way to do that. The so-called transwiki is just a manual cut-n-paste, with the page history copied onto the talk page [[Talk:Monopoly/Official Rules|as in this example]].
:So if you post it now someone's just going to have to manually move it. Not to say you shouldn't contribute, nono, but the less content involved in this already enormous move the better.
:Hope that explains everything, and if not ask away! :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:19, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

::Ok, in that case I'll write it in a sandbox for syntax testing until this is all decided.  And I'll hold off on things that may be reverted as well, since we wouldn't be actually able to revert easily.  Thanks.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 04:27, August 13, 2005 (UTC)

== Proposed &quot;[[Wikiversity:About|About]]&quot; page ==

Based on some of the comments on the vfd page, I've made a proposed [[Wikiversity:About|about]] page specifying what the goals of wikiversity are, and why it differs from wikibooks.  I basicly ripped off wikibook's format and changed the content a bit, so it may not be 100%.  Comments welcome.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 07:00, August 16, 2005 (UTC)
:You forgot to tell us where it was. :) Looking good so far... maybe needs some more details but I can't think of anything at the moment. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:20, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

:I'm taking lack of objection as consensus, since I have limited time before losing net access for a few weeks.  I'm putting this on the meta page as well, to help address concerns about the project.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 07:19, August 18, 2005 (UTC)

== Wikiversity Re-launch ==

I'm sort of &quot;forcing the hand&quot; of the foundation on this point, but I am &quot;relaunching&quot; the [[meta:Proposals for new projects#Wikiversity|new project proposal on Meta]] for this project.  This includes a [[meta:Talk:Wikiversity#Wikiversity &quot;Relaunch&quot;|timeline for when this project can become active]] as an independent wiki, with specific steps that must happen, as required by Wikimedia Foundation policies.  I think there is a tremendous amount of support for this project, so I don't see it rejected out of hand.  Based on the participants and comments here it appears as though there are also going to be a number of contributors that will keep the project alive.

As far as organization issues are concerned (including the basic charter of the project), please keep that discussion on Meta.  In terms of editing issues on Wikibooks or content organization of stuff that is already here, just keep doing what you are doing and expand what is presently here.  All contributions to Wikiversity that happen right now will be preserved and carried over to the new project, where ever it may end up.  '''PLEASE DON'T STOP CONTRIBUTING'''  ''Something'' is going to happen with Wikiversity, and on the whole it will be positive for the entire community as well.

==Importance of Schools==

Another one of my (in)famous ideas on how this project should run- has anyone given any thought to the importance of schools?  From a quick looks, it seems like most or all schools are pretty much a collection of links to courses.  Has any thought gone into making the school itself a method of teaching and community building?  I remember back in college, the people in my year were some of the best resources I had for learning and help with material.  Since its logical that someone interested in one course of a school may be interested in learning more, this seems to be a good spot to draw people in at.  I think I've already mentioned that I believe community building around courses will be important to teaching courses.  If we can start it at a higher level, we ccan keep more people around and draw them into helping on the lower level courses.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 07:19, August 18, 2005 (UTC)
:&quot;community building&quot; is important....maybe each &quot;school&quot; needs a page where students can describe what they hope to learn....this might start a feedback loop to grow the school in the right direction. We should link to wikiversity from places like [http://students.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page this wikicity]. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 13:24, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

== Math support? ==

[[User:gonzosm|My friend]] [[User:jhouse|and I]] are trying to start up a math intensive [[Wikiversity:Study_Group_For_Relativity|study group course on relativity]].  We've both taken a look at the math support on wikibooks and were appalled at how tough it is to do equations that are readable.  To copy a single sentence from [[Wikiversity:Special_Relativity|the special relativity page]]:

Most generally, this matrix looks like &lt;math&gt;L(v) =\left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and transforms &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ x\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t^\prime \\ x^\prime\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t' \\ x'\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ x\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt;.

This was created by typing:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
Most generally, this matrix looks like &lt;math&gt;L(v) =\left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and transforms &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ x\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t^\prime \\ x^\prime\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t' \\ x'\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ x\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

That seems impossibly complex for a '''casual discussion'''.  Does anyone know of any ways to make this easier on the students in the course?

:I'm not having much success finding what kind of plugins are used by wikiversity/wikibooks.  I did find a math plugin online that used latex format for math.  Is that possibly true for wikiversity?  If so, is there a latex editor that anyone recommends? [[User:Jhouse|Jhouse]]

:I'm going to take a look at having a friend of mine convert Scientific Notebook into this format...maybe it will be easy...In the meantime I finished chapter 1 of &quot;Tensors, Differential Forms and Variational Principles&quot; [[User:Gonzosm|Gonzo]]

:You can try [http://www.lyx.org/ Lyx] to generate the LaTeX using a WYSIWYG interface. An alternative is to format it as ASCII art:

       [a b
 L(v) = c d]

You can also format the LaTeX itself on multiple lines to make it easier to read:
&lt;math&gt;L(v)=\left(
\begin{matrix}
a &amp; b \\
c &amp; d
\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Or you could use some kind of template solution. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:07, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

:Your suggestions are good, but I'm really really hoping for some nice wysiwig editor or something.  Between my friends and I, we've tried downloading a number of equation editors and haven't found any that generate compatible output.  Some output looks close (Tex, LaTex) but none match.  The editors we got use the array keyword instead and possibly have a few other quirks...
::I remember looking around for good WYSIWYG LaTeX editors, but I haven't really seen too many. TexMacs works pretty well, but it isn't really LaTeX. However, for online discussions like these, I would recommend staying away from LaTex, even if it requires more non-standard notation, ala Mathematica. For instance, you could just represent a matrix as {{a,b},{c,d}}. It may not be as pretty, but it should do the trick. Subscripts could be either a[0], or a_0. Summation can be sum(a[k],1,n) or something like that. 

::Notation always varies, and it is generally made to best suite the medium. There is no reason we have to be constrained to notation, that was meant for being written out by hand. The important thing is to stay relatively consistent.
----[[User:72.245.93.22|72.245.93.22]] 04:52, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

::I disagree somewhat.  Consistent nomenclature starts to lock us into talking to ourselves more effectively than the rest of the world.  This is poor preparation for the real world.  The important thing is to get started studying, translating, and exchanging information.  Most serious students will have specific goals and milestones and if they do not experience progress towards their personal goals participation will inevitably fall off.  Indeed.  This seems to be a problem across the board with the wikiversity concept.

::Regarding the equation editor ... as we get to serious topics and problem sets we will have pages and pages of calculations.  It was not uncommon for me when as an undergraduate with a heavy 400 level course load to turn in over a hundred pages of detailed equations a week between physics and engineering classes.  Good scanning printers are now available from Wallmart and elsewhere in the U.S. for under $100.  If we cannot find a good mathml or svg editor then perhaps we can scan pages of calculation and upload png files.  A graphics editor such as GIMP should allow us to cut &amp; paste to insert corrections, questions or alternate mathematical opinions or proofs.  IMO this is a critical issue.  If we cannot do the math, then it is not physics.  This means ultimately our serious students should be able to start on a problem with a few fundamentals or previous results and then manually/personally do the math to generate the desired results or conclusions.  It may be that modern keyboarding is not up to this ... we may need to work on paper and then use computers to augment or communicate results.

== Wikiversity Vote ==

[[m:Wikiversity/Vote/en|Voting]] has started for a new Wikimedia sister project proposal called [[m:Wikiversity|Wikiversity]].  This is a request for anybody that is interested to cast a vote either in support or opposition to this new project proposal.  The results of this vote will determine if this project will be started on its own seperate group of wikis as a Wikimedia sister project, together with approval from the Wikimedia Foundation Board.  Discussion about this proposal should take place [[Talk:Wikiversity|on the Wikiversity discussion page]].

P.S. I know that if you are active with the Wikiversity community that you perhaps already know this, but this notice is for the few stragglers that may have missed my &quot;spamming&quot; all of the Wikimedia projects in the past 24 hours.  I've been throwing up notices about this vote everywhere I can, and it appears as though it is getting a very good response from the vote.  Those who are opposed to the creation of Wikiversity are also voicing their concerns, which is a good thing as well.  At least news of this vote is making the rounds in may places, and others are starting to pick up the ball and try to make announcements as well.  The voting page has now been translated into five languages (+1 being English).  The response from the &quot;international&quot; community has been quite impressive in particular.  As of when I posted this message, the voting is 34 in favor, 10 opposed.  Your vote is needed now to determine the future of this project. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:35, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

== Stubs, Stubs, Stubs ==
When I look around at the &quot;departments&quot; of Wikiversity, I find a ton of stubs, such as the course [[Wikiversity:Accounting/Acc 1000|Acc 1000]]. Perhaps there are some fully developed courses, but I failed to find them. I suggest using categories to indicate the stage of development for each course, e.g. &quot;category:Wikiversity courses - being taught now&quot;, &quot;category:Wikiversity courses - fully developed&quot;, and &quot;category:Wikiversity courses - being developed&quot;. --[[User:LA2|LA2]] 00:55, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

when
* [[Wikiversity:School_of_Computer_Security]]
doesn't exist.

Hi! Does it makes sense to work at this site while the vote is running? There doesn't seem to be any activity at the moment!

:Sure it does.  When we win (notice the lack of an if :), the more content we have to publicize, the better.  It helps make the doubters realize their mistakes.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 22:39, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

:Feel free to work on wikiversity. I think we need to make a section of the main page that invites people to describe what they would like to learn about. I agree with the idea that wikiversity should work on community building and the development of collaborations between learners and teachers.

I have high hopes that the board will approve, as I know at least Anthere is a fan of the project.  If you're interested in adding content, I'd say go ahead and do so.  Even if the answer ends up being no, I promise people will find some way to save the content.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 17:40, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:Here is how to save the content: most of the stuff at Wikiversity are textbook modules. Even the example [[Wikiversity:Forms:Circle]] is a textbook module.

In reply to MateoP (''You gloss over the interaction between professors and students (and students and students) as irrelevant.'') - this interaction is '''not''' irrelevant. I do think that the books at Wikibooks and the classes at Wikiversity (which are mostly lectures, list of participants, and external links) are &quot;essentially the same&quot; - why I wrote [[MetaWikipedia:No to Wikiversity]]. If Wikiversity was a forum where users had discussions, then I would believe that Wikiversity was different from Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:37, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

I would agree with MateoP (though I would phrase it differently.) The problem with so much of the web-based learning is that it IS just a book or lecture put to hardcopy. The concept we need to be directing ourselves is how do we make this interactive. Think about what you gained from college. Maybe the courses were good... maybe the content was good... but you definitely remember the people and networks you formed. That is what we need here to make it work. Not the largest cyber-keg party... but the ability for people to interact, exchange ideas, and form relationships. This ability to interact and exchange ideas will be what sets us apart from the traditional web course... that ability to form an &quot;academic community.&quot;--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 04:31, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

== Lets not limit ourselves to wikibooks not yet made ==

As much as I love wikibooks, I think we need a more stable base to start this joint. I suggest using any and all open textbooks right now.

The perfect ideal of course, is to use wikibooks in conjunction with wikiversity. But that ideal has a problem in itself. Wikibooks are living books, they are moving targets. The wikiversity will be required to change their lectures and keep up with wikibooks. What if chapter 1 gets split into 2 chapters? Then wikiversity will have lectures for chapter 5 which really are for chapter 6.

Of course, this problem will be corrected through time. Wikibooks probably won't go through major changes after they stabalize. But using an unstable wikibook as a base learning material would be inefficient at best.

I suggest using whatever materials possible to get the wikiversity on the road before working in the ideal. I'd hate for this project to stall. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

== No to online courses? ==

Does the new recommendations mean that we can't do online courses.  I'm putting together a course here:  [[Interventionism in Latin America During the Cold War: US and USSR]] and want to know if I should stop.  I'm not clear with what their recommendations mean.  If there are no online courses, does this mean that &quot;wikiversity&quot; would basically just be a place for people to come together and research to improve other wiki articles?  If it is &quot;no online courses&quot; could someone direct me to another place where I can hold my course (like the education wiki maybe?)..  Thanks.  --[[User:MateoP|MateoP]] 16:19, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

:I agree with the Board that it does not make sense to try to make '''conventional''' university courses the priority at Wikiversity. I think that the Board is looking for innovative e-learning that takes full advantage of the wiki format. If not conventional courses, then what? One suggestion had been that Wikiversity produce and archive &quot;teaching materials&quot; that could be shared globally. A second suggestion is that Wikiversity could be a learning community where various &quot;learning projects&quot; would exist. In my view, learning in Wikiversity should center around editing wiki documents (webpages). Learning would be through hands-on participation in Wikiversity projects. Initially, Wikiversity projects could center on &quot;services&quot; provided for other existing WikiMedia projects, particularly Wikipedia. Wikiversity could be a place for teaching Wikipedia editors how to find sources and evaluate references to include in Wikipedia articles so that all of the content of Wikipedia becomes verifiable. Currently, there are efforts towards this end within Wikipedia, but they need help. Wikiversity could archive all of the research performed by Wikipedia editors and Wikiversity researchers as they search for reliable sources to support what is said in Wikipedia articles. Only the best sources and conclusions from this Wikiversity background research would be transferred over to actual Wikipedia articles while the bulk of the sources (and probably BIG ARGUMENTS over their relative importance) would remain available at Wikiversity where it could continue be built upon in the future. The advantage for Wikiversity in starting with &quot;service courses&quot; for other wiki projects would be that it would provide a large pool of Wikiversity participants. Once Wikiversity learned how to form and facilitate useful learning communities for other wiki projects such as Wikiversity, then it would naturally expand in other directions starting from its initial foundation of &quot;service courses&quot;. In particular, I think that there will be a place in Wikiversity for the study of topics like [[Interventionism in Latin America During the Cold War: US and USSR]], but there is no reason that such e-learning projects could not start with an effort to make sure that Wikipedia has good coverage of Latin America. Eventually there could be links from Wikipedia articles about Latin America to the Wikiversity project called [[Interventionism in Latin America During the Cold War: US and USSR]] and those links would probably provide the main source of Wikiversity participants for the project. You could add &quot;work to improve Wikipedia articles&quot; to your list of &quot;Ideas or proposed study tasks&quot;. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 23:09, 11 December 2005 (UTC)
::I'm not interested in teaching people how to find sources.  What i am interested in is teaching and learning about topics [[Interventionism in Latin America During the Cold War: US and USSR|such as this]], and then using what is learned to improve wikimedia articles (i put in my course outline that editing Wikipedia and Wikibook articles would be part of assignments).  So does this fit into where Wikiversity seems to be heading?  Of course I want discussion about the topic to be an essential part of the course, not just jumping into article editing.  --[[User:MateoP|MateoP]] 23:49, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

:If you teach any subject it is a good idea to explaining the sources that you rely upon. If you give someone a fish, you feed them for a day. If you teach someone to fish, you feed them for life. If you do not show someone how to find and evaluate sources, then all you are doing is force feeding them one POV about a topic. Anyhow, the idea of orienting Wikiversity &quot;courses&quot; around existing wiki projects such as Wikipedia is probably what the Board is looking for. See this article about [[m:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal|modifications to the Wikiversity proposal]] for a central place to discuss modifications that will satisfy the Board. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 21:50, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

I think that the best thing this site could do is to list a bunch of textbooks for each course. For the intro to psychology, you might list The Essentials of Understanding Psychology by Robert Feldman. This is the best way to start Wikiversity.

I agree with this idea and have an additional suggestion.  I think it would be powerful to have a suggested syllibi for each course that outlines course objectives, topics of study, a suggested timeline, and recommended reading materials (from wikipedia, wikibooks, textbooks, articles, etc.).  For a start, it would allow online learners to skip or supplement the material gathering phase of online research by pointing out good resources and defining terms and ideas of a certain course topic. --[[User:Jcorrales|Jcorrales]] 18:40, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

==Prewritten Proposal to Teachers==
I know that a lot of students wouldn't want to take the time to write up a snippet of information about Wikiversity to send their teachers. Why not make a prewritten &quot;30-seconds-to-read&quot; letter that overviews the project and recommends that he or she write or help create a course? This way, students would be able to just highlight the text, paste it in an email, and send it to their teachers. [[User:Foxjwill|Foxjwill]] 23:11, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
:Great idea!  Do not ask the stacked board for permission, just do it.  You might also challenge the students/teachers to write up their extra credit homework in the appropriately placed course (creating a new course title or section if necessary) and then send the link to the public work to teachers, mentors, parents or peers requesting review, comment or grading.  Of course it would help to have a stable name space and basic policy in place such that we appear to be a going concern when an instructor or peer show up to look the work over.   The rumor that poor first impressions can be killers that are hard to overcome is well documented in various business marketing, management and pop pyschology sources. [[user:lazyquasar]]

==Formation of an Advisory Board/Group==
We are developing well as a project, but I see several things beginning to occur:

* We have some definite conflict with the Wikibooks folks and this could be problematic down the road if it continues.

* We need a core group of folks to organize and begin bringing stuff together.

* We need a support structure for those who are new to help them gain momentum.

In the early stages of any project (while this has been going on for awhile) there should be some core group to assist with the development and management of the process. Much like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EA Esperanza] seems to be a positive influence on Wikipedia, we should look seriously at something similar.

== Naming standards for courses ==

I've been doing some plowing through Wikibooks and I've come across some module titles that are really more Wikiversity course oriented modules rather than a book.  The goal I have is to index all Wikibooks (which is not as easy of a task as I first thought!).  Since these are course outlines rather than a book, I've been leaving these off of the book index.  The distinction isn't exactly clear, but there are some differences.  These are indexed through the various schools of Wikiversity, so the content isn't exactly lost.

If Wikiversity were on its own domain (hint, hint... yeah, I'm working on that too), it wouldn't be a problem either, but for now Wikiversity and Wikibooks are sharing domain space.  I am proposing at least for now that a seperate pseudonamespace like '''Course:''', '''Subject:''', or '''Wikiclass:''' be used for these pages.  Any other thoughts here with regular Wikiversity users?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:16, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

:I don't think this is necessarily as big of a deal as it is being made out to be.  The originator (aka the person who made the image) is [[User:Zephram Stark]], who has also been a significant contributor to both Wikibooks and Wikiversity.  That his major work is currently up for a VfD right now is certainly not endearing him to Wikibooks at the moment, however.  He has also been quite active on Wikipedia, and indeed brought some of his &quot;enemies&quot; to Wikibooks as well.

:From what I can tell, you are correct that it should be GFDL'd and not just granted to the Wikimedia Foundation, and that is an interesting dilemma for the foundation to consider if they should accept as a major project logo something that has been GFDL'd.  In this case, however, the logo hasn't been formally accepted by participants or anything seriou, just that it is a logo that has been created for the project.  The real solution to this would be to create alternative logos for Wikiversity and try to hold a contest for it.  It would be fun to move on to less serious stuff like trying to decide the logo for Wikiversity.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:04, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

==Grading and certification==
=== Grading ===
An important part of the traditional classroom experience is grading assignments.  You often don't know how well you're really understanding or not understanding material until you turn in an assignment and get some feedback.  It would seem useful to have a mechanism for confidential submission of assignments, so people can't just copy off the students who finish first.  (For assignments where that sort of thing matters.)  This could be just done by e-mail, or some improvements to the wiki software might enable it.  There's also the question of whether or not grades would be made public.  There are some privacy and also some legal concerns there.  -- [[User:Beland|Beland]] 02:24, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

:We could have it on a Special: page. That way it's like your Watchlist, only you can see the contents.  Whereas email exclusivity has problems, such as losing the email. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:25, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

I think tools supporting personal assessment will be critical to success.  Personally I am not much interested in some self appointed authority's opinion of my understanding of the material.  Rather I am interested in the universe's response when I attempt to field some new space related technology or product.  I agree that expert evaluation will become needed and necessary to achieve accreditation (a critical long term goal, I myself and past employers have both placed a premium value on my B.S. in Engineering Physics from an accredited institution, I think we are self delusional if we think people wish to undertake serious study with no assurance that they will ever be able to use the material for personal goals or gain) but I think that over reliance on external evaluation is one of the major pitfalls that has been impacting the quality of educational resources in the U.S.  With external evaluation there is a tendency for students to learn to game the system to get high marks now with good intentions of understanding the material later.  This allows poor students to graduate with high marks and incompetence in critical fields in the U.S.  This has large negative impacts on the student and society as resources are misapplied and wasted and errrors in the field are required to wash out or imprison incompetents who have unintentionally, negligently or fraudulently damaged others.  External grading is necessary but not sufficient to achieve our goal of improving education via the free online elearning strategy. [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 19:10, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

=== Grading and formats ===

I just saw Wikiversity.  Great concept but we certainly need a grading scheme.  Given a grading scheme
it would not be too hard to define what a degree consists of.  The only problem I can see from the very open
Wikiversity attitude is that I see no difference between a student and a teacher - can a student make up
all the questions and then answer them :-? 

It is very difficult to get  teachers involved in this kind of thing - I've been trying a more modest effort for several years and it is moving much more slowly than I would like.  But surely this is also to some extent a
question of permissible formats:  Can I easily upload all sorts of formats into Wikiversity or do I need
to retype everything in a specified wiki format?  I would think that there are a lot of very well 
structured latex books and slides which could be made available...   Also, I believe that students have
a need to see things on paper so one needs to be able to print everything easily - e.g. an entire course...

Finally, I have found it important to be able to write/enter/upload graphics and quiz questions in the
form of programming code (read fig/xfig, R, gnuplot etc) which automatically generates html, postscript,
pdf, png etc, depending on the required output.  I do not think it is enough to merely look at the content
on web pages.  Can one do this in Wikiversity?

[[User:Gstefans|Gstefans]] 18:56, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

:Wiki format is a limited subset of HTML with a few tools added by users. You can upload text and others will help you standardize the format. A method of standardized testing is something I have been arguing for since before the project began. Wikiversity is nothing more than a name without it. Additional functionality in the core code is required to enable real testing. That could come in one or both of two forms: expanded programming privileges granted to teachers within their specific testing areas, or a standardized testing form that would allow teachers to plug in questions or provide a testing bank of questions for a randomized test. I'm sure you realize that this would not entirely prevent fraud, so no certification could be given based on these tests alone. However, just as in physical universities, tests can be a measure of progress with some safeguards when combined with mid-terms and finals taken at a controlled testing facility. --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 17:05, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

===Certification===

Unless a student plans on always working for himself, knowledge of a discipline won't do him any good without proof that he '''''has''''' that knowledge and can put it to good use.  In my opinion, proof should not come from the &quot;good name&quot; of the school, but from some objective measure.

The classes that I have taught for the last twenty years are centered around achieving a quantifiable goal of some practical knowledge upon completion.  The level of knowledge, speed and skill is then demonstrated through third-party testing, available to anyone, whether they take the course or not, to generate an unbiased comparison of the student's abilities compared with those of people working in the industry or graduating from other schools.  Taking a particular class from a particular school is largely irrelevant to whether or not a student is qualified to do the job.  Hence, certification of a particular level of competency should not be tied to a school or a course, but to a demonstrable skill level in an unbiased environment.  --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 06:09, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

: Do you need a certification to apply knowledge? While I see this as a great bonus to Wikiversity if a certification could actually happen, I see this as both an unattainable and unnecessary goal. Again, it would be great, but it just seems like it would be too much trouble to get actual certifications. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

::Now that some time is passed, do you still see it as an unnecessary goal? Without standardized certification, we will not get students. Without students, we have no school. Certification is a huge undertaking, but proof and quantification of learning is a going to be a necessary requirement for almost any student. --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 16:51, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

This is going to be a free university.  Accreditation is nearly impossible.  And unnecessary.  Any students who participate in wikiversity would be doing so for their only personal knowledge only.  No, you're wrong when you say knowledge of a discipline will do no good without proof; knowledge is worthy of having for its own sake.  --[[User:MateoP|MateoP]] 20:36, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

: The effort to gain knowledge for its own sake is a commendable endeavour, but it would be useless if people don't trust that the knowledge you have gained is complete and relavent. I would not like to gain knowledge that I was unable to use because no one either believed I had it, or didn't trust it. Wikiversity may not require formal accreditation status, but if Wikiversity can construct a course, and a good way to test their students, the Wikiversity will be able to carry its own academic clout regardless of if its accredited. 

: The accumulation of knowledge is what Wikipedia is about, the application and improvement of that knowledge is what a learning is about. Wikiversity should be able to increase the populations understanding, and in doing that the population can then improve on Wikipedia.  --[[User:Ciaran.mooney|Ciaran Mooney]] 11:41, 11 Feburary 2006 (GMT)

===Testing by Employers===

The instructor developing the course could also create a standardized certification testing method.  One way to keep Certification free and unbiased is to have a potential employer sponsor the testing.  An established firm that would like to hire a person based on a standardized skill level could offer to conduct the testing for that area in order to draw in potential employees and to verify their expertise.  A representative of the established firm would submit a request to the Wikiversity Testing Department for a certification exam and procedures bundle (available online by password).  The representative would sign a non-disclosure form and a promissory agreement to make the names, log-ins, and scores of those desiring certification available to the Wikiversity Testing Department after exams are finished.  Those demonstrating a particular skill level in the exam would have an official certification thumbnail placed on their user:page that leads to a printable version when clicked.  The graphic would include a disclaimer with the name of the established firm that conducted the physical testing.  --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 06:09, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

===Examination Institutions===

One problem with online certification is that there is no way to know wich person took the examination. And what materials he/she had at the time of it. That takes out credibility in the certification. One way to avoid this is by use of Examination Institution. The purpose of the institutions would be to exam the student and verify their documents. Some institutions (non profit org, goverment, etc) can do this for free. But others should be allowed to charge a small fee (like $20 per exam). That way they can cover the expenses on the examination (paying a person to give the exam, paper, usage of room, etc.). At the end of the test the result could then be send to a central database that will hold the student record. --[[Ricardo Santos|Ricardo Santos]] March 29, 2006

: I second this proposal.  There is no online way of examination which will retain the integrity of such a certification.  I further       
: propose that no other online assignments' marks be taken into account when grading a candidate, since this would also degrade the 
: integrity of any Wikiversity certification, since there is no way of verifying that the online assignment was indeed handed in by the
: candidate under consideration. --[[User:Huibrecht|Huibrecht]] 15:11, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiversity in Wikibooks ==

I must confess that I am unaware what is happening with the Wikiversity proposal. Whatever the result, however, I understand that textbooks for university students will remain on wikibooks. I therefore think Wikibooks should be ensuring that its own Wikiversity section looks like a textbook repository. This would mean rearranging the Wikiversity portal page, and transferring bits related to the Wikiversity proposal to the Wikibooks: namespace. I don't think this would take too much, nor do I think it would detract from the proposal, whilst it would have the benefit of emphasising that university textbooks are very much part of Wikibooks' offering. Before making this change, I note my ideas here first to allow for comment, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 23:04, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:Eventually, there should be a good deal of cooperation between Wikiversity and Wikibooks. Many Wikiversity participants will be looking for online textbooks. Some Wikiversity participants will engage in scholarly projects that will very useful to the development of online textbooks. What is important is creating ways for constructive interactions between the two projects. It will not be constructive for anyone to patrol Wikiversity in order to make sure that it does not contain anything like a textbook or to patrol Wikibooks and make sure that it does not contain anything that looks like a Wikiversity learning project. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 18:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

I imagine a Wikiversity section will remain in wikibooks and will host university level textbooks. No doubt, assuming a separate Wikiversity project proceeds, there would be links between the wikibooks wikiversity section and wikiversity.org. Are there any objections to changing what we now have on wikibooks, so that the wikiversity section of wikibooks looks like how it will be after a new wikiversity.org project is set up, with the all the non-textbook related content (eg policy discussion pages) moved to the Wikibooks namespace (where other Wikibooks policy is discussed)?

Either above or under the above I attempted to add a bullet and found the page protected, any admin is requested to add the bullet while any interested can debate with me here why we want &quot;students&quot; to become &quot;participants&quot; at Wikiversity by &quot;participating&quot; in any way they please.  Modifying electronic bytes to improve the product is cheap and easy way to help people learn something and is what Wikiversity is all about.

* Publish your course notes (note that we're talking to ''students'' here, not their instructors), lesson plans, topical essays, or reference works for others to review, modify or fork.

and

*Publish your course notes (note that we're talking to ''participant'' here, not their parasites or naysayers), lesson plans, topical essays, or reference works for others to review, modify or fork.

or simplify the entire bullet list by changing the damaging sabotage in the original bullet to:

&lt;b&gt;* Publish your course notes, lesson plans, topical essays, or reference works for others to review, modify or fork.&lt;/b&gt;

The entire point of Wikiversity is to start with whatever participation we get and evolve towards effective materials and participants.   Participants means however someone wants to use the site. Students, mentors, professors, teachers, cub scout leaders, self improvement clubs, entrepreneurial cliques, whatever.   Discouraging student participation is a very bad idea on the front page.

Thanks Lazyquasar

:Okay, first... calm down. The warning about the page being protected says, &quot;''This page has been locked so that only '''registered users''' can edit it''&quot; (my emphasis). [[User:Lazyquasar|You are a registered user]], so you can edit it if you just log in. Now, secondly: I'm the one who added the phrase &quot;''note that we're talking to ''instructors'' here, not their students''&quot; to the instructions/suggestions. Calling that &quot;sabotage&quot; is a gross exaggeration. My concern was simply that one can easily argue that instructors who develop their own course notes '''hold the copyright to those notes'''. Thus, there may be legal issues involved if students post class notes without their instructor's permission. I have modified the statement to better reflect those concerns. - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] 08:01, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

::I have already calmed down as you know if you have checked your discussion page. Now secondly, copyright is exactly the issue.  Perhaps we have a terminology problem.  Obviously handouts or large volumes of verbatim repetition of the instructors materials will requirement their permission as they hold copyright.  The copyright to a student's &quot;course notes&quot; or &quot;notebook&quot; created by them as they assemble paraphrased materials to study from obviously belongs to the student and is well within their rights as copyright holders to publish.  Implying that we do not want participation from students donating their materials for coordination and group study between particpants improving the material as they interact socially to the wiki is diametrically opposed to the consensus or agreement to disagree that emerged during the Wikiversity proprosal development over the last year.  The issue of being a site for &lt;b&gt;educational professionals only&lt;/b&gt; was raised and dismissed in favor of broad participation of any interested in improving local content via the wiki while studying via group interaction or self study of the materials made available via the wiki.   &quot;(students might want to get the permission of their instructors first)&quot; is better than outright patronizing of students but should be relocated to the submittal screen notice if required and corrected to &quot;please do not illegally post copyrighted materials of others, permission to release the copyrighted materials under the FDL is required from the owners of the copyright&quot;.  I believe it has some similar already.  &quot;Personally created student notebooks with short specific quotes and appropriate citations in accordance with fair use provisions of copyright law are materials belonging to the student and may be posted.&quot;   This should be run by our copyright experts and improved and approved if there is concern about people's use or interpretation of &quot;notebook&quot; or &quot;course materials&quot;.  In any future changes please do not imply that some of our partipants interactions are presumed inferior or inappropriate and not welcome.  All participants are welcome to post their own materials for &quot;merciless editing&quot; until an offical coordinated policy says otherwise.  [[user:lazyquasar]]

== Move to Wikibooks namespace ==

The project/discussion pages on Wikiversity are not really pages of textbooks. I therefore intend to start moving these over to the more appropriate Wikibooks namespace - so that project pages starting Wikiversity: will instead start with Wikibooks:Wikiversity/ . I do not intend to move the textbook pages that begin with &quot;Wikiversity&quot;. If anyone has comments before the move, please do so here. Thanks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 09:28, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

:I do not really understand all of the implications of the different namespaces you are refering to above. I have been assured by Mr. Wales that the Board is supportive of getting Wikiversity started soon and by the members of the &quot;activation committee&quot; appointed by the &quot;Special Projects Committee&quot; that action will be forthcoming soon to finalize the initial Wikiversity project scope and wiki assets.  Rather than shuffling the materials at this time it might be advantageous to wait and allow Wikiversity people to transwiki or fork all the appropriate Wikiversity specific materials.   The Wikiversity project really does not need the further confusion of materials shifting around at this time.  Interest has waned dramatically over the last six months as the project has been stalled in limbo and this further confusion could be very detrimental to the new attempts to launch a successful project.  [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 03:30, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

I am more mindful that the Wikibooks project, which has hosted this proposal, which in strictness it really wasn't obliged to do, should get back to normal and showcase the textbook content within Wikiversity as a full integral part of its own. If we knew a date for a Wikiversity project to start that was near, we could plan around it - but there have been so many delays with Wikiversity, which suggests we should not wait. I also think that having all Wikversity project pages labelled up as Wikibooks:Wikiversity would help with the move - currently some but not all of the pages beginning with Wikiversity: are project pages - identifying the difference should be useful. However, I do think it is time for the Wikibooks project to regularise itself, and that remains the motivation behind this proposed tidy-up, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:17, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:I have been treating Wikiversity as a seperate namespace for some time, and I don't know why this was even proposed.  Please don't go moving Wikiversity content elsewhere other than to something tied directly to Wikiversity itself.  If Wikiversity is to remain on Wikibooks (that would require some more work and policy changes) I would hope that it would become a seperate namespace.  For now, please leave the Wikiversity pages in place, especially if they have a Wikiversity prefix.  I find it unfortunate that Wikiversity participants are more comfortable adding content to Meta now than Wikibooks, for what should be project content, like [[meta:Wikiversity community]].  There is obviously a very hostle attitude right now toward Wikiversity participants if content like this is even made on Meta.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:49, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

::I agree with you, Robert, that the Wikiversity content on Wikibooks should be left alone until it is transwikied (which ''is'' imminent). I'm not sure I agree about the hostility, though - I think the content on Meta is of a different kind to here (planning, policy and process, as opposed to actual educational content). I do feel I should have worked more on content of interest here on Wikibooks - I think I've simply been waiting for the separate domain all this time. Maybe this attitude hasn't helped..

== Small Spelling Mistake ==
Just wanted to point out that under the &quot;Some Ideas for Effective Initial Participation&quot; section, the emboldened &quot;edit mercilously&quot; should be spelled &quot;edit mercilessly&quot;.  Just thought I'd point it out, seeing as how it's on the main page and everything. :)

== See comments on blog ==

I've blogged a bit on the missing piece in Wikiversity at http://twofish.wordpress.com/

I lot of my comments are based on what happened in the &quot;beta prototype&quot; for an online university at http://www.gnacademy.org/

The thing that someone (probably Wikiversity) can and should provide is a lot of learning support services.  Academic advising.  Career counselling.  Research help.  Financial aid.

I'm a high school student that wants to be a high-energy particle physicist.  How do I do this?

== University departments are evil.... ==

And I think we need to get rid of them from wikiversity.  University departments exist to allocate budgets and exercise administrative lines of power.  Since we don't have a budget and there is no administrative line of power, there is no need for them here.  The problem with departments is that they draw lines that prevent people from interacting.

I suspect that [[m:Wikiversity:Communities|learning projects]] will be an important type of community group within WIkiversity. We will need many ways to organize and categorize learning groups and help Wikiversity participants find the specific Wikiversity learning communities that match their personal learning goals. A listing of conventional university schhools, departments and courses could be useful to help guide Wikiversity participants to Wikiversity projects and activities. Even if conventional university departments are too restrictive, that does not mean that Wikiversity departments would have to adopt the negative aspects of bricks-and-mortar schools. Wikiversity departments can be fluid and supportive of inter-disciplinary communication......everything is only a hyperlink away. Do we really have to call them &quot;wikidepartments&quot; in order to get people to think in the wiki way? --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 13:41, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

I certainly can't imagine a point where we would be restrictive based on the names of our departments.  There's tons of overlap and certainly we should encourage the overlap in this arena.  And while I agree University departments traditionally discourage this behaviour, I have to agree that [[User:Vitalij zad|vitalij]] is right in that we've got to help people find what they are looking for.

1) there will be a domain at beta.wikiversity.org, where all new
languages may contribute and start working on translation of guidelines
etc...

2) those languages with at least 10 active participants can request a
separate domain name. As of today, I presume the english language has at
least 10 people interested, so you guys may bug Brion to ask for
en.wikiversity.org. I am not sure if it is the case for any other language.

3) All sites will be flagged &quot;beta&quot; in the same way that wikinews has
been for at least 6 months.

4) During these 6 months, guidelines should be developped, *in
particular* with regards to collaborative research. We would hope that
these guidelines are as much as possible developped on the beta site (in
particular collaborative research), so that all languages share a common
goal and a few common non negociable rules.

5) At the end of these 6 months period, the project will be reviewed, in
particular so that the issue of collaborative research is qualified, and
if possible to define whether the beta stage is over. Reviewal will be
done by Spc.

== Old issues ==

There are a lot of issue to sort out on this book, before we get going.
*Firstly, we need to choose a transcription system. Should it be Latin-3, Unicode, X-system... you know the rest...
*How can we change the content to be more suitable for an Esperanto book? [[The original version came from the [[Spanish]] module. On that note, see the [[Talk:Spanish]] page.
*Any suggestions for chapters?
*Lastly, lets get writing!

:This wiki is in UTF-8, you can type Unicode straight into it. (Aŭtomata X-konvertado estas starigita ĉe la esperantlingva vikipedio por faciligi la laboron por tiuj, kiuj ne ĝuste agordis sian komputilon por Esperanto, sed ĉi-momente neeblas tiun enŝalti por nura parto de la vikio. Eble iam poste, sed mi havas sufiĉe da laboro kaj restas multe farenda pri lingvoj en la vikisistemo...) --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] 05:40, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Concerning the chapters, I don't think they are in the best order (and some of them aren't very relevant); for example, ''Traveling'' seems rather... inappropriately placed, seeing as what would usually be covered under that (riding taxis, catching flights, etc.) isn't something that is possible to use Esperanto for...  Anyways, I was thinking that it would be good to stick in a chapter somewhere concerning describing people, places, etc., rather near the beginning, just to give the readers a basic vocabulary, so they feel like they're actually learning something... --[[User:Travisg|travisg]] 00:08, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Cxu mi bobe komprenas, ke ni povas komune verki Esperanto-libron, respektive lernolibron? Cxu la x-sistemo ne funkcias en Vikipedio suficxe bone? Mi pensas ke jes. Eble anstataux la libro-titolo &quot;Esperanto&quot; (kiu sonas al mi same
kiel &quot;La cxehxa lingvo&quot;) estas tro largxa temo. Eble ni devus verki plurajn elektronikajn librojn pri Esperanto, ekz. &quot;Esperanto-lernolibro&quot;, &quot;Esperanto-infolibro&quot;, &quot;Esperanto-junularo&quot;, &quot;Esperanto-enciklopedio&quot;(mi pensas nun pri simila verko, kiu estis presita en 30-aj jaroj kaj iam en 1980 represita), &quot;Esperanto-historio&quot;, ... cxu ne?

:Nu jes! Je la unua okulĵeto, ŝajnas al mi ke ĉi tiun paĝaron estas planita kiel lernolibro por anglalingvanoj. Se indas krei apartajn librojn pri specifaj temoj (kaj kompreneble por alilingvanoj), oni certe rajtas tion fari ankaŭ. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] 05:40, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)

== Move it over? ==

Esperanto is a different ''kind'' of language, and it serves a different ''function'' compared to natural languages such as Spanish.  This book should '''not''' follow the generic language-learning-book template.  That said, I think that this wiki may be the wrong place to start a &quot;Learn Esperanto&quot; book.  It might work, but perhaps we should use Esperanto in the way it was intended... by making sure that we have a version '''in''' Esperanto to translate to other languages.

There ''is'' an [[eo:Cxefpagxo|Esperanto wikibooks wiki]] but I am apparently the only real [[eo:Speciala:listusers|user]] at the moment.  In a fit of entheusiasm, I've gone and started a book there: '''''[[eo:La Esperanto Komensanta|La Esperanto Komensanta]]'''''.  How's the title?

--[[User:Rick MILLER|Rick MILLER]] 03:40, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Interactive Activities ==

Hey Everyone --

I posted a link ( http://langwidge.com/esperanto.html ) to some activities I had made to the bottom of the wikibooks. If anyone knows of any way to incorporate them into the actual wikibook you totally have my permission to do so -- they've just been sitting on my hard drive unedited for 5 years now -- I couldn't find any way to use Flash in the WikiBook, though, so I just made a link.

~Ravi

btw, wikibooks would support the interactive activities if they were just sound. If anyone wants to try and make something similar as an ogg file, but didn't have the technical resources/skills, write me: ravip(at)mit(dot)edu

== Slang appendix ==

I believe that would be very useful an appendix about how translate &quot;[[w:en:American|American]]&quot; slang to Esperanto.

Dankon

== accusative case ==

In lesson one, you say &quot;the accusative case ... will be covered in the next lesson&quot;, but it isn't.  &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash; [[User:212.139.34.221|212.139.34.221]] 21:29, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Just fixed that. I went into Lesson 1 and put in a section on objects. Though it probably needs some expansion and revision.

[[User:DroEsperanto|DroEsperanto]] 04:34, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

== wordlist? ==

Shouldn't Appendix C and Appendix D be ROOT lists, after all, you can make English, Englishman, English speaker, and English hater all out of the same root. I know the appendix hasn't been made, but before it is begun, shouldn't have a correct title? --[[w:User:ThrashedParanoid|ThrashedParanoid]]
01:18, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

No one else has said anything about what's going on with the two wordlist appendices, but regardless i have started reformatting them. Since the [[Esperanto/Appendix_D|Esperanto-English appendix]] is already populated, i'm starting there. First, i am using templates rather than raw tables - which will make it ''much'' easier to change the styling if necessary, and allow for consistent styling across the whole book. Second, i have changed the style somewhat because the old style had ''way'' too much padding - each entry of the table took up three or four times the vertical space. Third, i have started adding styling to the sections that weren't styled (and were damn near illegible clumps of word soup) and fixed some broken code. i will work my way down the page - it should only take a couple of days - but once it's all done, the whole page will be in a single, regular format which can be easily changed into anything else you like. (Especially by script - just say what you want and i can change the whole list in minutes.) --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 09:01, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

== Lesson 4! ==

Hura! Lesson 4 is up! Though due to laziness, I have yet to add anything on the affectionate suffixes for male and female, nor have I said anything regarding &quot;bo&quot; or &quot;pra&quot;.
[[User:DroEsperanto|DroEsperanto]] 23:46, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

== Amount of grammar ==

Since Esperanto has a very easy grammar, I don't think we have to introduce it almost all at once. Students get scared away if they have to read through 3 screens full of grammar explanations before they learn how to say anything in a language. When teaching German, French or Russian, it is quite difficult to teach students to say something without having to introduce a lot of grammar at once, particularly in the first lesson, but even that is doable (see my Wikibook [[BLL German]]). In Esperanto, it should be no problem at all to write a lesson introducing e. g. just -as and -o (no -n even at first since the word &quot;Accusative&quot; alone will send students of German or Russian running) and to do so in a natural conversation, for example a round of introductions at a congress. Keep in mind that this Wikibook should probably not look like a textbook used during an Esperanto course. Self-study has different demands on material than classroom study. The most crucial difference is that self-study books have to keep the students' motivation up. As soon as something appears too difficult or too boring, many students will stop studying the course or maybe stop studying the language altogether, since they're not at High School where they have to continue taking the class or write exams and they're not working with a private teacher whom they could ask for additional explanations or who could re-motivate them. 

I believe the ideal structure for an Esperanto course would be:
# Text or Dialogue from a situation the student might find himself in (and yes, asking for the way or the like could be part of it, if you imagine a Pasporta Servo kind of situation of an international Esperanto-speaking visitor and a local speaker)
# Vocabulary
# Grammar
# Exercises for grammar and word usage
# Information about the Esperanto movement
# Maybe a list of additional vocabulary for those students who would like to have more words to use along the same patterns taught in the lesson. E. g. if the lesson teaches how to say that you're from a particular country, you wouldn't want to put in lots and lots of country names in the main vocabulary list of words that the student will absolutely have to know in the next lesson. Instead, you could put them in an optional vocabulary list, which the student can use to look up the name of his country and any country he is particularly interested in. Part of motivation is also the feeling that you aren't taught anything useless, only commonly-used vocabulary and vocabulary highly relevant to your own situation. 

There is a Wikibook about creating good language-teaching Wikibooks, for those interested in more tips for coursebook-writing. And I tried summarising the approach that I found worked best for self-study courses in natural languages in the article [[Bite-sized language lessons]].

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 08:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

:I believe that this would be a great structure to learn ANY language, not solely Esperanto.&lt;br&gt;I would really appreciate it if someone were to add that 'additional vocabulary', since I just started learning Esperanto (like half an hour ago) and feel like the amount vocabulary is out of sink with the grammar (although all this grammar was still easy enough for me) and would like to learn more words to get into sink again.  --[[User:JorisvS|JorisvS]] 11:22, 4 August 2006 (UTC)
:I've already started the first extra vocabulary list in lesson 1, but I need someone to expand it. --[[User:JorisvS|JorisvS]] 11:34, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
:To address JorisvS point - I need to have a good read of all this.  I take the line below, but you do need some basic bits and pieces to make up sentences with.[[User:Stevebritgimp|Stevebritgimp]] 19:51, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

Personally I disagree on the main point (in the gentlest possible way).  The point of Esperanto is that it has an entirely regular grammar, and so grammar is easy to learn.  If I were teaching Esperanto to a small group of people I would almost immediately talk about, say, the tenses - past and future.  Now if you were learning French in school you wouldn't do tenses until the second year, or at least quite a few weeks or months down the line.  I do very much agree that using the grammatical terms for things (like accusative) while fine on talk, should be avoided in lessons - in fact accusative itself is a mistake by Latin grammarians.  Best use 'object'.

Following on from that I think the classic 'phrasebook' or 'expressions' approach is not ideal for Esperanto, given that it is international and don't have idiom.

A lot to discuss - I wonder if this is something that floats people's boat - Esperanto's great strength is its simplicity and that it illustrates how other languages work.  [[User:Stevebritgimp|Stevebritgimp]] 19:49, 27 December 2006 (UTC)  P.S. Anyone encountered [[w:Michel Thomas]]' approach to teaching languages? [[User:Stevebritgimp|Stevebritgimp]] 19:51, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

== Lesson 10 ==

===''Venturo'' or ''veturo''?===
It says in lesson 10: &lt;br&gt;
ŝip- (ship) + ventur (travel) = ŝip(o)veturo (a journey by ship) &lt;br&gt;
This doesn't look correct. What is there correct translation of 'a journey' in Esperanto?&lt;br&gt;
--[[User:JorisvS|JorisvS]] 15:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== False Friends ==

Oh my gosh!  What happened to the section on False Friends?!  It looks like it was deleted, and right when I was about to learn from it!  Why was it deleted?  What can be done/what should I do?--[[User:Gabriel Koulikov|Gabriel Koulikov]] 20:06, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
== Esperanto Wikiversity course ==
The Wikiversity course is very bare and needs further development. Right now it just has links to the standard e-mail course but not much else. If anyone could help develop it that would be greatly apreciated. The link is here: http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introductory_Esperanto#.5B.5BPortal:Learning_Materials.7CLearning_materials.5D.5D

Thanks

== Add some flare! ==

I was thinking, why not add a welcome page and some nice graphics, similar to [[Spanish]] and [[German]]? I think that a good first impression will make learning from this wikibook easier. [[User:Sandman85048|Sandman85048]] 21:49, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

== Merge introduction ==

The introduction section is in all these tiny little bits.. why not just put them in one page and set up redirects? [[User:Sandman85048|Sandman85048]] 23:02, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

== Translated navigation??? ==

This book is intended to be for English speakers (anything else belongs in other language versions of Wikibooks) who don't know any Esperanto yet and wish to learn it. Hence, we can't have the navigation in Esperanto, because they won't understand it and will leave these pages discouraged from learning Esperanto. Not to mention that with the current translations, Esperanto speakers won't easily understand the items either...
[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 18:38, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

That's a good idea, my friend. Japanese is difficult enough for me to learn; since I'm now tackling an artificial language, baby steps are necessary here. --[[Special:Contributions/74.130.244.188|74.130.244.188]] ([[User talk:74.130.244.188|talk]]) 21:53, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

== Renaming pages ==

The [[Wikibooks:Manual_of_Style|manual of style]] frowns on naming pages as we have done here. I am going to go through renaming all &quot;lesson&quot; and &quot;appendix&quot; pages properly. All &quot;lesson&quot; pages are going to be renamed from, for example, &lt;tt&gt;Esperanto/Lesson 1&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;Esperanto/Introducing yourself&lt;/tt&gt; (with English titles like &quot;Introducing yourself&quot; rather than Esperanto ones like &quot;Enkonduko&quot; because this is the English Wikibooks) - and then I will turn &lt;tt&gt;Esperanto/Lesson 1&lt;/tt&gt; into a redirect to &lt;tt&gt;Esperanto/Introducing yourself&lt;/tt&gt;. All &quot;appendix&quot; pages are going to be renamed from, for example, &lt;tt&gt;Esperanto/Appendix A&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;Esperanto/Appendix/Esperanto alphabet and pronunciation&lt;/tt&gt;, along with a redirect. This is the total list of changes I will make:

* Lessons
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 1&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Introducing yourself&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 2&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Travelling&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 3&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Recreational activities&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 4&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Family&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 5&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;School&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 6&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Shopping&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 7&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Household&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 8&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Esperanto culture&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 9&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;World Congress&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Lesson 10&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Word synthesis&lt;/tt&gt;
* Appendices
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix A&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Alphabet and pronunciation&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix B&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Solutions to exercises&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix C&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/English-Esperanto word list&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix D&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Esperanto-English word list&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix E&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Abbreviations&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix F&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Summary of grammar&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix G&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Web resources&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix H&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Table of correlatives&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix I&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Table of word endings&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix J&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Table of affixes&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix K&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/False friends&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix L&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Slang&lt;/tt&gt;
*# &lt;tt&gt;Appendix M&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;Appendix/Common phrases&lt;/tt&gt;

The reasons for this, other than better conformance to the Wikibooks manual of style, should be painfully obvious I think. Lessons and appendices will be easy to add, remove and shuffle around (and clearly some shuffling is needed - why is &quot;World Congress&quot; a lesson? Are we going to be tested on it? &quot;Esperanto culture&quot; and &quot;World Congress&quot; should probably come ''after'' the lessons, after the language is taught and now you're discussing the culture). I'll be making this change sometime in February probably, or maybe March - unless I get a lot of negative feedback before then. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 21:08, 1 February 2010 (UTC)
:Sounds like a good idea. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 21:15, 1 February 2010 (UTC)

== Move worksheets to Wikiversity? ==

What do people think of the possibility of moving the worksheet-like sections to Wikiversity, and linking to them from within the appropriate section in the Wikibook? For example, we could remove the [[Esperanto/Introducing_yourself#Exercise : Translation|Exercise : Translation]] section from the first lesson, add something like [[v:User:Yair rand/eobooksandbox|this]] to Wikiversity, and link to that from the first lesson. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 23:49, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

:I think that's a great idea. Once I finish souping up the appendices, I intend to start on the lessons themselves, and I did intend to trim out the exercises. But if this textbook could have an associated course on Wikiversity, that would be even better. Would you like to talk about a lesson plan? I mean, not right away because I have to finish with the appendices first, but eventually we'll need a plan for the lessons - right now they're organized based on some other language textbook, but that's not really appropriate for Esperanto (when are you ever going to need to buy a plane ticket in Esperanto?). It would be cool if we could figure out a workable lesson plan for the Wikibook, and have exercises and lessons mirrored in Wikiversity, so that while either could stand alone, they work even better together. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 18:14, 11 March 2010 (UTC)

== Book layout ==

I have created a [[Esperanto/Manual of style|manual of style]] for this Wikibook (feel free to discuss that [[Talk:Esperanto/Manual of style|there]]). As I mentioned there, I think we need to talk about how to organize the main body of this book (thus far, all of my work has been souping up the [[Esperanto/Appendix|appendices]], which I will continue to do, of course). What should the book's layout be (Are we going to have a preface? A brief grammar intro before the in depth lessons?)? What should the lessons be like (How should grammar elements be introduced, and in what order? Should there be a consistent story to keep readers engaged, or isolated dialogues?)? --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 03:51, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

==Rewrite==
I'm working on a rewrite of this wikibook, as it has been incomplete for several years. I plan to present topics in this order. Feel free to suggest a different order.

*Lesson 1
**Nouns
**Adjectives
**Adverbs
**Personal and possessive pronouns
**Direct and indirect objects
**Prepositional phrases
*Lesson 2
**Infinitive
**Simple tenses/Active Voice
**Conditional mood
**Imperative mood
**Active and passive participles
**Questions
*Lesson 3
**Correlatives
**Participles as adverbs and nouns
*Lesson 4
**Word building with affixes
**Compound words
**Changing part of speech
*Lesson 5
**Complex tenses formed with participles

== Growing beyond the book format ==

My name is Ian and I'm from a project called Wikiotics, where we build free software tools for language instruction. We are starting to build collections of interactive language lessons that can serve as textbook replacements for students and this we would love for the Esperanto community to be represented.

If there is anyone here who is interested in expanding this content beyond a traditional text-based book format or who would like to incorporate interactive lessons we build based on the outline of this book, just chime in here or contact us at contact AT wikiotics DOT org or in irc at #wikiotics on freenode. 

As example of the kind of new materials you can make with our tools, here are examples our current lesson types:
* Picture choice lesson (http://wikiotics.org/en/Introduction), 
* Re-mixable Podcast (http://wikiotics.org/user/ian/FSI-Mandarin-Module01-Unit01), 
* Text multiple choice lesson (http://wikiotics.org/en/WANY_Hospital_grammar)

In addition, French uses several accents which are worth understanding. These are: à, è, ù, (grave accents) and é (acute accent). A circumflex applies to all vowels: â, ê, î, ô, û. A tréma (French for dieresis) is also applied: ä, ë, ï, ö, ü, ÿ. Two combined letters are used: æ and œ, and a cedilla is used on the c to make it sound like an English s: ç.

====Things of note about numbers:====

*For 70-79, it builds upon &quot;soixante&quot; but past that it builds upon a combination of terms for 80-99
*Only the first (21,31,41,51,61 and 71, but not 81 nor 91) have &quot;et un&quot; without a hyphen; but past this it is simply both words consecutively (vingt-six, trente-trois, etc.) with a hyphen in between.
*For 100-199, it looks much like this list already save that &quot;cent&quot; is added before the rest of the number; this continues up to 1000 and onward.

|-

|}

==V: Time==

In French, “il est” is used to express the time; though it would literally translate as “he is”, it is actually, in this case, equivalent to “it is” (unpersonal &quot;il&quot;). Unlike in English, it is always important to use “heures” (“hours”) when referring to the time. In English, it is OK to say, “It’s nine,” but this wouldn’t make sense in French.  The French time system traditionally uses a 24 hour scale.  Shorthand for writing times in French follows the format &quot;17h30&quot;, which would represent 5:30PM in English.

{| {{French/Table|Vocabulary|Time|Le temps||2}}
|Quelle heure est-il ?||What time is it?
|-
|Il est une heure.||It is one o’clock.
|-
|Il est trois heures.||It is three o’clock.
|-
|Il est dix heures.||It is ten o’clock.
|-
|Il est midi.||It is noon.
|-
|Il est minuit.||It is midnight.
|-
|Il est quatre heures cinq.||It is five past four.
|-
|Il est quatre heures et quart.||It is a quarter past four.
|-
|Il est quatre heures quinze.||It is four fifteen.
|-
|Il est quatre heures et demie.||It is half past four.
|-
|Il est dix-neuf heures moins le quart.||It is a quarter to seven, or six forty-five.
|-
|Il est quatre heures trente.||It is four thirty.
|-
|Il est cinq heures moins vingt.||It is twenty to five.
|-
|Il est quatre heures quarante.||It is four forty.

|}

*The days of the week are not capitalized in French.
*For phrases relating to the day of the week, see [[French/Vocabulary/Travel/Phrases|the phrasebook]].

Notes:
* ''What day is it today?'' is equivalent to ''Quel jour sommes-nous ?''.
* ''Quel jour sommes-nous ?'' can be answered with ''Nous sommes...'', ''C'est...'' or ''On est...'' (last two are less formal).
* ''Nous sommes...'' is not used with ''hier'', ''aujourd’hui'', or ''demain''. ''C'était'' (past) or ''C'est'' (present/future) must be used accordingly.

{{note|1|1}} ''Bien...'' is an adverb meaning ''well''. Its adjective equivalent is ''bon(ne)'', which means ''good''. Since ''je vais'', meaning ''I go'', uses an action verb,&lt;br&gt;
the adverb ''bien'' is used. In English, I'm good, which uses the linking verb ''am'', is followed by an adjective rather than an adverb.
&lt;p&gt;
{{note|2|2}} ''Est-ce que...'' doesn't mean anything (like the spanish upside down question mark) and is used to start a question.&lt;br&gt;
This can be used in a similar manner to ''do'' in English. Instead of ''You want it?'', one can say ''Do you want it?''
&lt;p&gt;
{{note|3|3}} ''chez...'' is a preposition meaning ''at the house of...''. ''Chez moi'' is used to say ''at my place''. ''Chez [''name'']'' is used to say ''at [''name'''s] place''. 
&lt;p&gt;
{{note|4|4}} ''on...'' can mean ''we'' or ''one''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Alphabet ==

The Esperanto alphabet has 28 letters.

;Uppercase
:A, B, C, Ĉ, D, E, F, G, Ĝ, H, Ĥ, I, J, Ĵ, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, Ŝ, T, U, Ŭ, V, Z
;Lowercase
:a, b, c, ĉ, d, e, f, g, ĝ, h, ĥ, i, j, ĵ, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, ŝ, t, u, ŭ, v, z
;Names
:a, bo, co, ĉo, do, e, fo, go, ĝo, ho, ĥo, i, jo, ĵo, ko, lo, mo, no, o, po, ro, so, ŝo, to, u, ŭo, vo, zo

Four letters from the English alphabet have been dropped &amp;ndash; '''Q''', '''W''', '''X''' and '''Y''' &amp;ndash; and there are six new accented letters: '''Ĉ''', '''Ĝ''', '''Ĥ''', '''Ĵ''', '''Ŝ''' and '''Ŭ'''.
The first five have an angle-shape accent called a ''circumflex'' ('''^''') over them, whilst the last has an accent rather like the bottom part of a circle, which is called a ''breve'' ('''˘''').

All of the accented letters are unique to Esperanto except for ''ŭo'' ('''Ŭ'''), which also exists in Belarusian, and ''ĝo'' ('''Ĝ'''), which also exists in Aleut.
Some of the accented letters may be used in transcription systems for languages that use non-Latin alphabets.
(For example, ''ŝo'' ('''Ŝ''') is used as the ISO 9:1995 transliteration of the Russian Cyrillic letter ''shcha'' ('''Щ''').)

=== Vowels ===

As in English, five letters are vowels ('''A''', '''E''', '''I''', '''O''', '''U'''), and the rest are consonants.
The letter ''ŭo'' ('''Ŭ''') is a consonant, not a vowel.&lt;!-- Note: maybe add sidebar about semivowels? --&gt;

=== Collation ===

Collation in Esperanto is the same as for English, except that the accented characters are counted as separate characters and collated after their non-accented versions.
Collation is as shown in the table above.

== Pronunciation ==

Each letter in Esperanto has only one pronunciation (allowing for cultural variation), and no letters are silent.
There are six dipthongs (see [[#Dipthongs|the next section]]), but their pronunciation follows logically from their constituent letters, except for being shortened into a single syllable.
This means that Esperanto is pronounced just as it is spelled.

Also, each sound has only one way of being written, so it is very easy to spell Esperanto words you hear.

The technical description for these traits is that Esperanto is ''phonetic'' and ''orthographic''.

&lt;center&gt;'''Be sure to make use of the [[Esperanto/Appendix/Alphabet and pronunciation|pronunciation appendix]].'''&lt;/center&gt;
==Grammar==
Since Esperanto is a very regular language, all its rules can be applied universally without exceptions. This means Esperanto grammar concepts are much easier to understand than those of natural languages. In this first lesson, we shall examine how to form nouns, adjectives, and the present tense.

===Nouns===
In any language, ''nouns'' are words that designate a person, place, thing, idea, or quality. Some examples of nouns in English are: &quot;house&quot;, &quot;friends&quot;, &quot;cake&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, and &quot;gardens&quot;.

In Esperanto, all nouns end in '''-o'''. The part of the word that goes before the '''-o''' is known as the ''root''. For example, in the word '''urbo''' (city), '''urb-''' is the root and the '''-o''' makes it a noun.

To make a noun plural, add a '''-j''' to the end, for example '''urboj''' (cities).

Some examples of nouns in Esperanto: {{Esperanto/wt|homo}} (human), {{Esperanto/wt|domo}} (house), {{Esperanto/wt|amikoj}} (friends), {{Esperanto/wt|kuko}} (cake), {{Esperanto/wt|Johano}} (John), {{Esperanto/wt|Francio}} (France) and {{Esperanto/wt|ĝardenoj}} (gardens).

To say ''a'' or ''an'', as in &quot;a town&quot;, just say the noun on its own, e.g. '''urbo''' (town, a town).  There is no indefinite article (&quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;) in Esperanto.

The word for ''the'' is '''la''', e.g. '''la urbo''' (the city). '''La''' never changes for singular or plural.

===Adjectives===
''Adjectives'' are words that describe a noun. Some English examples are: &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;tired&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;young&quot; and &quot;fresh&quot;.

To change an Esperanto noun into its corresponding adjective, replace the '''-o''' with an '''-a'''. For example, '''urbo''' (town) gives rise to '''urba''' (urban, &quot;relating to a town&quot;). 

Some examples of adjectives in Esperanto: {{bt|wt|feliĉa}} (happy), {{bt|wt|laca}} (tired), {{bt|wt|bela}} (beautiful), {{bt|wt|juna}} (young) and {{bt|wt|freŝa}} (fresh).

In Esperanto, an adjective must &quot;agree in number&quot; with the noun it describes. This means that if the noun is singular, the adjective must also be. If the noun is plural, the adjective must also be, too. Some examples: '''la freŝa kuko''' (the fresh cake), '''la freŝaj kukoj''' (the fresh cakes); '''feliĉa homo''' (a happy person), '''feliĉaj homoj''' (happy people).

The prefix '''mal-''' changes an Esperanto word into its opposite meaning - a feature that greatly reduces the vocabulary. Here are some examples of '''mal-''' words in Esperanto: {{bt|wt|malfeliĉa}} (unhappy), {{bt|wt|mallaca}} (alert, not tired), {{bt|wt|malbela}} (ugly), {{bt|wt|maljuna}} (old) and {{bt|wt|malfreŝa}} (stale).

===Adverbs===
''Adverbs'' are words that describe a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. They indicate manner, place, time or quantity. Some English examples are: &quot;quickly&quot;, &quot;orally&quot;, &quot;at home&quot;, and &quot;in writing&quot;.

To change an Esperanto word into an adverb, replace the usual ending ('''-a''' for adjectives, '''-o''' for nouns, and '''-i''' for verbs) with '''-e'''. The meaning of the base word determines whether it becomes a manner, place, time or quantity adverb.
*'''Manner''' - How something is done, ''&quot;He runs '''quickly'''.&quot;'' ; ''&quot;He submitted it '''in writing'''.&quot;''
*'''Place''' - Where something is done, ''&quot;He runs '''at home'''.&quot;''
*'''Time''' - When something is done, ''&quot;He runs '''on Sunday'''.&quot;''
*'''Quantity''' - ''&quot;He runs '''a lot'''.&quot;''

Some examples of adverbs in Esperanto: {{bt|wt|rapide}} (quickly), {{bt|wt|buŝe}} (orally), {{bt|wt|hejme}} (at home), and {{bt|wt|skribe}} (in writing).

Please note that not all adverbs use this rule, but the overwhelming majority of them do. Once you are introduced to these adverbs, it will be obvious why they are exceptions.

===Personal pronouns===
In Esperanto there are ten personal pronouns. However, you will initially need to only know seven of these pronouns.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Person
!Singular (one person) !!Plural (more than one)
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| First (the speaker)
|mi (I, me)
|ni (we, us)
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Second (the listener)
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;| vi (you, you all)
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;| Third (somebody else)
! Masculine
| li (he, him)
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;| ili (they, them)
|-
! Feminine
| ŝi (she, her)
|-
! Neuter
| ĝi (it)
|}

*The other pronouns (&quot;{{bt|wt|oni}}&quot;, &quot;{{bt|wt|si}}&quot;) will be covered later.
*&quot;{{bt|wt|Ci}}&quot;, a pronoun translated &quot;[[wiktionary:thou|thou]]&quot;, is rarely used.
*The third person neuter singular pronoun, &quot;ĝi&quot;, is not exactly the same as the English &quot;it&quot; because it can be used as a gender-neutral pronoun for a living person. For example, &quot;Look at that baby. I can't tell if '''it''' is a boy or a girl.&quot;

===Possessive pronouns===
To turn a personal pronoun into a possessive pronoun (which is an adjective), simply add an '''-a''' to the end.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Esperanto !! English
|-
| mia || my, mine
|-
| via || your, yours
|-
| ŝia || her, hers
|-
| lia || his
|-
| ĝia || its
|-
| nia || our, ours
|-
| ilia || their, theirs
|}

===Verbs - present tense===
The basic form of a verb is called its ''infinitive''. In English, this is the part of the verb that has &quot;to&quot; in front of it, as in the sentence &quot;John likes '''to play''' football&quot;. In Esperanto, the infinitive simply has an '''-i''' after the root, e.g. {{bt|wt|ludo}} (a game), {{bt|wt|ludi}} (to play).

The present tense has three forms in English. For example, one can say either &quot;I kick&quot;, &quot;I am kicking&quot; or &quot;I do kick&quot;; &quot;he laughs&quot;, &quot;he is laughing&quot;, &quot;he does laugh&quot;; &quot;Robert eats the cake&quot;, &quot;Robert is eating the cake&quot;, &quot;Robert does eat cake&quot;. All these forms are represented under one form in Esperanto.

To form the present tense of any Esperanto verb, simply substitute the '''-i''' in the root with '''-as'''. Some examples: '''mi legas''' (I am reading), '''li ridas''' (He is laughing), '''Roberto manĝas la kukon''' (Robert eats the cake).

You will also note that there is no verb conjugation in Esperanto for person. For example, in English you would say &quot;Bob eat'''s'''&quot;, &quot;I eat&quot;, and &quot;She eats&quot;; In Esperanto, you would use the same form of the verb: &quot;Bob manĝas&quot;, &quot;Mi manĝas&quot;, &quot;Ŝi manĝas&quot;.

===Objects and the accusative case===
Like in English, every complete declarative sentence in Esperanto requires at least two parts: a subject and a verb. In the sentence &quot;I ate&quot;, the subject is &quot;I&quot; and the verb is &quot;ate&quot;. A subject is a noun which performs an action. However, in the sentence &quot;I ate spaghetti&quot;, there is a third word: &quot;spaghetti&quot;. The word &quot;spaghetti&quot; in this sentence is what is known as a '''direct object'''. A direct object is a noun which is having an action performed on it. It is being &quot;verb'ed&quot;, so to speak.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Sentence !! Subject !! Verb !! Direct object
|-
| I ate spaghetti. || I || ate || spaghetti
|-
| The cat loves the dog. || the cat || loves || the dog
|-
| Bob insulted John. || Bob || insulted || John
|-
| Jennifer likes ponies. || Jennifer || likes || ponies
|-
| Frank gave Jane flowers. || Frank || gave || flowers
|}

Take special note of the last sentence. In the first three sentences, the direct object directly followed the verb. However, in the last sentence, the word &quot;Jane&quot; directly follows the verb &quot;gave&quot;. So why isn't Jane the direct object of the sentence? Because Jane is not having an action performed on her by the verb of the sentence, &quot;give&quot;. Frank is not giving Jane, Frank is giving flowers ''to Jane''. Since the flowers are what is being given, the flowers are the direct object.

So what is Jane in this sentence, then? Jane is what is known as an '''indirect object'''. An indirect object is a noun which is neither performing an action nor having an action performed directly upon it, but receiving the action of the verb less directly than the ''direct object'' (hence the name). In Esperanto, the indirect object will always take a preposition. For example, &quot;Frank baked '''Jane''' a cake&quot; becomes &quot;Frank baked a cake '''for Jane'''.&quot;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Sentence !! Subject !! Verb !! Direct object !! Indirect object
|-
| Frank gave Jane flowers. || Frank || gave || flowers || (to) Jane
|-
| Mary wrote Susan a letter. || Mary || wrote || a letter || (for) Susan
|-
| Harry read Dr. Phillips the message. || Harry || read || the message || (to) Dr. Phillips
|-
|}

This basal reader stuff is real cute. You'd almost believe that English could be a clear means of communicating. However, something working in the lab on small toy problems doesn't mean it will work on the complexities of real life. So now let's try some more advanced sentences in English.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Sentence !! Real Subject !! Incorrect Subject !! Real Verb !! Incorrect Verb !! Real Direct object !! Incorrect Direct object !! Real Indirect object !! Incorrect Indirect object
|-
| Now let's try more advanced sentences in English. || let's || || try_(attempt) || try_(hold due process against) || more advanced sentences in English || more advanced sentences || || in English
|-
| The history student's classmate found his faux pas offensive. || The history student's classmate || || found_(determined and classified) || found_(discovered) || his faux pas (tactless blunder) || his faux pas offensive (systematic campaign of tactless blunders) || (to be) offensive (infuriating)
|-
| The First Amendment to the United States Constitution makes the citizenry's trust in their ability to criticize their governor's administration of the draft presumptive. || The First Amendment to the United States Constitution || The First Amendment || makes_(converts and transforms) || makes_(redirects) || the citizenry's trust in their ability to criticize their governor's administration of the draft || the citizenry's trust in their ability to criticize their governor's administration of the draft presumptive || (into something that is) presumptive || to the United States Constitution
|}

As you can see, English sometimes chokes on the complexities of real life. The incorrect understanding of the sentence about the First Amendment has the same basic structure as &quot;The pilot makes the heading in the flight plan to the north.&quot;, giving the false parse a similar structure to &quot;The amendment redirects the trust in their ability to criticize, into the Constitution.&quot;, which would mean &quot;The First Amendment has persuaded the citizenry to trust that they are able to criticize the governor's administration of the presumptive draft on the grounds that the governor is administrating the presumptive draft unconstitutionally instead of trusting that they are able to criticize the governor's administration of the presumptive draft on other grounds.&quot;, which, depending on the minute details of history, the English language, and then-current law, could actually make sense, but is not the correct understanding of the grammar or the meaning of the sentence. People can sort of use their sapience to get past part of this problem, but in controversies, debates, and trials where words are deliberately or accidentally twisted, in technical fields, in natural language processing, and with English as a Foreign Language, this obviously isn't working. Now you know why natural language processing is an unsolved problem in computer programming. With thanks to Google Translate for its non-proficient but speedy and indispensable assistance, now let's see if a student's possibly incorrect Esperanto can do any better.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Sentence !! Subject !! Verb !! Direct object !! Indirect object
|-
| Franko donis floroj al Janino. || Franko || donis || floroj || (al) Janino
|-
| Mario skribis leteron al Susan. || Mario || skribis || leteron || (al) Susan
|-
| Mario legis la mesagxon al Doktoro Phillipo. || Mario || legis || la mesagxon || (al) Doktoro Philipo
|-
|}

We'll try that again with Esperanto. We'll start with the translation of &quot;Now let's try more advanced sentences in Esperanto.&quot;, which is &quot;Nun ni provu iom Esperantajn frazojn kiuj estas pli progresintaj.&quot;&lt;!----&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Sentence !! Real Subject !! Incorrect Subject !! Real Verb !! Incorrect Verb !! Real Direct object !! Incorrect Direct object !! Real Indirect object !! Incorrect Indirect object
|-
| Nun ni provu iom Esperantajn frazojn kiuj estas pli progresintaj. || ni || || provu || || iom Esperantajn frazojn kiuj estas pli progresintaj
|-
| La samklasano de la studento kiu studas historion klasifikis studenta manko de takto al desesperanta. || La samklasano de la studento kiu studas historion || || klasifikis || || studenta manko de takto || || (al) desesperanta
|-
| La Unua Amendo kiu modifas la Usona Konstitucio konvertas la civitanara konfidon ke civitanaro povas kritikas la guberniestra administrado de deviga militservo en io kiu estas suppozata. || La Unua Amendo kiu modifas la Usona Konstitucio ||  || konvertas || || la civitanara konfidon ke civitanaro povas kritikas la gubierniestra administrado de deviga militservo ||  || (en) io kiu estas suppozata ||
|}

In English, word order in a sentence helps determine whether a noun is a subject, a direct object, or an indirect object. In English, the order is often &quot;subject, verb, direct object&quot;, &quot;direct object, subject, verb&quot; or &quot;subject, verb, indirect object, direct object&quot;, and various other orders. As you can see from the table above, there are many plausible but incorrect comprehensions of the English sentences, but no plausible incorrect comprehensions of their Esperanto translations. That's because grammar in planned languages, such as Esperanto, tends to be much more precise than in natural languages. Esperanto uses affixes to explicitly and unambiguously mark words for part of speech, case, gender and number. Thus, part of speech tagging of Esperanto's single-stem words is already solved. In order to make a direct object in Esperanto, one simply adds the letter &quot;n&quot; to the noun (if the noun is plural, the &quot;n&quot; is added after the &quot;j&quot;).

Therefore, in Esperanto, subjects, verbs, and direct objects can be put in any order, with little, if any, loss of clarity. All of the following sentences, which mean &quot;the apple loves the banana&quot; are grammatically correct in Esperanto.
*La pomo amas la bananon.
*La pomo la bananon amas.
*Amas la pomo la bananon.
*Amas la bananon la pomo.
*La bananon la pomo amas.
*La bananon amas la pomo.

Instead of ''Quelles sont les nouvelles ?'' I'd say ''Quoi de neuf ?'', which is more idiomatic. [[User:Dhum Dhum|Dhum Dhum]] 20:36, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)

== The French Alphabet ==

Wouldn't it make more sense to simply say 'The French alphabet has the same letters as the English alphabet'? Given that the article is written in English, it seems pedantic to list the same characters the lesson is being written with.

:Well, it makes sense to show the alphabet since the pronunciation is different and this is what is highlighted. However, it is already part of the [[French/Lessons/Alphabet|Reading French]] Section, which makes it unnecessary to duplicate in this first lesson. --[[User:Jazz|Jazz]] 12:13, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

===W===
regarding the pronunciation of W, is there perhaps a better way of representing it other than the current dubl-vay. If I didn't know better, I feel I might read it as dubble-vay rather than the correct doob-le-vay. In fact, that seems to be an adequate way of communicating it, but I've neglected from changing it myself as I'm unaware if this is perhaps the standard form of communicating the sound and we're merely stuck with it as the norm. - &lt;strike&gt;Chris [[User:81.76.50.9|81.76.50.9]] 13:44, 23 January 2006 (UTC)&lt;/strike&gt; [[User:Chris|Chris]] 13:49, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

== [[{{ARTICLEPAGENAME}}#book|#book]] ==

I'm wondering if this should say something about the coherence of the modules of a book, at least distantly echoing that point made at {{nowrap|[[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not an encyclopedia]]}}.  Care needs to be taken to avoid implying a greater (as well as lesser) exclusion than we actually apply.  (Come to think of it, maybe that item in the policy could use clarification.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:16, 6 November 2010 (UTC)

:That entry was already either on this page or the &quot;glossary of Wikibooks jargon&quot; page that I merged in here.

A WikiProject is a metadata page that serves as a reference point for those who wish to be involved in a specific project to create a set of highly-related books.

Structural principles for a WikiProject page:
*defines the scope of the particular project
*establishes the formatting conventions for individual pages and books (e.g. how each individual item should be structured)
*lists participating contributors
*provides subject-specific forums

==What are the advantages?==
*'''Standard of look and feel'''. There are existing pages that deal with standards, but they cannot be applied to specific books. The conventions for books on mathematics or chemistry are worlds apart from the conventions for foreign languages.
*'''Allows the development of special interest communities within Wikibooks'''. This can happen organically, but the WikiProject page makes the process formal.
*'''Permits strategic planning and consensual discussion''' by creating a central location for discussion instead of fragmented discussion over several different talk pages.
*'''Allows controlled dynamic evolution'''. The inherent problem in any communal project is that without central authority chaos emerges. But with excessive central authority, stagnation sets in. The WikiProject is a 'central authority' (thus providing the benefits of stability), but the WikiProject page itself remains consensual and dynamic. Where evolution occurs, the process can be centrally managed.
*'''Helps to build community among users''', by creating common goals that people can work towards. Wikibookians tend to be focused on their own books and their own pet projects, and WikiProjects allow users to get together and work collaboratively on greater goals.

==What a WikiProject is not==
A WikiProject is not a place for subject information or book content. It is not a place to write a book, but it can be used to help plan a book, or to organize the authors of a book.

==Is it worth the effort?==
The value of such a metadata management model increases with the volume of contributors. In a case where only a handful of contributors are working on a project the actual value of a WikiProject page is negative - it only adds additional work. However, as the volume of contributors increases the work required to maintain the WikiProject pages is substantially less than the work required to correct the fragmentation of style and content, and the duplication which will otherwise occur.

== How to Start a WikiProject ==
Use {{tl|project}} on your page. WikiProjects should have a clear objective in mind, and should work to meet some goal. Once a new WikiProject is started, it can be advertised on the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Bulletin Board|bulletin board]] or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects|reading room]]. It is currently advised that WikiProjects's hyperlink be in the form of: Wikibooks:WikiProject_YourProjectName

If a WikiProject becomes inactive, it can be labeled with {{tl|inactive}}.  If it has only recently seen a slowdown in activity, {{tl|semi-active}} may be more appropriate.

===Layout===
Does anybody else wish to start a WikiProject to improve page design?  I am thinking specifically of the [[Main Page]] and the [[Wikibooks:All_bookshelves|Bookshelves page]], and the individual department pages.  If we could make them more like the [[Wikijunior]] page, the site would be a lot easier to navigate.  At the moment, it is easy to find your way within one book, but browsing the library is nearly impossible.  --[[User:Runnerupnj|Runnerupnj]] 01:45, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

:I agree with your assesment, but I would like to warn you that navigation and organization are much larger projects then you might realize. The mainpage probably could use a redesign, and many of the navigational links could likely be made more clear and obvious. What kinds of ideas do you have? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

===Wikiprojects do not need to have the word &quot;wikiproject&quot; in their page name.===
What's this change about? To should have &quot;wikiproject&quot; in their page name
http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWikiprojects&amp;diff=1160501&amp;oldid=1160117

It's quite unhelpful as &quot;Wikibooks:Wikiproject bookname&quot; is far to much of a mouthful. No easy way to use in conversation, to long to put into sidemenus etc.
Hence it's not used in wikiprojects [[Wikibooks:Counter-Vandalism_Unit]], [[Wikibooks:Wikipublish]] etc. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 15:17, 9 April 2008 (UTC)
:To add what I wrote [[Wikibooks_talk:WikiProject_History]] 
:I strongly disagree that 'All wikiprojects should use Wikibooks:Wikiproject XXXXXXX as the format to avoid any such conflicts.' If you are concerned about the conflicts a better way is to redirect Wikibooks:Wikiproject XXXXXXX to whatever format is choosen. It's quite inappropriate to change existing wikibooks that have already been branded with a name, and known as that name from many links in wikibooks and elsewhere (like wikipedia). Also the practical problems of the name 'Wikibooks:Wikiproject XXXXXXX' being to long to sensible displayed in sidebars. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 15:41, 9 April 2008 (UTC)
::Well the point is that Wikibooks:History will presumably not be a redirect forever since that should be a page about the history of Wikibooks. That's only one example, which prompted the move. In these cases, it is necessarily impossible to have a redirect since there'd be content there. The consistent naming scheme suggested avoids those conflicts, allows easy recognition from a pagename, and also allows easy search using the prefixindex. Finally, there are any number of workarounds for long pagenames wherever they may occur. As for having a &quot;brand&quot; -- the Wikiprojects at issue were created last week, so I don't see how there's some identity crisis created by a pagemove. Regardless, it's not my place to force anything upon the maintainers of these pages, so you're of course free to leave it as-is. I just think there are good reasons to use that naming scheme and trivial reasons not to. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:25, 10 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__
Avoid [[wikt:profanity|profanity]] (words or images that could be considered offensive by typical Wikibooks readers), but not at the expense of accuracy. We strive to create a serious educational resource with [[Wikibooks:Featured books|brilliant prose]]. Consideration to how others will perceive it is therefore an asset. Profanity is never acceptable in Wikijunior.

== Usernames ==

Avoid offensive usernames. Wikibookians feel that tolerating offensive usernames has few, if any benefits, but can turn away contributors who see them in a list of recent changes or elsewhere. For the purpose of Wikibooks, this outweighs freedom of expression. Users with profane or obscene usernames may be blocked without prior warning.

== Modules ==

[[WB:MODULE|Module]] titles should not include profanity unless specifically required by the content. Modules with inappropriate titles may be moved on sight to more appropriate locations, or [[WB:SPEEDY|speedily deleted]] and do not need to be listed on [[WB:RFD|requests for deletion]].

Well written modules should not, on the whole, need to use profanity. It may, however, be warranted in some cases: modules specifically ''about'' how profanity is used in society are an example, and when mentioning someone else's use of it, you should go ahead and be accurate.

Include the full, uncensored version when including exact quotes that are relevant to the module. There's no point in ever turning an instance of &quot;[[wikt:fuck|fuck]]&quot; into &quot;f***&quot; or &quot;the f word&quot;. If you wish to eliminate the word, you should paraphrase rather than quote it.

== Other pages ==

Other pages don't have the same requirements as the module pages, but profanity should be avoided there as well. Talk pages in particular are for conversation between users about a page, and in such conversations (except perhaps conversations about profanity itself) do not require profanity. Wikibookians may not verbally attack or abuse one another anywhere on Wikibooks, as we are all required to [[Wikibooks:Be civil|be nice to one another]].

== Move to Enforce ==

I am proposing that the text of [[Wikibooks:No offensive usernames]] be merged into this policy. I am also proposing that this page be moved to {{tl|enforced}}. It is my opinion that the concepts of these policies are already being implemented, and we should make our policy match the current state of business here on wikibooks. If there are no dissenting opinions, I would like to merge the policies by the beginning of the week, and I would like to move the policy to {{tl|enforced}} by the weekend. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:05, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

== Last minute rewordings ==

Sorry for doing this so in the nick of time before this sucker's time as Proposal of the Week runs out. I've done a large rewording; hardly substantial, mostly minor tweaks. I'd like some comments on a couple of concerns that I have. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:47, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

=== Speedy delete obscene module names? ===

Do we really need to speedy delete these? OK, it may be nice to have the option, but if the content is meaningful it should be moved. If the content isn't, it already qualifies for [[WB:DP#Speedy deletion|speedy deletion]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:47, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

:Perhaps we don't need to speedy delete them, but I would argue that few modules that have obscene page names will have any worthwhile content. If somebody creates a page &quot;Microsoft is fucking stupid!&quot; (as an example), can you imagine that the page will have much meaningful content? Also, I don't see any value in keeping such pages around as redirects. If a page has an obscene name, content can be moved to a better location, but the obscene page should still be deleted, preferrably quickly. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt;

:: Good point. Thanks. For that scenario it would, indeed, be useful to have the speedy delete clause. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:29, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

=== Not use profanity? ===

Yes, this is a semantic nit-pick, but I find [http://m-w.com/dictionary/offensive offensive] and [http://m-w.com/dictionary/obscene obscene] to be more precise words than [http://m-w.com/dictionary/profane profane] and fit better with the purpose of this proposal. Does anyone object to moving this to [[Wikibooks:Don't be offensive]] or [[Wikibooks:Obscenity]] and replacing instances of &quot;profane&quot; in the text? I personally prefer &quot;offensive&quot;.--[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:47, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

:&quot;offensive&quot; is an arbitrary term, and people can claim offense to all sorts of subjects. Creationists can claim that texts about evolution are &quot;offensive&quot;, for instance, and if we say that &quot;offensive materials can be deleted&quot;, then entire texts on evolution could become speedy delete targets. Of course, that's just one example, but it proves the point that &quot;offensive&quot; is arbitrary. Also, I would like to say that &quot;profanity&quot; and &quot;obscenity&quot; are pretty well-defined, and are not nearly so arbitrary. I could agree to change this to [[Wikibooks:Obscenity]], but I dont think that is nearly as good as [[Wikibooks:Profanity]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:05, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

::After looking at the definitions again, I think &quot;Obscenity&quot; might be better then &quot;Profanity&quot;. I still don't like &quot;offensive&quot;, however. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:16, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

::: Well, the reason I like offensive is that it captures the essence of obscenity/profanity without including the other specific meanings (sexual/religious). True, offensive is an arbitrary term, but so are the others as there exists no moral authority (well, except the infallable Pople, that is) to define them. I'd say the main drawback of &quot;offensive&quot; was that it may have a greater scope.
::: While you have switched your preferences over to &quot;obscene&quot;, I'm actually warming up to &quot;profane&quot; (there is no causal relationship there though, I assure you). I'd venture to say, that even though the &quot;profane&quot; definition may be a little further from the intended use than &quot;obscene&quot;, those fringe meanings are rarely used.
::: Hmmm ... I don't think we are in any hurry on this. The proposal is set as Proposal of the Week till Sunday. I'd like a little more time to think about this. Meanwhile, could you reconsider &quot;offensive&quot;. I'm not absolutely sure it is better for our purpose, but it looks appealing to me and I'd be willing to argue its case for the sake of this argument. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:49, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

::::I certainly understand what you are saying, but I can't seem to jump over this semantic fence that i'm stuck behind. I'm just worried that an active voting minority could be setting standards as to what qualifies as &quot;offensive&quot; for the entire community. Now, if we move this page to [[Wikibooks:Offensive content]], or something similar, we would have to painstakingly define &quot;offensive&quot; to exclude things that suit a particular minority at the expense of the majority. For instance, we would need to show that talking about controversial subjects (evolution/creationism, as a classic example) is not offensive, but talking about some subjects (god, religious POV) could be offensive/inappropriate. This raises another option: [[Wikibooks:Inappropriate content]]. Too many options. I need to think about it too. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:42, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

== Enforced ==

I have moved this policy to enforced. There were no outstanding objections besides comments from [[User:Swift]] on the semantics of the word &quot;profanity&quot;. Given that the aforementioned discussion has stagnated, and no suitable alternatives to the word &quot;profanity&quot; were found, I have made this into an official policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:46, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

== Possible copy-edit? ==

'If you wish to eliminate the word, you should paraphrase rather than quoting.' A bare infinitive followed immediately by a gerund? Perhaps it should be changed?

User names which offend other people are thought by most to be needlessly discouraging to other contributors, and distracting from the core purpose - creating an instructional resource.  This might include legitimate names and long-established Internet pseudonyms that can be misconstrued, however this has yet to occur in practice.

The primary purpose of user names is to identify and distinguish contributors.  This facilitates communication and record-keeping. The user name is not a forum to be offensive or make a statement. No one has a right to any particular user name. While colorful, interesting, or expressive names may add to the pleasure of Wikibooks, they are not essential.

Fairly or unfairly, the line between acceptable and unacceptable user names is drawn by the people who are offended, not by the creator of the name.  If someone complains about your user name, please consider changing it, in the spirit of Wikibooks.  If enough people complain about your user name (through talk pages or the [[Wikibooks:mailing lists|mailing lists]] or [http://meta.wikipedia.org Meta-Wikimedia]), the [[Wikibooks:Administrators#Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]] will change it.  Neither complaints, nor name changes should be arbitrary, but user names that are offensive to a significant number of people will be changed, not without notice, but without appeal.

Users creating accounts with aggressive, vulgar, offensive words in username, will be blocked infinitely without any warning.

Some people on Wikibooks use their real names as usernames. This certainly '''isn't''' required, but if you are having difficulty thinking of a username, please consider using your real name.

#Why are we creating rules where no problem exists? Don't we want to at least '''''try''''' asking someone nicely if they will use a different name? Before we make ourselves little dictators of our virtual domain, perhaps we ought to think about the ramifications. Systems of '''''crime and punishment''''' are a ''failure state''. They are an admission that we weren't able to work congenially as co-editors on a common project — that our little [[w:Animal Farm|Animal Farm]] couldn't exist without making some of us &quot;more equal.&quot; Do we really want to duplicate the system of punishment and vandalism that exists at Wikipedia? Is their instruction creep working for them? Perhaps we could learn something from our founder:&lt;blockquote&gt;''The problem we are seeing, again and again, is this attitude that some poor victim of a biased rant in Wikipedia ought to not get pissed and take us up on our offer of &quot;anyone can edit&quot; but should rather immerse themselves in our arcane internal culture until they understand the right way to get things done. I do not know what is going to change, but something BIG has got to happen and SOON about this issue, because the amount of time it is consuming for some of our best editors is getting way out of control.''  ~Jimbo Wales May 3, 2006 [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/045082.html WikiEN-l]&lt;/blockquote&gt; --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 04:19, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
#If needed should be done at the wikimedia software level not as a policy. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:26, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
# From the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:No_offensive_usernames&amp;oldid=441450 current version]: &quot;''however this has yet to occur in practice.''&quot;!! This is far too explicit. [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] and [[Wikibooks:Profanity]] already cover it nicely and the better parts of it (e.g. &quot;''While colorful, interesting, or expressive names may add to the pleasure of Wikibooks, they are not essential.''&quot;) may be added to those. Some parts of this are even bad (e.g. &quot;''Fairly or unfairly, the line between acceptable and unacceptable user names is drawn by the people who are offended, not by the creator of the name.''&quot; I remember seeing a request by someone who was offended by a username. The whole thing was a misunderstanding, but that didn't deter the offended who refused to listen to reason). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:55, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

== Merger to [[Wikibooks:Profanity]] ==

I propose we merge the text of this policy into [[Wikibooks:Profanity]]. I also propose that after the merger, we move the new composite policy to {{tl|enforced}} status. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:03, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

:Doesn't it need to have consensus to become a enforced policy ?!?
:Words like &quot;Avoid&quot; aren't prohibitive and then at the end of the section &quot;Users with offensive usernames may be blocked without prior warning.&quot; seems very prohibitive and against the votes here. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
::It does require concensus. I have proposed those changes, and I am asking the community to try and agree on it. If we dont reach concensus, this things wont happen. I agree with you that there are inconsistencies with the language in this one, and those need to be corrected. I would rather not make any substantive changes to this proposal until we've discussed the merger to [[Wikibooks:Profanity]].  --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:44, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

: I propose we don't. The essential parts are currently coverd by [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] and [[Wikibooks:Profanity]] (though both are still only proposed). We don't need to it to be so explicit and we'll have a better time at getting consensus on those I mentioned if they don't have stuff in them which doesn't even seem to have majority support! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:48, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

::You are right in saying that the important material here is duplicated in other places. However, those other places are themselves still just proposals. If we move to reject this policy, then it would seem we should move to enforce [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] and [[Wikibooks:Profanity]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:05, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

::: How about not rejecting anything till the matter has been accepted in some policy? I say we go for [[Wikibooks:Profanity]] first. If we get consensus on that we can move to reject this one. If not, we can revisit this one. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:51, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

::::I agree. Let's focus our attention on that policy first. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:48, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

== Move to Reject ==

I am moving to reject this policy. All the key points here are already found in [[Wikibooks:Profanity]], and This policy is poorly written in comparison to that one. Also, I am simultaneously moving to enforce [[Wikibooks:Profanity]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

: '''Support''' as soon as [[Wikibooks:Profanity]] has been made official. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:28, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

I have moved this one to '''rejected''' I see no reason to wait for the profanity policy, because with or without that proposal being accepted, there is no desire to keep this one. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:08, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Contributing ==

=== Should I use Wikibooks or create my own wiki? ===
Wikibooks is for textbooks, annotated texts, instructional guides, and manuals. If you want to create new documentation and want people to know where to find it, such as for a new open source software program that you helped create, you may want to do it on your own wiki. Creating a book on Wikibooks may not be such a bad idea either. See [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] for what is and isn't ok to include in Wikibooks.

=== Who can contribute? ===
Anyone can contribute and [[Help:Editing|edit pages]] at any time. You are encouraged to create an account and [[WB:LOGIN|login]], but you don't have to if you don't want to.

===Why would I want to contribute?===
: See [[Help:Contributing|Why contribute to Wikibooks?]]

===How can I contribute?===
There are many [[Help:Contributing|ways you can contribute]]. You can [[Help:Editing|edit pages]], [[WB:CREATE|create new books or pages]], publicize Wikibooks, or [{{int:sitesupport-url}} donate].

=== How do I donate? ===
To learn how to donate to Wikibooks' parent organization, [[Wikimedia:|Wikimedia]], see [[Wikimedia:Fundraising|Fundraising and Donations]].

===Do I have to use my real name?===
No. You don't have to use your real name. Some people choose to use their real name, some don't. Some people may seek recognition for their contributions. Some people may seek to encourage the free exchange of knowledge and information.

===How do I change my username?===
You may request a name change at [[Wikibooks:Requests for renaming]]. This method will also ensure all your contributions are reassigned to your new username as well. If that doesn't matter, you can also just create a new user account.

===How do I recover a password I have forgotten?===
:If you entered your e-mail address when you signed up, you can have a new password generated. Click on the &quot;[[Special:Userlogin|Log in]]&quot; link in the upper-right corner. Enter your user name, and click the button near the bottom of the page called &quot;E-mail password&quot;. You should receive an e-mail message with a new random password; you can use it to log in, then go ahead and change your password to something you'll remember in your preferences.

===Can we debate or talk about subjects here?===
Discussions intended to improves books, pages or Wikibooks are welcome here. Most discussions take place on a page's [[Wikibooks:Talk page|discussion page]]. You can also use the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|reading room]] to discussion things with the Wikibooks community. Any other discussions probably belong on [[v:|Wikiversity]].

===What languages can I use?===
Books and discussions should be understandable by people who know the English language. Please use one of the other Wikibooks languages projects if you wish to write books for people who don't know the English language.

===Which spelling should I use?===
Books may be written in British or American English. You should follow whatever the existing spelling convention is for consistency.

===How do I spell-check a page?===
You can use an online spell checker such as [http://www.spellonline.com Spellonline], or paste the text into your favorite [[:w:text editor|text editor]] or [[:w:word processor|word processor]] first, edit and spell check there, and then paste back into your browser to preview. Additionally, some browsers include spelling correction for all text editing files. Such is the case of all Cocoa browsers for MacOS X (Safari, Camino, OmniWeb, etc) and Firefox. Please see the documentation for your particular browser/operating system to turn this option on.

&lt;!-- Note to admin: There are two MediaWiki spellcheckers that you could install.
   1) [http://mirror.linuxquestions.org/pub/lq/lqwiki/ linuxquestions.org ]
   2) [http://mcintosh.cjb.net/wiki/index.php/Spell_Checker mcintosh.cjb.net] --&gt;

===I found works on the same subject, now what? ===
Books often have a unique scope, target audience, style, and method of teaching a subject. If two or more books are similar enough you can see what others think by suggesting a merger on the discussion page for one of the books or pages and leave a quick note with a link on the other discussion pages. If you know which book or page you would like to merge works into the discussion should be done on the discussion page for that book or page, and you should also add {{tlx|mergeto}} or {{tlx|mergefrom}} to the pages or books in question. You should use the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] process to decide when or if you can merge them yourself.

=== Is there a standard convention for X? ===
: See the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]

===What file formats are supported?===
[[Commons:Help:SVG|SVG]] is preferred for diagrams, maps, and other non-photographic images. You can use [[w:JPEG|JPEG]] for photographs, and [[w:PNG|PNG]] for drawings. [[w:GIF|GIF]] can be used instead of PNG, but it is discouraged because of patent reasons. [[w:Ogg Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]] is preferred for sound; [[w:MP3|MP3]] is tolerated but also discouraged for the same reason as GIF.

=== Why limit pages to 30 kilobytes in size? ===
Some people use dialup or use mobile devices which can drastically effect the length of time it will take to download and load a page longer than 30 kilobytes. Additionally some web browsers may have an upper limit on how much text can be placed into or edited in text boxes.

=== How do I undo vandalism or restore a previous version? ===
: See [[Help:Editing#Reverting]] and [[Wikibooks:Dealing with vandalism]]

=== What is Recent Changes, and what do the abbreviations there mean? ===
: Recent Changes lists all the edits that have been made over a given time period. See [[Help:Tracking changes#Recent changes|Help:Tracking changes]] for info.

=== Why are some links different from others? ===
Pages which have not yet been created or started either appear in red or include a question mark next to them depending on your [[Special:Preferences|preferences]]. Either way, you can click on that link and start a page with that name. Please search Wikibooks before starting new pages on a topic. Books may already have a page on the topic you wish to contribute to, or there may also be a book on the topic you wish to contribute to. See [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] for information on how to name pages.

===What happens when two users edit a page at the same time?===
This is called an  &quot;edit conflict&quot;. The first person to click &quot;Save page&quot; has their changes saved. The second person will get a conflict screen that displays both versions in separate windows, along with a summary highlighting the differences (typically showing the edits of both users, except those which both have made exactly the same), and instructions on how you should proceed. It's virtually impossible to lose any data.

=== Can I lose my work mid-edit? ===
If your computer or web browser crashes mid-edit you may lose your work. Firefox can sometimes recover from this, and will not only return you to the last page you were at but include any changes you've made to text boxes. If the server is unresponsive, you can often recover your work by clicking the back button. To some extent, you may be able to guard against work loss by using a word or text editor.

=== Is there an easy way I can track changes? ===
If you are a logged-in user, on every page you will see a link that says &quot;Watch this page&quot;. If you click on it, the page will be added to your [[Special:Watchlist|personal watchlist]]. Your watchlist will show you the latest changes on your watched pages. Every page also includes a rss and atom feed that anyone (even unregistered users) can subscribe to which can be used to keep track of a page's changes.

=== Can I adjust the number of changes shown by default? ===
Yes. The number of changes shown by default can be changed in your [[Special:Preferences|preferences]].

=== Can I link to other websites? ===
Wikibooks is not a [[:w:web directory|web directory]]. Books should be reasonably self contained. External links should be relevant and support works, not replace works. The current convention is to place external links on dedicated page specifically for all links. However, sometimes links are placed within footnotes or in a separate section at the bottom of a page. See [[Help:Editing#External links]] for different ways to create external links.

=== A contributor is being unreasonable. Help! ===
: See [[Wikibooks:Staying cool when the editing gets hot]] and [[Wikibooks:Problem users]].

== Copyrights ==

=== Can I copy works to Wikibooks that I got special permission for? ===
Unless you have permission to use textual works under the terms of the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]], a similar and compatible license, or the work is in the [[w:public domain|public domain]], the work cannot be used on Wikibooks. So you may have to ask the copyright holder of the material to license it under GFDL (See [[Wikibooks:Boilerplate request for permission]]). Any other works must satisfy the requirements set out by [[Wikibooks:Media]].

=== Can I copy public domain works that are reproduced in copyright works? ===
A copyright claim cannot be made provided the out-of-copyright work hasn't been altered. If it was in the public domain before they used it, it's still in the public domain afterward.

=== Does using a GIF image violate the GFDL because of its patent? ===
: ''Note: the [[:w:LZW|LZW]] patent owned by Unisys has expired on June 20, 2003 in the United States, and have also been expired in other countries since July 7, 2004. Some of the below may no longer be relevant''  Like all legal questions, however, there are still issues to be resolved, including other conflicting patents on the LZW algorithm, as well as data compression patents that may more generally apply.  &quot;Consult an attorney for more legal advice.&quot;

:The LZW compression algorithm used with the [[:w:GIF|GIF]] format is patented . It is nevertheless legally permissable to produce gif's and release them under the GFDL, just like it is legal to produce a CD-ROM with GFDL material even though the CD-ROM format is patented. People who write or use gif creation programs are bound by the patent.  There may also be separate licensing fees for distribution of patented multimedia data formats like GIF images, which if not in fact at least in philosophy violate the principles of the GFDL, preventing you from freely using the image or picture.  That is why [[:w:free software|free software]] generally does not support the format anymore. That being said, we encourage Wikibookians to use the technically superior and patent-free [[:w:PNG|PNG]] format instead of GIF.

=== Works in Japan cannot be released into the public domain! What can I do?===

Technically, there is still expiration in Japan too. So if the works exceeded expiration term, they are considered public domain. Otherwise, they cannot be public domain.

== Terminology ==
''See also [[Help:Glossary]]''

===What's the difference between a page and a module?===
: The term &quot;page&quot; encompasses all the material on Wikibooks, including instructional resource topics, talk pages, documentation, and special pages such as [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]]. &quot;module&quot; is a narrower term referring to a page containing an instructional resource entry. Thus, all modules are pages, but not all pages are modules. See [[Help:Pages#Modules]] for more.

===What is an orphan?===
: An orphan is a module that no other module links to. These can still be found by searching Wikibooks, but it is preferable to find another module where a link can be added. You can find a list of orphan modules from [[Special:Lonelypages]].

===What is a stub?===
: A stub on Wikibooks is a very short module, generally of one paragraph or less. Most people hate stubs, even though they are probably a necessary evil. Many excellent modules started out as short stubs. Existing stubs should be expanded into proper modules: there is a hand-made list at [[Wikibooks:Find or fix a stub]], and a generated list at [[special:Shortpages]].

===What is a minor edit? When should I use it?===
:When editing a page, a [[WB:LOGIN|logged-in]] user has the option of flagging the edit as a &quot;minor edit&quot;. When to use this is somewhat a matter of personal preference. The rule of thumb is that an edit of a page that is spelling corrections, formatting, and minor rearranging of text should be flagged as a &quot;minor edit&quot;. A non minor edit is basically something that makes the entry worth relooking at for somebody who wants to watch the module rather closely, so any &quot;real&quot; change, even if it is a single word. If ''information'' is added to, or removed from a page then the edit should not be marked minor.

:This feature is important, because users can choose to ''hide'' minor edits in their view of the Recent Changes page, to keep the volume of edits down to a manageable level.

== Miscellaneous ==

===Does Wikibooks use cookies?===
:[[w:HTTP cookie|HTTP cookie]]s are not required to read or edit Wikibooks, but they are required in order to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] and link your edits to a user account.

:When you log in, the wiki will set a temporary session cookie which identifies your login session; this will be expired when your browser exits (or after an inactivity timeout), and is not saved on your hard drive.

:Another cookie will be saved which lists the user name you last logged in under, to make subsequent logins just a teensy bit easier. (Actually two: one with your name, and one with your account's internal ID number; they must match up.)  These cookies expire after 30 days. If this worries you, clear your cookies after completing your session.

:If you check the &quot;remember my login on this computer&quot; box on the login form, another cookie will be saved with a hash of your password (not the password itself). As long as this remains valid, you can bypass the login step on subsequent visits to the wiki. The cookie expires after 30 days, or is removed if you [[Special:Userlogout|log out]]. If this worries you, don't use the option. You should probably not use it on a public terminal! See also: [[Help:Account management#Logging in]]

===Where do I find more information beyond this FAQ?===
: You can start by reading the introduction at [[Wikibooks:Welcome]]. [[Help:Contents]] lists all the help pages that Wikibooks has. You may also find some books on Wikibooks helpful, such as [[Using Wikibooks]] or [[Editing Wikitext]].

==How do I edit a page?==
:It's quite simple. Simply click &quot;Edit this page&quot; on the bottom or the side of the page, and type away. See [[Help:Editing|How to edit a page]] to learn about making links, using '''bold''' and ''italics'', linking to images, and many other things...

==What happens if two or more people are editing the same page?==
:The second person (and later persons) to save the page will receive an &quot;edit conflict&quot; message, and the opportunity to merge their changes into the most-currently-saved version. The wiki will also check for a conflict if you are editing and do a preview of the edit. Multiple consecutive conflicts are noticed, and will generate a slightly different message. This is similar to [[w:Concurrent Versions System|Concurrent Versions System]] (CVS), a widely-used software version management system.

==But I have problems editing with my browser!==
: See [[w:Wikipedia:Browser notes|Browser notes]] (Wikipedia page)

==Why not use [[w:HTML|HTML]]?==
:The short answer is: for simplicity and security.

:And now the longer answer. Wikibooks, and [[w:wiki|wiki]]s in general, are meant to be edited on the fly. HTML is not easy to use when you simply want to write a module. Creating links gives us a particularly dramatic example. To link to the HTML page using HTML, one would have to type

::&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Main Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:Using MediaWiki's markup is much easier:

::&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Main Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:Then there's security. Different [[w:web browser|web browser]]s have bugs that can be exploited via HTML. Malicious users could also do things like [[w:JavaScript|JavaScript]] popup windows or page redirects if they had full HTML ability on Wikibooks.  Several &quot;experimental&quot; sites that allowed full-HTML editing have suffered such attacks, including a couple other wikis that allowed arbitrary HTML.

==So we can't use &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; HTML?==
:Alright, alright, a few tags work. Especially, HTML table tags can be used to create tables. See [[Wikibooks:How does one edit a page]]. However, there's been some rumbling among the [[m:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] software developers that most HTML tags are [[w:deprecated|deprecated]]. There's also a wiki syntax for tables; see [[m:Help:Table]] for help in using it.

==What about non-[[w:ASCII|ASCII]] characters, and special symbols?==
:Just because the codes are defined in HTML 4 doesn't mean they actually work in any common browser. See [[meta:Help:Special characters]] for a discussion of what is generally safe and what isn't.

==What about math topics, which require many special symbols, fonts, and graphics?==
:Just use [[w:TeX|TeX]]! See [[meta:Help:Displaying a formula]].

==How do I make links?==
: A link is just the name of the page surrounded by double square brackets. It's also possible to make the link display text that is different from that of the link itself:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[page name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[page name]]s&lt;/nowiki&gt; -- suffix text will display as part of the link
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[page name|display name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; -- the piped link: hide the page name and display something else (but use this sparingly, and ''never'' &quot;click here&quot;!)
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[page name (disambiguation)|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; -- the &quot;pipe trick&quot;: the part in parentheses  or the [[w:namespace|namespace]] will not be displayed.
:You don't need to put underscores (&quot;_&quot;), to act as space separators like you see in links. Spaces will work fine.
: Note: to link to an external webpage, use &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://webpage Multi-word Title]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==How do I rename a page?==
:Registered users can move a page; this moves the page content and edit history to a new title, and creates a redirecting page at the old title. This method is better than just copying the content by hand, as it preserves the page's history. Use the &quot;Move this page&quot; link. If you want to move a page, please click the &quot;What links here&quot; and fix the links to the page in question.

==How do I edit a redirect page?==
:The easiest way to edit the redirected page is to click on the link you see at the top of the page after being redirected: &quot;redirected from ...&quot;. At the very top of that page, you will see a message: &quot;(redirected from [[page name]])&quot;, Click on the [[page name]] link, and you will edit the redirect page page.  See [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Redirect]].

==How do I figure out how big a page is?==
:Search results give the size, for example &quot;Knot theory (3220 bytes)&quot;. See [[Help:Navigating#Searching]]

==How do I determine what other users have changed in a module?==
: Wikibooks's software [[m:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] can produce a list of all the changes between two versions of a module (either between two consecutive versions, or between an old and the current version), laid out in two-columns side by side with changes highlighted. From the Recent Changes page you can click the &quot;diff&quot; link; from a module page itself click &quot;Page history&quot;, then &quot;cur&quot; or &quot;last&quot; to see changes.

==How can I put pictures on a page?==
:First, you need the right to publish the picture under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. This means that either you created the picture and therefore own the copyright, or it is in the public domain. If the picture is located on a server you control, you can refer to that image from your wiki page by simply including its URL, like this:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://my.webserver.com/image.png&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and it will be included. (Note it will only be linked, not displayed.) If instead you want to upload a picture to Wikibooks.org, you can use [[commons:Commons:Upload]] as a logged-in user and once it is uploaded, you can refer to it in your wiki pages as above, by including its file name :&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:NameOfImage.png|Alternate Text]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

See also [[Wikibooks:Media]].

==How can I delete uploaded items?==
:Only [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] can delete uploads, but anyone can upload a new item with the same name, thereby replacing the old one.

==How do I describe images?==
:Click on the image to get the description page.  Also, when you upload the file everything you put in the upload summary is placed into the image's description page. See [[:Image:Introductory Physics fig 4.3.png]] for an example of what goes onto one of these pages. See also: [[Wikibooks:Image use policy]]

==Can I give the references in a book?==
Yes. See [[Help:Editing#References]] and [[Template:Reflist]].

==Can I link to a specific section header if there are multiple section headers of the same name? If so, how?==
Yes, you can. Each section header, regardless of size or depth, has a number corresponding to how many times that header's name has already appeared on the page. The number is &quot;1&quot; for the very first instance, &quot;2&quot; for the next, &quot;3&quot; for the next, and so on. You can link to each header just like a normal header, but using that number after the header's name (i.e. if there are three headers named &quot;Foo,&quot; then the first can be linked to like so: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[#Foo 1]], the second. [[#Foo 2]], and the third, [[#Foo 3]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Using the number &quot;1&quot; for the first header is generally superfluous, as the software will automatically link to the first header without using the number (i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[#Foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). If you don't want the number to show, then you have to use a piped link (e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[#Foo 2|Foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

If you don't know how many times a given header has already appeared on a page (and thus the number to use), there are two ways to find out.
#Use the table of contents.
#:If a table of contents appears on the page, click on the header that you wish to link to. The page will jump to that header. Now, look at the [[w:Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]. At the end, it will show the ID of the header in question. An example of a URL who has just been linked to a header, whose name has already appeared twice (and so is the third instance), and whose name is &quot;Foo:&quot;
#::&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Example_article#Foo_3&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
#:The header link at the end of the URL shows that to link to this header, you would use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[#Foo 3]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
#Look at the source.
#:While looking at the source, first find the section you're looking for, and then look at its ID tags. It will show the number in that tag. An example for a header, whose name has already appeared once (and so is the second instance), and whose name is &quot;Foo:&quot;
#::&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Foo_2&quot; id=&quot;Foo_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
#::&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Foo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
#:The ID and name tags (the ones that say &quot;a name=&quot; and &quot;id=&quot;) show that this header can be linked to with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[#Foo 2]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

==How do I get a page deleted?==
First you should review our [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy|deletion policy]]. If a page qualifies for speedy deletion you can add {{tlx|delete|your reason}} to the top of the page. Otherwise you should add {{tlx|rfd}} to the top of the page and add a new section to [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] explaining why the page ought to be deleted.

==How can I easily change the title of a book?==
Use the MOVE button/link at the top of the page to change the title of your book.

==How do I archive my User Page?==
See [[Help:Pages#Archiving]]

==Can I put preformatted text inside a numbered list?==
Yes, if you use the HTML &amp;lt;ol&gt; and &amp;lt;li&gt; tags and the &amp;lt;pre&gt; tag like this:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
 |
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two
&lt;pre&gt;
here are a couple lines
of preformatted text
&amp;lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the numbering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does not start over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 |
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two
&lt;pre&gt;
here are a couple lines
of preformatted text
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the numbering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does not start over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
 |}

==Can I use transparent borders on a table? ==
Yes. The easiest way to write this is using wiki table notation with a different background for the table and for each row.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
 |
&lt;pre&gt;
{| style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 |- style=&quot;background:#0075ff;&quot;
 | abc || def ||ghi
 |- style=&quot;background:#0075ff;&quot;
 | jkl || mno || pqr
 |}&lt;/pre&gt;
 |
{|style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 |- style=&quot;background:#0075ff;&quot;
 | abc || def ||ghi
 |- style=&quot;background:#0075ff;&quot;
 | jkl || mno || pqr
 |}
 |}

==Can I change the style of something throughout a page without having to repeat the style?==
There are two ways this can be done.

'''Method 1''': This can be done by using a template and using the template repeatedly on the page instead. For example add &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre style=&quot;border:pink; ...&quot;&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to [[Template:Template sandbox]] and use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{template sandbox|some text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; throughout the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] page. Everyone will see what you see.

'''Method 2''': You can set this up once using CSS on your User Style. Then every &quot;pre&quot; tag will have the same pink-on-yellow style. However, every person that wants to see that style will need to set it up in their own personal &quot;User style&quot;. That allows people to see a yellow-on-pink style if they want, without messing up your pink-on-yellow view.

''See also:'' [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]

==How do policies get decided?==
:[[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] describes how Wikibooks arrives at its policies and guidelines through a process of discussion and consensus.  Discussion takes place on the [[Wikibooks:Mailing lists]], on [[irc:#wikibooks|IRC]], and in the various policy pages which form part of the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; namespace. For recent policy discussion on wiki, try looking at [{{fullurl:Special:RecentChanges|namespace=5}} recent changes].

==What is an Administrator? What is a sysop?==
:An Administrator is simply a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] who can access the few restricted Wikibooks software functions: deleting modules and uploaded files, protecting and unprotecting pages and blocking and unblocking IP addresses.
:&quot;[[w:sysop|Sysop]]&quot; is a more technical designation which deals with the a special user account itself, due to historical and to the Wikimedia software the &quot;flag&quot; that gives an Administrator its special privileges is called ''sysop flag'' that is why Administrators are sometimes called  sysops (even if the definitions aren't equivalent).
:The Administration tasks and rules are (still to be) defined on [[Wikibooks:Administrators]], they are not of a technical nature and are defined more as several managerial task that must be performed by a selected groups of users that needed or requested the access to be able to perform them to the good of all the community.

==How can I become an Administrator?==
:It's easy. First, you need a user account. Then, make useful edits over a period of time. In this way, you prove to the community that you are here in good faith. Then, add your name to [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]]. Voila! Be sure to read [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] and [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]], and use your new &quot;powers&quot; with caution.

==Who monitors the conduct of an Administrator?==
: Administrators monitor each other; all administration tools are completely reversible by any other admin (including [[Special:Log/Delete|page and media deletions]], [[Wikibooks:Protected page|lockings]], and [[Special:Ipblocklist|IP bannings]]). In rare cases [[w:User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] has to step in. In any case, the GFDL license grants you the [[MeatBall:RightToFork|right to fork]], but all forks must be on your own servers, in accordance to [[Wikibooks:Forking policy|policy]] (the fixed policy regarding fork is still under discussion you are welcomed to express your views).

==How can I unban an IP?==
:Administrators can go to [[Special:Ipblocklist]] and click on &quot;unblock&quot; as required.  Developers can unblock multiple IPs at once.

== Linking to wikipedia? ==
As a new user, I upgraded the [[perl]] book to link to all first-occurrences of foreign comp-science words to wikipedia ( ie. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:foo|foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.) Today I find someone of high stature has reverted all of those links. Please advise on when a wikibook should consult with a wikipedia entry and when it shouldn't. I feel discouraged, a lot of time has been needlessly wasted. [[User:EvanCarroll|EvanCarroll]] 19:14, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

== wording nitpick ==

This is super minor, but while browsing the page, the wording about the GIF patent question leapt out at me.  Instead of saying  &quot;&quot;Consult an attorney for more legal advice,&quot;&quot; it would probably be better to delete the word &quot;more.&quot;  It seems like, to me at least, including the word &quot;more&quot; suggests that the answer is in fact trying to give legal advice, which we probably shouldn't be giving the impression of.

== Broken link ==

In the section [[Help:FAQ/Contributing#How do I spell-check a page?]] the link to [http://www.spellonline.com spellonline.com] seems to be broken. Does anyone know the right address?

''Note: If you're trying to get help for a specific technical problem that isn't answered by the FAQs, try asking in the [[WB:TECH|Reading room]].''

==How do I report that something isn't working properly?==
:If you think it's a bug in the software, you can send a bug report to the developers. See [[Wikibooks:Bug reports]] for directions. It may also be a problem with your browser; see the next question.

==My web browser and Wikibooks aren't playing nice!==
:Report at [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Browser notes|Browser notes]]. Include a description of the problem, the name of your browser, the version number, and the [[w:operating system|operating system]] you are running.

==How do I know if the problem is in the [[m:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] software or my browser?==
:If you have another [[w:web browser|web browser]] installed, you can try to reproduce the problem in both. Failing this, you can describe your problem at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]] and ask other Wikibookians if they are having a similiar problem. If no one else is, it's probably a problem with your particular browser setup.

==Some, but not all, images don't show up. What's wrong?==
:Usually this is caused by ad-blocking software; uploaded files are distributed into random subdirectories, and 1/256th of all images on the server end up in http://www.Wikibooks.org/upload/a/ad/, which trips off some advertisement-blocking proxies. Configure your proxy to allow this directory, and you should be fine.

==Is it possible for a vandal to delete all Wikibooks pages?==
:Not really. Not even [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]] can permanently and totally delete pages. Any other users could remove the text of a page, but any other user could restore the text from the history archive. If someone did an extensive attack, they could be blocked from further editing by the admins. Moreover, there are periodic backups kept of the server itself. For more on this topic, see [http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWipeout this discussion of &quot;wiki wipeouts&quot;] at the original [[en:Wiki|Wiki]].

==Help - a page I am interested in has been deleted!==
When you try to go to the page, you should see a notice saying who deleted the page and the reason why. If you disagree with the reason given or think the administrator made a mistake you can contact them directly on their talk page or make a general request for the page to be undeleted [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion#Undeletion|here]]. (Select &quot;Add New Entry&quot; in the '''Undeletion''' section.)

This page explains how to download an XML dump of the entire en.wikibooks.org site, or of one specific page. If you are trying to download the entire site, please use the XML dump instead of a web crawler.

== What is MediaWiki? ==
The [[Wikimedia:Home|Wikimedia Foundation]] hosts Wikibooks on servers running the free software [[MW:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]]. MediaWiki is a PHP script that provides the wiki to web browsers and stores the pages in a MySQL database. MediaWiki was developed for our sister project, [[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]]. It is now used by all wiki projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, including Wikibooks itself.

To learn more about MediaWiki or to download a copy, visit:
* http://www.mediawiki.org

== How is Wikibooks copyrighted? ==
Contributors to Wikibooks own the copyright to their contributions, but they all grant permmission under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] and the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|CC-BY-SA 3.0]] license for copying, modifying, and reusing our textbooks and other content. Some embedded images and media are under [[Commons:Commons:Licensing|other free licenses]]. Some copyrighted content is used under &quot;[[WB:FUP|fair use]]&quot;. For more information, see the page [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]].

== How do I download my copy? ==
Because Wikibooks is free documentation, you are allowed to copy our content from our MediaWiki server to your own computer. You might want to download a machine-readable copy designed for human modification, that is, the '''Transparent Version'''. Or you might want to load a copy of en.wikibooks.org into your own copy of MediaWiki as a mirror. Our XML dumps fulfill both purposes.

== Understanding different formats ==
* '''Wiki markup''' is the format in which authors write pages for MediaWiki. This is what you see when you use the &quot;Edit this page&quot; tab on Wikibooks.
* '''HTML''' is the format that web browsers understand. This is what you obtain when you use the &quot;Save Page&quot; function of your web browser.
* An '''XML dump''' is a format from MediaWiki that contains the complete wiki markup of a page, plus additional information about the page such as its title. ''Thus an XML dump is the best format for copying the wiki markup from Wikibooks.'' You can also reimport an XML dump into your own copy of MediaWiki.

== Downloading the ENTIRE site ==
The site http://download.wikimedia.org contains an entire site dump for en.wikibooks.org. To download the entire collection of textbooks:
# Visit http://download.wikimedia.org
# Look for &quot;enwikibooks&quot;
# Pick an XML dump and download it

Note that &quot;enwiki&quot; is the English Wikipedia, and does not contain any part of &quot;enwikibooks&quot;.

== Downloading some pages ==
The [[Special:Export]] feature allows you to download one or more pages from Wikibooks. To download some pages:
# Visit [[Special:Export]]
# Follow the instructions to submit a query
# Save the resulting XML to disk

... or just use [[Special:Export/Main Page]] to quickly get the XML dump of the [[Main Page]], for example.</text>

All rights available on Wikibooks are handled here, including [[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewer]], [[Wikibooks:Importers|importer]], [[Wikibooks:Uploaders|uploader]], [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]], [[Wikibooks:Administrators|bureaucrat]], [[m:CheckUser|CheckUser]], [[Wikibooks:Pseudo-bots|pseudo-bot]], and [[Wikibooks:Bots|bot]] flags. A nomination must demonstrate how the project will benefit from granting the rights.

;Nominations
: To nominate a user (including yourself), add their username to the appropriate section below. Please explain why you feel the nominated user would be a good choice. All registered Wikibookians may comment, and provide arguments in support or opposition. For the bot flag, technical information about the bot may be requested. See the specific requirements for each type of access on their respective pages.

;Outcome
: Consensus does not need to be demonstrated in granting reviewer, importer, and uploader flags. Administrators may use their best judgement in granting those. All other tools require community consensus and can only be granted by bureaucrats. Access to CheckUser is governed by [[meta:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]]. After about one week, if there is consensus to grant access, then a [[Special:ListUsers/bureaucrat|bureaucrat]] will make it so and record the fact here. If not, a bureaucrat may refuse to grant the rights and the request will remain until a consensus is reached.

Scrolling through the [[Wikibooks:Administrator]] page since I was quite bored, I scrolled past [[User:Darklama]]. I have never seen Darklama in the Recent Changes Board, so I decided to scroll past his/her [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?limit=50&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;contribs=user&amp;target=Darklama&amp;namespace=&amp;tagfilter=&amp;year=2015&amp;month=-1 contributions] and [[Special:Log/Darklama|logs]], and haven't seen any logs or contributions from this user for over a year now.

=={{usercheck|balaji.md_au}} (Importer)==
Dear all, I am a Specialist doctor in Intensive Care and I have started and editing a wikibook titled [[Intensive Care Medicine]]. I wish to be able to import many existing Wikipedia articles and incorporate the content as required to various sections of the wikibook. Please could you assist me with this. Kind regards [[User:Balaji.md au|Balaji.md au]] ([[User talk:Balaji.md au|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Balaji.md au|contribs]]) 05:35, 19 January 2016 (UTC)
:I'm a little uncomfortable with this request as you aren't demonstrating good editing practices and allowing you to import en masse is likely to increase the work of other people tidying things up. Take this page, [[Intensive Care Medicine/clinical/ards]], as an example. Bad formatting means the bullet points aren't working, you haven't added {{tlx|BookCat}} to the page so it isn't categorised properly. This page, [[Intensive Care Medicine/organ/ventilation]], has all the headings wrong. When you import from Wikipedia you will need to dewikify - remove the links, fix the categories, etc. I'd like to see you fix the pages you've already started before bringing lots more in.

:: I am trying to read through, validate and then add content, including original text. To read through such volumes of advanced medical material with the view of creating a quality text consumes significant effort.

::::I understand your point, and yes the content is more important than formatting. However, we generally do not have editors who want to clean up other people's work. That means any problems might get left in the book. I think you might be under estimating the amount of work required after a page is imported. As a suggestion, please request some (say five) articles you'd like imported at [[WB:RFI]]. We'll import them and you can then judge for yourself if you, or your colleagues, are happy to do the work to incorporate them.

:::::Whilst I realize your concerns for integrity of contents, I am a bit disappointed with the many presumptions made and the 'jumping to conclusions.' It may not be a mandate to have a Neutral Point of View in discussions, but would be preferable. I would like to make it clear that none of your presumptions were my intentions. I clearly realize the difference between an encyclopaedic article and a text book content. I also realize the rigor needed for generating text book contents. I only wanted to appropriately credit the original authors and preserve the history for articles, if any, that were ported from the Wikipedia site. The articles you had mentioned as being incomplete are actually declared as being incomplete. Building such texts is a slow process spanning over years. The book's creation and location had been broadcasted to members of reputed international societies and has generated interest among experts who consider this a valuable project. I neither underestimate nor intent on delegating any clean-up work! I also appreciate the facility that exists to import select articles (Perhaps, that is all I needed in the first place as a reply!). Again, text books in such areas of human enterprise will grow slowly as more experts come forward to contribute, spending their valuable time with magnanimous intent.Cheers [[User:Balaji.md au|Balaji.md au]] ([[User talk:Balaji.md au|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Balaji.md au|contribs]]) 01:23, 21 January 2016 (UTC)
::::::The point I was making was not that the format was more important; I never mentioned anything about the differences in content between encyclopedias and textbooks.

::::Actually, the initial reason for my comment is that many people will look for contributions with the &quot;minor edit&quot; flag turned off. Looking at recent changes with minor edits excluded would result in this RFP not being visible... which I don't think is OP's intent.

I think we should make RFA look like Wikipedia's one. Now everything is messed up: support, oppose votes, comments, chat etc. There should be clearly separeted sections of: support, oppose votes, questions, comments.

I don't think it's necessary to do that. I prefer the mix everything in together approach personally. It's a discussion rather than a vote. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 10:58, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

:Apparently, the adminship rules are less strict here, so I don't think there's a need to have a fancy RfA like Wikipedia.

== Admin question ==

I have spent quite a bit of time around the RfA process at en.wiki, and know the ins and outs, but am a little puzzled here. Roughly how long does a user have to be active before adminship is a real possibility? About how many edits? I guess I'm gonna get some response about it is a case-by-case basis and that editcountitis is bad, but I ''would'' like a candid answer.

: There are no strict requirements. As for now, you should be &quot;active at Wikibooks for a while&quot; and &quot;known and trusted&quot;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 18:42, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

::I realise there are no strict requirements. I was just looking for some general answer. What does &quot;active at Wikibooks for a while&quot; even mean? 1 week? 1 month? 3 months? 6 months? 1 year? And I know people have their own standards and such, I am looking for a frank, to the point answer. At Wikipedia, you have a hard time becoming Admin if you haven't been there for around 3 months or have less than 1000 edits. There is no rule, but that seems to be about the line most people have in their standards. I want to know what the general community consensus is here.

:::I've been an admin for only a short time now, and I am up to a total of about 1500 edits, and have been a contributer for a relatively short period of time.

:::I from what it looks like here, you have less then 100 edits, and you dont seem to have any history before november.

: You know, edits are not everything. For me, a candidate for admin should be proficient with MediaWiki mechanisms: history, moving, special pages, templates. He should also prove that he knows Wikibooks policies. I don't think an admin should take part in discussion about policies and be active at staff lounge, but I require that he is able to patrol Recentchanges regularly. I would also check if the user does not start arguments and whether his contributions are useful to Wikibooks. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 19:43, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:: I like to see people become admins once you have been able to figure out how to use the major tools for editing, like page moves and marking in a watchlist, as well as going beyond just adding a little bit of text to a page.  Participation in discussion, especially on Staff Lounge and the VfD discussions is useful as well.  One huge plus is if you have been able to help out with a vandalism attack and have been able to on your own revert some vandalism and help restore some of the damage without resorting to the use of admin tools.  All of this, plus knowing some of the general policies of Wikibooks is all I look at.  I believe that the quality of the edits is more important than the number of edits anyway.  If you do an edit and put in 20K more content instead of 2000 edits of one word each, I would say the one edit is far more valuable.  Using this philosophy, you could become an admin with just 50 high quality edits where you spend a lot of time reading policies and getting to know the community.  I think it is important that an admin is going to stick around as well, so an admin candidate that created the account just two weeks ago is IMHO less likely to get the admin status than somebody who has been on here for more than a year.

:: Jimbo has suggested that becoming an admin is &quot;not that big of a deal&quot;, and if you are willing to put in a little bit more effort for Wikibooks and help police what is going on, you are certainly encouraged to try and become an administrator.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:04, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

I suggest creating edit limit for users who want to vote here. I think we may take [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month]] and [[WB:BOTM]] as example and require at least 20 edits. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:21, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
:I think a more substantial edit count should be used. 20 edits can happen pretty easily for very new users, and I would think something a bit larger like 50 edits would be better. This ensures a bit more practice around the project. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 21:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

::Yeeeah, I think ''some'' minimum should be set, but think we should allow (and encourage if they have something substantive to say) anons and low-edit accounts to '''comment'''. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:59, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

: An edit limit seems a good idea.  I have not seen here the same problems with suspicious (may be sock puppets or friends) votes and other such nonsense seen at [[WB:COTM|COTM]] and [[WB:BOTM|BOTM]] (and occasionally [[WB:VFD|VfD]]), so I don't see a need for a higher limit than for those.  If problems arise, then we can raise it.  Or if we need to raise the edit limit for [[WB:COTM|COTM]] and [[WB:BOTM|BOTM]], then we can raise the edit limit here to match.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 20:25, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

:::I personally don't like the idea, new users are effected just as much by who becomes an adin as the ones who have been around.  Plus I think that enforcing an edit limit may make a new user feel left out in some cases perhaps, but I agree in that something needs to be in place to prevent sockpuppets from getting involved, perhaps someone with checkuser can &quot;certify&quot; the voting results by checking for sockpuppets, although thats not a fool-proof method, I don't think anything is.[[User:RyanB88|RyanB88]] 21:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
::::I agree that newer users should be encouraged to exercise full citizenship. Many have background on WMF, or at RealWorld university. The problem with checkuser is that it is intrusive but maybe a non-judgemental individual could be entrusted to screen for sock-voting.(Probably no way that can be done unintrusively.)The only other idea I have is that the number of user edits could be displayed next to the voter's signature through some sort of software device. If any programmers out there feel like looking into that maybe we can do that and to get fancy, create an algorithm that multiplies users edits times votes for a weighted average. But wait - these aren't votes, they are discussions. This is one of those things with no &quot;right&quot; answer.

==Desysop request==
About the desysop request for my account : It's ok for me to be desysoped here. I don't know if I will contribute here very much in short future. My sysop privilege came essentially from the period when all wikibooks were on the same domain. Now, it's not really useful anymore. What is sure, is that I will not abuse from these privileges, so don't worry, but if you want to remove them, it's ok. [[User:Traroth|Traroth]] 14:13, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

== Sysop Removal Timeline ==

When does everyone think inactive sysops can be re-nominated to be removed of rights? As time goes on many of these admins' inactivity times just lengthen. Perhaps every six months a vote can be held? Also, it might not be a bad idea to define what &quot;inactivity&quot; means here since many of the supposed current votes have been non-consesused due to last-second voting regarding mandatory inactivity rules. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 02:02, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

:Yes. Though it might be better to reconsider the issues again in abstract first. The initial discussions showed there was unanimity amongst those voting to remove those who had made no edit of any description in the last 12 months (unless there are other wikimedia-related matters than need to be taken into consideration). The discussions on the other nominees seem to have stalled - mostly relating to a nomination that was considered by some to be arguing for de-sysopping on fault rather than no fault. This even led to one user opposing the de-sysopping of a user who has consented to his own de-sysopping, which just seems weird - as is the case where a level of inactivity of well over 12 months was broken by one single edit on a usertalk page to thank him for a vote he made on meta.

:The discussion areas for &quot;no fault&quot; de-sysoppings under a &quot;use it or lose it policy&quot; are:

::Complete inactivity over 12 months (excepting those who need reserve rights for Wikimedia Foundation or MediaWiki development reasons) - ''de facto'' already agreed as being reason for de-sysopping
::User request or with the consent of the user - we'd need to agree this, but personally I can't see why this should be controversial
::Complete inactivity over 6 months (excepting those who need reserve rights for Wikimedia Foundation or MediaWiki development reasons) - there was around 80% support for this looking at the nominations on the project page - maybe we can agree this in the abstract
::Inactivity over 12 months - ie there was some activity (maybe fewer than 10 edits, or no edits to the main namespace) - again, there was some significant support for this looking at the nominations - maybe this is worth discussing again in the abstract
::Intermittent (or continuing) editing activity, but no usage of sysop-only rights for a 12 month period - again, maybe this is worth discussing again in the abstract

:[[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:40, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

I oppose establishing any such timeline without the general discussion suggested by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]].  We seemed to have at least more or less agreed to do some housecleaning of inactive Admins at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/February#Removing Sysop Status|Staff Lounge discussion]].  But the consensus spoiling &quot;last minute votes&quot; seem to indicate that we had less of a consensus than we had thought.  In the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/February#Removing Sysop Status|Staff Lounge discussion]], [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] suggested we should have a policy on these issues.  [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]]'s horror expressed as &quot;Oh dear, not another new policy&quot; reply notwithstanding, I support having a policy or guideline on the matter (possibly new or possibly worked into existing policies).  In the recent vote, there seemed to be some confusion both over what we ''were'' doing and over what we ''should'' have been doing.  Were we desysopping those with no activity for 12 months?  No activity for 6 moths?  Desysopping those with non-admin activity only for 6 or 12 months?  Desysopping those with no non-admin activity outside their own books?  I changed one of my votes over such confusion.  There was even disagreement over whether we should be having no-fault desysopping votes at all.  Having a policy or even a guideline to point to might even have ameliorated a bit the contretemps that occurred over [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship/Archive#Marshman ( talk .7C email .7C_contribs )| Marshman's vote]] (okay, well, maybe that one's a stretch).

I don't have much of a position on the issues raised by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]].  Here is what little I do have:

* No-fault desysopping due to 12 months inactivity (whether that's complete inactivity, near complete inactivity, non-admin inactivity, etc.) is more likely to garner a consensus than desysoping due to 6 months inactivity.  I base that on the discussions both at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/February#Removing_Sysop_Status|the Staff Lounge discussion]] and at the desysopping votes themselves.  I like consensus.  Consensus is good.  :-)

* Assuming we have set times for these desysopping votes or time spans between them, we should consider not holding a desysopping vote for the same admin two times in a row.  As long as they are not doing any damage, I don't want to give the impression that we're piling on.  If that adopted, it might argue for holding housecleaning desysop votes twice a year rather than yearly.

* Perhaps we should maintain a strict wall between for-cause desysop votes and no-fault housecleaning desysop votes.  For-cause reasons for desysopping are of a ''very'' different type than no-fault housecleaning desysop votes.  I don't see a little bit of for-cause and a little bit of no-fault reasons supporting each other.  For-cause and no-fault desysoppings need to stand by themselves as sufficient.  On the other hand, the &quot;piling on&quot; problem concerns me here.  Consider [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship/Archive#Marshman ( talk .7C email .7C_contribs )| Marshman's case]].  How much nastier would that fight have been if we held one type of vote (for-cause or no-fault) first and then the other type a month later.  I don't right now have any brilliant ideas as to how to separate for-cause and no-fault votes without leaving us susceptible to piling on problems.  But I do feel that such a brilliant idea would be highly desirable.

:Then you need to request it on the project page rather than the talk page (go to [[WB:RFP]]).

== How do I know if I have certain permissions? ==

I haven't worked with Wikibooks for a bit, but am the one that created the [[How to use a Motorola DVR]] book. It looks like flagged revisions have been added, but I have no idea how to 'approve' items. There is mention that some submit or other buttons should show up, but I don't see that. Basically, I assume I haven't been granted the correct permissions? I have no idea on how to check if I should have them or not, or if I'm just missing something. [[User:Andyross|andyross]] ([[User talk:Andyross|talk]]) 14:27, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

:That's been corrected. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:10, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

== CU ==

I hope this won't lead to a straw poll like WN ArbCom elections... [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 14:15, 15 August 2010 (UTC)

:CUs have a minimum requirement of support &quot;votes&quot;, take a look in Adrignola's nomination.  It shouldn't be a static number but a percentage based on the active administrators.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:31, 15 August 2010 (UTC)

::Actually, the requirement is at least 25 votes.  It's the last bastion of an actual vote.  It should be based on project size, but it's not. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:16, 15 August 2010 (UTC)

:::After a fixed minimum number of votes, the next simplest arrangement would perhaps be a number simply proportional to active admins, which would seem to make it too easy for tiny projects and prohibitively difficult for huge projects.  One might supplement that with absolute lower and upper bounds on the required minimum, or go for something even more baroque (logarithmic scale, anyone?).  But the more complicated you make it, the harder it is to use and the more of a controversy magnet it becomes.

:::Smaller projects are given some relief in trying to scrape up the requisite numbers by the fact that there is no fixed limit on how long a CU vote can remain open.  Sanity checks are that the whole local community has to have been properly notified of the vote ('''which, since we haven't clearly settled on what we're doing, has not yet happened here'''), and that once you claim to have the requisite level of consensus, you have to request at Meta, which gives the Stewards a chance to look over the proceedings to see if there's anything dicey about them.  Details are at {{nowrap|[[Meta:Checkuser policy#Access to CheckUser]]}}.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:03, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
::::It has been my experience that WMF projects do, despite protestations to the contrary, have a certain number of individuals who are eager to acquire administrative power in order to promote or protect POV or for ego-gratification reasons &lt;font color=green&gt; present company excepted&lt;/font&gt;. Thus I would suggest erring on the side of (a) less is more regarding CU's but more importantly (b) quality more important than quantity in that CU's should have a very detailed understanding of rights and responsibilities, be accessible to folks with less technical expertise and have a demonstrated record of wielding power judiciously, NPOV and fairly. My bottom line is that I use properly disclosed multiple accounts for lawful purposes, like protecting my sanity from POV warriors, and I don't doubt that someday a POV Warrior will try to use CU and attempt to characterize my lawful-per-policy multiple accounts as somehow indicative of (evil vampire soundtrack) &quot;socking&quot;.

'''Ruby''' is an [[w:Interpreted_language|interpreted]], [[w:Object-oriented_programming|object-oriented]] [[w:programming|programming]] language. Its creator, [[Wikipedia:Yukihiro Matsumoto|Yukihiro Matsumoto]], a.k.a “Matz,” released it to the public in 1995.  Its history is covered [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming_Language here].  Its many features are listed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming_Language#Features here].

The book is currently broken down into several sections and is intended to be read sequentially.  [[#Getting started|Getting started]] will show how to install and get started with Ruby in your environment. [[#Basic Ruby|Basic Ruby]] demonstrates the main features of the language syntax. The [[#Ruby language|Ruby language]] section is organized like a reference to the language.
[[#Available Standard Library Modules|Available modules]] covers some of the standard library.  [[#Intermediate Ruby|Intermediate Ruby]] covers a selection of slightly more advanced topics.  Each section is designed to be self contained.

=== Available Standard Library Modules ===

These are parts of Ruby that you have available (in the standard library, or via installation as a gem).
To use them you typically have to require some filename, for example &lt;code&gt;require 'tracer'&lt;/code&gt; would make accessible to you the Tracer class.

You can see a list of basically all the (std lib ruby) modules available in the [http://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/trunk/lib/ ruby source] and [http://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/lib/README lib readme].  There are a several more modules available in the std lib, which are C based extensions.  You can see their list [http://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/trunk/ext here].

* [[/Standard Library/BigDecimal|BigDecimal]] gives you a way to have arbitrary precision Decimal style numbers.  Never succumb to rounding errors again!
* [[/Standard Library/Debugger|Debugger]] gives you a way to step through debug your Ruby code.
* [[/Standard Library/DRb|Distributed Ruby]] (DRb) gives you a way to make remote procedure calls against objects in a different VM.

----
Have you ever noticed a crackle when you pull off a sweater? Have you ever had your hair stick to your face after combing? What about seeing a balloon stick to the wall after it has been rubbed? All these effects are caused by '''static electricity'''. Static electricity is the imbalanced charges of matter.  It was the Greeks who first noticed that when they rubbed a piece of amber, it attracted small pieces of paper. The Greek word for amber is elektron, and it is from this that we get our words electron and electricity.

==What causes static electricity?==
Usually materials are electrically neutral. This means that they are ''not'' electrically charged. However this doesn't mean that materials have no charges ''inside'' them. All materials are made of atoms.  Atoms are made of particles called electrons, protons, and neutrons.  Electrons have a negative charge, protons have a positive charge, and neutrons (as you can probably guess by the name) have no charge.  Materials are partly made of charged particles.  Materials have no overall charge whenever they have the same number of electrons and protons. The negative charge of the electrons exactly cancels out the positive charge of the protons. 

'''Test YourSelf:''' 
Q1) The element lithium  has three protons. How many electrons must a neutral lithium atom have?

Inside an atom the protons and neutrons are held firmly at the very centre in a structure called the nucleus. The electrons however are held much more loosely. Some can be found at the surface, and if the surface is rubbed, they can be rubbed away. This removal of electrons will leave the atom with more protons than electrons. It will have a positive charge because the protons are positively charged. Atoms that are charged are called ions.

When you rub a balloon on your sweater some of the electrons are transferred from the sweater to the balloon. The sweater becomes positively charged. 

'''Test YourSelf:''' 
Q2) What charge will the balloon have?

==How do the two types of charge behave?==

The sweater is positively charged, the balloon negative. The balloon sticks to the sweater. This is because '''unlike charges attract'''. If you were to take two balloons, both of which had been negatively charged and brought them together you would find that they tried to push apart. This is because '''like charges repel'''.

[[Image:Balloons (static electricity).png]]

''' Test Yourself''' 
Q3) Look at the balloons above. The pair on the left are being repelled. The pair on the right are being attracted. Notice that one out of each pair of balloons is negatively charged. What is the sign (positive or negative) of the charges on the other two balloons?

==Sparks can fly!==



When a large enough charge is built up sparks can fly. A spark is just a flow of electrons through the air. This can sometimes be very dangerous. For example, petrol flowing through a pipeline can pick up a charge by friction. If a spark flies it could ignite the petrol. For this reason, pipes are earthed. Earthing means connecting the pipe to the ground by means of a copper wire. Copper, unlike air, is a very good conductor of electricity. The electrons can flow easily and safely to the ground without sparking.

Some devices make use of sparks. A Van de Graaf generator consists of a large metal dome that is in contact with a rubber or plastic looped belt. As the belt moves, friction causes it to become charged; the charge is spread out over the metal dome where it builds up until it is large enough to cause a spark.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Girl touch Van de Graaf.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

In the diagram above a girl is standing on a washing up bowl and touching a Van de Graaf machine.

'''Test Yourself'''
Q4) What do you think is the purpose of the washing up bowl?

'''Test Yourself'''
Q5) Explain why the girl's hair is standing on end (no it's not her style, it's to do with the charge)

'''Summary'''
*Friction can cause electrons to rub off one material onto another
*Two objects with the same type of charge repel
*Two objects with the opposite type of charge attract
*To prevent sparks, discharge the object by connecting it to earth with a metal conductor
*To encourage sparks, insulate the object

I've been thinking. I sort of hijacked this page for GCSE science. It occurs to me that someone visiting this page migh want see see things on the scientific method, anyalysing data, Good and not so good science. Examples of downright sloppy science and even fraud. That sort of thing.If anyone want's reclaim this page for general science rather than GCSE science, feel free, but please link GCSE science to the main page or somewhere it is likely to be seen [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:36, 18 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Very chivalrous of you. I imagine that as this site grows there will be all kinds of overlaps on name usage, with multiple books and stuty guides on any topic. Hopefully there will be so much activity that people will be fighting over namespaces. Well, not that I am hoping for fighting. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

== Tweaks ==
Theresa, love the design of the page. I tweaked it up a bit for you. Question: Just what does &quot;GCSE&quot; stand for, anyways ? If I knew I forgot and don't know where to check. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Thanks for the tweaks. GCSE stands for General certificate of secondary education. 

:&lt;headmistress giving a &quot;you should know better&quot; look&gt; 
The best place to check for information is wikipedia ;-) see this article for more details http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSE 
:&lt;/headmistress giving a &quot;you should know better&quot; look&gt; [[User:Theresa knott]]

::Headmistress ? OK, this must definitely be a non-US thing. Seriously, I have never heard of General certificate of secondary education before. I thought the S would stand for science ..

== Funny science songs ==
You may like the songs found on this page. Sort of more designed for kids but it was funny to me as an adult too. Maybe it could fit into your book somewhere although I wouldn't know where.

http://www.acme.com/jef/science_songs/

- Thank you

== Subpages ==
Wouldn't it be better to use subpages? For example, right now you have &quot;GCSE_science&quot; and &quot;Introduction_(GCSE_science)&quot; and so on. With subpages, they would be &quot;GCSE_science&quot; and &quot;GCSE_science/Introduction&quot; and so on. It seems tider to me because all the GCSE science pages are then contained under 'GCSE_science'. Just a thought. :) --[[User:Avxxv|Avxxv]] 20:10, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

:Subpages is a feature that was added long after this book was created. Sure, having subpages will be much tidier, but things will have to be moved in a way to not ruin internal links. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 18:58, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== Proposed rename ==

I'd like to change these pages so that they all start with &quot;GCSE Science/&quot;. This would bring these pages into link with other wikibooks. Any move would be done in such a way as to preserve all links. I trust this will prove to be non-controversial, but note the proposal here first to allow for comments, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:50, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

== Image format ==

A lot of images in this textbook are in GIF format. They should be converted to PNG, or a PNG alternative should be found. [[User:Ksd5|Emanla Eraton]] 15:26, 26 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Q1)''' 3 --- all atoms have the same number of protons as electrons


'''Q2)''' Negative ---	electrons have been added to the balloon.


'''Q3 left hand pair)'''  Negative--- The balloons are  repelled

'''Q3 right hand pair)'''Positive --- The balloons are attracted. Remember '&quot;like charges repel, unlike charges attract'''   


'''Q4)''' The purpose of the washing up bowl is to insulate the girl from the ground. People are reasonable conductors of electricity. If the girl just stood on the floor electricity would run through her body and leak away. She would act as an earth wire for the Van de Graaf.

'''Q5)''' The girl's hairs all pick up static electricity from the Van de Graaf machine.  Remember '''like charges repel''', so each hair tries to get as far away from the other hairs as possible. That is why her hair stands on end.

I LOVE your drawings ... you are going to make me get off my duff and do some of my own because I see how much they immediately add to the work. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Theresa, what program are you using to make those drawings ? Just wondering .. Hey never mind, I just checked your user page on the main WP and saw that you have links and info about it .. you use MS Word ?? Interesting ... I hope you keep up the passion. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Thanks, Theresa. You've really restored my confidence in the whole Wikibooks thing. I've encountered a lot of unwritten, poorly-written or excessively incomprehensible stuff, and what I see with GCSE Science is a breath of fresh air! Keep up the good work, it's of sufficient quality to actually see it competing with other major textbooks. Well done! --[[User:81.157.26.41|81.157.26.41]] 21:31, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Theresa, sub-pages are any page that contains a '/' in the page name. Normally, a slash in the URL indicates a file structure or directory entry on the server. They were used a lot in Wikipedia, but have mostly been removed there.
We've discussed them here as a possible way to solve the need for duplicate modules. Thus ''GCSE/Atomic Structure'' would be different than ''Physics/Atomic Structure''. The Wikipedia approach would be to name these modules ''Atomic Structure in General Science'', but this seems combersome.
Another approach involvers the use of Namespaces. This would get things like ''GCSE:Atomic Structure''.

There are a couple of us experimenting with things like automated table of contents and pop-up windows for footnotes or a glossary. When we get a good technique that works, we'll update or create a guideline page. In the meantime, most of us are just continuing whatever method a book started with. We know we'll have some cleanup when a good technique is settled on. Hope this explains some of whats going on. Keep up the good work, and I second Karl's praise for your illustrations.  [[User:LouI|LouI]] 19:57, 1 Sep 2003 (UTC)

==Covalent bonding==
Hey Theresa, thanks for your edits on the organic subpages. This statement from [[Organic Chemistry/Foundational concepts of organic chemistry/Covalent bonding|Covalent bonding]] does not seem to be true tho: &quot;Covalent bonds always occur in molecules that only have one type of atom&quot;. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
----
I was just looking at your science book. It sure is a large volume to cover. Do you plan on writing the whole thing ? I see your edits all of the time for quite some time now and yet the volume left to go is much larger than that which is done. I guess my book is the same tho, and when I finish ochem its on to other subjects .. Oh yeah, I hope you approve of the edit I did on the main science book page. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:It certainly is a large amount of work. If I do it all by myself on and off as the mood takes me it'll take maybe two or three years to complete. Still nothing worth doing is easy. What I hope will happen, when I get the electricity module really well done, a proper useable resource, then people might start actually using it. If that happens {well I should say when that happens) someone else may be inspired to write another module, Still if I have to do the whole thing myself I will. Oh and yes the edit on general science is good.[[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:21, 18 Sep 2003 (UTC)
==Evangelizing==

Theresa - The main page was perfectly fine before (Statement not true about whatever size screen you have ~ I never had to scroll right left. Not sure what the proper sizing is, but the central contents area looks a bit squeezed now - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 21:18, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC) I think the problem arises from that little box added at top right. -- [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]

Theresa - I'm using IE.  The html width % tags should adjust things for both individual browser and screen resolutioon settings (all things functioning perfectly).  By adjusting the contents table to 80% it did get smaller on my screen, but everything else around (above and below) stayed the same (the tables are nested), so there was no right-left adjustment in text outside the colored contents box.  Is it (on your browser) actually filling more than full screen width?  Usually, that is caused by something forcing the width out of specified bounds (e.g., a line or graphic that is too large for screen setting, or something similar in essence overriding the percent width commands) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 22:55, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I too am using IE. I think the problem that have is to do with the navigation frame on the L.H.S. of the page. (the one with the wikibooks logo) This takes up about 20% of the page width, so if the tables set at 100% the page will always be wider than the browser window. I don't see why we need to set a width at all really, so I've removed the width attributes entirely, letting the viewers browser decide how wide to make the table. Does this look ok to you ? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:17, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Did removing the Width=100% make any difference on your browserr? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:37, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:Yes it's cured the problem for me. Does it still look OK to you? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 23:03, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)
::After I brought the three columns a bit closerr to same size, it looks fine on my screen, but only fills about 80% of the available space.  If it was off screen with 100% setting on your monitor, then something must be forcing the layout wide (and the colored box table complies by filling 100% of &quot;too big&quot;); but I cannot see what that is.  Most suspicious is the longer titles in the book listings. That is all I can see that could overide settings as there are no wide graphics anywhere.  What does the French Wikibooks main page look like on your system?  It is fine on mine. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 00:49, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

== Foundation or Higher? ==

As far as I know, there is no Foundation or Higher. It is law that schools (except public schools...) have to have balanced sciences.

There is Single Science, 6 modules, Double Science, 12 modules, or Seperate Sciences, 18 modules.

Single Science makes you do 6 modules in the 2 GCSE years and you recieve one grade (from * down to F/U/similar).

Double Science makes you do 12 modules in the 2 GCSE years and you recieve two identical grades (from ** down to FF/UU/similar). They can never be different so excelling in Chemistry will not get you very far.

Seperate Sciences (that's me!) is like taking a Biology, Physics and Chemistry GCSE. Each have 6 modules and you get three seperate grades.

What's Foundation and Higher? [[User:R3m0t|R3m0t]] 16:52, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)

It's the paper you sit in many exam boards Foundation is balanced, you still get 12 modules for doulble science, but the papers omit the most difficult questions. You can get grades C downwards. The higher paper is gives grades A -D any lower than that you get a U. The paper sat is not specified on the final certificate though, A grade C For example can be got by sitting either paper and nobody but the candidate need know which paper was sat.

== Algebra:Functions images ==

Thanks for those.  The apple picture is great!  I'm going to move the second illustration down from the relation section to the function part; any chance you could make another similar picture demonstrating a relation that's not a function (ie., at least one right-hand element points to more than one left-hand element)?  That would really make the distinction clear.  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 01:35, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Hi T :) If you do intend on resizing the image yourself, you may want to simplify it just a little, it may be a bit complicated on sight to spot that it isn't a function - perhaps have the mapping 1-&gt;{2,3}, 2-&gt;3, 3-&gt;4, 4-&gt;4?

Theresa, have you seen the feature where little boxes show up at the top of the editing box that let you do some formatting in one click ? I was on a friend's computer and these icons showed up that I had never seen, to make text bold or italic, among other things. Maybe it does not work on my Mac or something.

forgive my ignorance but for the life of me i can't get the venus image to post from the wikipedia article over to the module. why is this? i was also thinking of bringing the tables from the articles explaining the planet stats. can you help me out maybe post a tutorial type of thing on my talk page here. sorry to bother you. oh and p.s. i look forward to working on this project with everyone, i beleive it will be a great success! --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 16:50, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:It can't be done! (Which explains why you can't do it) However a new project called wikicommons has just been launched. This is a central repository for wikimedia pictures. I ''think'' you can get images from commons to display on any wiki, but I don't know for sure as I've never tried it. Take a look [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page here] and see if you can figure it out.

hey there would you be able to tell me where i can find info on how to bring the nasa image from the site to the module? --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 18:16, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Go to the NASA site and download the image onto your harddrive. (Clicking on the image and selecting &quot;save as&quot; should do it. Make sure you save it where you can find it again. Change the name if necessary; it should be descriptive. then click the upload button and navigate yo where the file is on your computer. Put the public domain tag in the summary and also add that it's from NASA then hit the upload button. Let me know if you have any problems. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:10, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

check out what i did for the venus category (the image showing venus in blue) is that ok or should i not do it like that. --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 21:07, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:No you can't do that. What you are doing is retreiving the image live from their website everytime you look at the page. This has two consiquences
:#If their website is down for any reason, or if they decide to move the image location or name, we'll see a &quot;missing image&quot; note instead.
:#Because the viewers browser fetches the image from thier website rather than ours, ''they'' have to pay for the bandwith rather than us. bandwith theft is considered extremely poor etiquette.

You best bet is to just put the url on the talk page and let someone else sort adding it to the page. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 06:48, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Also, I'd like to create a new version, under a different name.  It would have the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona labelled.  I see a comment here from Karl Wick that you create your images in MS Word.  If that's true, I should be able to edit in MS Word, right?

I could download, work on them, and report back to you on what I've done with your baby.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 16:23, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for responding to my message.  I appreciate your invitation to re-use your image. I thought the original version -- in the format you had when you were editing it, before you saved it as a PNG -- would be better than the png, because it might have more bits.  If I start working from a copy, I could just degrade the image.  Thanks if you can enlighten me. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 00:52, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

== Question ==

Hi THeresa! I just registered today, and I have a question about articles on Wikibooks. Are there cases here where blank pages are accepted? I saw [[European History/Chapter 14]] was created today and saw that [[European History/Chapter 13]] is in a similar vein. Just wondered because Chapter 13 seems to be several years old. [[User:Sjakkalle|Sjakkalle]] 11:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
:I can't for the life of me see why someone needs to create a totally blank page. Books are different from encylopedias because they need to be structured. So obviosly chapter 13 should come before chapter 14 in the contents page, but once there is a link there I can't see a reason to actually create the page blank. I'll leave it a little while as the book is clearly being worked on (if not that chapter) and see what happens. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 11:36, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

== School Project ==

I'm probably going to be a TA next semester, and I was toying with the idea of offering my students extra credit for making (class-related) contributions to wikibooks. I saw your school project, and would very much like to know how well it is working out for your students, how easy it is to teach wikiformatting to people who may be completely unfamiliar with text markup etc. I think it's very admirable for you to be getting young people involved, not only in the learning process, but also in the teaching process as well. Kudos to you! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:14, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

:Well they seem to be enjoying it! I haven't actually taught much formatting at all; some of the brighter ones are picking it up for themselves. It's very easy after all, and the nice thing about a wiki is that someone else can always fix the formatting later.

:You need to think carefully about safety. My pupils are all quite young, so I gave them a very stern talking to about how they are allowed to behave online, and i vetted their usernames etc. You also need to think about staff pupil relationships. If the pupils are teenagers I recommend that you create a seperate account for yourself for use in the project and keep you main account secret from them.

== Great! ==

So happy to have a contributor! The standards you suggest are right on the money. &quot;key stage three&quot; as you call it is exactly the same age group I was aiming for. As for science currently learned, It vairies from school to school but generally they will have had basic environmental science, weather, some geology, basic electricity, etc... In the USA, public school texts do not focus enough on laboratory experimentation as a form of learning. Because of this, i would like the book to have a large basis in experimentation, lab work and procedure, and careful observation as methods of learning material covered in the book, but also as preparation for high school science (ages 14-18) where this sort of analysis is required.  I look forward to working with you! please feel free to edit any part of the book that you find a way to improve! Thanks for the offer!

I didn't &quot;add&quot; the Swastika the next day. It was always there. It's been The Vandal Warrior's page for ages and no one mentioned it to me. When that user removed he didn't put a good enough reason for removing it, so I put it back and explained me reason, then he put it back still without any discussion, so I reverted it, then he blocked my user page and still didn't discuss it. Then I asked him why he did via email... No email reply and guess what? I got my email blocked! Great... I really was going to do as you said, but none of this would have happened, if he talked about it with me or maybe if you did... or if anyone did, rather than just getting blocked. It seems unfair to be blocked from email someone when all I did was ask him why he reverted it?! And still no reply! What's going on with Wikipedia.

There are several practical uses of   static electricity. We will look at two of them on this page. There are many more, but these are probably the easiest to understand.

==The Photocopier==
One example of the practical use of static electricity is a photocopier. A photocopier is a complicated piece of equipment, but the basic principle of how it works is fairly simple. The best way to understand what is going on is to consider it as a stage by stage process.

|}

===Stage one===
Positive charge is sprayed onto a plate from a high voltage power supply which is called charging by friction. The plate is connected to the earth but the charge does not have quite enough energy to flow away from it. (The plate is not a good conductor of electricity.) even if is a metal

===Stage two ===
Paper is placed over the plate and a light is shone onto the paper. Where the paper is white the light is reflected onto the plate. Where the paper is dark a shadow falls onto the plate. The light falling on the plate gives it just the extra energy needed to allow the  charge to escape to earth. The plate becomes neutral where the paper is white but keeps its charge where the paper is black. The plate is now a copy of the paper with charges taking the place of ink. You could call this a template.

===Stage three ===
Toner particles are sprayed through a negatively charged nozzle onto the plate. As the toner passes through the nozzle it picks up the charge so that each particle of toner becomes negatively charged. The now charged toner is attracted to the areas of positive charge because '''unlike charges attract'''. More light then allows the positive charge to escape (However the negative charge on the toner remains.)

===Stage four ===
A piece of paper is given a very strong positive charge, and then placed in contact with the plate. The paper attracts the toner. The paper is then removed from the plate and passed through a heating unit. The heat melts the toner and bonds it to the paper. 

In a real photocopier, there is no plate, just a large drum. As the drum rotates its surface goes through stages one through four.  At the end of the sequence a scraper removes any toner left on the drum and the whole process is repeated with a new image. A good photocopier is capable of producing 20 duplicate pages per minute (20ppm), which is approximately one page every three seconds.

===Questions on Photocopiers ===
'''Q1)''' If the black areas of the image leave a positive charge on the plate what charge do the white areas of the image leave? (''Be very careful, the answer may not be what you think!'')

'''Q2)''' How does the light shining onto the charged plate allow it to lose its charge?

'''Q3)''' Why is the toner given a negative charge?

'''Q4)''' Why does the paper attract the toner?

'''Summary'''
*A photocopier uses a static electricity image to attract ink
*Unlike charges attract, the image and the ink are oppositely charged
*Unlike charges attracting is also used when spray painting cars
|}

==Other uses of static electricity==

===Spray painting  car parts===
When paint is sprayed from a paint gun, the painter normally needs to use a fair amount of skill to ensure the paint goes on evenly. By connecting the spray nozzle to a negative electrode, it is possible to charge each droplet of paint. If the car part is then given the opposite charge, the paint droplets will be attracted to the car body part. This has several advantages:
*Less mess - The paint goes to the charged body part and not to the electrically neutral floor.
*Less wastage - All the paint ends up on the body part, very little is wasted.
*Less skill needed - Because the charge is over the entire car part, the paint will stick to it.
*Neater job - The paint is distributed evenly across the surface

===Questions===
'''Q1)''' If the paint droplets are given a positive charge, what charge should the car part be given?

'''A1)''' A negative charge as the positive will always be looking for a negative to balance it out. 

'''Q2)''' Why does less paint fall on the floor? Give reasons for your answer

'''Q3)''' In the application of painting cars, wouldn't negatively charging the spray source and positively charging the object being sprayed also attract dust, dirt and, trash too?

===Pollution Control===
Static electricity is used in pollution control by applying a static charge to dirt particles in the air and then collecting those charged particles on a plate or collector of the opposite electrical charge. Such devices are often called electrostatic precipitators.


Factories use static electricity to reduce pollution coming from their smokestacks. They give the smoke an electric charge. When it passes by electrodes of the opposite charge, most of the smoke particles cling to the electrodes. This keeps the pollution from going out into the atmosphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A ''graph'' is a mathematical way of representing the concept of a &quot;network&quot;.

== Introduction ==
A network has points, connected by lines. In a graph, we have special names for these. We call these points ''vertices'' (sometimes also called nodes), and the lines, ''edges''.

Here is an example graph. The edges are red, the vertices, black.

[[File:Discrete Mathematics Example Graph.png]]

In the graph, &lt;math&gt;v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4&lt;/math&gt; are vertices, and &lt;math&gt;e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5&lt;/math&gt; are edges.

== Definitions of graph==
There are several roughly equivalent definitions of a '''graph'''.  Most commonly, a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is defined as an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is called the graph's '''vertex-set''' and &lt;math&gt;E=\{e_1,\ldots,e_m\}\subset\{\{x,y\}|x,y\in V\}&lt;/math&gt; is called the graph's '''edge-set'''.  Given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we often denote the vertex—set by &lt;math&gt;V(G)&lt;/math&gt; and the edge—set by &lt;math&gt;E(G)&lt;/math&gt;.  To visualize a graph as described above, we draw &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dots corresponding to vertices &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots, v_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, for all &lt;math&gt;i,j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; we draw a line between the dots corresponding to vertices &lt;math&gt;v_i, v_j&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists an edge &lt;math&gt;\{v_i,v_j\}\in E&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the placement of the dots is generally unimportant; many different pictures can represent the same graph.

Alternately, using the graph above as a guide, we can define a graph as an ordered triple &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E,f)&lt;/math&gt;:
* a set of vertices, commonly called V
* a set of edges, commonly called E
* a relation &lt;math&gt;f: E \rightarrow \{\{x,y\}|x,y\in V\}&lt;/math&gt; that maps to each edge a set of ''endpoints'', known as the ''edge-endpoint relation''.  We say an edge &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; is '''incident''' to a vertex &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;v\in f(e)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the above example, 
* V={v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}
* E={e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}
* f such that e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}, e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}, e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}, e&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}, and e&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not injective — that is, if &lt;math&gt;\exists e,e'\in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;e\neq e', f(e) = f(e')&lt;/math&gt; — then we say that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a '''multigraph''' and we call any such edges &lt;math&gt;e,e'\in E&lt;/math&gt; ''multiple edges''.  Further, we call edges &lt;math&gt;e \in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f(e)|=1&lt;/math&gt; '''loops'''.  Graphs without multiple edges or loops are known as '''simple graphs'''.

Graphs can, conceivably, be infinite as well, and thus we place no bounds on the sets V and E. We will not look at infinite graphs here.

=== Directions, Weights, and Flows ===

We define a '''directed graph''' as a graph such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; maps into the set of ordered pairs &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y)|x,y\in V\}&lt;/math&gt; rather than into the family of two-element sets &lt;math&gt;\{\{x,y\}|x,y\in V\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can think of an edge &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(e)=(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; as 'pointing' from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  As such we would say that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the ''tail'' of edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the ''head''.  This is one of the vagaries of graph theory notation, though.  We could just as easily think of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as the head and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as the tail.  To represent a directed graph, we can draw a picture as described and shown above, but place arrows on every edge corresponding to its direction.

In general, a '''weight''' on a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is some function &lt;math&gt;c: E(G)\rightarrow \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''flow''' &lt;math&gt;(G,c)&lt;/math&gt; is a directed graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E,f)&lt;/math&gt; paired with a weight function such that the weight &quot;going into&quot; any vertex is the same amount as the weight &quot;going out&quot; of that vertex.  To make this more formal, define sets
*&lt;math&gt;f^+(v)=\{e\in E(G)|f(e)=(v,x), x\in V(G)\},\; \forall v\in V(G)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;f^-(v)=\{e\in E(G)|f(e)=(x,v), x\in V(G)\},\; \forall v\in V(G)&lt;/math&gt;
Then, formally stated, our requirement on the weight function is
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{e\in f^+(v)} c(e)=\sum_{e\in f^-(v)} c(e),\; \forall v\in V(G).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Special Graphs ===
[[Image:Completegraphon6vertices.png|thumb|The complete graph on 6 vertices]] 
Some graphs occur frequently enough in graph theory that they deserve special mention.  One such graphs is the ''complete graph'' on n vertices, often denoted by K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  This graph consists of n vertices, with each vertex connected to every other vertex, and every pair of vertices joined by exactly one edge.  Another such graph is the ''cycle graph'' on ''n'' vertices, for ''n'' at least 3.  This graph is denoted C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and defined by V := {1,2,..,n} and E := {{1,2},{2,3}, ..., {n-1,n},{n,1}}.  Even easier is the ''null graph'' on ''n'' vertices, denoted N&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; it has ''n'' vertices and no edges!  Note that N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Some Terms ===
Two vertices are said to be ''adjacent'' if there is an edge joining them. The word ''incident'' has two meanings:

* An edge ''e'' is said to be incident to a vertex ''v'' if ''v'' is an endpoint of ''e''.
* Two edges are also incident to each other if both are incident to the same vertex.

Two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' are said to be ''isomorphic'' if there is a one-to-one  function from (or, if you prefer, one-to-one correspondence between) the vertex set of ''G'' to the vertex set of ''H'' such that two vertices in ''G'' are adjacent if and only if their images in ''H'' are adjacent. (Technically, the multiplicity of the edges must also be preserved, but our definition suffices for simple graphs.) 

=== Subgraphs ===
[[File:Subgraph.svg|thumb|Generated Subgraphs]]
A ''subgraph'' is a concept akin to the subset. A subgraph has a subset of the vertex set V, a subset of the edge set E, and each edge's endpoints in the larger graph has the same edges in the subgraph. A 

A subgraph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is ''generated'' by the vertices {&lt;math&gt;a, b, c,...&lt;/math&gt;}&lt;math&gt;\in H&lt;/math&gt; if the edge set of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; consists of all edges in the edge set of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that joins the vertices in &lt;math&gt;H=&lt;/math&gt;{&lt;math&gt;a, b, c, ...&lt;/math&gt;}.

A ''path'' is a sequence of edges &lt;math&gt;&lt;e_1,...,e_N&gt;&lt;/math&gt; such that e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is adjacent to e&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; for all i from 1 to N-1. Two vertices are said to be connected if there is a path connecting them. 

&lt;!-- clean this up A connected component of a graph is a maximal subgraph generated by vertices which are all mutually connected. A cycle is a path with the same initial and final vertex. A connected cycleless graph is called a tree. A maximal subgraph of a connected graph which is a tree is called a spanning tree. A planar graph is a graph representable by points on a plane as vertices and nonintersecting continuous curves as edges. --&gt;

== Trees and Bipartite Graphs ==

A ''tree'' is a graph that is (i) connected, and (ii) has no cycles.
Equivalently, a tree is a connected graph with
exactly &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; edges, where there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes in the tree.

A ''Bipartite graph'' is a graph whose nodes can be partitioned into two disjoint
sets U and W such that every edge in the graph is incident to one node in U and one
node in W. A tree is a bipartite graph.

A ''complete bipartite graph'' is a bipartite graph in which each node in U is connected to every node in W;
a complete bipartite graph in which U has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices and V has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; vertices
is denoted &lt;math&gt;K_{n,m}&lt;/math&gt;.

Adjacent,Incident,End Vertices

Self loops,Parallel edges,Degree of Vertex

Pendant Vertex : Vertex Degree one &quot;Pendant Vertex&quot;
Isolated Vertex : Vertex Degree zero &quot;Isolated Vertex&quot;

== Hamiltonian and Eulerian Paths ==
Hamiltonian Cycles:
A Hamiltonian Cycle received its name from Sir William Hamilton who first studied the travelling salesman problem. A Hamiltonian cycle is a path that visits every vertex once and only once i.e. it is a walk, in which no edge is repeated (a trail) and therefore a trail in which no vertex is repeated (a path). Note also it is a cycle, the last vertex is joined to the first.

A graph is said to be Eulerian if it is possible to traverse each edge once and only once, i.e. it has no odd vertices or it has an even number of odd vertices (semi-Eulerian). This has implications for the Königsberg problem. It may be easier to imagine this as if it is possible to trace the edges of a graph with a pencil without lifting the pencil off the paper or going over any lines.

== Planar Graphs ==

A ''planar graph'' is an undirected graph that can be 
drawn on the plane or on a sphere in such
a way that no two edges cross, 
where an edge &lt;math&gt;e = (u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is drawn as a continuous curve 
(it need not be a straight line) from u to v.

Kuratowski proved a remarkable fact about planar graphs:  A graph is
planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to 
&lt;math&gt;K_5&lt;/math&gt; or to &lt;math&gt;K_{3,3}&lt;/math&gt;.
(Two graphs are said to be homeomorphic if we can shrink some components of each
into single nodes and end up with identical graphs.  Informally, this means that
non-planar-ness is caused by only two things—namely, having the structure of
&lt;math&gt;K_5&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;K_{3,3}&lt;/math&gt; within the graph).

=== Coloring Graphs ===
A graph is said to be planar if it can be drawn on a plane in such way that no edges cross one another except of course for meeting at vertices

Each term, the Schedules Office in some university must assign a time slot for each final exam. This is not easy, because some students are taking several classes with finals, and a student can take only one test during a particular time slot. The Schedules Office wants to avoid all conflicts, but to make the exam period as short as possible.

We can recast this scheduling problem as a question about coloring the vertices of a graph. Create a vertex for each course with a final exam. Put an edge between two vertices if some student is taking both courses. For example, the scheduling graph might look like this:
Next, identify each time slot with a color. For example, Monday morning is red, Monday
afternoon is blue, Tuesday morning is green, etc.

Assigning an exam to a time slot is now equivalent to coloring the corresponding vertex.
The main constraint is that adjacent vertices must get different colors; otherwise, some student has two exams at the same time. Furthermore, in order to keep the exam period short, we should try to color all the vertices using as few different colors as possible.
For our example graph, three colors suffice:
red, green, blue.

The coloring corresponds to giving one final on Monday morning (red), two Monday afternoon (blue), and two Tuesday morning (green)...

=== K Coloring ===

Many other resource allocation problems boil down to coloring some graph. In general, a graph G is kcolorable if each vertex can be assigned one of k colors so that adjacent vertices
get different colors. The smallest sufficient number of colors is called the chromatic number of G. The chromatic number of a graph is generally difficult to compute, but the following theorem provides an upper bound:

Theorem 1. A graph with maximum degree at most k is (k + 1)colorable.
----

Proof. We use induction on the number of vertices in the graph, which we denote by n. Let P(n) be the proposition that an nvertex
graph with maximum degree at most k is (k + 1)colorable.
A 1 vertex graph has maximum degree 0 and is 1colorable,
so P(1) is true.

Now assume that P(n) is true, and let G be an (n + 1)vertex
graph with maximum degree at most k. Remove a vertex v, leaving an nvertex
graph G . The maximum degree of G is at most k, and so G is (k + 1)colorable
by our assumption P(n). Now add back vertex v. We can assign v a color different from all adjacent vertices, since v has degree at most k and k + 1 colors are available. Therefore, G is (k + 1)colorable.
The theorem follows by induction.

== Weighted Graphs ==
A '''weighted graph'''  associates a  label (weight) with every edge in the graph. Weights are usually real numbers, and often represent a &quot;cost&quot; associated with the edge, either in terms of the entity that is being modeled, or an optimization problem that is being solved.

The '''GNU''' operating system was started by Richard Stallman as a free replacement for the UNIX operating system. At the same time Linus Torvalds was working on a kernel, which he adapted to fit the GNU operating system. As time progressed, many applications from UNIX and DOS were ported to GNU/Linux as well as the thousands of new applications written for it.  GNU/Linux has become a completely self-sufficient operating system with applications ranging from the many console applications to the numerous highly advanced GUI applications (many of which are based on lower level console applications) and everything else in between.

The most popular languages for use on the GNU/Linux platform include [[C Programming|C]]/[[C++ Programming|C++]] and [[Programming:Java|Java]], however the range of programming languages supported by the GNU/Linux platform cover the entire spectrum of the software development world. Other popular languages are [[Perl|Perl]], [[Python Programming|Python]] and [[Ruby Programming|Ruby]]. Shell scripting is often used for administrative tasks but cannot be called a complete high level language.

==Basic information==

Most UNIX code is instantly portable to GNU/Linux systems - it can be compiled as on a UNIX system.  GNU/Linux programming tools are mostly from the GNU project at http://www.gnu.org, including gcc (free C/C++ compiler), and equivalents of make, ld, as, etc.  Numerous others are available for various languages, including java.

== Metabolism ==
=== Anabolism and catabolism ===
Metabolism (Fig. 1) is, broadly speaking, the conversion of food into energy, cell components, and waste products.

[[image:biochemistry_metabolism_1.png]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1''': Overview of metabolism

The above diagram shows the different parts of metabolism:
* ''energy source'', which is, after all, the sun, whose energy is harvested through photosynthesis
* ''catabolism'', the breakdown of food into chemical energy, which is needed in
* ''anabolism'', the construction of complex cell molecules from small environmental molecules, utilizing chemical energy
Catabolic reactions release energy and are therefore &lt;tt&gt;exergonic&lt;/tt&gt;, while anabolic reactions use up energy and are therefore &lt;tt&gt;endergonic&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== High-energy phosphates ===
Due to the large variety of food compounds, and the large number of biochemical reactions which need energy in anabolism, it would be quite inefficient to couple a specific anabolic reaction to a specific energy source in catabolism. Instead, the cell uses an intermediate compound, a kind of universal energy currency. This intermediate is called ''high-energy phosphate''.

But when is a phosphate group called &quot;high-energy&quot;, and how does it differ from a &quot;low-energy&quot; phosphate? A giveaway is the &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis separates a phosphate from a compound by adding water:
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; O &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; O
 R-OP-OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;#8652; R-OH + HO-P-OH
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; O &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; O

The &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; of a low-energy (or &quot;inorganic&quot;) phosphate group (called P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is 9-20 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; of a high-energy phosphate (denoted &amp;#9413;) is ~30 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== pKa value ===
Now what makes this &amp;#9413; so special? To explain this, we must take a little excourse into pH and pKa values. A phosphate group has between zero and three &lt;tt&gt;OH&lt;/tt&gt; groups. This allows &amp;#9413; to exist in up to four different forms (0, 1, 2, and 3 &lt;tt&gt;OH&lt;/tt&gt; groups, Fig. 2), depending on the pH value of the surrounding solution. A pKa value gives us the pH value at which 50% of the molecules are in one form (e.g., 1 &lt;tt&gt;OH&lt;/tt&gt; group) and another (e.g., 2 &lt;tt&gt;OH&lt;/tt&gt; groups). This is expressed by the ''Henderson-Hasselbalch equation'' :

:&lt;math&gt;{pH} = {pK}_{a} + log{[base] \over [acid]}&lt;/math&gt;

[[image:biochemistry_metabolism_2.png]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2''': The four possible forms of a phosphate group. pK&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the conditions in the cell.

Now to the promised difference between &amp;#9413; and PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The breaking of the ester bond of an RO&amp;#9413; releases more energy than the breaking of a PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; bond (Fig. 3), because of
# ''electrostatic repulsion'' between the two phosphate groups in PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
# ''resonance stabilization'' of two P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; groups, compared to PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 4)

[[image:biochemistry_metabolism_3.png]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3''': Hydrolysis of &amp;#9413; and PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[image:biochemistry_metabolism_4.png]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 4''': Resonance stabilization of P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

Resonance stabilization means that both &lt;tt&gt;OH&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;=O&lt;/tt&gt; can &quot;travel&quot; around the phosphate. Of course, this is a crude analogy; they do not really move, the electrons are just &quot;smeared&quot; around the phosphate atom. This is also indicated by the use of the &amp;#8596; arrow, instead of &amp;#8652;; the three forms &lt;u&gt;do not exist&lt;/u&gt;, they are just a way of writing down the chemical reality.

As you can see in Fig. 3, the &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; value for PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8652;2P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is &amp;#8810;0, shifting the reaction strongly in favor of the 2P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Molecules using high-energy phosphates ==

=== Anhydride between phosphoric acid and carboxyl group ===
Hydrolysis : &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; = -49.3 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[image:biochemistry_metabolism_5a.png]]

=== Guanidine phosphate ===
Hydrolysis : &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; = -43.0 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[image:biochemistry_metabolism_5b.png]]

=== Enol phosphate ===
For example, this picture is wrong, the carbon has 5 bonds to it after it tautomerizes, which is impossible and a rookie organic chemistry error. please fix phosphoenolpyruvate&lt;br&gt;
Hydrolysis : &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; = -61.9 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[image:biochemistry_metabolism_5c.png]]

=== ATP ===
Adenosine triphosphate contains one low-energy and two high-energy phosphate bonds:&lt;br&gt;
[[image:biochemistry_metabolism_5d.png]]&lt;br&gt;
Low energy : &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; = -14,2 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
High energy : &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; = -30.5 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*ATP is regenerated from ADP (adenosine diphosphate), P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and energy (from food); H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is released in the process.
*ATP is the short-term energy &quot;currency&quot; of the cell.
*ATP concentration in the cell is low (ATP: 2-8mM; ADP:0,2-0,8mM). ATP is generated in high &quot;turn over&quot;.
*ATP performs its chemical work through ''coupled reactions''.
*Coupled reactions are always &amp;#9413; ''transfers'', never direct hydrolysis

Basically, any ATP-driven reaction is reversible, building ATP from ADP and P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in the process. However, some ATP-driven reactions should never be reversed; these include nucleotide and protein synthesis. If these were reversed, the organism would disassemble its own DNA and proteins for energy, a rather unfortunate strategy. For reactions that should never be reversed, ATP can be broken down into AMP (adenosine monophosphate) and PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, which in turn becomes 2&amp;times;P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. This reaction has a &amp;Delta;G&lt;sup&gt;0'&lt;/sup&gt; of -65,7 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is totally irreversible under ''in vivo'' conditions.

It should be noted that AMP can not directly be converted to ATP again. Instead, the enzyme ''AMP kinase'' forms two ADP molecules from one ATP and one AMP. The resulting ADPs are then treated as described above.

== Non-covalent bonds ==
The destruction of covalent bonds takes up huge amounts of energy. The breakdown of an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule into two oxygen atoms needs ~460 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, nowhere in &quot;living&quot; biochemistry are covalent bonds actually destroyed; if one is broken, another one is created. This is where non-covalent bonds come in, they are weak enough to be broken down easily, and to form &quot;bonds&quot; again.  For this reason, many biochemical functions are using so-called weak/secondary/non-covalent bonds.

Weak bonds are created and destroyed much more easily than covalent ones. The typical range of energy needed to destroy such a weak bond is 4-30 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, the formation of weak bonds is energetically favorable, but these bonds are also easily broken by kinetic (thermal) energy (the normal movement of molecules). Biochemical interactions are often temporary (e.g., a substrate has to leave an enzyme quickly after being processed), for which the weakness of these bonds is essential. Also, biochemical specificity (e.g., enzyme-substrate-recognition) is achieved through weak bonds, utilizing two of their major properties:
* Since individual weak bonds are, well, weak, several of them have to occur in a specific pattern at the same time in roughly the same place.
* The short range of weak bonds.

The link that follows demonstrates the type of non-covalent forces: [http://www.pearsonhighered.com/mathews/ch02/fi2p2.htm]
There are three basic types of weak bonds, and a fourth &quot;pseudo-bond&quot;:


=== Ionic bonds ===
Ionic bonds are electrostatic attractions between permanently charged groups. Ionic bonds are not directed. Example:
:X-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;.....&lt;/sup&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;N-Y
::~ 20 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Hydrogen bonds ===
Hydrogen bonds are also established by electrostatic attraction. These attractions do not occur between permanently charged groups, but rather between atoms temporarily charged by a ''dipole moment'', resulting from the different [[electronegativity]] of atoms within a group. Hydrogen bonds are even weaker than ionic bonds, and they are highly directional, usually along a straight line. Besides being weaker than ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds are also weaker, and longer than similar covalent bonds.
Hydrogen bonds are unique because they only exist when the Hydrogen is bonded to an oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), or Fluorine (F), but the most common hydrogen bonds in biochemistry are:
:X-OH &lt;sup&gt;.....&lt;/sup&gt; O-Y
:X-OH &lt;sup&gt;.....&lt;/sup&gt; N-Y
:X-NH &lt;sup&gt;.....&lt;/sup&gt; O-Y
:X-NH &lt;sup&gt;.....&lt;/sup&gt; N-Y
Hydrogen bonds equal an energy between 12-29 kJ mol, whereas covalent bonds are much higher. For example, the covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen is about 492 KJ mol-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Hydrogen Bonds and Water==
Water has unique properties; after all, it is chosen to be the universal solvent. The unique properties of water are due to hydrogen bonding between all the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of the content. The hydrogen bonds occurring in water are about 2 angstroms apart from each other. Although hydrogen bonding is only about 5% as strong as covalent bond, they still cause water to have a high boiling point, and a high surface tension. The following link will take you to the structure of water and its Hydrogen Bonding. 
=== Van der Waals attractions ===

Van der Waals attractions are established between electron density-induced dipoles. They form when the outer electron shells of two atoms ''almost'' (but not quite) touch. The distance of the atoms is very important for these weak interactions. If the atoms are too far apart, the interactions are too weak to establish; if the atoms are too close to each other, their electron shells will repel each other. Van der Waals attractions are highly unspecific; they can occur between virtually any two atoms. Their energy is between 4-8 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Hydrophobic forces ===
Hydrophobic forces are not actually bonds, so this list has four items, but still just three bond types. In a way hydrophobic forces are the negation of the hydrogen bonds of a polar solute, usually water, enclosing a nonpolar molecule. For a polar solute like water, it is energetically unfavorable to &quot;waste&quot; a possible hydrogen bond by exposing it towards a nonpolar molecule. Thus, water will arrange itself around any nonpolar molecule in such a way that no hydrogen bonds point towards that molecule. This results in a higher order, compared to &quot;freely&quot; moving water, which leads to a lower entropy level and is thus energetically unfavorable. If there is more than one nonpolar molecule in the solute, it is favorable for the nonpolar molecules to aggregate in one place, reducing their surrounding, ordered &quot;shell&quot; of water to a minimal surface. Also, in large molecules, such as proteins, the hydrophobic (nonpolar) parts of the molecule will tend to turn towards the inside, while the polar parts will tend to turn towards the surface of the molecule.

While it's asked how | lim [x -&gt; 0]{sin(x)/x} = 1 | can be proven, this isn't demonstrated - there also isn't an actual demonstration elsewhere online, nearly as I can determine. Shouldn't one be put in? --[[User:68.212.77.222|68.212.77.222]] 23:05, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Is there anyone interested in writing [[en:How to evaluate the limit of a real-valued funtion ]]?  --wshun

I think we should put the formal definition of the limit right at the end of page. As it is the most difficult concept to full grasp. And we need some excercises.

The last example seems to imply that f(x) = (x^2 - 9)/(x - 3) is not the same as g(x) = x + 3.  Why is this true?

Because you can't divide by zero; g(3) = 3 + 3 = 6, whereas f(3) = (3^2-9)/(3-3) = (0/0) = undefined.  The functions will, however, be equal at all other points.  (yes I edited your question to make my answer easier to articulate.  :) ) 

BTW, I would consider completely deleting the introduction.  It makes some questionable statements, and I can't see it as being anything but confusion for someone who doesn't know anything about limits already.  --Xhad


Am I the only one that thinks that this whole thing is worthless without the Cauchy definition of a limit? You cannot proove any of the statements unless you define limits properly. The best way to define them is the Cauchy definition!!

==arbitrary break==
(x^2-9)/(x-3) has the problem of a loss of information as x approaches 3.  The solution to this is rearranging the problem so that you are no longer dealing with having a small number on the denominator.  This is the realm of computational mathematics, though, and I'm not sure if it's useful to put in a Calculus textbook.  --Ronald Raygun

To me that sounds like something that would be appropriate for a Calc primer for physicists, but it seems beyond the scope of a typical Calculus course. --Xhad

Can any-one tell me that if we are taking x-&gt;0  and f(x)-&gt;L//then why are puting there an = in the answer when it should be ~(approximate value) --221.135.232.166 10:19, 27 June 2007

To answer the above question, it is because of the definition of a limit.  Although we think of &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; intuitively by the process of taking values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; closer and closer to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, the limit is not formally related to the value of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt;, which may not even be defined.  For instance, consider the function defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
f(x) =\left\{\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; \mbox{if }  x\neq 1 \\
\mbox{27} &amp; \mbox{if } x=1\end{matrix}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

By the definition of limit, &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 1} f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, which is a really bad approximation of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Hey there, I'm making a dutch version of this book/chapter. I think I may have solved some presentational problems so if you like check out http://nl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Analyse:Limieten. Robert Zboray

==LEDE==
The section named [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Calculus/Limits#Finding_limits Finding Limits] starts as follows: ''Now we will concentrate on finding limits, rather than proving them. In the proofs above, we started off with the value of the limit. How did we find it to even begin our proofs?'' I find this confusing. There are no '''proofs''' ''above'' that I can see, only examples. And in those examples we did actually find the value of the limit. (I realize that this error is probably a rest from a previous re-dispositional edit..) Or am I missing something? In that case I apologize. /Hugo --[[User:83.181.53.162|83.181.53.162]] 20:31, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

== &lt;s&gt;You CAN divide by zero&lt;/s&gt; ==

EVERYONE LISTEN TO THIS. I'M TIRED THAT EVERYONE KEEPS TELLING THAT YOU CAN'T DIVIDE BY ZERO.
Of course you can; it's a limit.

lim x/y = a. When y approaches zero, a = infinity.

:Technically, you can divide by ''y'' in the limit as ''y'' approaches zero. You cannot divide by zero without the use of such a limit. Remember that:
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{y \to 0} y \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
:The limit never allows ''y'' to actually take the value of zero, only to approach that value by infinitessimal amounts. As such, ''y'' never equals zero, but instead equals a value infinitessimally close to zero. The two quantities, while close, are not strictly the same. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

Whoa! I'm going to have to set this straight.  You can't divide by zero, neither algebraically nor analytically.  In algebra, the defining quality of the additive identity, zero, is that it has no multiplicative inverse (unless the set is trivially {0}).

PROOF:
:Assume that zero has an multiplicative inverse, and let 0 * a = 1.
:b*a + 1 = b*a + 0*a = (b + 0)*a = b*a   (assumption, distributive prop., def. of additive identity)    
:which means that 1 = 0, which is a contradiction whenever the set is not {0}.
Let's look at it analytically now.  Remember, a limit has to be well-defined to exist.  If it takes on different values depending on the way you approach the limit, then the limit doesn't exist.
Back to your example:
:lim(y-&gt;0) x/y.  Without loss of generality, let x &gt; 0 (if x = 0, then the limit is 0, and if x &lt; 0, we can multiply it by -1)
:lim(y-&gt;0 from the left-negative side) x/y &lt; 0 and lim(y-&gt;0 from the right-positive side) x/y &gt; 0
:Therefore the limit is not well-defined.  It doesn't exist.
Now, you could try to patch it by definition, but no matter what you'll be left with some &quot;infinity&quot; which isn't accounted for.  Also, negative infinity is not equal to positive infinity... that's easy enough to see.

Lastly, to the point: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{y \to 0} y = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  If one uses the formal definition this is obvious.  There is no actual &quot;approaching&quot; - that's just a simple way to think about it.  &quot;The two quantities, while close, are not strictly the same&quot; - They are only different in that they have different names.  (Sketch: Let the infinitesimal x (&gt;0) be a number different from 0, so that x/2 is not 0.  Then |y - 0| &lt; x/2. Obviously y cannot be x, for x &lt;= |x| = |x - 0| &lt; x/2 is a contradiction.) The infinitesimal is a nice tool for investigating functions of limits, but technically it's not a number in the sense you're trying to use it.

Hello! Intuitively, zero is a special symbol (like &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;), that denotes empty expression. But if there is abscence of anything, what are you trying to compare with divident? Of course, division by zero can be defined artificialy, but AFAIK all such definitions lead to contradictions with other axioms.
[[User:Exanode|Exanode]] 15:16, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

There are two limit of each function (though sometimes both give the same result), one from the positive side and one from the negative side, so actually you can take the limit of x/y as y approaches 0. This is also a mistake in the text, which says that the limit of 1/(x-2) as x approaches 2 is undefined. The limit of this function from the negative side is negative infinity and the limit from the positive side is positive infinity.

==TO: authors.==

Please put some visualizations in the text. It's best to describe things like limits with graphics and give viewers an intuitive visual analogy.

I've seen some very interesting eLearning math courses with lots of graphical analogies. It made the concept of functions limit (among other things) easily understandable. Unfortunately the said courses are copyrighted and closed source.

:That's a great suggestion! If you have images or visualizations that you would like to donate, or if you know where we can find free or open-source images that we can use, that would be great.

Shouldn't we start with the values approaching a particular value? That makes it a lot easier to understand.

==Conversation==
For what it matters, after learning a little more about formal continuity, density isn't even required.  For instance, every function on the integers is continuous (since as a subspace of R, they have the discrete topology). Also, something interesting for anyone reading the person down there below Eric119: the integers are complete.  [[User:Mo Anabre|Mo Anabre]] 20:59, 1 November 2007 (UTC)

I changed it back.  The density of the rationals in the reals is quite enough to justify a concept of continuity of f.
[[User:Mo Anabre|Mo Anabre]] 17:48, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

I don't understand why this is wrong. If the domain of f is only the rationals, then, according to our definition of limits (which seems to have vanished from the article), no matter what delta we have there will exist irrational x such that 0 &lt; |x - c| &lt; delta and thus f(x) is not defined and therefore the condition |f(x) - L| &lt; epsilon cannot be true. (And then there is no limit and therefore a discontinuity.) If there is a problem in all this, please let me know. [[User:Eric119|Eric119]] 01:28, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)

this is just wrong! The real number line is complete, meaning there are no holes. However, if we say ''f''&amp;nbsp;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and restrict the domain of ''f'' to rational numbers, there will be holes at the places corresponding to irrational numbers. There are irrational numbers between any two rational numbers, so all the rational numbers on which ''f'' is defined are isolated from each other. But, there are rational numbers between any two irrational numbers, so each hole must be at a single point. There are infinite irrational numbers over any interval, so there are an infinite number of infinitely small holes between any two points on the graph. The places where ''f'' is defined are also infinite and infinitely small. The function ''f'' has no limits defined anywhere, despite that any graph would look like a simple line.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called RoseParks. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name RoseParks~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the NOV policy needs some discussion for wikibooks project.  

We may agree that wikibooks should not a place to produce a book that asserts some specific position or view, though I am not completely sure.

Should we say, for example, there should not be a book about environmental conservation (or gun control or birth control) that asserts that conservation is important? (The more NPOV way of referring to that is &quot;many (including, A, B) think that conservation is important because of ..., though there are some criticisms, most notably by C that ....&quot; 

In case of encyclopedia, there is a solution - we can sometimes split an article into many articles, and explain different points of views in length. 

If we were to implement this kind of solution, we might want to develop multiple &quot;modules&quot; or components of books along with multiple table of contents (each of which take different sets of modules to create a book from one particular POV). 

Feel free to copy this to mailing list or elsewhere. [[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 22:54, 31 Aug 2003 (UTC)
:I agree that NPOV will have to apply differently here than Wikipedia.  Since the project is still nascent, the best bet is to just go with it and, hopefully, a consensus will develop over time -- since most of our regulars are likely also Wikipedians, I think this will be a relatively easy process.  The conservation textbook you mentioned is a good example; it would be silly to interrupt every point with an explanation of why not everyone believes it.  The same would apply to descriptions of evolution, the Big Bang, etc.  We can assume a particular POV on the part of the reader in these cases, and should probably include an introduction or preface that explains why we are ignoring the fact that not everyone believes the same way on these issues. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 18:00, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

My opinion is that NPOV is not really at home here. Textbooks and other learning materials at times are written, and NEED to be written, from a &quot;non-neutral&quot; point of view. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:51, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:I'm pretty new here, but I strongly belive that NPOV is not appropriate for Wikibooks. I think that there is, perhaps, some questionable sort of &quot;objectivity&quot; that something like an Encyclopedia can strive for, but I do not think this the case with a book. Limiting ourselves to books that meet an-NPOV standard would limit ourselves to books that sound an aweful lot like encyclopedias. Wikibooks seems to be about something beyond that.

:''Furthermore'', since Wikibooks is trying to create textbooks or books that could be used for learning, in a project like Wikiversity, etc., I think it is important to recognize that &quot;objective&quot; truth is a POV that tends to privilege the status-quo. Like the above example, if you are writing a book on environmental conservation, I believe it would not only be &quot;silly&quot; to strive for NPOV, I believe it would be counter-productive. As a history student, I believe that every narrative has an implicit subjectivity, (or POV). Any narrative that is constructed, for instance history, anthropology, sociology, etc., comes from a point of view and has political implications. The notion of &quot;objectivity&quot; and &quot;objective truth&quot; for instance in Anthroplogy, has been used to blind people from the significance of privileged white male anthropologists observing other cultures. (And Anthropology, with its claim to &quot;objective truth,&quot; has played a vital role in the construction of scientific racism.)

:I'm sorry if I'm trailing off here... I just feel strongly that recognizing subjectivity as opposed to hiding from it is a more fruitful approach to something such as Wikibooks. [[User:Fokion|Fokion]] 23:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

----

If there is a '''need''' to have something written from an non-NPOV, then that need should (will?) be clearly noted in the text itself.  The real question of NPOV is what does 'neutral' really mean?  That should be clearly defined in the policy.  My initial idea is that if something exists to be talked about factually, there is something in empirical reality that can be cited, and ought to be cited.  Conclusions and opinions based on that empirical concepts should be built logically.  ''If'' there are any countering opinions (or ''significant'' counter theories) they should be explained as if they were subject to the same rules.  --[[User:Delfeld|Neal Delfeld]] 18:24, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:I think a problem here is that the idea of talking &quot;factually&quot; and &quot;empirical reality&quot; may work well with something like computer science or mathematics, but not so well with history or social theory. History, for instance, is not made of concrete facts, one stacking upon another. NPOV may work better with the &quot;hard&quot; sciences, but in the humanities or social sciences there is no such thing.[[User:Fokion|Fokion]] 00:16, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

== POV in textbooks ==

I think our history, geography and Chinese history textbooks are almost certainly biased. Especially history. You know, the 'the ancient Egyptians were great architects' or 'Alexander the Great was a great ruler'. For the ancient Egyptians they even gave the wrong fact because they followed Herodotus' version. But to the smaller ones. Like 'the Spartans are a warlike people'. Most people agree that, don't we? By modern standards they are pretty warlike. But is that still an opinion, an opinion to the eyes of us modern people? And one more thing: Athenians built many open-air theatres. What defines many? There could be theatres on every corner of Planet Drama. :)

By the way, I think the emoticon should be removed. It makes our policy here look much more casual. Policies and guidelines can joke, sure, WP does that all the time, but not include non-standard ways of expressing.

: Compared with Wikipedia our NPOV policy is much more casual. I think Wikipedia expects their articles to be written neutral from the beginning while Wikibooks accepts that neutrality is a process that takes time. Wikipedia's expectations are reflected in that its policy defines what it means for articles to be neutral and how to achieve neutrality while Wikibooks relies on the scope of each book to affect what it means to be neutral and how neutrality is achieved which is reflected by the more general and less specific approach used in Wikibooks' policy.

== Historic texts ==
The origin of many modern dishes can be traced back to ancient times, but there are very few surviving texts written before 1000 AD that deal with cooking. In many cases where texts exist, the recipes and directions they provide are little more than guidelines and assume much knowledge on the part of the cook.

For example the following is a recipe taken from the Forme of Cury, a roll of cookery written around 1390 by the master cooks of King Richard II of England.

:'''Compost.'''

:Take rote of persel, of pasternak, of rafens, scrape hem and waische hem clene. Take rapes &amp; caboches, ypared and icorue. Take an erthen panne with clene water &amp; set it on the fire; cast alle þise þerinne. Whan þey buth boiled cast þerto peeres, &amp; parboile hem wel. Take alle þise thynges vp &amp; lat it kele on a faire cloth. Do þerto salt; whan it is colde, do hit in a vessel; take vyneger &amp; powdour &amp; safroun &amp; do þerto, &amp; lat alle þise thynges lye þerin al nyyt, oþer al day. Take wyne greke &amp; hony, clarified togider; take lumbarde mustard &amp; raisons coraunce, al hoole, &amp; grynde powdour of canel, powdour douce &amp; aneys hole, &amp; fenell seed. Take alle þise thynges &amp; cast togyder in a pot of erthe, &amp; take þerof whan þou wilt &amp; serue forth.

&lt;!-- Take ???, scrape them and wash them clean. Take ???. Take an earthenware pan with clean water and set it on the fire; toss in the aforementioned ingredients. When ???, throw in ??? and parboil thoroughly. Let cool on a ??? cloth. Could someone please finish this translation? --&gt;

This recipe, which is written in late Middle English, is open to interpretation as it gives no specific quantities and assumes that the reader will know how long certain things need to be cooked, soaked, etc.

You shouldn't let this deter you from reading old texts concerning cookery; indeed there is a certain degree of fun in taking an old recipe and determining how it might have been prepared.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The introduction to variables may make sense for a course to &quot;Programming C&quot;
and a like. But in a more broader context it does not satisfy me. Some thoughts:

Variables may ''reference'' values rather than ''stand in for''. You can
make the variables to reference to another value later on in the program,
you can have to variables to reference the same value and you can then
manipulate these value through either variable.

The later is explained in the text, but we may abstract from &quot;memory addresses&quot; here. 

Moreover, there are programming languages where you have to declare
a variable before you can use but don't need to give it a type. I'm thinking
of Oz here. In some dynamically typed languages like ruby, procedures/functions/methods declare proc./func./method need arguments (which are
variables) declared but without a type.

:Dates and times can be in various formats such as USA (mm/dd/yyyy); European (dd.mm.yyyy); Japanese (yyyy.mm.dd); based on Chinese Year (not Biblical); and others.

== Lysosomes == 
Membrane-bound sacs called lysosomes contain digestive enzymes that can break down such macromolecules as proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides (Figure 6-23). Lysosomes have several functions. They fuse with incoming food vacuoles and expose the nutrients to enzymes that digest them, thereby nourishing the cell. Lysosomes also function like safety officers when they help destroy harmful bacteria. In certain cells—for example, your white blood cells—lysosomes release enzymes into vacuoles that contain trapped bacteria and break down the bacterial cell walls. Similarly, lysosomes serve as recycling centers for damaged organelles. Without harming the cell, a lysosome can engulf and digest another organelle. This makes molecules available for the construction of new organelles.The structures vary in size from 0.2 to 2 micrometers in diameter. The staining reveals a crystal like matrix in spherical vesicles. The crystalloid matrix is urate oxidase. These are small organelles containing around 40 enzymes for intercellular digestion. The lysosome membrane helps to protect the enzymes as much as it helps protect the cell. This is because the optimal pH for these enzymes is around a pH of 5. The membrane of the lysosome is again a lipid bilayer and is thought to have a ATP hydrolysis to pump H+ into the lysosome to maintain the pH. This also has another affect, that is free protons. Other small molecules can pass through the lysosome membrane, but will then become charged by picking up a free proton, then they are less likely to be able to leave the lysososome. A good reference on Lysosomes is at

----
It used to be thought that peroxisomes are formed by the budding of smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). However, now it is thought that they form through self-assembly. (I will get more information references as I do some more thorough literature searches). The peroxisome is another major source of Oxygen utilization (along with the mitochondrion). There are specific proteins associated with the peroxisomes membrane, also there are 3 oxidation enzymes associated with peroxisomes:

# D-amino acid oxidase 
# Urate Oxidase 
# Catalase 

The enzyme contents vary with various types of cells. One of the main functions of peroxisomes in liver cells is detoxification. This is done by the oxidation of substances like:

# Alcohol - About 1/2 of the ethanol one drinks is converted to acetaldehyde by oxidation. 
# Phenols 
# Formic acid 
# Formaldehyde 

=== Why peroxisomes are not like lysosomes ===

Peroxisomes are organelles that contain oxidative enzymes, such as D-amino acid oxidase, urate oxidase, and catalase. They may resemble a lysosome, however, they are not formed in the Golgi complex. Peroxisomes are distinguished by a crystalline structure inside a sac which also contains amorphous gray material. They are self replicating, like the mitochondria. Components accumulate at a given site and they can be assembled into a peroxisome. They may look like storage granules, however, they are not formed in the same way as storage granules.

Peroxisomes function to rid the body of toxic substances like hydrogen peroxide, or other metabolites. They are a major site of oxygen utilization and are numerous in the liver where toxic byproducts are going to accumulate. 

The peroxisome is made as a phospholipid bilayer, encapsulating oxidative materials. They would be 'sphere-ish' in shape, not necessarily a perfect sphere, and sometimes, they may take other shapes. But most electron micrographs I have seen (2 dimensions) show them as circles. (As you may be aware, the Cell membrane is also a phospholipid bilayer.) Peroxisomes have membrane proteins that are critical for peroxisomal function, to import proteins into their interiors, proliferate or segregate to daughter cells (This update, thanks to Babich Temps). The main differences would be:

# Types of phospholipids used. 
#Size of the membrane (i.e. peroxisomes are MUCH smaller than the cell).

----
The cytosol (as opposed to cytoplasm, which also includes the organelles) is the internal fluid of the cell, and a large part of cell metabolism occurs here. Proteins within the cytosol play an important role in signal transduction pathways, glycolysis, and act as intracellular receptors and ribosomes. In prokaryotes, all chemical reactions take place in the cytosol. In eukaryotes, the cytosol contains the cell organelles. In plants, the amount of cytosol can be reduced due to the large tonoplast (central vacuole) that takes up most of the room of the cell.

The cytosol is not a &quot;soup&quot; with free-floating particles, but highly organized on the molecular level. The cytosol also contains the cytoskeleton. It is made of fibrous proteins and (in many organisms) maintains the shape of the cell, anchors organelles, and controls internal movement of structures, e.g., transport vesicles.

As the concentration of soluble molecules increases within the cytosol, an osmotic gradient builds up toward the outside of the cell. Water is flowing into the cell, making it larger. To prevent the cell from bursting apart, molecular pumps in the plasma membrane, the cytoskeleton, the tonoplast or a cell wall (if present) are used to counteract the osmotic pressure.

==Where charge concentrates==

{| align=&quot;right&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | [[Image:Charged asymetric conductor.png]]
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;ccddff&quot; |  The charge spreads out on  this &lt;br/&gt;uneven conductor unevenly. The &lt;br/&gt;two electrons that are circled &lt;br/&gt;in red cannot see each other.&lt;br/&gt; The body of the conductor gets&lt;br/&gt; in the way and shields them. This&lt;br/&gt; is why the charges congregate&lt;br/&gt; around the highly curved areas.
|}
When an object is charged up with electrons, the electrons try to spread out over the object to be as far apart as possible. This means they go to the surface rather than spread throughout. On a metal object the material of which the object is made shields the electrons from one another. They do not ‘’see’’ the electrons round the back. This means that highly curved objects can hold more electrons than flat objects. For a complicated shape, the electrons tend to congregate on the more highly curved areas, and to desert the flatter areas.

==Inducing charge separation on neutral objects==

Consider a crystal of gold for example. {This argument works for all materials}. Normally the atoms are perfectly spherical, and completely neutral. 

'''Q1)''' Why are the atoms neutral?

Remember that neutral atoms contain positive charges in the nucleus and negative electrons orbiting in their shell. Normally the center of the positive charges and the center of the negative electrons is in the same place: the exact center of the atom. If we bring up a charged object to them however, something important happens. Look at the diagram on the right.


{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Charge separation on a crystal.png]]
|}A charged rod is brought near the surface of the crystal. {Note: the rod is not shown, just the charges on it}. The electrons in the atoms try to get away from the negative charge because they are repelled. The positive charges in the nucleus try to get nearer to the negative rod because they are attracted to it. The result is the atom slightly changes shape. The center of the negative charges goes to the right of the center of the atom and the center of the positive charges goes to the left. We say there is a '''separation of charges'''

'''Q2)''' What would happen if we brought up a positively charged rod?

'''There is always an attractive force between the rod and the crystal no matter what the charge on the rod'''.

To see why this is so, we need to know one more thing about electrostatics. '''The force of repulsion or attraction falls off with distance'''. In fact, rather like gravity it falls off as the ''square'' of the distance. This means if you go to twice the distance the force becomes only a quarter as much. If you go three times the distance it becomes only one ninth as great and so on. Now look at the diagram again. The negative charges in the atoms are repelled by the rod, the positive ones are attracted, but '''the positive charges are closer''', so overall there is a force of attraction.

'''Q3)''' Repeat the above argument with a positively charged rod to convince yourself that there is still an attractive force.

==Lightning==

| [[File:Multiple Lightning Strikes.jpg]]
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;ccddff&quot; | Time-lapse photography captures multiple cloud-to-ground&lt;br/&gt; lightning strikes during a night-time thunderstorm.
|}

Lightning is basically a great big spark. In a thunderstorm, separation of charge occurs in big rain clouds. No one is really sure of ''how'' this occurs, although it appears to be caused by ice crystals rubbing together and becoming charged. but what ''is'' known is that storm clouds have a negative bottom and a positive top. The bottom of the cloud is nearer to the ground so it induces a positive charge on the ground. When the voltage becomes high enough a spark flies between the cloud and the earth; this is lightning. The spark is so hot, it causes the air to rapidly expand then collapse; this causes thunder.

'''Q4)''' Why does the voltage need to be very high before lightning can occur?
===Lightning rods===
Lightning rods are used to protect buildings from lightning strikes. They are usually made from a length of copper rod with a pointed end. They are attached to tall buildings and the lightning strikes them rather than the building itself.

'''Q5)''' Why do you think the rods are made of copper rather than iron which is cheaper?

'''Q6)''' Why do the rods have a pointed end?

'''Q7)''' It is standard advice that if caught out in a storm you should ''never'' stand under a lone tree. Why is this advice good?                                                                       


{| bgcolor=&quot;#ffeeaa&quot;
|-
|
'''Summary'''
*Charge congregates around highly curved surfaces
*A charged object induces charge separation in nearby neutral objects. This ''always'' produces an attractive force
*Lightning is just a big spark from a cloud to the ground, thunder is the sound of the spark
*Lightning rods protect buildings by attracting the lightning strike and conducting the charge safely to ground

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word '''geometry''' originates from the Greek words (''geo'' meaning world, ''metri'' meaning measure) and means, literally, to measure the earth. It is an ancient branch of mathematics, but its modern meaning depends largely on context. Geometry largely encompasses forms of non-numeric mathematics, such as those involving measurement, area and perimeter calculation, and work involving angles and position. It was one of the two fields of pre-modern mathematics, the other being the study of numbers. In modern times, geometric concepts have been generalized to a high level of abstraction and complexity, and have been subjected to the methods of calculus and abstract algebra, so that many modern branches of the field are barely recognizable as the descendants of early geometry. This Wikibook is dedicated to high school geometry and geometry in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Pointers and arrays|Strings}}

In C, you have already considered creating variables for use in the program. You have created some arrays for use, but you may have already noticed some limitations:
* the size of the array must be known beforehand 
* the size of the array cannot be changed in the duration of your program

''Dynamic memory allocation'' in C is a way of circumventing these problems.

== Malloc ==
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
void free(void *ptr);
void *malloc(size_t size);
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
&lt;/source&gt;
The C function &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is the means of implementing dynamic memory allocation. It is defined in stdlib.h or malloc.h, depending on what operating system you may be using. Malloc.h contains only the definitions for the memory allocation functions and not the rest of the other functions defined in stdlib.h. Usually you will not need to be so specific in your program, and if both are supported, you should use &lt;stdlib.h&gt;, since that is ANSI C, and what we will use here.

The corresponding call to release allocated memory back to the operating system is &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;.

When dynamically allocated memory is no longer needed, &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; should be called to release it back to the memory pool.  Overwriting a pointer that points to dynamically allocated memory can result in that data becoming inaccessible.  If this happens frequently, eventually the operating system will no longer be able to allocate more memory for the process.  Once the process exits, the operating system is able to free all dynamically allocated memory associated with the process.

Let's look at how dynamic memory allocation can be used for arrays.

Normally when we wish to create an array we use a declaration such as
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int array[10];
&lt;/source&gt;

Recall &lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt; can be considered a pointer which we use as an array. We specify the length of this array is 10 &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s. After &lt;code&gt;array[0]&lt;/code&gt;, nine other integers have space to be stored consecutively.

Sometimes it is not known at the time the program is written how much memory will be needed for some data. In this case we would want to dynamically allocate required memory after the program has started executing.
To do this we only need to declare a pointer, and invoke &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; when we wish to make space for the  elements in our array, ''or'', we can tell &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; to make space when we first initialize the array. Either way is acceptable and useful.

We also need to know how much an int takes up in memory in order to make room for it; fortunately this is not difficult, we can use C's builtin &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; operator. For example, if &lt;code&gt;sizeof(int)&lt;/code&gt; yields 4, then one &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; takes up 4 bytes. Naturally, &lt;code&gt;2*sizeof(int)&lt;/code&gt; is how much memory we need for 2 &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s, and so on.

So how do we &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; an array of ten &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s like before? If we wish to declare and make room in one hit, we can simply say
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int *array = malloc(10*sizeof(int));
&lt;/source&gt;
We only need to declare the pointer; &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; gives us some space to store the 10 &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s, and returns the pointer to the first element, which is assigned to that pointer.

'''Important note!''' &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; does ''not'' initialize the array; this means that the array may contain random or unexpected values! Like creating arrays without dynamic allocation, the programmer must initialize the array with sensible values before using it. Make sure you do so, too. (''See later the function &lt;code&gt;memset&lt;/code&gt; for a simple method.)

It is not necessary to immediately call &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; after declaring a pointer for the allocated memory.
Often a number of statements exist between the declaration and the call to &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, as follows:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int *array = NULL;
printf(&quot;Hello World!!!&quot;);
/* more statements */
array = malloc(10*sizeof(int)); /* delayed allocation */
/* use the array */
&lt;/source&gt;
=== Error checking ===
When we want to use &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, we have to be mindful that the pool of memory available to the programmer is ''finite''. As such, we can conceivably run out of memory! In this case, &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. In order to stop the program crashing from having no more memory to use, one should always check that malloc has not returned &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; before attempting to use the memory; we can do this by 
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int *pt = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
if(pt == NULL)
{
   fprintf(stderr, &quot;Out of memory, exiting\n&quot;);
   exit(1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, suddenly quitting as in the above example is not always appropriate, and depends on the problem you are trying to solve and the architecture you are programming for. For example, if the program is a small, non critical application that's running on a desktop quitting may be appropriate. However if the program is some type of editor running on a desktop, you may want to give the operator the option of saving his tediously entered information instead of just exiting the program.  A memory allocation failure in an embedded processor, such as might be in a washing machine, could cause an automatic reset of the machine.  For this reason, many embedded systems designers avoid dynamic memory allocation altogether.

==The &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt; function==
The &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt; function allocates space for an array of items and initilizes the memory to zeros.  The call &lt;code&gt;mArray = calloc( count, sizeof(struct V))&lt;/code&gt; allocates &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; objects, each of whose size is sufficient to contain an instance of the structure &lt;code&gt;struct V&lt;/code&gt;. The space is initialized to all bits zero. The function returns either a pointer to the allocated memory or, if the allocation fails, &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;.

==The &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; function==


&lt;source lang=c&gt; void * realloc ( void * ptr, size_t size ); &lt;/source&gt;
 
The &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; function changes the size of the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; to the size specified by &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;. The contents of the object shall be unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old sizes. If the new size is larger, the value of the newly allocated portion of the object is indeterminate. If &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; is a null pointer, the &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; function behaves like the &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; function for the specified size. Otherwise, if &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; does not match a pointer earlier returned by the &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; function, or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; function, the behavior is undefined.  If the space cannot be allocated, the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; is unchanged. If &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; is zero and &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; is not a null pointer, the object pointed to is freed.  The &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt; function returns either a null pointer or a pointer to the possibly moved allocated object.

==The &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; function==
Memory that has been allocated using &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt; must be released back to the system memory pool once it is no longer needed. This is done to avoid perpetually allocating more and more memory, which could result in an eventual memory allocation failure.  Memory that is not released with &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; is however released when the current program terminates on most operating systems. Calls to &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; are as in the following example.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int *myStuff = malloc( 20 * sizeof(int)); 
if (myStuff != NULL) 
{
   /* more statements here */
   /* time to release myStuff */
   free( myStuff );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== free with recursive data structures ===
It should be noted that &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; is neither intelligent nor recursive.  The following code that depends on the recursive application of free to the internal variables of a [[C Programming/Complex types|struct]] does not work.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
typedef struct BSTNode 
{
   int value; 
   struct BSTNode* left;
   struct BSTNode* right;
} BSTNode;

// Later: ... 

BSTNode* temp = (BSTNode*) calloc(1, sizeof(BSTNode));
temp-&gt;left = (BSTNode*) calloc(1, sizeof(BSTNode));

// Later: ... 

free(temp); // WRONG! don't do this!
&lt;/source&gt;
The statement &quot;&lt;code&gt;free(temp);&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will '''not''' free &lt;code&gt;temp-&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, causing a memory leak. The correct way to free the allocated memory is as follows.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
free(temp-&gt;left);
free(temp);
&lt;/source&gt;

Because C does not have a garbage collector, C programmers are responsible for making sure there is a &lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt; exactly once for each time there is a &lt;code&gt;malloc()&lt;/code&gt;.
If a tree has been allocated one node at a time, then it needs to be freed one node at a time.

=== Don't free undefined pointers ===
Furthermore, using &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; when the pointer in question was never allocated in the first place often crashes or leads to mysterious bugs further along.

To avoid this problem, always initialize pointers when they are declared.
Either use &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; at the point they are declared (as in most examples in this chapter), or set them to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; when they are declared (as in the &quot;delayed allocation&quot; example in this chapter).
&lt;ref&gt;
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=478901 &quot;Bug 478901 ... libpng-1.2.34 and earlier might free undefined pointers&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several errors on this page, and I also don't quite like the approach to that is taken here. I think we should use the real names of the types of Japanese verbs, namely Itidan and Godan. Also, I am a big fan of Kana. Romanisatons are only crutches. This is also why I use the official Japanese romanisation, and not the Hepburn one if I have no access to a Kana-enabled PC . It's a bit slower in the beginning, but there's nothing better than Kana to learn Japanese. 

Basically, apart from the irregular verbs, japanese verbs can be conjugated in all possible forms, based upon five basic stems, namely the dictionary form, and four forms derived from it. -masu is in fact an auxilliary verb wtih a (slighlty) irregular verb.

To explain it with an example:

hanasa: Informal negative stem. Used to form negative and passive forms.
hanasi: Informal positive stem. Used to form more complex forms of the verb such as the polite forms, the informal past and the -te form.
hanasu: Informal positive present form, also called dictionary form.  
hanase: Imperative stem. Used to form provisional and imperative forms.  
hanaso: Volitional stem. Used only to form the volitional. 

Other example for godan (sinu=to die)
sina (-nai, -nareru, -nasu, -naseru)
sin (-de, -da, -dai,  
sinu
sine (-ba)
sino (-o)

And, for ichidan:
tabe
tabe
taberu
tabe
tabe

Now, it should be clear why verbs are called &quot;one-rank&quot; (itidan) or &quot;five-rank&quot; (godan) in Japanese ^_^. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:157.193.202.83|157.193.202.83]] ([[User talk:157.193.202.83|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/157.193.202.83|contribs]]) 02:31, 2 September 2003.&lt;/small&gt;

There are several verbs with slight irregularities that aren't covered here.  aru -&gt; nai instead of *aranai, kureru -&gt; kure instead of *kurero in the imperative, iku -&gt; itte instead of *iite in the conjunctive, the one-kanji + suru verbs than sometimes conjugate like X-su instead of X-suru-- aisuru -&gt; aiseru instead of *ai-dekiru (and can sometimes be X-zuru instead of X-ziru), and the five polite verbs irassyaru, ossyaru, kudasaru, gozaru, and nasaru whose stem is irregular and involves dropping the -ru instead of just the -u and adding &quot;i&quot;-- i.e. irassyaimasu instead of *irassyarimasu. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:128.253.136.126|128.253.136.126]] ([[User talk:128.253.136.126|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/128.253.136.126|contribs]]) 16:52, 23 November 2004  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

I would like to point out that it would be helpful to others if the tenses were to be outlined in the context of proper usage and English equivalents (if any).  Many may not feel they know enough to distinguish between the use of the &quot;non-past&quot; and the &quot;volitative&quot;.  Of course, those studying should know that the indicative can be formed by just using the infinitive (in some cases).  Tenses are used in polite speech for the most part (?). &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:207.162.163.19|207.162.163.19]] ([[User talk:207.162.163.19|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/207.162.163.19|contribs]]) 07:40, 11 May 2004  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

As an intermediate-level student of Japanese (I've taken five semesters, one of them in Tokyo), I must say this page confuses me, and I can't imagine a beginner, using this wikibook to teach themselves, learning anything from this. It reads more like a linguistic analysis than a step-by-step teaching process. Personally, I've never been a big fan of complex linguistics terms like &quot;perfective,&quot; &quot;conjunctive,&quot; and &quot;euphony&quot;; they don't serve to add to understanding, and probably confuse and scare away readers/students. Other terms like &quot;conditional,&quot; &quot;volitional,&quot; and &quot;non-past&quot; are, I think, a little better, as their meanings are more well-known and transparent. Still, even though the basic 'non-past' form (e.g. 食べる or 食べます) is used for both present and future, and as the infinitive, I've always seen it described as the 'present' tense, because this is simpler, and easier for a beginning student to wrap their mind around.

As for godan and ichidan, I've never heard that before, and so it's confusing to me. I learned them as う-verbs and る-verbs ... but either way is better than one book I saw that called them Type I and Type II verbs, and didn't even call the irregulars 'irregular', just called them Type III.

:I've seen that. The source I saw also had an ある-class, including ござる and 下さる, which acted like る verbs (even though they end in ある rather than える or いる) but with the addition of an い to the conjunctive form, e.g. くださ'''い'''ます. I kind of prefer that arrangement, as the other systems gloss them over or consider them another sort of irregular separate from the irregulars (despite the fact that they're regular when considered as a group).

I apologize to complain and criticize without going ahead and changing things, making you do the work or whatever, but, I think it'd be ruder to go and change things now that you've obviously sorted the whole thing out and put a lot of work into it yourself. If you'd like me to write (or help) on part of it, just drop me a message. Thanks.

Oh, and if I could add one more thing. Spelling.
し should be written 'shi', not 'si'.
しゃ should be 'sha' not 'shya', and certainly not 'sya'.
じょ should be 'jo' not 'jyo'.
These sorts of incorrect romanizations, in my opinion, make the language look more strange and esoteric, and confuse beginners who might mistake 'sya', 'sha' and 'shya' for different characters, and worse, who might actually get the wrong idea about pronunciation.

== Some comments ==

I do realise that it has been months since the last comments were made here.  However there are some things I'd like to say about what is said above:

* Verbs, adjectives and adjectival nouns traditionally have six stems; however, for verbs, the language has evolved such that in modern usage, two of the forms almost always coincide, so it looks like there are only five for verbs.

* It is quite standard to call the verbs ''godan'', ''ichidan'' and &quot;irregular&quot; in English, together with the other standard of calling the first two types ''u'' and ''ru'' verbs.  Japanese-author textbooks use the type I-II-III style more.  However, the &quot;official&quot; types are:

# 五段 ''godan''
# 上一段 ''kamiichidan'' = the single-row conjugation verbs ending in ''iru''
# 下一段 ''shimoichidan'' = the single-row conjugation verbs ending in ''eru''
# カ行変格 ''kagyou henkaku'' = ''kuru''
# サ行変格 ''sagyou henkaku'' = ''suru''

The verbs usually called &quot;irregular&quot; in English are thus not really called &quot;irregular&quot; in Japanese, just &quot;different from normal&quot;.  This is because while a foreign learner typically does not learn further than the Japanese as used in modern times, when verbs from much older texts are considered, there are quite a few more types of verbs:

# 四段 ''yodan'' - which naturally became 五段 verbs as a consequence of the writing reform in 1946
# 上一段 ''kamiichidan'' - the dozen or so of them have stayed as 上一段 verbs
# 上二段 ''kaminidan'' - they have become 上一段 verbs
# 下一段 ''shimoichidan'' - the only 下一段 verb in the old times, 蹴る, became 五段
# 下二段 ''shimonidan'' - they have become 下一段 verbs (but ''uru''/''eru'' has kept a slightly modified ''shimonidan'' conjugation even in modern Japanese)
# カ行変格 ''kagyou henkaku'' - 来 ''ku'' (= modern くる ''kuru'')
# サ行変格 ''sagyou henkaku'' - out of these, only す ''su'' (= modern する ''suru'') survived into modern times.  One of these old verbs was おはす ''owasu'', the &quot;ancestor&quot; of ござる ''gozaru''
# ナ行変格 ''nagyou henkaku'' - 1) 死ぬ ''shinu'' (became 五段 in modern times; however many dialects have kept the ''henkaku'' type conjugations); 2) 往ぬ ''inu'' (fell into disuse only last century)
# ラ行変格 ''ragyou henkaku'' - verbs that ended in り ''ri'': あり (= modern ある), をり (= modern おる) etc.

and the true &quot;irregular verbs&quot; are called 特別活用 ''tokubetsu katsuyou'' verbs, such as the endless variations on ござる (there are easily twenty of them, as it evolved from the original おはす ''owasu'' all the way to Edo period's ''gozaru''), or a verb like さしも ''sashimo'' (which doesn't even end in a ''u'' or ''i'' sound), which conjugates like ''sashima'', ''sashimou'', ''sashimo'', ''sashimo'', ''sashimae'', ''sashimae''/''sashime''.

Irregularities in conjugations, such as in the verb くださる ''kudasaru'', are noted, but otherwise they are classified as ''godan'' or ''ichidan'' verbs officially.  ない ''nai'', the word used when one wants to express the negative of ある ''aru'', is actually an adjective.  Hence ない has such forms as なき ''naki'' and なし ''nashi'', while none of the other verbs ending in -ない have such forms.  In addition, the negative stem for ある ''aru'', i.e. あら ''ara'', exists, and is used in other situations.  As a historical side note, there was indeed a period when the あらない form was used, when the auxiliary verb ない ''nai'' itself was pretty new.  (In the old days it was ず ''zu''.)

As for romanisation, it is actually the standard in Japan to write し as ''si'', write しゃ as ''sya'', write ち as ''ti'', etc.  But as has been pointed out already, this is misleading in terms of pronunciation, so the rest of the world has happily ignored it.  However, because of its official status, one can't really say it's wrong either...

-- [[User:KittySaturn|KittySaturn]] 04:16, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Also, an extra note about the terminology being too technical: the style of terminology such as ''u'' and ''ru'' verbs is indeed easy for beginners to understand; however this kind of terminology simply does not work at more advanced levels of Japanese learning, because soon there will be so many &quot;exceptions&quot; that nothing makes sense any more - ''su beki'' would be an &quot;exception&quot;, ''osokare hayakare'' is another &quot;exception&quot;, the grammar pattern ''-zaru wo enai'' is an &quot;exception&quot;, and the ''n'' in ''iwan bakari'', being not of a negative meaning, becomes totally inexplicable... when they in fact fit into the &quot;complicated terminology&quot; grammar structure well, and it is just that the basic terminology is incapable of describing. -- [[User:KittySaturn|KittySaturn]] 04:29, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Verb suffixes ==

To what point should verb suffixes be mentioned?  Should a section be made to discuss them and list common ones?  -- [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 09:38, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

: I think it would be fine to make this page as exhaustive as possible. The reader can choose what to pick from it while the actual lesson pages should (in my view) take smaller steps and lead the reader along topics of increasing difficaulty. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:38, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
:: The problem with an exhaustive list is that it will become a conglomerate mess as items get added.  Perhaps it'll suffice to make pages on the conjugations and then make a list of suffixes there, which could lead to other pages.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 00:20, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

::: Sorry, where are you thinking of putting the list of suffixes? Discussing them in detail on sperate pages sounds fair enough, though. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:23, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

Electrolysis is the decomposition of certain types of substance using electricity. The types of substance that can be split are '''ionic''' substances. This just means that they are made of  charged ions rather than neutral atoms. {Remember that an ion is just an atom that has either a positive or negative charge}. An example of an ionic substance is common table salt sodium chloride. The sodium atom has a positive charge, the chlorine atom has a negative charge. It is usually written as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Q1)''' Check in a periodic table, what is the symbol for sodium: Na or Cl?

As you may already know if you've studied the [[GCSE_Science/Metals|Metals]] module, a salt is any substance made by combining an acid with an alkali. Acids, alkalis, and therefore all salts are ionic.

'''Q2)''' Which of the following substances can be broken up by electricity: sodium chloride, iron sulphate, copper nitrate?

==Basic experimental setup==

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Simple electrolysis setup.png]]
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;ccddff&quot; | The liquid electrolyte is connected&lt;br&gt; to a battery or power supply.&lt;br&gt;The electrodes must not touch!
|}

Most ionic compounds are not liquid at room temperature. This is a problem because the ions need to be able to move for the electric current to be able to flow. This can be achieved by melting. Look at the electrical setup shown on the right.  The electrodes are just two carbon rods connected to a battery. The one connected to the positive electrode is called the '''anode'''. The one connected to the negative electrode is called the '''cathode'''. this is due to a collision

Consider for example the compound lead bromide. This compound is a solid at room temperature but can be molten over a Bunsen flame. So what you would do is put some lead bromide into a beaker. Put the beaker on a tripod over a bunsen flame. Melt the lead bromide, then put in the electrodes and turn the power supply on at a setting of, say, 2V. What you would see happening is the cathode, is a silvery coating of pure lead forming, and bromine forming at the anode. The current would continue to flow until all the lead bromide was turned into lead and bromine.

'''Q3)''' It takes energy to split up a compound like lead bromide. Where does this energy come from?   
    
'''Q4)''' Predict what products you would get at the anode and cathode if copper chloride was the electrolyte.

==What happens at the anode==

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Electrolysis anode.png]]
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;ccddff&quot; |  The bromine atoms (blue)&lt;/br&gt;
give up  2 electrons each&lt;/br&gt;
(green) to the anode.
|}
The anode is the positive electrode; it attracts  negatively charged ions, because unlike charges attract. The bromine ions move through the melt until they reach the anode. Once they get there, they give up their two extra electrons to become bromine atoms.

2Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The electrons flow up the anode to the positive terminal of the battery.

==What happens at the cathode==
The cathode is the negative electrode; it attracts the positively charged ions. Metal ions are always positive and so the lead ions flow through the metal uhe negatively charged terminal of the battery and onto the lead ions.


Some trick to remember cations and anions, cathodes and anodes.

I have a cat......I call her by saying come here plussy! - cathodes attract positive ions

ca+ions has a plus in it, cations are positive ions

red cat: reduction occurs at the cathode


Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; Pb

'''Q5)''' Solid ionic substances do not conduct electricity and are not split up by it. Why do you think that is?

==Quantity calculations (higher tier only)==
[[Image:Electrolysis copper sulphate.png]]

In the experiment with lead bromide, you saw that lead was deposited at the cathode. If you actually do the experiment you will see that the lead coats the cathode. In this section we will look at how much metal will coat a cathode in a given time.

A scientist performed the following experiment.
*A copper cathode was carefully cleaned and accurately weighed.
*It was placed along with an anode into a solution of copper sulphate.
*It was connected via an ammeter to a variable power supply.
*A current was left to run for a given time, then the cathode was removed and weighed again.

His results were:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;  bgcolor= &quot;ffdddd&quot;
|-
| Current /A || Time /s || Mass of copper deposited /g
|-
| 1 || 3000 || 1.0
|-
| 2 || 3000 || 2.0
|-
| 2 || 1500 || 1.0
|-
| 1 || 1500 || 0.5
|}

You can see from the results that the total amount of copper deposited depends on both the current and the time it flows. This is because the number of copper atoms that can be made from ions depends on the total amount of '''charge''' that flows. The unit of charge is the coulomb.

One coulomb is the amount of charge when one Ampere flows for one second.


'''Q6)''' Look at the results table above. How much copper is deposited when 1A flows for 3000 seconds?

'''Q7)''' How much copper do you predict would be deposited if 1A were to flow for 6000 seconds.

'''Q8)''' What about if 2A were to flow for 12000 seconds ?

==Electrolysis of Aqueous solutions (Advanced)==
''Before studying this section check with your teacher to see if you need to''.

Earlier on in this module you've learned that ions must be able to move in order for electrolysis to work. If the ions are held rigid {such as in a solid}, they can't move and no electricity will flow. We've looked at how the freeing up of ions can occur by melting the electrolyte. Another way to achieve this is by dissolving the electrolyte in water. The trouble with this method is, there will be more than one type of ion present.

Water partially splits up into ions {this is why it's such a good solvent for ionic compounds}. It splits into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions.


H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

So at the cathode there will be two ions present: the metal ion and the hydrogen ion from the water. Which element is actually produced at the cathode depends on how reactive the metal is. If the metal is very reactive, such as potassium or sodium, then it is unlikely to be discharged. Hence hydrogen will be produced. If the metal is unreactive such as silver, the metal will be produced. To work out which ion &quot;wins&quot;, the metal or the hydrogen, compare their reactivities in a the reactivity series. The one that is most reactive, will '''not''' be produced at the cathode.

A similar situation occurs at the anode. Hydroxide ions {from the water} are usually discharged at the anode ultimately producing oxygen. However, if the concentration of the ions of Halites (group 7) are much higher than that of the hydroxide ions, then the halite ions are discharged. Sulphates are never discharged.

OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; OH + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

4OH &amp;rarr; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.


'''Q9)''' Sodium chloride is dissolved in water and subjected to electrolysis. Explain what you see at each of the electrodes.



{| bgcolor=&quot;ffeeaa&quot;
|-
|
'''Summary'''
*Only ionic substances can be split up by electrolysis
*The ionic compounds need to be melted or dissolved in water so the ions can move
*Positive ions are attracted to the cathode, where they pick up electrons from the electrode
*Negative ions are attracted to the anode where they give electrons to the electrode

'''Hindi''' is an Indo-European language spoken as a first language in majority states in northern India and second language in many countries where these people have emigrated. It is written with the  Sanskrit's '''Devanagari''' script which fairly closely follows the phonetics of the language.  Spoken Hindi is very similar to spoken [[Urdu]] &amp;mdash; as such they are both often classified as part of the Hindustani (Indian) language.

'''Solving linear inequalities''' involves finding solutions to expressions where the quantities are ''not'' equal.

A number on the number line is always '''greater''' than any number on its left and '''smaller''' than any number on its right. The symbol &quot;&lt;&quot; is used to represent &quot;is less than&quot;, and &quot;&gt;&quot; to represent &quot;is greater than&quot;.

For example:

 &lt;--|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----&gt;
   -5    -4    -3    -2    -1     0     1     2     3     4     5

From the number line, we can easily tell that 3 is greater than -2, because 3 is on the right side of -2 (or -2 is on the left of 3). We write it as &lt;math&gt;3&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt; (or as &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;3&lt;/math&gt;). We can also derive that any positive number is always greater than negative number.

Consider any two numbers, ''a'' and ''b''. One and only one of the following statements can be true:
# &lt;math&gt;a&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;a=b&lt;/math&gt;, or
# &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Wikipedia:Law_of_trichotomy|Law of Trichotomy]].

For an inequality with one unknown, there may be many (sometimes infinite) possible solutions.

== Properties ==

* '''Transitive property''': 
::For any three numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Additive property''':
::In an inequality, we can add or subtract the same value from both sides, without changing the sign (i.e. &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;&quot;). That is to say, for any three numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x+p&gt;y+p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x-p&gt;y-p&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Multiplicative property'''
::We can multiply or divide both sides by a '''positive''' number without changing the sign. For example, if we have any two numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and another positive number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, then if &lt;math&gt;x&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \cdot p&gt;y \cdot p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {x} {p}&gt; \frac {y} {p}&lt;/math&gt;.

:: When we multiply or divide both sides by a '''negative''' number, we have to change the sign of the inequality (i.e, &quot;&gt;&quot; change to &quot;&lt;&quot; and vice versa). So if we are given two numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and another negative number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, then if &lt;math&gt;x&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \cdot p&lt;y \cdot p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {x} {p}&lt; \frac {y} {p}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we can go on to solve any linear inequalities.

== Solving Inequalities ==

Solving inequalities is almost the same as solving linear equations. Let's consider an example: &lt;math&gt;x+4&lt;13&lt;/math&gt;. All we have to do is to subtract 4 on both sides. We will then get &lt;math&gt;x&lt;9&lt;/math&gt;, and that is the answer! Note, however, what you get is not a single answer, but a ''set'' of solutions, i.e., any number that satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;x&lt;9&lt;/math&gt; (any number that is less than 9) can be a solution to the inequality. It is very convenient to represent the solution using the number line:
 &lt;-------------------o
 &lt;-+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--&gt;
   6     7     8     9     10    11

('''Note:''' the open circle (&quot;o&quot;) shows that the value 9 is not included in the solution set, as the inequality of this equation is ''less than 9'', not ''less than or equal to 9''. When we deal with less (greater) than or equal to (≤ or ≥) later on, we use a closed circle (&quot;●&quot;) to show that the value is included in the solution set.)

Let us try another more complicated question: &lt;math&gt;3x-2\ge2(x-3)&lt;/math&gt;. First, you may want to expand the right hand side: &lt;math&gt;3x-2\ge2x-6&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can simply rearrange the terms so that all the unknown variables are on one side of the equation, usually the left hand side: &lt;math&gt;3x-2x\ge-6+2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we can easily get the answer: &lt;math&gt;x\ge-4&lt;/math&gt;. This solution is represented on the number line below. Note that the solution requires a closed circle (&quot;●&quot;), because the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is greater than ''or equal to'' 4.
               ●-------------------&gt;
 &lt;-+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--&gt;
  -6    -5    -4    -3    -2    -1

=== Inequalities with a variable in the denominator===
For example consider the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{x-1}&lt;2\,&lt;/math&gt;

In this case one cannot multiply the right hand side by &lt;math&gt;(x-1)&lt;/math&gt; because the value of x is unknown.  Since x may be either positive or negative, you can't know whether to leave the inequality sign as &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; (ie less than), or reverse it to &gt; (ie greater than).
The method for solving this kind of inequality involves four steps:
# Find out when the denominator is equal to zero.  In the above example the denominator equals zero when &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;.
# Pretend the inequality sign is an &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; sign and solve it as such: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{x-1}=2\,&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;.
# Plot the points &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt; on a number line with an unfilled circle because the original equation included &lt; (it would have been a filled circle if the original equation included &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;).  You now have three regions: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1&lt;x&lt;2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.
# Test each region independently.  in this case test if the inequality is true for &lt;math&gt;1&lt;x&lt;2&lt;/math&gt; by picking a point in this region (e.g. &lt;math&gt;x=1.5&lt;/math&gt;) and trying it in the original inequation.  For x=1.5 the original inequation doesn't hold.  So then try for &lt;math&gt;1&gt;x&gt;2)&lt;/math&gt;  (e.g. &lt;math&gt;x=3)&lt;/math&gt;).  In this case the original inequation holds, and so the solution for the original inequation is &lt;math&gt;1&gt;x&gt;2)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Compound Inequalities==

A compound inequality is a pair of inequalities related by the words ''and'' or ''or''. In an ''and'' inequality, both inequalities must be satisfied. All possible solution values will be located between two defined numbers, and if this is impossible, the compound inequality simply has no solutions. 

Consider this example: &lt;math&gt;x+6\ge2&lt;/math&gt; '''and''' &lt;math&gt;x\le2&lt;/math&gt;. First, solve the first inequality for x to get &lt;math&gt;x\ge-4&lt;/math&gt;. All ''and'' inequalities can be rewritten as one inequality, like this: &lt;math&gt;-4\le&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;x\le2&lt;/math&gt; (write x between two ≤'s or &lt;'s or both with the smaller number on the left and the larger number on the right). Now, we can graph this inequality on a number line as a line segment. Remember, all solutions to ≤ or ≥ must be graphed with closed circles. Interpret this graphic as &quot;all numbers between -4 and 2, including -4 and 2.&quot;
         ●-----------------●
 &lt;-+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--&gt;
  -6    -4    -2     0     2     4

Now, let us consider ''or'' inequalities. ''Or'' inequalities usually do not have a set of solutions that satisfies both. Instead, they usually have two sets of infinite numbers that are solutions to each one. Because of this, ''or'' graphs define which numbers satisfy '''either''' equation. For example: &lt;math&gt;x\;&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; '''or''' &lt;math&gt;x-1\ge2&lt;/math&gt;. First, solve for x in the second inequality to get &lt;math&gt;x\ge3&lt;/math&gt;. Now, graph the two inequalities on the same number line. Remember to use open and closed circles accordingly.
 &lt;-------------o           ●--------&gt;
 &lt;-+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--&gt;
  -1     0     1     2     3     4

==Solving Inequalities with Absolute Value==

Since &lt;math&gt;'''|x| = |-x|'''&lt;/math&gt; A inequality involving absolute value will have to solved in two parts.

Solving &lt;math&gt;'''|x-6| &lt; 5'''&lt;/math&gt;

The first part would be &lt;math&gt;'''x-6 &lt; 5'''&lt;/math&gt; which gives &lt;math&gt; x &lt; 11 &lt;/math&gt;.
The second part would be &lt;math&gt; '''-(x-6) &lt; 5''' &lt;/math&gt; which solved yields &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. 

So the answer to &lt;math&gt;|x-6| &lt; 5&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;x&lt;11&lt;/math&gt; 

         ●----------------------------&gt;&lt;-----------------------------●
 &lt;-+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--&gt;
   0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     10    11    12

==Graphing Linear Inequalities==

The graphing of linear inequalities is very similar to the graphing of linear functions. A linear inequality is written in

== Evening ==
*こんばんは - ''Konban wa'' - Good evening.
*おやすみ - ''Oyasumi'' - Good night.
**おやすみなさい - ''Oyasumi nasai'' - an emphatic &quot;Good evening&quot;.

''Oyasumi'' - good night and ''oyasumi nasai'' - good evening is it correct?

[[User:Matusz|Matusz]] 11:27, 7 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Sorry for the late reply..
:Oyasumi &amp; Oyasumi nasai are the same, meaning good night (or literally &quot;please rest&quot;), only that the latter is more polite. 
:And konbanwa is good evening. [[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 21:19, 20 Oct 2003 (UTC)

::Eh my typo on that, gomen ne? ^_^;; -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 07:04, 21 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Is it true that すみません means both ''thank you'' and ''excuse me''? Also, there seems to be ''Dōmo'' missing in the transkription of どうもすみません (section &quot;Please and Thank You&quot;). --[[User:62.203.232.241|62.203.232.241]] 14:23, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Missing ==
Could somebody add in an explanation for the past tense variations? Like in
*doumo arigatou gozaimashita ''vs'' doumo arigatou gozaimasu
*sumimasen deshita ''vs'' sumimasen
[[User:200.34.166.34|200.34.166.34]] 18:19, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

: Alright, doumo arigatou gozaimashita is little too polite to say.  Unless brown-nosing is the case.  You would simply say doumo arigatou- or you would say arigatou gozaimashita.  Likewise for the present tense form.  A rule of thumb here is the difference between shita (which is pronounce shta, unless talking to someone of high status then you will need to bust out shi-ta) and the masu only endings. 
: Masu is the present tense of a verb. For instance nani wo shimasu.  Nani is the japanese for what when used to describe the object of a verb- wo is a particle used to indicate that the verb is going to be the next thing said- and shimasu( the present form of the verb).
: Now in order to say something was doing in the past simply put shimashita. notice ''shimasu''shita.
: Gozaimasu, indicating great thanks for something will be gozaimasushita in past tense form. 
: I would type more but it really is late and I just happened to be on :-).
: Anata ha naze besuto tsukusanai desuka? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:70.178.16.196|70.178.16.196]] ([[User talk:70.178.16.196|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/70.178.16.196|contribs]]) 07:05, 29 September 2007.&lt;/small&gt;</text>

==JLPT Level N5==
The following is a list of 81 [[Japanese/Kanji|kanji]], which is most of the kanji necessary to pass the N5 level of the [[w:Japanese Language Proficiency Test|Japanese Language Proficiency Test]] (JLPT), prior to the updating of the list several years ago.

There are now 103 kanji in the level N5 exam (22 more than listed below).  Kanji used in the N5 test are used in more difficult levels, too.

As of 2010, the JLPT no longer publishes an official vocabulary list.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jlpt.jp/e/faq/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About the platform==

MacOS is the primary operating system for the Macintosh computer.  It was originally a system designed privately by Apple Inc, however with Mac OS X, it has been based on Unix.  Specifically, a modified FreeBSD operating system called &quot;Darwin&quot;.

There are many different kinds of software that can be developed for Mac OS X.  People generally think of applications, but we'll briefly cover some of the other kinds.

==Types of Software for Mac OS X==

===Applications===

Applications are what people generally think of when they think about software for Mac OS X.  Cocoa applications include: Finder, Mail, Address Book, Safari, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Excel.  Anybody can develop applications using Apple's free development tools which includes XCode.  Mac OS X applications are developed using Objective-C though there are other possible programming languages that could be used.

The most popular languages for use on the MacOS platform is Objective-C which could be thought of as Mac OS X's &quot;native language&quot; since the Mac OS X libraries, or &quot;frameworks&quot;, all have an Objective-C interface.  Objective-C includes everything that plain C can do, and adds object-oriented programming. See: [[Programming:Objective-C|Objective-C]].

C++ can be used in developing for the Mac, but generally, it is used in addition to Objective-C rather than being in place of Objective-C.  Using both Objective-C and C++ is called &quot;Objective-C++&quot; and is considered to be optional when developing software for Mac OS X: [[Programming:c|C++]]

See [[Programming:Objective-C]] for a lesson on the basics of Objective-C [http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/07/22/cocoa_series.html] may also be of assistance.

Some preliminary thoughts:

Objective-C is the language most commonly used in Mac OS Programming. Objective-C entered Mac OS X and has ancestry in NeXT. [[Programming:Cocoa|Cocoa]]. Before you learn Mac programming you ''must '' know the basics of C since it is the basis for Objective-C.

There used to be three separate APIs for developing a Mac application with a GUI: 

1. Classic (Mac OS 9 and lower).  Developing for the Classic API is no longer done.  When Mac OS X first came out, users and developers had a huge investment in software written for Mac Classic OS and Mac OS X used to have an emulation mode so that users could run their old software.  Apple has long since stopped support of the Classic API and Classic emulation in Mac OS X.

2. Carbon (Mac OS 8.5 up to and including Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard). Carbon was an API for developers to update their applications that used the Classic API to be run without the Classic emulator.  Carbon was a great way that Apple provided developers to upgrade their software to run on Mac OS X without having to totally rewrite their software, but Carbon, like Classic, is no longer supported by Apple.

3. Cocoa (All versions of Mac OS X). Cocoa is the most native API that can be used to develop applications for Mac OS X that are truly &quot;Mac-like&quot;.  Generally, Objective-C will be used along with Cocoa, though there are other options such as Cocoa-AppleScript and Cocoa-Python, but Cocoa-Objective-C is really the &quot;mainstream&quot; way to develop Cocoa applications.

'''Resource Forks''' Files in Mac OS X have a feature that is unique to Mac OS and that is that each file on disk can have two &quot;forks&quot;.  This feature used to be used for Classic and Carbon applications to separate code from resources (such as menus, windows, etc.), and the Mac OS X file system still supports two forks, but you should only use the &quot;data fork&quot;.  The resource fork is non-standard and can be lost when transferring Mac files to other file systems.

===AppleScripts===

Another &quot;native language&quot; for developing Mac OS X applications is AppleScript.  AppleScript is a language that Apple invented to automate repetitive tasks.  The AppleScript application is located on your Mac at /Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor.  AppleScript can be used to record AppleEvents, the events that applications send to themselves or to other applications.  Why don't you try it out.  Open AppleScript Editor, press the record button, do some things with your other applications and watch the script write itself.  AppleScript can be used alone or it can be used along with XCode to develop Cocoa Applications using mostly AppleScript instead of Objective-C.  This option is mostly for experienced AppleScript programmers who don't know Objective-C.

===Automator Workflows===

Apple also provides an application called &quot;Automator&quot; that can be used to easily automate repetitive tasks.  It is located at /Applications/Automator.app

===Shell Scripts===

Mac OS X has an application called Terminal that provides a command-line interface to Mac OS X.  It is possible to develop scripts for the command line.  Terminal.app is located at /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app  To create a shell script, you need a text editor.  There is a text editor that comes with Mac OS X called &quot;TextEdit.app&quot;.  It is located in /Applications/TextEdit.app.  But actually, what is better than TextEdit is a program such as TextWrangler.app which is available for free from the following link: http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ 

The shell that Terminal.app uses by default is called &quot;bash&quot;.  Here is a simple tutorial on developing bash scripts
http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/terminal_101_automate_terminal_bash_scripts

We won't go any more deeply into shell scripts here in this wikibook, but it's just good to know what they are.  You can always google for more information now that you know what to google for.

===Command Line Tools===

When you open Terminal and you learn how to type in commands.  The commands are usually command-line tools or scripts.  Above, we just talked about developing your own scripts with a text editor.  It's also possible to develop your own command-line tools, using XCode.  This is an advanced thing to do.  Usually, power-users will write a shell-script (or some other kind of thing such as an AppleScript or an Automator Workflow) but it's good to know what a command-line tool is.  Command-line tools have a textual user-interface rather than a graphical user interface (GUI).

===Java===

Java used to be treated by Apple as a &quot;first class language&quot; to develop for Mac OS, however in recent years, Apple has less support for Java.  Now with Mac OS X 10.7 &quot;Lion&quot; and 10.8 &quot;Mountain Lion&quot;, Java doesn't even come pre-installed in Mac OS X.  Java is still available, but users have to download Java from Oracle's website and install it themselves.  Apple's Mac App Store doesn't even allow Java apps to be sold at their store calling Java &quot;deprecated&quot;. 

However, there still are Mac developers who use Java because it has the advantage of being cross-platform compatible.  For example, the same source-code can be used to generate software that runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

Apple has said that Java reduces the Mac to the &quot;least common denominator&quot;.  That's why they support it less.

===Python===

Python is somewhat supported by Apple.  In fact, Python ships with Mac OS X and is part of the System Folder.  There are third-party libraries that allow developers to develop applications using Python and Cocoa together, but these are not very well maintained, and Python on the Mac is most suitable for developing command-line utilities, or cross-platform scripts that aren't really very Mac-like.

===Ruby===

Similar to Python.

===Websites===

Most Mac users use Safari for their web browser.  Safari uses the standards set by w3c.org  You can develop websites that work with Safari by following the standards of the w3c.org.  Remember to validate your HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML Validator:
http://validator.w3.org/

CSS Validator:
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

JavaScript Lint:
http://www.javascriptlint.com/online_lint.php

If you're developing websites using your Mac and using Safari, remember to test your webpages on other platforms and with other web browsers.

==Mac OS X Specific Languages==

Objective-C is really the &quot;native&quot; language for Mac OS X development

*[[Programming:Objective-C|Objective C Programming]]

You could call AppleScript a &quot;native&quot; language too, but it isn't really used to make commercial applications.  It was designed to be used by real power-users to automate their tasks.  Although it is possible to use AppleScript to build Cocoa applications in XCode, this would be more for users who already know AppleScript and don't want to learn Objective-C.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This part contains a survey of the world of computer hardware.
This chapter introduces computer hardware and provides a very short history of computing.
This section introduces the computing environment thrugh a brief hitory of computers and an overview of the subjects within hardware.
==Outline of computer history==
There is some disagreement about when the digital age began. After all, the Babylonians used a kind of abacus about 500 BC. If we call it the computer age, we can get a much cleaner mark. 1951 was a watershed year, and two events identify it as the beginning. The UNIVAC became the first commercially available digital computer. That same year a research team at MIT completed the first user-interactive computer (named Whirlwind) that used a keyboard and a television screen or CRT.
Considering developments by decades gives a pretty clear picture of the evolution of computers.
*'''1950s the vacuum tube decade''' - introduction of computers and their use in business and major scientific research;
*'''1960s the mainframe decade'''  - transistor-based computers used in business;
*'''1970s the PC decade''' - the first CPU on a chip to widely available personal computers;
*'''1980s the software decade''' - windows, games, and spreadsheets make the PC useful;
*'''1990s the internet decade''' - creation and then commercialization of the Web.

The reason to do this is to promote dicussion and editing. The outline by decade, and the names assigned for each decade are NOT traditional or widespread. They are '''New''' material for this book.

Because they are new, I'd really like comments or suggestions from others. I need to find out if this structure ''(by decade)'' makes any sense, and welcome any ideas about better ways to summarize each decade. [[User:LouI|LouI]] 21:53, 3 Sep 2003 (UTC)

The trouble with decades is they are exactly 10 years long :-( You could try naming them eras or ages instead then you can divide things more natuarally. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 08:02, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm the same [[en:User:Marshman|Marshman]] from the [http://www.Wikipedia.org Wikipedia] Project but presently not active.

Here at '''WikiBooks''', I am interested in putting together a ''Study Guide'' on [[Botany]] and on on [[Ecology]], by which I mean an outline of botanical or ecological subjects organized as they would be found in a textbook with links to appropriate '''Wikipedia''' articles (where I am working to instill botanical credibility).  In time, text would need to be added to the ''Study Guide'' to introduce and transition between subjects.  Eventually, this outline could be fleshed out into a textbook.  Hopefully this approach will result in a useful product (although incomplete) much sooner than attempting to write a textbook from scratch.

I am a biologist with a background in marine biology, terrestrial botany, water quality, and ecology. I am still active in the work force as a biologist/consultant and own a 13-person consulting firm in Hawaii.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to Wikibooks! Now that your user page is here, you are one of us who suffer dual addiction, both Wikiholic and Wikiworm :).
I wish you well in linking Botany to the 'Pedia.
Again, Welcome aboard! ..[[User:LouI|LouI]] 19:13, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)
:Thanks!  I was contemplating how one could develop study outlines for topics at Wikipedia, and discovered WikiBooks. The idea is more suited to this project. - [[User:Marshman|Marshman]] 20:47, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC)
----
A suggestion: You don't need to copy an entire article from the 'pedia to protect your references from future editing. You can simply refer to a specific historic version. Thus [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_cell Plant cell] gets the current page, while [http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Plant_cell&amp;oldid=1407735 Planr cell oldid=1407735] always returns a specific historic version.

There is probably a shorter way (without full URL) to get to the Wikipedia namespace, and I'll ask in the staff lounge. [[User:LouI|LouI]] 05:01, 8 Sep 2003 (UTC)
:Actually, I was not concerned about protecting any particular version on Wikipedia from being edited.  I am attempting/intending to improve the Wikipedia entries if I find the deficient, otherwise I welcome each articles improvement with time.  I do intend to bring over material when it is introductory in nature and therefore useful to simply have the text in Wikibook ''Guide'' to set the stage for suggested readings of articles. I will either write that material myself, or grab a good start from off of Wikipedia.  
:Seems like I was told there would eventually be a shorter way to get to Wikipedia namespaces, and I have seen &quot;en:&quot; used, but was unsure if that was available yet. - [[User:Marshman|Marshman]] 08:06, 8 Sep 2003 (UTC)

----
I want to nominate you to be an admin but can't find the nomination page. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:I don't know where it is! Thanks for support. I did get admin at Wikipedia and have not done too much damage over there. 8} - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:22, 24 Sep 2003 (UTC)
::I see it happened, presumably less formal here than at Wikipedia as probably required by the present small crowd at Wikibooks.  Anyway, thanks, whomever is/was responsible. Sysop [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]

----
Hi Marsh. Thanks for your comments on my talk page. I realize that your intention for the introduction was to just point out the similarities between English and German words. However, I've heard that it's best to also write down the proper article right from the beginning where you introduce a new word.[[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

-----
Hi Marshman, you've put the comment to Robbyjo on his user page, not his [[User talk:Robbyjo|talk page]]. I'd move it myself but that wouldn't look right :)  [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:13, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)
:Thanks it was late at night. He had a blank user page, so I clicked on &quot;Discuss this Page&quot;, but did not watch what came up! - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]

==Moving Botany pages==
Marsh, this new naming scheme looks like a bad idea to me. &quot;Biology Botany&quot;? That does not seem any better than Botany. Worse, rather. Did they do it to you or did you consent ? Its a trifling thing but bugs me, I'd like to see if we could undo it. Comments ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
::From what I can gether, Botany was selected as an example page. I was not asked.  Although '''Biology_Botany''' is not too thrilling to me, the rest of the system, say '''Botany_Introduction_How_to_use''' seems like a logical approach.  Of course it can all be undone, with a little work. I agree, a discussion should be set up separate from the Staff Lounge, especially if changes are going forward. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 04:03, 27 Oct 2003 (UTC)

::Marsh-dogg, who did this act ? I would like to communicate with them. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::Marshman! Why not set up a discussion page for the subject. I responded to the initial change, but I was not logged in (found out later) so it is bnot recorded in my contributions list. But should be on the page history? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 07:41, 27 Oct 2003 (UTC)

: Why not Biology:Botany, like I've done with Discrete mathematics:''whatever'' ? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]]

::Actually, I'm not proposing any system; See [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge]] for what discussion has taken place to date (not much) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 08:31, 27 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:: Sorry about before - I missed the SL discussion to the matter. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:29, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Which has not gone very far by the way &amp;mdash; but it is generally pretty quiet over here compared with Wikipedia. No problem, I;m cool 8^) but I was in the process of changing the traditional &quot;tight&quot; form of page names to one more open when you came along almost (a day or two) after me and &quot;reverted&quot;.  Since these are &quot;books,&quot; I'm thinking the look of every line has a bit more impact than is the case for an encyclopedia article, so I've opted for now to go with the open look (hope you do not mind) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:51, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

----
Hi Marsh, I've listened to the alphabet recording and I don't think the 'B' and 'E' sound English. However, recording with my $10 microphone, the initial sounds of 'B' and 'P' (which are the same as in English I think) do not come out as clearly as they could be. If I get the chance, I'll make a better recording some time later. [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]]
: I listened again and the Bay is ok, just a tad towards Bee. The Ay seems more towards an EE (english), but both shifts could be the microphone. It is great you can produce these, so I'm not complaining. Great additions to the text! - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:58, 29 Oct 2003 (UTC)

About the main page width. I think it must be a browser issue. What browser are you using ?  [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 22:04, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Hi Marsh, the layout for vocabulary can be done by leaving the first character of a line blank, for example:

 das Wort        word
 der Buchstabe   character

[[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]]

:Shoot. I did read that when I first showed up at Wikipedia. Thanks - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 06:04, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Link format==
Marshman, following is a short, tidy format for writing working links into the main Wikipedia: [[en:wiki|wiki]]. (That is, if you did not know this already). And I am talking about the format the link is written in, not where this particular link leads .. hope I am not confusing the issue. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:Thanks. I see what you are saying. I'll try that format. I originally used &lt;nowiki&gt;En:Wikipedia|wiki&lt;/nowiki&gt; and that worked, but then one day stopped working. I'm told &lt;nowiki&gt;Wikipedia:en:wiki|wiki&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the correct form.

==Pictures==
Marshman -- do you take your own pictures ? Where do you get them ? They are beautiful and bring a real level of professional image to the site. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:Thanks for the compliment.  Yes, I take them myself.  I bought a Nikon Coolpix 950 a few years ago, and have been using it to illustrate reports, websites, etc.  Nice thing about digital, you can just click away without regard to film costs.  I've taken over 7000 pictures in those few years, but have kept only perhaps 1000 or a little less.  It has been a very good camera, but I will probably need a new one pretty soon. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:29, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Wow I am impressed. I'd buy the old camera off of you if you are going to sell it... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::I will let you know ! - [[User:24.94.82.245|24.94.82.245]] 01:20, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 01:21, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:::Marshman,

:::Hello, I hope that you have been well lately. 

:::I was just looking at some beautiful botanical photos and remembering your Nikon Coolpix 950. Do you still have it? Still want to sell it? If so, I’ll make you an offer.--[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 19:51, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::Hey Karl. You're back!  That camera is starting to get difficult to use. I'm debating whether to get a new one or get it fixed.  You are right, it is a great camera and that model is no longer available (Nikon Coolpix 950).  I think we can both do much better in terms of functionality, but I've not had time to research that. Let me see if I can replace the camera for myself and get that one fixed for a reasonable price.  Then we can talk.  As is, I could not put much value on it to sell although it does still work and I continue to turn out good photos, but I'm having a battery problem (may not have anything to do with the camera) that I need to solve. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:21, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Marshman: do you have an image or images that we could use on the main page of the [[General Biology|general biology textbook]]? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:Have lots of images. Do you have anything special in muind? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:27, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I didn't think about a picture till just after I put the recipe up.  I didn't cook at home last night, was cooking for my grandmother and just used what I had on hand, and it turned out really good.  Next time, I'll bring a camera with me. :~) [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 06:08, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::Photographing food is a real art; but would certainly enhance any recipe to have a photo of the finished product - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 16:57, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Dear Marshman,

I only learned about the wiki concept recently, and (like everybody around it seems) I think it is great. I have started to contribute to the Botany textbook, mainly on chapter 6, and created missing chapters and updated the content page and TOC. I have done a PhD in molecular plant virology, therefore my interest in chap 6. After general introductions, I focus the text there mostly on plant pathogens, since they are of most interest for those studying botany (and hopelessly ignored in the wikipedia virology and bacteria articles)
Please have a look at the book when you have time, and give me feedback on my work. Thank you, and best wishes, [[User:Alettaka|Aletta]] 21:15, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:Wiki concept is great if you like to write or edit. You are certainly welcome to help out here with the Botany text project (add some info to the contributors page when you get a chance) and I like seeing you have a strong  background in microbes!.  The concept of this textbook is one of providing some general introductory text for each chapter, then links that are essentially reading assignments to appropriate articles at Wikipedia. I usually spend most of my time working on those Wikipedia articles to insure that they are useful to the textbook as well as to the wikipedia.  However, there is no hard and fast rule about how much information should and should not go into the textbook.  Eventually, we may want to include most of the information at Wikipedia over here as well, although I do not forsee that happening soon. That is to say, I would not import wikipedia articles into the textbook to make this book &quot;more complete&quot;.  But put as much original writing into each chapter of the textbook as you want, then adjust the reading assignments accordingly. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:05, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== Help reviewing books ==

Hi Marshman. I saw you downgraded some of the [[Help:Development stages|development stages]] {{stage short|100%|Jan 12, 2005}} I gave to the chapters of your book. That is quite some brave thing to do, and just in the spirit of a critical review! Of course, as the author you know your work best. Would you help me to review one or another book of your choice in a similar way on the [[Science bookshelf]]? You can use the template as explained in [[Help:Development stages|Development stages]]. There is no hurry, do it when you want to browse some other book. Thanks! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 21:51, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:Can do. I'll go look at some of the other &quot;biological sciences&quot; texts.  I got the impression you were either being very generous, or just putting in the &quot;symbols&quot; so that the authors could modify them to what looks more likely a status of each chapter. I do agree that &quot;100%&quot; is not necessarily the same as &quot;done, no more additions anticipated&quot; but really means the user can expect to get something close to full value out of that chapter, even if the author plans to tweek it a lot more. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:07, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== [[Basic Ecology Contents]] ==

Why did you revert my edits without any justification? You are deliberately violating naming policy. Such use of revert function makes me wonder if you really should be a sysop. Taking a look at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Marshman&amp;page= operation log] gives me no clue why you became one. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:29, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
:Man, where did they find you? I've been here working on Wikibooks for a long long time and I know the rules about policy, the first being that &quot;policy&quot; as you now call your banners is suggestion and therefore cannot be violated. I do not appreciate stupid banners (essentialy a form of vandalism) being placed on the books I am working on and find your attitude more than bit aggressive, violating the cardinal rule at Wikipedia of making personal attacks on other editors. I did expain the revert on the page. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 18:38, 22 January 2006 (UTC)
:: Call it a personal attack but it occured that you don't use your sysop right for things other than your books cleanup. I can't see if you revert vandals or not, but your part of log shows no vadalised pages you deleted. In fact, you are not doing any administrative tasks. And calling cleanup templates &quot;vandalism&quot; is nothing more than arrogance from you. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:17, 22 January 2006 (UTC)
:::I deleted your vandalising of the pages I watch. And they are vandalism because of where you place them (more so because it appears there really is no such naming policy in place). Sorry I do not fit your definition of what I should be doing here, but then I may have missed the vote where you were elected king. I am a contributor to textbooks, and I will not be subjected to attacks by you. I have plenty of other things to do with my time. Please do not write on my user page again. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 00:52, 24 January 2006 (UTC)  

==Releasing a first PDF edition of Botany? ==

I have recently proposed that some Wikibooks are ready for a first PDF edition. Botany is a likely candidate.  The first edition would contain a prominent link saying &quot;If you wish to edit, correct or contribute to this book please click here&quot;. The idea is to use some of the better and more complete books as an example. What do you think? See:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#The_management_of_book_publishing_-_a_policy_suggestion

== German: Level 3 ==

This needs a total remake, it is not even funny. It is very silly and useless to have '''a whole''' different sub-section, with all the lessons of level 2, and the only thing which is different is a small, little advance page for each lesson. It needs different, and harder lessons. Isn't that the whole reason for a different sub-section page? We need all the complex grammer and difficult words of German in this level, or put the easier parts of complex German grammer and vocabulary of it here, and make a Level 4 and put the more difficult parts of complex German grammer and vocabulary in there. Derbeth even said we had to do something. And it is time. We need to get a plan together. -- [[User:German Men92|German Men92]][[User talk:German Men92|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 1:03, 17 Feb 2006 (UTC)
:I'm not real clear on your complaint, but I think you do not like the idea of having a Level 3 in the German textbook.  It was an idea for having a more advanced course that built easily on the Level 2&amp;mdash;that was the plan. Of course, we could as well just mush together each &quot;advanced&quot; page with the corresponding Level 2 page and by that process create a new or separate Level 3 textbook. And of course, when you say &quot;what it needs&quot; you must back up a minute and realize that while some lessons are more or less complete, most others are just a shell of what could be done. So the obvious response to seeing a deficient subsection page (or any page) is to add to it, not complain about it. And I will not address what I think about your statement &quot;Derbeth even said we had to do something&quot;; is Derbeth a contributor to this textbook? - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:01, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
No, but he is an admin here, and that is really why I pushed forward with seperate lessons, because he asked me or a main contributorto fix it. -- [[User:German Men92|German Men92]][[User talk:German Men92|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:22, 1 Mar 2006 (UTC)
:No problem, really. I just have serious reservations about Derbeth. But YOUR ideas are what is important here, so I won't be side-tracked. I'll check in and see how you develop the (is it now five levels?) lessons the way you are going. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 06:06, 2 March 2006 (UTC)  

== Proposal to remove your sysop rights ==

Marshman

I'm dropping you this note as I note another user has made a request on [[WB:RFA]] for your account to lose sysop rights. If you would like to comment on the matter, please do so there. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:49, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

* Actually, a vote is under way to remove the sysop rights from 10 admins.  I think [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] left you a note because you are the only active editor subject to such a vote, and perhaps because he voted to oppose removing your sysop rights.  I have been leaving notes with all 10 admins concerning the vote.  Even though [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] has already informed you of the vote, it seemed strange for me to leave you out.  Here is the note I have been leaving:

:: A vote is being held to remove your sysop privileges.  The basis for this vote is lack of use of these privileges.  You may want to participate at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#Marshman_.28_talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.29]].  See also the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Removing_Sysop_Status]]. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:04, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for at least showing that much respect - [[User:Marshman|marsh]]

:Marshman, I am definitely against your sys-op rights being taken away. Where is the appropriate place to make that known publicly? Thank you, --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 20:27, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

== [[:Image:Fernsehturm Stuttgart.jpg]] ==

I have been using a script [[User:Kernigh/monobook.js]] (copied from [[Commons:MediaWiki:Extra-tabs.js]]) to examine image uploads. Thus I noticed that you have many untagged images. Most of them indicate the author credit and copyright license very clearly, and at some point someone will tag them {{tl|GFDL}}.

However, [[:Image:Fernsehturm Stuttgart.jpg]] (which you uploaded two years ago at 9 March 2004) claims to be from the &quot;German Wikipedia&quot; but gives no license information. I checked the same filename in de.wikipedia and commons.wikimedia and found nothing. Do you know the license information? If so you could add a [[WB:ICT|copyright tag]]. Otherwise it might be better to delete the image; it is on the [[German Grammar]] page and we could probably replace it with something else. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:40, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:26, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Template:Classis ==

*Is {{tl|Classis}} a holding spot/building block for another template?  I was going to nominate it for deletion, but I wanted to check with you first as the creator.&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; [[User:MrDolomite|MrDolomite]] | [[User talk:MrDolomite|Talk]] 01:02, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

== Your De-Adminship ==

Hello. I would like to inform you that you will have your sysop rights removed here on 20 Apr 2007 due to inactivity. If you would like to discuss the matter, please see [[WB:RFA]]. You can re-apply for adminship at a later date if you wish. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:23, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

I would like to add here that I am not completely convinced that there is a need to deadmin inactive users.  Some very convincing arguments have been made in the past to keep admins around, and very weak reasons (admittedly I made the first suggestions) to remove admin status.  Others like Karl Wick (mentioned above) certainly have your support.

Regardless, don't take this as an insult in any way, as you are certainly welcome to come back and continue editing Wikibooks at any time.  And if you ever want to have the admin tools back (I'm  fatalistic as I think the current mood with several active Wikibookians is to strip your admin rights), count on me to be one of your hardcore supporters.  You have done nothing wrong except to deal with life and not let this project become an obsession.  That, IMHO, is an admirable trait.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:55, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Marshman. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Marshman~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lots of material there, maybe enough for several &quot;modules&quot;. Would it make sense to divide it up ? -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I'd be against the idea, in my opinion. If someone's trying to study the material, it'd be a great deal more difficult jumping back and forth through linking to other modules. Anyway, this module's almost done, just going to cover Hasse diagrams and some questions/answers and I'm done with this bit, I think. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:20, 5 Sep 2003 (UTC)

== Confusion about Cartesian product definition of Function ==

I was reading the '''Other function notation''' section of this module and was a bit confused by the wording of the last sentence:

''So using set notation, a function can be expressed as the Cartesian product of its domain and range.''

Shouldn't that read ''a function can be expressed **as a subset of** the Cartesian product of its domain and range.''? 
Otherwise, the function would be defined as F={(1,1),(1,4),(1,9),(2,1),(2,4),(2,9),(3,1),(3,4),(3,9)}.

Or perhaps my understanding of a Cartesian product is incorrect. Just wanted some clarification. Thank you.
:This confuses me too. [[User:Tim J Tylor|Tim J Tylor]] ([[User talk:Tim J Tylor|talk]]) 11:06, 23 April 2008 (UTC)


I think there is a short coming in the discussions of functions nothing has been mentioned one to one function or generally the types of functions

== OR or XOR in trichotomy ==

I just added an example in the Trichotomy section but I'd like to know if the or we have is a strict OR (XOR) or not. If it is then my example is incorrect (since sometimes both aRb and bRa hold).

Thanks for your help :)

how can we find the union,intersection,complement, difference of two sets named R &amp; S?

I just undid a change that removed &quot;Transitive&quot; as one of the properties of equality.  Equality ''is'' transitive: a = b and b = c implies a = c.  In fact, the transitive property is one of the three necessary properties of an equivalence relation, of which equality is the classic example.

I have also seen other examples changed to false answers, but what bothers me more than these erroneous edits by random IPs is that they are being ''approved'' by Wikibookians with the rights to do so.  I'm fairly new here, so I don't know what Wikibookians' common problems are, but what's going on here?  Are they just too busy to make a detailed review?  Does nobody care what's right and wrong here?  Or is there something else I'm missing?  Thanks in advance.  --[[User:BCW|Brian C.

This is an elementary Latin course accompanied with a detailed grammar based upon Kennedy's Public School Latin Grammar designed to introduce one to the world of [[w:classical languages|classical languages]].  A basic understanding of [[w:grammar|grammatical terminology]] would be helpful; however, it is not required.  Basic definitions of terms will be explained in Lessons 1 and 2, and later elaborated as needed.

For detailed explanations and examples of English grammatical terms, please consult the [[English Grammar]] textbook.  However, Latin grammar is quite different from English, and thus it requires different grammatical terms to explain the concepts.  These will be taught as needed.

==Note==
Parts of this book may have been edited by people who do not speak English as their first language. All Wikibooks are written in the particular English dialect of the writer, which may not be standard usage. If you see something particularly unclear, please feel free to correct it. But ''please'' alter this article in a constructive manner.

This book will attempt to teach the reader Latin from the ground up. Please consult the Appendix or [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Latin-aware Dictionary] if you are confused about the presentation of Latin grammatical elements compared to English concepts.

Please read the Introduction carefully, as it introduces the concept of a stem.
As is typical in many other languages, the infinitive stem (present tense, active voice) is used for conjugating verbs.
[The introduction of additional information in parentheses is done simply to avoid confusing a student who has already had exposure to Latin.]

If something doesn't make sense to you, note your grade level in the summary, and delete what you don't understand, e.g., &quot;grade 12 [grade]  American [system] revert?&quot; The &quot;revert&quot; keyword allows your editors to know that you are not a skilled editor but are just trying to learn, and are confused. Your changes are not permanent.

Edit this book responsibly:
* As this is a textbook, readers will want denotational indication of macrons. If you do not know how to do this in HTML, please refer to [[wikipedia:Macron|Wikipedia's article]] on the topic. 

*Always use the genitive in presentation, or present the nominative and the genitive side by side, clearly indicating which one is which (&quot;nom.&quot; for nominative and &quot;gen.&quot; for genitive). Different pages may use their own layout rules, but they should be left-justified and clear to the student.

*Check with other commercial textbooks and study guides to see if what you are doing is factually accurate and pedagogically sound. Wikibooks trusts you to make that judgment on your own, but this is a book - not an article. A person who is either bold or rash might make an error or mistake in layout or explanation that will take a long time to find and correct.

=What is Latin?=
&lt;small&gt;
''Parts of this introduction were taken from [[Wikipedia:en:Latin|The Latin Language]] on the [[en:Main Page|Wikipedia]].''
&lt;/small&gt;

Latin was the language originally spoken in the region around the city of Rome called Latium. It gained great importance as the formal language of the Roman Empire. 

All Romance languages descend from a Latin parent, and many words in [[English]] and other languages today are based on Latin roots. Moreover, Latin was a ''lingua franca'', the learned language for scientific and political affairs in Europe, for more than one and a half thousand years, being eventually replaced by [[French]] in the 18th century and English by the middle of the 20th. Latin remains the formal language of the Roman Catholic Church to this day, and as such is the official national language of the Vatican. 

Romance languages are not derived from Classical Latin, the language spoken by Caesar and Cicero, but rather from Vulgar Latin, the language spoken by the common people, or '' vulgus, '' of Rome. Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin (Romance) differ (for example) in that Romance had distinctive stress whereas Classical had distinctive length of vowels. In [[Italian]] and Sardo logudorese, there is distinctive length of consonants and stress, in [[Spanish]] only distinctive stress, and in French even stress is no longer distinctive. 

Another major distinction between Classical and Romance is that modern Romance languages, excluding [[Romanian]], have lost their case endings (suffixes at the end of the word used in place of prepositions) in most words (some pronouns being exceptions). Romanian is still equipped with several cases (though some, notably the ablative, are no longer represented).

It is also important to note that Latin is, for the most part, an inflected language — meaning that the endings change to show how the word is being used in the sentence.

=Introduction to the Latin Language=

== Simple and Compound Words ==

In Latin, words are either:
* ''' simple ''' (words that consist of only one part). For example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot;
|-
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Latin&lt;/font&gt;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;English&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''eo'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''I go'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''fero'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''I carry'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''do'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''I give'''
|}
* ''' compound ''' (words that consist of more than one part, for example, a root word combined with a prefix). For example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot;
|-
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Latin&lt;/font&gt;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;English&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''abeo'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''I go away'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''transfero'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''I carry across'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''reddo'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''I give back'''
|}

==Word Parts==

Inflected words (i.e., words having ending- or spelling-changes according to their grammatical functions in the sentence) have a '''stem''' and a '''root.''' 

&lt;B&gt;The Stem&lt;/B&gt;

The stem is the part of the word to which various suffixes are added. The final suffix determines either the role of the word in the sentence (for example, when a Roman slave wished to address his ''dominus'' (master), he used the vocative form ''domine'' -- equivalent to &quot;O master&quot; in English) or the person involved in the action (for example, &quot;I dominate&quot; may be expressed as &quot;domin-or&quot;, and &quot;they dominate&quot; as &quot;domin-antur&quot;). In these cases, ''domin-'' is the stem and ''-us'', ''-e'', ''-or'' and ''-antur'' are suffixes. The addition of such suffixes is called ''inflection''. This is discussed further in the [[#Summary|Summary]].

&lt;B&gt;The Root&lt;/B&gt;

The root is the part of the word that carries the essential meaning. For example the stem of ''agito'' (I drive onward) is ''agit-'', whose root is ''ag'' (do, drive), which is in common to words of similar meaning: ''ago'' (I do, drive), ''agmen'' (that which is driven, such as a flock), etc. Notice the essential difference between a root and a stem. To the root &quot;ag&quot; has been added a suffix &quot;(i)to-&quot; which denotes frequency of action (so &quot;agit-&quot; means to do or drive more than once, hence &quot;agit-o&quot;, I agitate, I keep (something) moving, I urge, I impel).

In contrast, English uses word order more than inflection to determine the function of a word within a sentence. English also uses words like pronouns (I, she, etc.) and prepositions (to, at, etc.) where Latin generally prefers inflexions. Thus &quot;dom-i&quot; (noun -- &quot;at home&quot;), &quot;ag-unt&quot; (verb -- &quot;they do/drive&quot;).

&lt;B&gt;Primitives&lt;/B&gt;

Primitives occur when both the stem and the root are the same. For example, in the word ''agere'' (to do, drive) both the stem and the root are the same: &quot;ag-&quot;.

&lt;B&gt;Derivatives&lt;/B&gt;

Derivatives occur when the root or stem is modified. For example, the stem ''flamm-'' from the noun ''flamma'' has the root &quot;flag&quot; (&quot;blaze&quot;), &quot;nosco&quot; (I know) from the verb &quot;noscere&quot; has the root &quot;gno-&quot; (&quot;know&quot;).

&lt;B&gt;Suffixes&lt;/B&gt;

Latin attaches suffixes (&quot;endings&quot;) to stems to turn them into words (most stems and roots cannot be used in sentences without an ending). This inflection is essential to forming Latin sentences. The various suffixes and their translations will be learned in the later lessons.

=Types of Words used in Latin=

==Nouns==

A noun (Latin: ''nomen'') is &quot;something perceived or conceived by the mind.&quot;

There are two kinds of nouns: Substantives and Pronouns. 

1. &lt;B&gt;Substantive&lt;/B&gt; (''nomen substantivum'') is a name simply denoting something perceived or conceived: ''psittacus'' - the parrot, ''nix'' - the snow, ''virtus'' - virtue.

2. &lt;B&gt;Pronoun&lt;/B&gt; (''pronomen'') is a word used in place of a ''substantivum'', usually when the ''substantivum'' is already known: ''ea'' - she, ''ille'' - that man

Nouns have changing endings on the stem (known as declension) and three incidents: number, gender and case. Number concerns whether the thing referred to is singular or plural (and the ending shows this); gender classifies a substantive as masculine, feminine or neuter (this determines how the endings of adjectives and pronouns behave) and case (where the ending must show how the noun fits in to the sentence). Adjectives and Pronouns must agree in all incidents when they refer to a substantive.

==Verbs==

Verbs (''verba'') express an action or a state of being, e.g., ''ago'' (I do), ''dixit'' (he said), ''venis'' (you come). &quot;Conjugation&quot; is the term for adding inflections to verb stems to indicate person (first, second or third), number (singular or plural), tense (present, future, imperfect, perfect, pluperfect or future perfect), voice (active or passive), and mood (indicative, subjunctive or imperative).

A verb can be either ''finite'' or ''infinite'':

1. &lt;B&gt;Finite&lt;/B&gt; verbs (''verba finita'') are inflected and have a subject, e.g., I run, you run, he runs, they drive, the computer is turned on.

2. The &lt;B&gt;infinite&lt;/B&gt; verbs (''verba infinita'') are not inflected and have no subject, e.g. to run, to drive, to turn on, to have drawn. ''Participles'', which are inflected as substantives rather than as verbs, may also be considered infinite, e.g., the ''running'' boy.

==Modifiers==

1. &lt;B&gt;Adjectives&lt;/B&gt; (''adiectiva'') are used to describe nouns. They indicate a quality perceived or conceived as inherent in, or attributed to, something denoted. E.g., ''vir &lt;U&gt;magnus&lt;U&gt;'' (the &lt;U&gt;great&lt;U&gt; man), ''puella &lt;U&gt;pulchra&lt;U&gt;'' (the &lt;U&gt;fair&lt;U&gt; girl)

2. &lt;B&gt;Adverbs&lt;B&gt; (''adverbia'') are similar to adjectives, except that they are used to qualify verbs, adjectives or other adverbs, rather than nouns. In practice, they restrict the meaning of the verb or adjective by specifying how or how much. E.g., ''curro &lt;U&gt;celeriter&lt;/U&gt;'' (I run &lt;U&gt;quickly&lt;/U&gt;), ''pugnat &lt;U&gt;fortiter&lt;U&gt;'' (he fights &lt;U&gt;bravely&lt;/U&gt;), &quot;&lt;U&gt;vere&lt;/U&gt; jucundus est&quot; (he's &lt;U&gt;really&lt;/U&gt; nice&quot;), &quot;&lt;U&gt;incredibile&lt;/U&gt; callida est&quot; (she's &lt;U&gt;incredibly&lt;/U&gt; clever).

==Other==

Particles are uninflected words that provide extra meaning.

1. &lt;B&gt;Prepositions&lt;/B&gt; (''praepositiones'') are little words which tell you how one word is behaving in relation to another word (&quot;the &lt;U&gt;duck&lt;/U&gt; was &lt;B&gt;near&lt;/B&gt; the &lt;B&gt;pond&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;U&gt;she&lt;/U&gt; went &lt;B&gt;towards&lt;/B&gt; the &lt;B&gt;wood&lt;/B&gt;&quot;). In Latin, the noun that follows a preposition takes a particular ending (called a &quot;case&quot;), depending on the nature of the relationship, or on the nature of the preposition itself. E.g., ''ad'' (by), ''in'' (in), ''sub'' (under). What all this means is that a preposition is a sort of adverb, telling you how something is done. For example, &quot;you go&quot; is a simple statement, but &quot;you go in&quot; suggests that you don't just &quot;go&quot;, you go so as to enter something, and so you need a noun for the &quot;something&quot;. In English, we might say &quot;you go &lt;B&gt;into&lt;/B&gt; the house&quot;. In Latin, this would be: &quot;&lt;B&gt;in&lt;/B&gt; domum inis&quot;. Notice the form &quot;in domum&quot;, which means &quot;into&quot; the house -- you're going into it, you're not yet exactly inside it (the ending -um of &quot;domum&quot; is called &quot;accusative&quot;). When you are inside the house, what you do is &quot;in&quot; the house, which is &quot;in domo&quot; (the ending -o of &quot;domo&quot; is called &quot;ablative&quot;).

2. &lt;B&gt;Conjunctions&lt;/B&gt; (''coniunctiones'') join together clauses and sentences. E.g., ''et'' (and), ''atque'' (as well as), ''sed'' (but).

3. &lt;B&gt;Interjections&lt;/B&gt; (''interiectiones'') are exclamations used to express feeling or to gain attention. E.g., ''o!'' (oh!) ''eheu!'' (alas!) ''ecce!'' (behold!)

==Articles==
Latin has '''NO articles''' (words for 'the' and 'a').  When translating Latin into English, insert a 'the' or 'a' when appropriate.

==Pronunciation==
Latin pronunciation has varied somewhat over the course of its long history, and there are some differences between Classical Latin, as spoken in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire, and Medieval or Ecclesiastical Latin, as spoken in the Middle ages and in the Catholic Church. This text focuses on the classical pronunciation.

{|
|a || /a/, about, between ah and uh, ad is pronounced almost like (the American pronunciation of) &quot;odd&quot;
|-
|e || /ɛ/, get or bed
|-
|i || /ɪ/, hit, pin, in
|-
|i || (Before vowel and not accented) /j/, Y as in yes
|-
|j || Sometimes used in place of the letter I when making a /j/ sound, as above
|-
|o || /ɔ/, on, cot
|-
|u || /ʊ/, put, foot
|-
|ā || /aː/, father
|-
|ē || sounds like saying the letter &quot;A&quot;, /eː/, hay
|-
|ī || sounds like saying the letter &quot;E&quot;, /iː/, eat
|-
|ō || sounds like saying the letter &quot;O&quot;, /oː/, clover
|-
|ae || (Diphthong) sounds like saying the letter &quot;I&quot;, /aɪ/, aisle
|-
|au || (Diphthong) /aʊ/, brown, how
|-
|oe || (Diphthong) /ɔɪ/, oil, boy
|-
|ou || (Diphthong) oo
|-
|ui || (Diphthong) we
|-
|bs || (At the end of word) the B sounds a P
|-
|bt || (At the end of a word) the B sounds a P
|-
|ch || /kʰ/, pronounced separately as in archaic, not like in church
|-
|gn || /ŋn/ han'''gn'''ail, sin'''g n'''ow
|-
|ph || u'''p h'''ill, never sounds an F in philosophy
|-
|th || Pronounced separately as in po'''t h'''ole, never like this or theater
|-
|c || /k/, always hard as in cat
|-
|g || /g/, always hard as in get, never soft like adage
|-
|r || Rolled like in the Spanish and Italian languages
|-
|s || Always voiceless as in see, never voiced as in ease
|-
|v || /w/, equivalent to an English W, never sounding an English V (sounds U as a consonant), some texts will write the &quot;v&quot; as a &quot;u&quot; when it serves as a vowel
|-
|x || Equivalent to an English Ks as in box, never like exert
|-
|(y) || Rarely exists in Latin except in words borrowed from Greek
|-
|(z) || Rarely exists in Latin except in words borrowed from Greek
|-
|}

Note that Latin, as written by the Romans, did not include macrons (the longmarks over long vowels) or the letters J and U. Macrons are used today as pronunciation guides and do not necessarily need to be written. The sound value of the letter U was filled by the letter V, which sounded either /w/ or /ʊ/ depending on context. Modern texts often preserve the V when it is making a /w/ sound and change it to a U when making a /ʊ/ sound. The letter J is sometimes used in modern times (this Wikibook not included) when the letter I is being used in diphthongs.

==Declension Tables==
The following tables will be both referenced and explained in all of the following sections, and hence are placed here.

Note that nouns in the 3rd declension nominative can have any ending, hence why none is given in bold.

==Grammar Part 1: Nouns and Their Role in Sentences==
[[w:Noun|Noun]]s in Latin are [[w:Inflected language|inflected]], which means that endings (also known as [[w:suffix|suffix]]es or ''suffices'') are appended to the end of the [[w:stem|stem]] to denote these things:
#Number (whether the noun is singular or plural)
#[[w:Declension|Case]] of the noun (role of the noun in the sentence)
#[[w:Grammatical gender|Gender]] (the gender of the word - one of masculine, feminine, or neuter)

Most nouns in English can be modified to indicate number (cat versus cats), and many pronouns can be modified to indicate case (who versus whose) or gender (he versus she, his versus hers). Case is especially important in Latin as meaning cannot be determined by word order as it can be in English, but purely by word endings, or &quot;inflection&quot;. Indeed, the words in a Latin sentence can appear in almost any order with little change in meaning. Two sentences with the word orders &quot;Sam ate the orange&quot; and &quot;The orange ate Sam&quot; could potentially mean the same thing in Latin, though the spellings of &quot;orange&quot; and &quot;Sam&quot; would have to change slightly to denote which was the subject (the one eating) and which was the object (the one being eaten).

It is important to note here that although the genders of many words make sense (for example, &quot;puella&quot;, meaning a girl, is feminine) many are simply assigned and hold no real meaning. Luckily, as you will find, the gender can often be determined by the spelling of the word (words ending in &quot;us&quot; are almost always masculine, and words ending in &quot;a&quot; are almost always feminine). For many words, however, you will simply have to memorize their gender. 

[[w:Adjective|Adjective]]s themselves must match the number, case, and gender of the noun (be it a substantive or a pronoun) they modify. If a noun is nominative singular feminine (see [[#case|case table]] below), then the adjective describing it must also be nominative singular feminine. If the noun is accusative plural masculine, then the adjective must be accusative plural masculine. This will be expanded on in the [[#Adjectives|Adjectives]] section below. The advantage of this system is that adjectives do not need to be adjacent to their respective nouns, as one would be able to tell which noun they modify by which noun they appear to agree with.

===Declension===
'''All substantives''' are part of one of 5 categories, called '''declensions'''. Each declension has a set of standard suffixes that indicate case and number. Usually gender is indicated by the suffix, although there are many exceptions. Therefore, you must memorize the gender of every substantive you learn.

By familiarizing yourself with the [[#Declension Tables|above tables]], you could deduce that originally the suffix indicating number, case, and gender was the same for every noun. However, as the language developed, nouns with a common stem formed declensions and sounds changed. Similar processes happen continually over time, even today.

The above tables allow you to familiarize yourself with the existence of each declension, though by no means are you expected to memorize it now. Nonetheless, you will have to memorize it as you are formally introduced to individual cases and declensions in future lessons. Because of its introductory purpose, it is considerably simplified and incomplete, and therefore should not be used as a reference in the future.

Adjectives are also classed into declensions:
#'''1st/2nd declension adjectives'''...
##...Use 1st declension suffixes from the substantive declension table when describing feminine nouns.
##...Use 2nd declension masculine suffixes from the above table when describing masculine nouns.
##...Use 2nd declension neuter suffixes (''not'' found in the above table) when describing neuter nouns.
#'''3rd declension adjectives''' behave as 'i' stem substantives unless specified. Masculine and Feminine suffixes (which are the same) will be used if describing masculine and feminine nouns, and Neuter suffixes will be used when describing neuter nouns.

Pronouns are not part of any declension, as they are all irregular, and simply have to be memorized.

===Case===
Cases (Latin: ''casus'') determine the role of the noun in the sentence in relation to other parts of the sentence. 

There are six cases, Nominative, Vocative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative and Ablative. Vocative (Lesson 3) can be considered a sort of miniature case, generally not being accepted as a true one. Additionally, some nouns have a locative case, which will be covered later. As nominative and accusative are the most basic, these will be taught first (the rest will be covered in later lessons).

|-
| Vocative || Direct address (speaking to somebody directly)
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Salvē, '''Brute'''!
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | Hello, '''Brutus'''!
|}

===Gender===
'''All substantives''', including inanimate objects, have a particular gender (genera), which is either masculine, feminine, or neuter.

For example, Vir, &quot;a man,&quot; is masculine. Marītus, &quot;a husband,&quot; is also masculine. Puella, &quot;a girl,&quot; is feminine. Māter, &quot;a mother,&quot; is feminine. Even inanimate objects are assigned gender, including all the moons, stars, trees, tools, and so forth. Logic will give you little help in determining what the genders of inanimate objects are, and with many nouns memorization is required. Luckily, for many nouns, the spelling of the word indicates the gender.

Certain rules may be utilized to determine the gender of an inanimate substantive. Declension is a good indication of gender, especially for 1st and 2nd declension substantives. 1st declension substantives (substantives with an -a suffix) are usually feminine and second declension nouns (substantives with an -us suffix) are usually masculine or neuter. There are a few exceptions, and they will have to be learned. 3rd declension nouns can be either masculine, feminine or neuter (thus the gender will often have to be memorized). 4th declension nouns are usually masculine, sometimes neuter while 5th declension nouns are usually feminine.

1st/2nd declension adjectives alternate the set of endings depending on the gender of noun it describes (see above: Agreement of the Gender of Nouns and the Adjective). If the adjective describes a feminine noun, the adjective must use 1st declension endings, if the adjective describes a masculine noun, the adjective must use 2nd declension masculine endings, if the adjective describes a neuter noun the adjective must use 2nd declension neuter endings.

3rd declension adjectives use the same set of endings for masculine and feminine nouns. However, a slightly different set of endings are used when describing neuter nouns.

==Adjectives==
As stated above, adjectives must match the gender, number, and case of the noun (be the noun a substantive, or a pronoun) they modify. However, there are many occasions where logic cannot be used to determine the gender of inanimate objects, as genders are generally arbitrary when the noun has no literal gender. Furthermore, the declension of the noun, often determined by the spelling, can in turn be used to determine the gender, especially for the 1st and 2nd. However, this is never the case for the third declension, as the declension itself is not primarily assigned to any gender and the spelling of the nominative (&quot;default&quot;) stem is random, leaving you with no hints.

A noun and its adjective must also be in the same case. Otherwise, it is impossible to tell which nouns pair up to their respective adjectives in a sentence, as the words in a Latin sentence can appear in any order. See the examples below.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;
|+align=&quot;bottom&quot;|Notice how &quot;magna&quot; changes to &quot;magnae&quot; to agree with the pluralized &quot;puellae&quot;.

Also notice that &quot;magnus&quot; changes to &quot;magnum&quot; to agree with the noun it's describing in case, though do not concern yourself with the difference between cases for the time being.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;
|+align=&quot;bottom&quot;|Notice that &quot;magna&quot; is feminine because &quot;arbor&quot; is feminine, despite that it does not end in &quot;a&quot; like &quot;puella&quot;. The word &quot;arbor&quot; is one of the situations where you will simply have to memorize the gender.
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Latin
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|English

|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Arbor (nominative sing, fem.)
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|Tree

==Recapitulation==
*Declensions are used to categorize nouns in groups. There are 5 declensions total.
*Each of the five declensions has a distinct set of endings which are appended to nouns of that declension.
*The endings indicate the case and number when appended to the stem of a noun.
*A substantive may use only the endings of the declension of which it is a part.
*Each substantive has a predefined gender which almost never changes and is separate from the suffix.
*Adjectives are a part of the 1st/2nd declension and 3rd declension.
*Adjectives use the gender of the noun that they modify.

'''Therefore:'''
*An adjective of the 1st/2nd declension uses 1st declension endings when describing a feminine noun, a 2nd declension masculine ending when describing masculine noun, and 2nd declension neuter when describing a neuter noun.
*An adjective of the 3rd declension uses the same set of endings when describing masculine and feminine nouns and another set of endings when describing neuter nouns. (Actually, there are 3-termination, 2-termination, and 1-termination 3rd declension adjectives. If the adjective is 3-termination, e.g., acer (f. sing.), acris (m. sing.), acer (n. sing.), acres (f. pl.), acres (m. pl.), or acria (n. pl.), then use the appropriate ending; if the adjective is 2-termination, then one termination will be masculine/feminine and the other neuter; if the adjective is 1-termination, the common form is used.)

==The Nominative Case==

The nominative case refers to the subject of the sentence. It is also one of the three cases of modern English. Every sentence must have a subject. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Caesar is emperor of Rome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Caesar is the subject of this sentence therefore Caesar is given in the nominative case.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Caesar's army entered Rome&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Above is the genitive case which shows possession; the army was Caesar's army. We have changed the case of the word &quot;Caesar&quot; by altering its end. The nominative case has been changed to the genitive case by the addition of an apostrophe and the letter &quot;s&quot;.  

Latin cases are formed in the same way. The first step is to learn some words in their nominative case so as to become familiar with their endings which will later be changed to form the other cases.

Of the &quot;to be&quot; verbs listed in the table, only '''est''' and '''sunt''' will be covered in this lesson. The table simply allows you to familiarize yourself with them, as verbs will be covered more in future lessons.

The nominative case is used for the subject of the sentence (or any noun that is the equivalent of the subject). 

In this chapter, the following conventions will be used for nouns:
*''m.'' = masculine
*''f.'' = feminine
*''n.'' = neuter

*First and second declension substantives are given with at least the nominative case. (We will add the genitive singular as time permits. It is not strictly necessary, but you should get in the habit now of declining nouns based on the genitive stem and not the nominative. &lt;B&gt;This chapter is therefore slightly misleading in this regard.&lt;/B&gt;)
*Third, fourth, and fifth declension substantives are given with the nominative and genitive singular.

==Overview of Adjectives==
An adjective is simply any word that describes a noun, such as an object or subject in a sentence. Of course, whole phrases may be used to describe nouns, but adjectives are individual words. For example:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|English
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Latin
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|The '''good''' ''boy'' walks.
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|''Puer'' '''bonus''' ambulat.
|}

An adjective can also be used in a sentence opposite a form of &quot;to be.&quot; The &quot;to be&quot; verb simply serves as a linking verb, as &quot;the good boy&quot; is an incomplete sentence, but &quot;the boy is good&quot; is a complete sentence.
{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|English
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Latin
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|The boy ''is'' '''good'''.
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Puer '''bonus''' ''est''.
|}

As shown above, the same is true in Latin.

==Adjectives in Latin==
Like nouns, adjectives in Latin are declined. The vast majority take either the first and second declension (''antiquus -a -um'') or the third declension (''ferox, ferocis''). All such adjectives must agree with the nouns they describe in gender, number, and case, '''but not necessarily declension'''.

*First and second declension adjectives have three distinct genders. Feminine adjectives require the first declension, masculine the second, and neuter the second. First/second declension adjectives use all three gender suffixes: -us, -a, -um (masculine, feminine, and neuter, respectively). This is because description is not limited to a single gender. For example, being good is not a quality limited to a single gender. Boys can be good, girls can be good, and things can be good. So, since all three genders must apply, we don't label adjectives as particularly ''m.'', ''f.'', or ''n.''.
*Third declension adjectives are given with the nominative and genitive singular. '''This, however, is only true for third declension adjectives of one termination, so again this chapter is misleading in this regard.''' Most third declension adjectives do not have separate masculine and feminine forms. (Neuter adjectives follow the third declension neuter pattern.)

These words will look like the adjective '''antiquus''' (old, ancient):
:''antiquus'' (masculine), ''antiqua'' (feminine), ''antiquum'' (neuter). 

Third declension adjectives typically look more like '''ferox''', '''ferocis''' (wild, bold). This is because the third declension has no stem assigned to the nominative singular and is a &quot;wild card&quot; in that regard.

Adjectives &lt;u&gt;often&lt;/u&gt; come '''after the word they describe'''. (But since word order is not central to the meaning of a Latin sentence, the adjective &lt;u&gt;may appear anywhere&lt;/u&gt; within the sentence. In poetry, for example, several words often separate an adjective from the noun it modifies.)

For example:
'''Nota bene:''' In the following examples the ''-us'' ending stands for the '''masculine (m.)''' gender, 
the ''-a'' for the '''feminine (f.)''' gender, and the ''-um'' stands for the '''neuter (n.)''' gender. 
So '''magnus''' is masculine, '''magna''' is feminine and '''magnum''' is neuter. 

{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|Latin
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|English
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|Puella bona est.
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|The girl is good.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|Dominus bonus est.
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|The master is good.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|Templum magnum est.
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|The temple is big.
|}

''Bona'' is an adjective describing a feminine substantive, such as ''puella''.&lt;br&gt;
''Bonus'' is an adjective describing a masculine substantive, such as ''dominus''.

==Grammar: Pluralizing Nominatives==
{| align=&quot;center&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;
|-
! Number
! First declension feminine
! Second declension masculine
! Second declension neuter
|-
| Singular || puell-'''a''' || lūd-'''us''' || triclīni-'''um'''
|-
| Plural || puell-'''ae''' || lūd-'''ī''' || triclīni-'''a'''
|}

To pluralize most first and second declension nouns, replace the singular suffix with the equivalent plural suffix. All adjectives that describe the noun must be pluralized as well because adjectives must agree in case, number, and gender (but not necessarily declension). With the adjectives given, use first declension with feminine nouns and second declension with masculine nouns. In English we use the same nominative plural endings for words we have borrowed from Latin, so it may be helpful to remember we say one vertebr-a but two vertebr-ae, one radi-us but two radi-ī, and one medium but multi-medi-a.

==Basic verbs==
Verbs in Latin work quite differently than those in English. Study the following table, then view the examples below, though keep in mind that you only need to fully understand the difference between numbers for the time being.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! !! English !! Latin
|-
|Number || Only pluralize the noun that is being pluralized, not the adjectives that describe it or the verb that it is performing. || All three are pluralized. In this context, singular verbs end in &quot;-t&quot; (es'''t''', ambula'''t'''), and plural verbs end in &quot;-nt&quot; (su'''nt''', ambula'''nt''').
|-
|Tense || The ending is sometimes changed, though the words surrounding the verb can also be used to denote tense. Consider these examples: &quot;he will walk, he is walking, he walks, he walked&quot;. || The stem is used to denote the tense, though this will be covered in a future lesson. In this lesson, only the present tense is being taught.
|-
|Person || The subject of the sentence is used to determine the person. If I am the subject of the sentence, then the sentence is in the first person. If you are the subject, then the second person, and so forth with the third. In this lesson, only the third person is being taught, which refers to anyone other than the speaker or the listener. || The stem also denotes the person, though as previously stated, only third person is being taught in this lesson.
|}

===Examples===
{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|+align=&quot;bottom&quot;|Notice how &quot;magnum&quot; changes to &quot;magna&quot; to agree with the pluralized &quot;triclīnia&quot;.
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Latin
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|English
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|puell-a bon-a es-t.
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|The girl is good.
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''And to pluralize:''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|puell-ae bon-ae su-nt
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|The girls are good.
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Note that verbs do not have gender, in that they do not change to the gender of the word that they are describing.
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;| Puer bon-us ambula-t.
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;| The good boy is walking.
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''And to pluralize:''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Puer-ī bon-ī ambula-nt
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;| The good boys are walking.
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | You will notice that neither the linking verbs &quot;est&quot; nor &quot;sunt&quot; appear in the previous two sentences. The meaning of the linking verbs are assumed in Latin sentences, as their respective meanings already exist in the verb stems.
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|triclīni-um magn-um es-t
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|The dining room is large.
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''And to pluralize:''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|triclīni-a magn-a su-nt
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|The dining rooms are large.
|}

==Further Examples==
===Example 1===
{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;
|-
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Latin
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | English
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | templum magnum est
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | The temple is big.
|}

;Notes
*The adjective ''magnus -a -um'' must agree with ''templum'' in gender, number, and case, so the correct form is ''magnum'' (neuter nominative singular).
*Something like ''templum magnus est'' is '''incorrect''' because ''magn-us'' does not agree with ''templ-um''. To a Latin speaker, this would sound like nonsense.

===Example 2===
{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;
|-
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Latin
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | English
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | puella magna est.
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | The girl is big.
|}

'''Notes:''' In the same way, the adjective ''magnus -a -um'' must agree with ''puella'' in gender, number, and case, so the correct form is ''magna'' (feminine nominative singular, a-declinatio).

===Example 3===
{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;
|-
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Latin
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | English
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Puer currit.
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|The boy is running.
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Puerī currunt.
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|The boys are running
|}

'''Notes:''' You may notice that, when pluralized, &quot;curr'''i'''t&quot; becomes &quot;curr'''u'''nt&quot;. The original spelling was probably &quot;currint&quot;, but changed to &quot;currunt&quot; over time to make it easier to say. This is true of any pluralized verbs that would otherwise be ending in &quot;-int&quot;. 

===Example 4===
{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;
|-
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Latin
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | English
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | lūdī magnī sunt
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | The schools are big.
|}

'''Notes:''' The adjective ''magnus -a -um'' in this case must agree with ''lūdī'' in gender, number, and case, so the correct form is ''magnī'' (masculine nominative plural).

==Third Declension Nouns and Adjectives==
Third declension nouns and adjectives follow a different pattern. The nominative singular stem is not defined, and as such, any letter (or letters) can serve as a third declension stem. For example, ''Māter'' (mother) is a third declension noun in the nominative case. When pluralized, it becomes ''Mātrēs''. &quot;-ēs&quot; is attached to the end of a third declension noun to pluralize it, as opposed to changing the ending completely, because there is no uniform way to do so given the third declension's random nature.

You may have also noticed that that the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;Māter&quot; was dropped when pluralized. This often happens when a stem is attached to a third declension noun of similar spelling (example, &quot;Pater&quot; (father) becomes &quot;Patrēs&quot;)

Examples:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;
|-
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Latin
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | English
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | māter bona est
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | The mother is good.
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | mātrēs bonae sunt
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | The mothers are good.
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | pater magnus est
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | The father is large.
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | patrēs magnī sunt
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | The fathers are large.
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | amīcus fortis est
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | The friend is strong.
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | amīcī fortēs sunt
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | The friends are strong
|}

Third declension nouns are listed with the nominative case and the genitive case to provide the main stem, which will be covered in a few lessons. All other nouns are also listed with the genitive for standardization, but often just the genitive ending is given. For example:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;
|-
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Latin&lt;/font&gt;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;English&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''pater, patris'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''father'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''oratio, orationis'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''speech'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''uxor, uxoris'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''wife'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''canis, canis'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''dog'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''proelium, -ī'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''battle'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''oculus, -ī'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''eye'''
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | '''amīcus, -ī'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | '''friend'''
|}

All other types of nouns are also generally listed with the genitive

Adjectives with a nominative ending in -is and the same stem in the nominative and in the other cases (eg. fortis) end in -e in the neuter and -ia in the neuter plural.

For example:
*dies difficilis = the difficult day
*proelium difficile = the difficult battle
*proelia difficilia = the difficult battles

It is always SO exciting to see people working on a project. This work will be the basis of many people learning about this subject ... We leave behind a legacy with every bit of work. Thank you, welcome, and good luck with your efforts. Any questions ask me or one of the oldtimers .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

== Introduction Completed ==

After going over things many, many times, I think I have completed the Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 pages (which are both counted now by me as 'Introduction').

I have merged the nominative and accusative lessons in one, because I think it is important to learn both cases at the same time, and I think it offers a better introduction to the meaning of the the suffixes, and it allows students to construct real sentences not just 'he is good' etc. at the very beginning.

Also, I might just show students all the 5 cases at the very beginning. I don't think it will overwhelm them because what we are doing is starting from the two basic cases (nominative and accusative) and gradually building up to all 6 and at the end touch on locative.

Also, who is in favour of using instead of 'present, future, imperfect and perfect, future perfect, pluperfect' rather Present Imperfect, Future Imperfect, Past Imperfect, Present Perfect, Future Perfect, Past Perfect.

And from there students can use the planned 'Advance Latin Course', to be used for later years. It is to be a course for students who know a little latin and want to build their knowledge. Anyway, it will start from ground zero, and will assume the student knows nothing, but the student must be intelligent, and very dedicated. It will go through all aspects of the language, and won't offer exercises, because the student is expected to simply to take notes.

== Some thoughts... ==

I like the ideas put forth so far, and would love to help out on this project.  I'll also touch on the ideas you presented with my own - we agree on a good deal of the points:

As we learn different parts of speech and noun constructions at different times in our natural English educations, I think a similarly-presented Latin lesson plan is appropriate.  What I'm suggesting is to mention all the cases and their most &lt;b&gt;basic&lt;/b&gt; usages (with respect to English constructions) up front:  &lt;em&gt;Nominative&lt;/em&gt; is for subjects, &lt;em&gt;Accusative&lt;/em&gt; is for direct object, etc.  

Then, start with basic sentences involving the Present Imperfect of &lt;em&gt;esse&lt;/em&gt;, subjects, predicate nominatives, and prepositions taken with the Ablative - &lt;em&gt;Pueri in campo sunt&lt;/em&gt;.  Toss in some possessives - &lt;em&gt;Ciceronis frater miles est&lt;/em&gt;.  Obviously the vocab. in that last example was a bit steep as it would be wise to start with just the first or second declension.  The point of this is just to teach Latin in the same manner English was taught.  Certainly in English we learned how to say &quot;I kicked the ball in the field&quot; (place where) before learning to say &quot;I kicked the ball in the field with amazing vigor&quot; (manner) or &quot;I kicked the ball in the field with my foot&quot; (means).

While it certainly is neat (and very viable) to have students constructing &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., substantial) sentences by the end of the first lesson, I worry about how many students may be turned off by such a rapid approach.

As for your verb tense naming scheme, I think the latter name scheme provides better insight into what the tenses actually imply, so my vote goes for that option.  It took me the longest time as a student to make the distinction between Imperfect and Perfect with regards to the action's &quot;completeness.&quot;

I'd be more than happy to make whatever contributions I can to this thing, just let me know what I can do to help!  Cheers!

== Systematic Approach ==

The problem is I want a systematic approach for latin.

As you can see I have a table for all the cases in Lesson 1 or 2. The first two lessons, as I had arranged it give a complete introduction into the terminology used. And in the 3rd lesson (which is quite a mess) you start to apply it to real Latin, starting with the Nominative and Accusative cases. I think it is important to start off comparing nominative and accusative, and getting students to recognize the forms as once you can do that, it is all a matter of memorizing suffixes (only nominative and accusative for lesson 3).

Also I think it would be appropriate to give simple rules to the suffixes and stem changes in the third declension so by the end of lesson 3 you would be able to:

Decline (only nominative and accusative) 1st declen, 2nd declen., 3rd declen, 4th declen. and 5th declen. including adjectives.

Pronouns will be introduced on the last lesson on nouns, also the effect of dropping the subject noun.

1st and 2nd persons will not be dealt with until we start learning to conjugate verbs which will be quite later down the track (I think nouns (which include substantives, adjectives and pronouns) are the MOST important things to get out of the way.

Constructions with the 3rd persons of to be (est, sunt, erit, erunt, erat, erant, fuit, fuerunt, fuerit, fuerit, fuerat, fuerant) can be learnt but it must be emphasized that these verbs take the NOMINATIVE.

If you wish, you can drop me an email at daniel_canaris@yahoo.com.au

== Latin Dictionary... ==
I have been reading some of Des Cartes writings (which is in latin), and he employs peculiar Latin. Namely due to the fact that Latin &quot;evolved&quot; somewhat, but I have no clue what he is saying. If anyone has a philosopher Latin-English dictionary, or a link to an online one, that would be supper to put on!
Cheers!
Pablo

If we can find a good link on it, the one on www.perseus.tufts.edu would be the best.  It includes all the classics and all the philosophers and all the big dictionaries (except the OLD.)

== Formatting. ==

I try to help as much as I can, but unfortunately, since I'm actually using this book to learn Latin, I can't contribute in that manner. However, I ''can'' contribute by fixing / formatting tables, removing typos or tags that show though the page, and things like that.

That brings me to my question: is there some kind of set formatting that's been agreed upon? I've just been alternating the rows with grey and white where appropriate, but I'm not sure if I should do anything with the heading or use different colors.

Like I said, I'm trying to help, but I can't help if I don't know what to do.

Also, is there going to be a non-introductory Latin course? If not, then each of the parts (Part 1, Part 2, etc.) can be made into a header and the &quot;Introductory Latin Course&quot; header can be removed. This  will make sure that the table of contents works correctly, although I'm not particularly sure that it's necessary to have a table of contents for a table of contents.

On the front page, a note has been added by someone asking for macrons to be used to indicate vowel length.  I see that there is no need for such a thing, because there different ways in which latin can be pronounced.

'''This is true, however the macron must be used for the ablative singular (otherwise it gets confusied with the nominative pluaral. --source of &quot;Note&quot;. It is also best used for the acc. to distingush for novices between the English plural -s and the 1st declension accusative plural since English has a much broader concept of plural which doesn't always depend on case. So I just made sure to point to people how to do this. (Technical skills are also covered in many textbooks.) I struggled to figure out how to do it.

I am also learning Latin through this text, and Latin via Ovid.

== Speaking Latin??? ==
There is now an enormous online audio course for spoken Latin, with many thousands of users. This is Latinum, and it is delivered by podcast.
There are also a huge number of colloquies, dialogues etc that were written for beginners to learn colloquial Latin (heavily influenced by Terence and Plautus,of course ). A google search for Latinum, or 'latin podcast' will bring up the Latinum podcast, which is free.
There is also a community of Latin speakers who communicate regularly through Schola.ning.com.

Hi,

I ´m wondering if it is reasonable to make a section for speaking Latin.
I would like to work upon this section, altough I am not that experienced in spoken Latin.
But I think some might be interested in basic speaking exercises and phrases you may use some time. So I think , actually speaking Latin is not taught at school neither at University, so maybe it could be an interesting thing for (advanced) Latin learners.
Tell me your opinon upon this please.

Sincerely,

Kay Lorenz
: There are universities that teach spoken classical Latin, and definitely a lot of religious schools that teach &quot;church latin.&quot;  And, despite what anyone says, we do know a lot about colloquial Latin, how things were pronounced, colloquialisms and slang, etc.  So yes, at least pronunciation and at most a steady stream of spoken Latin should be inected into this book.  --[[User:Mrcolj|Mrcolj]] 04:55, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
: I just saw this: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Spoken_Latin  --[[User:Mrcolj|Mrcolj]] 05:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:I am fluent in spoken Latin and let me tell you that it is used more then just in university courses on in the Church.  Not to be hostile but I also take exception to the characterization of Church Latin as somehow being different, wierd or bad.  This may not have been your intention but it came across to me that you meant that by putting it in &quot;quotes&quot;.  The kind of Church Latin that you find in the liturgy or in set prayers like the Our Father is an idiom of Latin that is different but not significantly different from everyday Latin or the Latin used for formal meetings.  We know that Issac Newton, regardless of what you think of him, didn't write in the idiom of Latin used in the liturgy but he did write in the common Latin idiom of his time that was intelligible to almost all litterate people of that time.  Just like Biblical Greek is different from Ancient Greek due to the inclusion of and direct translations from Hebrew and other Semetic languages, they were both used in the Church, one for the liturgy and bible and the other for everyday communication.  The modern version of Latin that exist and is decended from the Latin that Newton and his peers used is not only used by the Church but by anyone that respects the language enough to allow it to grow and start to include new words and used new letters like the now demonized letter J.  Much of this has come about by teachers that want to teach very specifically Classical Latin.  I respect their decision to teach Classical Latin as it is an important idiom of the Language that is important form many people to learn but I do take issue when people begin to say that ONLY Classical Latin is correct.  They start to want to expunge books of the letter J, accent marks and any words not used by Cicero or Ceasar.  Keep in mind that Classical Latin only existed for about 100 to 200 years.  Anything else is simply an immitation of it.  Latin has a 3000 year history and mother tounge speaker living in a very wide area that used slightly different vobaculary and had local idioms.  Are we to tell them that they are all wrong, us who come to Latin as a second Language, tell the ancients who were Native speakers and maybe didn't even know any other language that they are wrong.  Certainly not.  There is more to Latin then just the simple form of Classical Latin or the very complicated form of Liturgical Latin.  Latin is a full and complete language and one should never be afraid or embarassed to learn to speak it.

== Exercises ==

I have realised how little thought has been put into the exercises even many points of existing grammar.   I believe we should pick passages for every page which relate to the grammatical concepts introduced in the chapter in addition to revised exercises.  I shall spend quite some time this week revising pages and making additional entries.



==Comments from a Latin Student==

I have a number of comments on how everything is done - and, I want people to keep in mind, I mean it in a good way. It seems to me that at certain points some things are introduced far too soon - subjunctive, for example, and declining adjectives (although that should be fine as long as we stick to first and second declension!) - while other things are brought up too slowly. For example, I think we could teach all the cases at once, which I realize the author is considering - maybe leave out the Vocative, as it's not particularly useful and not technically a case - or something to that extent.

Just a thought; it seems to me that the way some of it is organized is inconsistent, which can make it hard to follow.

Some things also don't make sense to me - for example, how can an adjective be a noun? Something can't modify itself. I just have a bunch of little nitpicks; however, I'm not a professional, just a student, so feel free to correct me!

Awesome work, though - a really tough project! Hope I can help out too.

--Chiyo

PS - My vote goes to the former system, as in the one with Pluperfect, but that's only because that's what I was taught and it's what I'm the most used to. Don't care much either way, though.

Now concerning the 'Noun'.  Latin grammarians, like Donatus, considered the adjectives, pronouns and substantives to all be 'nouns'.  And in fact, many of the older grammar also do this as well.  Nouns to the ancient grammarians were words which were declined which include adjectives, pronouns and substantives. - Daniel Canaris

What are those two new additions on the title page?  What are they there for?

== declensions and cases ==

I'm using your text to learn latin, not very hard at any rate.  As a person who is more or less oblivious this crazy Latin grammar, I find you explain most of it well enough, although it may be a little technical.  Declension is the part that gets me.  I see that the nouns are modified depending on their use in the sentence, but what's with the 5 declensions?  I think this is something that needs clarification.  I'm assuming the different declensions just mean you decline differently, like conjugating verbs differently in spanish depending on the ending?  Also, the different cases could use a little clarification, I get the feeling that everything but nominative and accusative has some pretty complex nuances.  It seems pretty good for being a work in progress, albeit a bit complicated for a new latin student (or just me?).  Just trying to give you a learner's perspective.


- REPLY 

Your assumption is right.

Don't worry about 'nuances' at the beginning.  Datives are used more than just 'giving', genitives more than just origin etc. but don't worry about it.  You'll learn it gradually.

The final vowel (or consonent) of the stem of the noun determines what declension a noun is.  From analysing the different declensions and the case endings you can see that each case ending of one declension shares something in common with another.  A 'm' sound is typical for singular accusatives (like Greek) and 'um' for genitive plurals (like the greek on).  Different indo-european languages also share common case endings.  The endings though become corrupted and certain elisions occur dependant on the final vowel or consonent.  All the nouns with the vowel 'a' as the final vowel of the stem fall under the catagory of 1st declension nouns.  'o' nouns are the second declension, 'consonents or i' 3rd declension, u 4th declension and 'e' 5th declension.  By reading a bit of basic linguistics it's not hard to see how this occurs.  

In Spanish you have verb conjugations, and the concept is not dissimilar.

hablo
hablas
habla
hablamos
hablaís
hablan

and other 'a' verbs conjugate like this in spanish

form the 'a' conjugation which all conjugate alike (the a conjugation in Spanish is very regular, which is to do with the vowel 'a', because in Latin the 'a' nouns and verbs are the most stable as well)

amo
amas
amat 
amamus
amatis
amant

and other 'a' verbs conjugate like this in english.

'a' nouns in Latin nearly all decline like 'puella' (puella, puellam, puellae, puellae, puella, puellae, puellas, puellarum, puellis, puellis)
'o' nouns in Latin nearly all decline like 'servus'
'consonent' and 'i' nouns in Latin nearly all decline like 'civis' or 'rex'
'u' nouns nearly all decline like cornus
'e' nouns decline like 'res'.

== Imperatives ==

I have noticed that there is not a section on imperatives.  Imperatives are rather simply as far as I recall from school. Imperatives are commands!

First Conjuagtion

S Ama = (You) Love!
P Amate = (You) Love! 

Second Conjugation

S Mone = (You)Advise!
P Monete = (You) Advise!

Third Conjugation

S Rege = (You) Rule!
P Regite = (You) Rule!

Except for: (Mnemonic &quot;Dick had a Duck with fur on its face&quot;)

- Dic Dicite
- Duc Ducite
- Fer Ferte
- Fac Facite

Fourth Conjugation

S Audi = (You) Hear!
P Audite = (You) Hear!

-- Reply to Reply

An easier way to remember the declensions, and the way in which I was taught, being a Latin student myself, is to have a song that you can sing to yourself that identifies them.  For example, I was taught &quot;One is -o, -are; Two is -eo, -ere; Three is -o, -ere; Four is -io, -ire; and Third -io is -io, -ere.&quot;  I was taught that the &quot;fourth declension&quot; here was the &quot;third -io&quot; and the &quot;fifth&quot; was the &quot;fourth,&quot; which may or may not be confusing to you...  The numbers in the song are the declensions, and the first ending is the first-person nominative singular form, whereas the second ending is the ending for the infinitive.  When you look up a word in almost any Latin/English dictionary, only the first- person nominative singular form and the infinitive form will be listed, so if you look in a Latin/ English dictionary, or you happen to know these two forms of the word, you will be able to identify the declension of that word.  Hope this was helpful!!!

== Answers To Exercises ==

I think the answers for all of the exercises should be given somewhere, otherwise it defeats the purposes of the exercises. I would go ahead and add them, but I am student and am not very confident with the accuracy of my answers.

== Advanced ==

perhaps after all the basic grammatical bases have been covered there could be added an introduction to Latin meter and where it is used?

== Learning unused languages ==

It is always suggested that people practice the language they are learning by using it. The problem: no one speaks languages like Latin or Greek anymore (two that I would like to learn). This is a huge obsticale to learning. Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions on how to practice with people? I am thinking the best way is to find a friend that also wants to learn, and learn at the same time. --[[User:Loplin|Loplin]] 02:46, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

::See William Harris' excellent essay [http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/LatinBackground/SilentReading.html the Sin of Silent Reading] for some trenchant views on learning Latin.  It might be hard to find another student but you can always read out loud.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 15:40, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

Just a comment and I don't mean to be snide but I am pretty sure people still speak Greek in Greece as it is the only official language.  Modern Greek is a little different form Ancient Greek but learning it would help you a lot to learn to speak Ancient Greek.  Many people do still use Latin and many people still speak Latin but the problem is that modern writers or speakers of Latin are painted as strange, religious fanatics by people that support ONLY Classical Latin. 

== Long Vowels ==

I looked over this Latin course and I noticed that you didn't use long vowels (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū). They are necessary to correctly determine stress, so should they be added? [[User:Gandalf1491|Gandalf1491]] 15:29, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

Added long vowels up to Lesson 10. [[User:Gandalf1491|Gandalf1491]] 16:13, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

== Hard Going ==

Although I can understand this course, I have a nagging suspicion that I can only understand because I learned it all years ago. I think that some simpler explanations would help, perhaps it would be useful to have some explanations on linked pages. What do people think? [[User:Gaius Calvus|Gaius Calvus]] 13:28, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

Amen to that.  [[User:216.178.90.41|216.178.90.41]] 02:17, 2 May 2006 (UTC)TC

== Missing Stuff ==

I have noticed that a certain construction is missing.  Where is the ablative absolute?  The ablative absolute is probably the bane of anyone learning to translate latin.  An example would be ''caesare in absentia'' which would be translated as ''When/While Caesar was absent''.--[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 00:39, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{mergefrom|Spoken Latin}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

To avoid confusion, all pages of the book called [[Latin]] should start with the word [[Latin]]. The majority of the pages already do this, but I suggest a move of [[Spoken Latin]] and other such pages. I might attempt to move the pages myself. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:43, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

Hi Kernigh.  Changed your tag to a merge tag as I couldn't see any incorrectly named pages in the Latin book which needed fixing.  Cheers Ad --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 12:03, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

== Comments from a different Latin student ==

As far as I can see, there are a few organizational problems.  I think that all five cases should be introduced at once, or at least very quickly.  After all, what good is the nominative by itself?  The way I was taught (which worked well) was to introduce all five cases quickly, but do the declensions less quickly.  It isn't that difficult to come up with sentences using only first declension.

Also, I think that there should at least be an introduction to verbs in the first or second lesson (maybe just present tense).  This way, the student can practice with simple sentences and thoroughly memorize 1st declension, which is absolutely necessary.  After that, 2nd declension is not that different from 1st, and imperfect isn't that different from present, etc.

More extensive selected vocabulary would also be nice, because dictionaries are a little bit intimidating, especially if you don't know what priciple parts are, etc.  Also, just knowing what to learn is a setback.  People just being introduced don't have to know arbitrary words such as orca, orcae, f. -- a pot with a large belly.

e.g. my original vocab consisted of: illa, hic, agricola, fabula, familia, femina, fenestra, ferula, filia, ianua, mensa, patria, pictura, poeta, provincia, puella, regina, sella, silva, tabula, terra, via, villa, vita, murus, pavimentum, puer, stilus, in, cum, amo, habito, laudo, narro, voco, sum, and et.  Memorizing basic words such as these makes learning latin a lot easier when it is at first taught with simple words.

Did I miss the section on deponent verbs?

Tables of irregular verbs would be nice.  Sum, Fero, Volo, Nolo, Malo, etc.

So far, it's pretty good, though, despite my criticism.

== And another student.. ==

It's rather difficult to navigate my way around this site, so forgive me if I missed this earlier on somewhere else..

As a person who has no prior knowledge of Latin whatsoever, it is difficult to grasp some of the things presented here. For me, at least, it would help a great deal if somebody could include a brief table or something that defined (translated) all the terms/phrases  used in any give lesson. It would make a great deal more sense to me, as I can understand grammatically what it being explained sometimes, but I am unsure still of what exactly is being said.

As the person before me mentioned, I would greatly appreciate it if somebody could do up an appendix that is linked from the first page of basic vocab in one tense, just so I could at a very minimal level get started with simple phrases and sentences, and build up from there.

All in all, though, it is a formidable undertaking to learn a language from a textbook, and all the more daunting to teach one. I greatly applaud all the effort gone into the work so far, and eagerly await the completion of this text.

== Ideas for Revisions==

Currently my biggest issue with the book, besides some inaccuracies I've been fixing, is the order of chapters. Students learn the vocative and ablative absolute before they can say &quot;pater est bonus.&quot;

As it is, I'm going to make some revisions to the order. If this is disliked, a revert will fix that immediately!

My plans are to subdivide the course into grades. That is grade 1 would have the basics, nominative, accusative, and present tense verbs, as well as the first few declensions of nouns, and a basic overview of verbs, adjectives, and so forth.


As an update, I have done that which I hoped to do to make the book more understandable and useful for the beginner. Unfortunately, I think I may have butchered the formating from earlier times into an irrecoverable state. For that I apologize greatly. Nonetheless, I have tried to simplify some complicated topics(such as the imperfect and future, genative and dative, etc. all being one topic instead of two or more, and invite anyone to help with this. Also, many of the perfects are completely, for lack of a better word, wrong. I think help with that would also be great. 

Again, apologizing, --[[User:Asv|Asv]] 20:00, 4 April 2007 (UTC)


==Thinking of Helping==

I am a Latin teacher and have developed an iterestin way of teaching Latin that I find works very well.  However, I teach Latin generally and I teach students to use what I call the easy pronunciation where C and G change before an EE type sound. It looks to me that the kind of Latin being taught here and the Latin that I teach are incompatible with each other.  Many people make arguement about Classical Latin and I certainly have no problem with people teaching Classical Latin but let us remember that the Classical Idiom is but one of the many idioms that existed and it only existed for a small time period when compared to the whole of the language.  I teach Latin as a complete language and I would hope that my students could read Classical, pre Classical, post Classical or any other type of Latin you could throw at them.  To get to the point I don't suppose you would be willing to reconsider your policies regarding the other idioms of Latin.  If not them I would suggest with all humility that this particular module be rename Classical Latin so that it could be more accurate and advertise exactly what is being taught here and open up the more general name of Latin for those of us who want to teach all of Latin.--[[User:Billiot|Billiot]] 10:32, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

==Pre/Suffixes==

Could any of you tell me in which part of this book I could write a section or two on prefixes and suffixes? They obviously aren't a large part of latin that your everyday student would need to learn to be able to translate a latin text, but there isn't a lot in Wikiland about these. I'm writing about the diminutive suffix in latin at Vicipaedia, but I'm sure that the page won't be done justice there. --&lt;font face=&quot;Courier new&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;[[user:Harris Morgan|Harris]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Harris Morgan|Morgan]]&lt;/font&gt; 18:23, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

==An alternative book==
I was thinking about making an alternative Latin book. Now before you kill me, I want you to look at some other language books and see what they teach first and what the emphasise; they teach &quot;greeting people&quot; and &quot;conversing&quot; first, learning how to introduce oneself. They don't slap a bunch of declension and conjugation tables in your face. Therefore I propose we create another lesson, which teaches Latin in order to make the student good at &quot;speaking&quot; Latin. To say how much something costs, to say which way to the bank and to order a hamburger. Sure some might say &quot;why learn that? you don't need to order hamburgers in Latin&quot;, well why not? Some people who have learned Latin for many years don't know how to say &quot;my name is xxx&quot;, and only know how to say &quot;sic transit gloria mundi&quot; and something like that. Now what do you say? I personally don't think that this would make it too complex for the students, and that it only make learning more fun. Then later, when people have mastered some helpful phrases and sentences (not &quot;the girls carry the water&quot;), we can teach them about the cases and grammar. I think this will make many kids aspire to learn Latin; &quot;hey guess how you say &quot;fuck you&quot; in Latin??&quot;. Hilarity ensues! --[[User:BiT|BiT]] 16:34, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

Why do u want to teach people to order hamburgers in latin sorry? my view is the crowd for studying latin don't learn it to speak it they learn it to be able to translate and appreciate such writers like Virgil or Horace. To read that stuff, you'll need to know your tables solid from the beginning. I see where your coming from, its a nice hook maybe to get people in, but you might be wasting your time writing more than a few chapters for the crowd you'll get though.

:As a matter of fact, I am studying Latin myself using the Memoria Press curriculum. (''Prima Latina'', then ''Latina Christiana'', and so on.) You could say that these people know what a student needs-plenty of review, a new list of vocab/grammar every week, and continual review.

== Clarifications ==

I think that we should explain everything, like where sentences come from and such, right from the start. I think the best way to do this would be to make a new page under the first chapter. I'm a very new memberand am not sure of how to do this.

== Major revisions and restructuring needed ==
This book needs some fundamental restructuring and fixes. For example, i have found that it is incredibly difficult to learn without the presence of macrons, especially for first-time students with no prior knowledge of Latin whatsoever. Additionally, all of the cases should be introduced at once, not over a series of lessons. The page on the uses of the subjunctive is severely lacking. Use of linguistic terms in articles without defining them can confuse first-time foreign language learners. Frankly, this book is not of featured quality, in my opinion. It is incomplete and needs serious improvements.

Please offer your opinions. If I receive no feedback to the contrary within the next three days, I will begin a massive restructuring to the likes of that which I have described above. Thank you.

I found the structure of the book perplexing, the sentences inconsistent, the vocabulary choices strange (I'd start with English-like ones first, and include English words derived from the Latin to make memorization easier), and the amount of information in the first parts overwhelming.
