'''Chicken Parmigiana''' is a popular [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]]-[[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] dish served in a variety of ways.  The same basic recipe works for a number of dishes.  The components usually consists of a breaded, tenderized piece of [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] (or slice of [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]]), a simple [[Cookbook:Marinara Sauce|marinara sauce]], and [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (usually [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]]).  A thicker [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], such as linguini, a toasted loaf of Italian [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], and a light red wine such as Chianti complement this dish well.

This recipe is typical of the parmigiana recipes from New York and New Jersey.

==Ingredients==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] powder
* 1/2 a teaspoon of dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* 1/4 teaspoon of dried [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 1/4 teaspoon of finely crushed [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1/2 a [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of All-Purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1/2 a cup of [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato puree]]
* 1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]
* 1/2 a cup of [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]] (see below if you wish to use [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]])
* 1/2 a cup of shredded [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]]
* 1/4 a cup of grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmigiano cheese]]

==Preparation==
#In a heavy [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] (preferably cast iron), heat the oil on medium heat.
#While the oil is heating, use a tenderizing mallet (or the ball of your hand) to pound the chicken breasts to about 1/2 an [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] of thickness.  This step is important to ensure the chicken is tender and more importantly to ensure the chicken cooks thoroughly.
# Season the chicken breasts with salt and garlic powder.
# [[Cookbook:Dredging|Dredge]] the breasts in flour and shake off any excess.
# Place both breasts in the heated oil for 3 minutes, then flip and [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] for an additional 2 minutes.
# Remove the breasts and place on a rack or paper towel.
# Turn on an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], set for [[Cookbook:Broiling|broiling]].
# In a large oven-safe [[Cookbook:Saucepan|sauce pan]], heat the tomato puree and chicken stock until it begins to [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]].
# Add the oregano, basil, and pepper to sauce pan and mix
# Place cooked chicken breasts in pan and flip a number of times to coat with sauce.
# Add mozzarella and parmigiana cheese to the tops of the breasts.
# Place in oven for 30-60 seconds.  It will burn very quickly so check it frequently.
# Remove from oven and serve.

==Tips==
* Use thin-sliced chicken cutlets (available at most supermarkets) to avoid the BIG mess and time of pounding.
* If pasta is to be served with this meal, it should be timed so that the parmigiana is done right when the pasta is.  The pasta should be removed directly from the pot and placed into the pan.  The remaining sauce can then be used with the pasta.
* This recipe works best with breasts that come from slightly older chickens (such as broiler or fryer chickens).  These chickens have a stronger taste but are generally tougher.  The tenderizing step takes care of the toughness of the older birds though.
* If you do not live in area where fresh tomatoes are grown, canned tomatoes are usually superior to the low-cost ones you will find in the super market.
* Tomato puree goes bad very quickly (even in the fridge).  Freezing the tomato puree in chunks allows for long-term storage.

==Variations and Varieties==
* For [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] parmigiana, follow the same steps except do not tenderize.  Veal is already tender enough.  The veal can also be cooked for 2 minutes on each side.
* Omit the tenderizing step for [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]] parmigiana.
* If you want to use fresh garlic instead of powder, add it to the sauce instead of adding it to the chicken breast.
* You can also try using other types of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheeses]] such as [[Cookbook:Provolone Cheese|provolone cheese]] or [[Cookbook:Fontina Cheese|fontina cheese]] to add more of a &quot;tasty kick&quot; compared to a mild cheese like mozzarella 
* You may wish to use [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. When frying with olive oil, be sure to use a cheap solvent-extracted grade! The fancy grades can not tolerate heat. They have [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke points]] as low as 200°F (93°C), making for both a fire hazard and a source of cancer-causing fumes. Save the cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil for a [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]].

{{book title|Teaching Computer Literacy|From the Beginning}}

This is a resource for anyone who is, or will be teaching the basics of computers to any type of beginner. 
The focus of this book is to provide:
*General suggestions that can be adapted to your needs.
*Specific lesson plans for students with varying interests. 
*Links to other relevant information 
*Links to useful software for the purpose of learning or teaching.

Currently we have &quot;Lessons in Paint&quot; which are good for most children, and anyone else who likes to draw. Lessons in Paint is great because many of the Windows features are teachable in Paint.

These lessons are geared toward Windows PCs. The suggestions and lessons could be adapted to work with other operating systems. If you have or make a lesson plan around Mac or Linux, please let us know on the discussion page and we could create a place for it.

Remember, you can edit or add information by simply clicking on the “edit” tab at the top of any page or any section. Don’t worry about mistakes, you will be able to preview before saving. Also other users of can refer to previous versions and fix mistakes. If you are interested in the development of this book click on the “discussion” tab on any page to see what we are working on, and to contribute to the discussion.

*paste
*cut
*undo
*redo
*spell check

= Overall Suggestions =
Some obvious and hopefully some not so obvious suggestions;
It is important to make it interesting for the specific person, while keeping it simple enough to avoid frustration. To achieve both goals at the same time you should;
#Ask them what they want to do. 
#Find the simplest method of accomplishing the task. 
#Try it a few times to simplify the process and organize your lesson.
#Then walk them through the lesson.

At first skip the start menu by using a desktop shortcut. Yes they will need to learn it, but getting straight to something useful is key to avoiding frustration.

Use 800x600 screen resolution for improved visibility and mouse accuracy.

Change the mouse sensitivity to be easier to control.

Use only click, and drag on the first lesson.

Choose the save to directory and make sure you are viewing with thumbnails.

Teach the menu from left to right, i.e. start with 'file' on the first day then 'edit' the next. This should prevent having too many students unsure which menu item to click.

Note that similar things can be taught together when they are done in the same way. Like dragging a window and dragging a pasted item. However when two different things could be confusingly similar, teach them at different times, and teach the distinction when teaching the second. Some examples of this; the menu items, click/double click, and save/save-as.

Use consistent language, and find the easiest term to relate too. Students will learn the synonyms later without even realizing they are learning. Here are a few examples

Arrow, pointer, curser, mouse (I prefer arrow, pointer works well also).
Enter, or return (use whatever is written on the key, and stick with it).

In the first few sessions avoid button combinations of any kind. Using Ctrl C to copy is faster, and easier, but not for those new to computers. Even Shift key for capital letters is potentially frustrating. Introduce these combinations after your students are good at computers.

= '''Lessons in Paint''' =

In this series of lessons we use Microsoft Paint. This is a good program to use; it is already on the computer, is fun to use, and is great practice for the mouse. You can teach most of the basics using Paint.

== Paint Lesson 1 ==
Open MS Paint


First you setup the computer;
*Change the screen resolution to 800 x 600.
*Choose the location for saving files.
*Set to view files as thumbnails.
*Change the mouse settings to be less sensitive.
(This will help students who are new to using the mouse, making it easier to select things.)
*Next you put an icon of the Paint program on the desktop.

The students will be learning how to click, drag, and point the mouse. To avoid overwhelming the student we will focus on just those 3 things. We will cover double click, and right click in another lesson. We will also want to focus on only things that can be done when pressing one button at a time. An example is shift key for caps; you should consider not using caps, or using the caps lock. 

===Mini Lesson #1===
#Show how to select the icon and hit enter to open (not double clicking).
#Have them click on the line tool.
#Show how to drag to make a line.
#Demonstrate picking a color from the palette.
#Show the circle tool (ellipse tool).
#Let them have fun.
Watch for anyone having trouble, and be ready to answer any questions.

Next we show how to save;
#Click on file.
#Click save.
#Choose a name.
#Type it in.
#Click save.
#Show how to close the Window (using the X).

Congratulate everyone on completing the first (mini) lesson.

===Mini lesson #2===

Have everyone start again, on their own as much as possible.
Show the pencil tool and have the students see what all the tools below it do.
*spray paint (airbrush)
*line
*rectangle
*oval (ellipse)
Kids can easily remember these tools because the icons have simple representations of what the tool does.

Tell the students they can draw a picture for the computer. This will give you some time to help and reassure those who need it.
#make sure everyone has saved their picture
#click on 'file'
#click on 'save as background image centered'

Now their work of art is the center of attention on the computer. This should bring their focus from the paint program to other parts of the computer.

== Paint Lesson 2 ==
Check the settings are suitable to your needs, just as in Paint Lesson 1. 

#Have everyone open Paint by double clicking on the icon. 
#Show the Brush and demonstrate the options (shapes and sizes).
#Have the students draw with the diagonal brush so they can see the ribbon effect.
#Explain how most tools have options in the same place.
#Let them look at the tools and options and try them out.
You might have them find how many don't have options (pencil, fill tool, eyedropper). Let the students get comfortable using them to see what happens. 

Most of the options are related to size making it easier to understand.

For now we will move on to explain edit options starting with undo.
#Show how to undo from the edit menu and let everyone practice.
#Show how it will only go back 3 times.
#Demonstrate redo, and how it is the opposite of undo.

End the lesson by having everyone save their pictures and make it the background image.

==Paint Lesson 3==
You should begin by teaching anything you may have skipped in from the past lessons. Next you should cover the text tool

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[wikipedia:en:Drug prohibition|Drug prohibition]] is a set of policies which outlaw the possession, use, manufacture and/or distribution of drugs.  In most countries, prohibited drugs include heroin, cocaine, marijuana and LSD.

:'''Supporters''' believe that drug prohibition is a morally acceptable and/or efficacious way to reduce drug abuse
:'''Opponents''' believe drug prohibition is a morally unacceptable and/or ineffective way to reduce drug abuse

Both of these positions rely on the premise that drug abuse is harmful to the individual abusers and/or society in general.

==Arguments in support==

===Crime===

Drug prohibition reduces the rates of drug addiction and thus reduces drug-related crime such as robbery.

:''This argument relies on the assumption that drug prohibition has reduced drug abuse.''
:''This argument relies on the assumption that drug addiction causes crime drug abuse.''

===Marketing===

Legalized drugs would be sold by large corporations that may use irresponsible advertising to encourage risky and addictive behaviors.

====Counterpoint====

Prohibited drugs are currently sold by black market distributors who do not monitor purity and resort to outright violence in trade disputes, in addition to promoting their product to non-users.  Corporations could be more easily held to standards of purity and ethical conduct than a vast network of black market distributors.

====Socialist view====

Legalized drugs could be produced and managed by the state and done in such a manner as to eliminate advertising and reduce overall use.

===Protect individuals===

Drug abuse causes harm to the individuals and their family and friends, and society in general.  It is the responsibility of the government to prevent that.
:''This argument relies on the premise that drug abuse is harmful to the individual abusers and/or society in general.''
:''This argument relies on the premise that the government has the right and responsibility to limit individual rights in this case.''
:''This argument relies on the assumption that drug prohibition has reduced drug abuse.''

===Setting an example===

Allowing the legal use of drugs like heroin and cocaine will provide a negative role model for children and thus cause an increase in drug abuse.
:''This argument relies on the factual claim that legalizing drugs will cause an increase in drug abuse.''

==Argument in opposition==

===Black Market===
''[[wikipedia:en:Black Market|Black Market]]'': the trade in prohibited goods

Much of the harm caused by drug abuse comes from the unregulated market for drugs.  There is no legal incentive for manufacturers and distributors to ensure the safety of their product or rely on honest, peaceful transactions with customers and rivals.  If drugs were legalized, this black market would disappear, reducing the funding considerably for organized crime including terrorism, Mafia and street gangs.

:''This argument relies on the claim that organized crime is funded by the drug trade.''

===Drug costs===

Legalizing drugs would drastically reduce their cost.  Thus, addicts could afford their habit without resorting to violence and robbery.

===Efficacy===

Because drug prohibition has not proven effective in reducing the rate of drug abuse, it is time to try a different approach, such as a wide variety of harm reduction proposals.

:''This argument relies on the claim that drug prohibition has not reduced drug abuse rates.

===Personal freedom===

The government does not have the right to limit a person's choices regarding drug use.

===Racism===
Drug prohibition was founded based on racism, and remains racist in practice.

:''This argument relies on the premise that drug prohibition policies are racist in implementation and design.''

===Tax revenue===

Legalizing drugs would grant a major new stream of tax revenue for the government.

===Federal Marriage Amendment===
''Wikipedia article: [[wikipedia:en:Federal Marriage Amendment|Federal Marriage Amendment]]''

The Federal Marriage Amendment is a proposed [[wikipedia:en:Constitutional amendment|Amendment to the United States Constitution]] that would legislate the nature of marriage, so that it is limited to occurring between one man and one woman.  The Amendment would override any state law that contradicts it, and could be changed only through the passage of another Amendment.

The Federal Marriage Amendment is generally supported more by the Republican Party.  Nevertheless, there are Democrats and member of other leftist parties who also support it, as well as Republicans and other rightist parties who do not.  Opposition can be inspired either by a belief that same-sex marriage should be allowed, or by a philosophy that the Amendment would needlessly overrule states rights.

Those who believe in states rights on the same-sex marriage issue do so on the principle that the populations of individual states should be allowed to organize their society and culture in whatever way fits their ideals and morals.  One potentially divisive issue, however, is whether other states and communities must recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere.  According to the US Constitution's [[wikipedia:en:Full Faith and Credit clause|Full Faith and Credit clause]], marriages performed legally in one state must be recognized throughout the nation.  The [[wikipedia:en:Defense of Marriage Act|Defense of Marriage Act]], a bill signed into law in 1996 by Democratic President [[wikipedia:en:Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton]], explicitly grants states the right to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages.  Some of the support for the Federal Marriage Amendment comes from those who believe that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional because it grants an exception to the full faith and credit clause.

Some opponents of the Federal Marriage Amendment have pointed out that the Amendment would be the only binding Amendment to limit the freedom of citizens.  The [[wikipedia:en:18th Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], which banned alcohol during [[wikipedia:en:Prohibition|Prohibition]], was also passed, but has been repealed by the [[wikipedia:en:21st Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]].  The [[wikipedia:en:Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd]] and [[wikipedia:en:Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution|16th Amendment]] could also be seen as curtailing freedoms in establishing a two-term limit for Presidents and instituting a graduated [[wikipedia:en:Income tax|income tax]], respectively.

===Civil unions===
''Wikipedia article: [[wikipedia:en:Civil union|Civil Union]]

The state of Vermont does not allow same-sex marriages, but does allow same-sex &quot;civil unions&quot;.  These grant most of the same rights as marriage.  Opposition to civil unions occurs from both Supporters and Opponents; Supporters believe it is a form of &quot;second-class citizenship&quot; (that is, discrimination) and Opponents believe it is, for all intents and purposes, equivalent to marriage and is opposable on the same grounds.  Those who support civil unions include Opponents who object to same-sex marriage on traditional grounds&amp;mdash;that ''marriage'' is a heterosexual institution by definition, but that same-sex couples should be able to receive the same benefits for their own unions&amp;mdash;and Supporters who believe that civil unions are practically identical to marriage.

==Discrimination==

'''Supporters:''' The refusal to extend marriage to homosexual couples is inherently unfairly discriminatory and a violation of the [[wikipedia:en:Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], which guarantees equal treatment under the law.  There are more than 1,000 laws which apply differently depending on an individual's marital status.  These extend from trivial facts, such as that a gay president's lover would not be protected by the Secret Service, to complex issues concerning the release of financial and medical information, hospital visitation rights, taxes, wills, child custody, alimony, and Fifth Amendment rights.

'''Opponents:''' The 14th Amendment does not apply because a person's homosexual behavior is a choice.  The government is not obliged to recognize all choices as of equal validity. (''This is part of the [[wikipedia:en:Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture debate]].'')

===Libertarian View===

The United States Libertarian Party, and some persons from Democratic, Republican, other, or no parties, have an opinion different from both Supporters and non-Supporters.

'''Libertarians:''' The government has no authority to recognize any marriage.  There are over 1,000 legal rights granted to heterosexual couples should not be granted. For example, the tax code should not treat married couples differently than unmarried couples.  The government should not compel hospitals to allow any individual access to patients or medical records, except in accordance with that hospital's policy.  Individuals can choose to cohabitate, and can declare themselves married, or perform a ceremony.  It is up to individuals to choose, according to their own beliefs, whether to recognize any such marriage.

==Views==

===Parties===

*[[Voter's Guide/United States/Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]: Opposed to same-sex marriage but in favor of civil unions
*[[Voter's Guide/United States/Republican Party|Republican Party]]: Opposed to same-sex marriage and civil unions
*[[Voter's Guide/United States/Green Party|Green Party]]: Supports same-sex marriage
*[[Voter's Guide/United States/Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party]]: Supports the Libertarian View (see above)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===== This wikibook needs your help with; =====
*Teaching tips even basic ones.
*Lesson plans/lesson outlines.
*Organizing the information.
*Changing to multiple pages at some point.

===== A little more about me and this project =====
I'm Eric, and I started this wikibook because I've offered to volunteer teaching computer classes. Classes should start when school is out. They are still cutting through the red tape, and I am not sure if I will get the chance. I didn't realize that non-profit organizations had so much red tape. Anyway I practiced the lessons with my nephews 7 and 4 years old. But they are already familiar with a mouse, hopefully it doesn't skew my test results too much.

I tried to find some public domain material on the subject but came up with nothing, and so this book was started. I started with paint because I know it well. It does keep the interest of kids. As a native windows program you can teach some windows fundamentals. Simplified kids software is great but you can't teach what isn't there.

The organization I've offered to volunteer for says they have Microsoft Office. So far I'm not sure what is going to get teenagers interested in Microsoft Office. Any ideas please click 'edit this page'. Thanks for taking the time to read this, hopefully you find this book useful.

== A few comments ==
1) I think we should either rename the article or perhaps expand its scope to non-windows machines.
2) I hope to make some of my own contributions, and maybe expand this beyond paint.
3) Is this really a worthwhile book? There are other, much more complete books on the same topic.
4) Anyone else still interested?

==== Wordpad ====
My name is Hall, I'm a computer teacher for both primary and secondary schools. I have found that Wordpad is a great program to teach beginners about word processing, keyboard skills and file management. The interface in wordpad is like a cutdown version of MSWord (without going to the trouble of customising the MS word interface), which helps the student focus on key skills, reduces choice/mistake anxiety, and helps the transition to a &quot;real&quot; Word Pocessor. I have about 3 lessons written up (if I can find them). If Eric wants to set up the chapters I'll paste them in.

== Setting up Wordpad lessons ==

I would be glad to set up the Wordpad lesson. You can leave what you have in this talk page. Thanks, Eric

== Timing ==
A helpful element for this book would be suggested/expected time that the lessons would take. I might offer this myself after trying some of it out today at a primary school in Newtown, Basseterre, St. Kitts today.

== Not Paint, but WORD or rtf ==

The subject is presented well, but I teach Senior Citizens! I therefore prefer a TEXT program to start with, such as WORD since that makes immediate connection to the SC students.
Easy to start them off with typing their life history for their grandchildren. Alternately, start them playing card games, which they often already know, but gives them plenty of opportunity to use the mouse, especially at home away from the classroom.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The US-led coalition invaded Iraq and are occupying it.  There are two broad areas of dispute:
:The evidence that an attack was necessary
:The handling of the invasion and subsequent occupation

==Justification for the attack==

===International Law===
*According to international law, an attack on another country is illegal unless approved by the security council.  The USA was unable to provide this approval.  

*The USA frequently condemn the military actions of other countries when they act without security council approval.  Failing to lead by example will diminish the USA's credibility in the eyes of other countries as a law abiding moral state.

===Humanitarian principles===

*[[wikipedia:en:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] was a tyrant who ruled over Iraq with a reign of terror and murder, committing acts that amount to [[wikipedia:en:genocide|genocide]].  Therefore, invading Iraq to install a more peaceful regime was an act of kindness and benevolence.

:''This argument relies on the [[../Murder|premise that murder is]] wrong.''
:''This argument relies on the premise that democracy is morally superior to tyrannical regimes.''
:''This argument relies on the claim that the government of Saddam Hussein was murderous and dictatorial.''
:''This argument relies on the claim that the invasion is not murder itself:  See War is murder.

====Counterpoint====

*Many governments in the world are dictatorial and sometimes even genocidal.  Saddam Hussein's capacity to harm both his own people and his neighbors was so severely harmed by UN sanctions that he posed little threat to anyone, and was in any case less dangerous than many other dictators around the world.  Thus, the invasion was not warranted because other countries represented a bigger threat to world peace and stability.

:''This argument relies on the [[../Human Rights|premise that there are extant governments that routinely violate]] human rights.''
:''This argument relies on the premise that UN sanctions on Iraq worked to reduce Saddam Hussein's military capacity and threat to the world.

===Iminent threat===

*The invasion of Iraq was warranted because Iraq posed an imminent threat to the safety and well-being of the United States and other countries.

:''This argument relies on the premise that Saddam Hussein's government represented a threat to world peace.''
:''This argument relies on the premise that the safety and well-being of the United States and other countries are important.''

===Aid to al-Qaeda===

*Saddam Hussein had ties to [[wikipedia:en:al-Qaeda|al-Qaeda]], a [[wikipedia:en:terrorist|terrorist]] organization that threatened the United States and other countries and has masterminded several major terrorist attacks.

:''This argument relies on the claim that Saddam Hussein's government had ties to al-Qaeda.
:''This argument relies on the claim that terrorism, and al-Qaeda specifically, remains a major threat to peace in the United States and other countries.''

====Weapons of Mass Destruction====

*Saddam Hussein represented a threat because he had [[wikipedia:en:Weapon of Mass Destruction|Weapons of Mass Destruction]], or had the desire and ability to acquire them.

:''This argument relies on the premise that Iraq was in possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
:''This argument relies on the premise that Iraq had no right to possess Weapons of Mass Destruction.

===Middle-Eastern stability===

===Oil===

==Execution of invasion and occupation==

===Civilian casualties===

===Insurgency===

===Predictions===

= Newtonian Gravitation =
[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Isaac Newton]]
All objects on Earth are pulled downward, towards the ground. This phenomenon is called '''gravity'''. Every object falls just as fast as any other object (unless the air slows it down like a feather, or pushes it up like a balloon), as first shown by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo Galileo].
In 1687 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton Isaac Newton] stated that gravity is not restricted to the Earth, but instead, there is gravity everywhere in the universe. Newton explained that planets, moons, and comets move in orbits because of the effect of gravity.</text>

= Properties =

Gravitational attraction is a force and therefore must be described by a vector - so remember magnitude and direction.
The force due to gravity acts between ''any'' two objects with mass. To determine the magnitude of the force we use the following equation:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |    (9.1)
|}

This equation describes the force between two bodies, one of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the other of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (both have units of kilograms, or kg for short). The ''G'' is Newton's`Gravitational Constant' (6.673&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;11&lt;/sup&gt; N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;kg&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''r'' is the straight line distance between the two bodies in meters.

This means the bigger the masses, the greater the force between them. Simply put, big things matter
big with gravity. The 1/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; factor (or you may prefer to say ''r''&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) tells
us that the distance between the two bodies plays a role as well. The closer two bodies are, the
stronger the gravitational force between them is. We feel the gravitational attraction of the Earth
most at the surface since that is the closest we can get to it, but if we were in outer-space,
we would barely even know the Earth's gravity existed! 

Remember that 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=ma\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |    (9.2)
|}

which means that every object on the earth feels the same gravitational acceleration! That means
whether you drop a pen or a book (from the same height), they will both take the same length of time to hit the ground... in fact they will be head to head for the entire fall if you drop them at the
same time. We can show this easily by using the two equations above (9.1 and 9.2). The force between the Earth (which has the mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) and
an object of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=\frac{G m_o m_e}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |     (9.3)
|}

and the acceleration of an object of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; (in terms of the force acting on it) is

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a_o=\frac{F}{m_o}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |     (9.4)
|}

So we substitute equation (9.3) into equation (9.4), and we find that

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a_o=\frac{G m_e}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |     (9.5)
|}

Since it doesn't matter what ''m''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is, this tells us that the acceleration on a body (due to the Earth's gravity) 
does not depend on the mass of the body. Thus all objects feel the same gravitational acceleration. The force on different bodies will be
different but the acceleration will be the same. Due to the fact that this acceleration caused by gravity is the same on all objects we label it differently,
instead of using ''a'' we use ''g'' which we call the gravitational acceleration.</text>

= Mass and Weight =

Weight is a force which is measured in Newtons, it is the force on an object due to gravity. People are always asking other people &quot;What is your weight?&quot; when a physicist might ask the same question as &quot;What is your mass?&quot;.

Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and is the amount of matter in an object, it doesn't change unless you add or remove matter from the object (if you continue to study physics through to university level, you will find that Einstein's theory of relativity means that mass can change when you travel as fast as light does, but you don't need to worry about that right now). There are 1000 g in 1 kg and 1000 kg in a tonne.

To change mass into weight we use Newton's 2nd Law which is &lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;. The weight is the force and gravity the acceleration, it can be rewritten as:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W=mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |    (9.2)
|}


''W'' is the weight, measured in newtons. ''m'' is the mass, measured in kilograms and ''g''
is the acceleration due to gravity, measured in metres per second squared; it is equal to about 10 on the Earth. The exact value of Earths equatorial surface gravity is 9.7801 &lt;math&gt;m.s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
1. A bag of sugar has a mass of 1 kg, what is it's weight? (Acceleration due to gravity = 10 &lt;math&gt;m.s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;)

Step 1: 
Always write out the equation, it helps you to understand the question, and you will get marks as well.
{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W=mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.7)
|}

Step 2: Fill in all the values you know. (remember to make sure the mass is in kilograms and NOT in grams or tonnes!)

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = 1 \times 10\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;W =  10&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.8)
|}

Step 3: Write out the answer remembering to include the units! You will lose marks if you don't

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = 10 \ newtons\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.9)
|}


2. A space-man has a mass of 90 kg, what is his weight (a) on the earth? (b) on the moon? (c) in outer space? (The acceleration due to gravity on the earth is 10 &lt;math&gt;m.s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, on the moon gravity is about 1/6 of the gravity on earth).

1:
{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W=mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = 90 \times 10 = 900\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;W = 900 \ newtons&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.10)
|}

2:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;W = M \ g&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = 90 \times  \ 10  \times \frac{1}{6} = 150 \end{matrix}	&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;W = 150 \ newtons&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |(9.10)
|}


3: Weightless in outer space because ''g'' = 0.

So now when somebody asks you your weight, you know to reply ``Anything!! But my mass is a different matter!&quot;</text>

If you put a book on a table, it does not accelerate; it just lies on the table. We know that gravity is acting on it with a force 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F= G\frac{m_Em_{book}}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.12)
|}

but if there is a net force there MUST be an acceleration and there isn't. This means that the gravitational force is being balanced by
another force [Newton's third law!].

This force we call the normal force. It is the reaction force between the book and the table. It is equal to the force of
gravity on the book. This is also the force we measure when we measure the weight of something.

The most interesting and illustrative normal force question, that is often asked, has to do with a scale in a lift. Using Newton's
third law we can solve these problems quite easily. 

When you stand on a scale to measure your weight you are pulled down by gravity. There is no acceleration downwards because there
is a reaction force we call the normal force acting upwards on you. This is the force that the scale would measure. If the
gravitational force were less than the reading on the scale would be less.

==Worked Example 53 Normal Forces 1==

'''Question:''' A man weighing 100''kg'' stands on a scale (measuring newtons). What is the reading on the scale?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him. 

Step 2 : 

The scale measures the normal force on the man. This is the force that balances gravity. 

Step 3 : 

Firstly we determine the net force acting downwards on the man due to gravity.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_g&amp;=&amp;mg \\&amp;=&amp; 100kg\times 9.8\frac{m}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980\frac{kgm}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980N\ downwards \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

We now know the gravitational force downwards. We also know that there must be a reactionary force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; upwards. To determine
the magnitude of this we use newton's laws again. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant acceleration times
the mass. The overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is 0. if we write out the equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_r&amp;=&amp;F_g+F_N \\0 &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\F_N = 980N\ upwards\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The normal force is then 980''N'' upwards. It exactly balances the gravitational force downwards so there is no net force and no
acceleration on the man.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Now we are going to add things to exactly the same problem to show how things change slightly. We will now move to a lift moving at
constant velocity. Remember if velocity is constant then acceleration is zero.

==Worked Example 55 Normal Forces 2==

'''Question:''' A man weighing 100''kg'' stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift accelerating downwards at &lt;math&gt;2\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;. What is the reading on the scale?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 
We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him. 

Step 2 : 

The scale measures the normal force on the man.

Step 3 : 

Firstly we determine the net force acting downwards on the man due to gravity.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_g&amp;=&amp;mg \\&amp;=&amp; 100kg\times 9.8\frac{m}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980\frac{kgm}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980N\ downwards \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

We now know the gravitational force downwards. We also know that there must be a reactionary force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; upwards. To determine
the magnitude of this we use newton's laws again. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant acceleration times
the mass. The overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is &lt;math&gt;2\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;. if we write out the equation: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_r&amp;=&amp;F_g+F_N \\100kg\times (-2)\frac{m}{s^2} &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\-200\frac{kgm}{s^2} &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\-200N &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\F_N = 780N\ upwards\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The normal force is then 780''N'' upwards. It balances the gravitational force downwards just enough so that the man only
accelerates downwards at &lt;math&gt;2\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;. 

==Worked Example 56 Normal Forces 3==

'''Question:''' A man weighing 100''kg'' stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift accelerating upwards at &lt;math&gt;4\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;&gt;. What is the reading on the scale? 

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 
We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him. 

Step 2 : 

The scale measures the normal force on the man.

Step 3 : 

Firstly we determine the net force acting downwards on the man due to gravity.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_g&amp;=&amp;mg \\&amp;=&amp; 100kg\times 9.8\frac{m}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980\frac{kgm}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 980N\ downwards \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

We now know the gravitational force downwards. We also know that there must be a reactionary force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; upwards. To determine
the magnitude of this we use newton's laws again. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant acceleration times
the mass. The overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is &lt;math&gt;4\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;. if we write out the equation: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_r&amp;=&amp;F_g+F_N \\100kg\times (4)\frac{m}{s^2} &amp;=&amp; -980N+F_N\\400\frac{\mbox{kg} \cdot \mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}^2} &amp;=&amp; -980 \mbox{ N}+F_N\\400\mbox{ N} &amp;=&amp; -980 \mbox{ N}+F_N\\F_N = 1380 \mbox{ N}\ upwards\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The normal force is then 1380 N upwards. It balances the gravitational force and then in addition applies sufficient force
to accelerate the man upwards at  &lt;math&gt;4\frac{m}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

= Comparative problems =

Here always work with multiplicative factors to find something new in terms of something old.

==Worked Example 57 Comparative Problem 1==
'''Question:''' On Earth a man weighs 700 N. Now if the same man was instantaneously beamed to the planet Zirgon, which has the
same size as the Earth but twice the mass, what would he weigh?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We start with the situation on earth:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = mg = G\frac{m_Em}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.13)
|}



Step 2 : 

Now we consider the provje

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{m_Zm}{r_Z^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.14)
|}

but we know that &lt;math&gt;m_Z = 2m_E&lt;/math&gt; and we know that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r'' so we could
write the equation again and substitute these relationships in:

Step 3 : 

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{(m_Z)m}{(r_Z)^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.15)
|}

Step 4 : 

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{(2m_E)m}{(r)^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.16)
|}


{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= 2( G\frac{(m_E)m}{(r)^2})\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.17)
|}

Step 5 : 

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= 2(W)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.18)
|}

so on Zirgon he weighs 1400 N.

== Principles ==

* Write out first case
* Write out all relationships between variable from first and second case
* Write out second case
* Substitute all first case variables into second case
* Write second case in terms of first case

|The acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface is, by
convention, equal to 9.80665 ''ms''&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. (The actual value varies
slightly over the surface of the Earth). This quantity is known as
''g''. The following is a list of the gravitational accelerations (in
multiples of ''g'') at the surfaces of
each of the planets in our solar system:

==Worked Example 58 Comparative Problem 2==
'''Question:''' On Earth a man weighs 70 kg. On the planet Beeble how much will he weigh if Beeble has mass half of that of the Earth and a radius one quarter that of the earth.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

We start with the situation on earth:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = mg = G\frac{m_Em}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.19)
|}

Step 2 : 

Now we consider the provje

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_B= mg_B = G\frac{m_Bm}{r_B^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.20)
|}

but we know that &lt;math&gt;m_Z = \frac{1}{2}m_E&lt;/math&gt; and we know that &lt;math&gt;r_Z = \frac{1}{4}r&lt;/math&gt; so we could write the equation again and substitute these relationships in:

Step 3 : 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{(m_Z)m}{(r_Z)^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.21)
|}

Step 4 : 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= mg_Z = G\frac{(\frac{1}{2}m_E)m}{(\frac{1}{4}r)^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.22)
|}

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= 8( G\frac{(m_E)m}{(r)^2})\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.23)
|}

Step 5 : 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_Z= 8(W)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

But although the man exerts 8 times as much force due to gravity, he still weighs 70 kg on Beeble!

= Falling bodies =

Objects on the earth fall because there is a gravitation force between them and the earth - which results in an acceleration - as we saw above.
So if you hold something in front of you and let it go - it will fall.

It falls because of an acceleration toward the centre of the earth which results from the gravitational force between the two.

These bodies move in a straight line from the point where they start to the centre of the earth. This means we can reuse everything we learnt
in rectilinear motion. the only thing that needs thinking about is the directions we are talking about.

We need to choose either up or down as positive just like we had to choose a positive direction in standard rectilinear motion problems. this is the
hardest part. If you can do rectilinear motion you can do falling body problems. Just remember the acceleration they feel is constant and because
of gravity - but once you have chosen your directions you can forget that gravity has anything to do with the problem - all you have is a rectilinear
motion problem with a constant acceleration!!

What is the weight of a free falling body ? Would you be surprised to know that it is zero ?

Weight is measured using a spring balance. (Mass is measured using a physical balance). When a body is falling, the spring balance to which it is attached (the spring balance needs to fall along with the body too !) would show zero weight. When the body stops falling, then it would exert a force on the spring (equivalent to the force exerted by earth on itself) and hence it would show a reading.</text>

= Terminal Velocity =

Physics is all about being simple - all we do is look at the world around us and notice how it really works. It is the one thing everyone is qualified
to do - we spend most of our time when we are really young experimenting to find out how things work.

Take a book - wave it in the air - change the angle and direction. what happens of course there is resistance. different angles make it greater - the faster
the book moves the greater it is. The bigger the area of the book moving in the direction of motion the greater the force.

So we know that air resistance exists! it is a force. So what happens when an object falls? of course there is air resistance - or drag
as it is normally called. There is an approximate formula for the drag force as well.

The important thing to realise is that when the drag force and the gravitational force are equal for a falling body there is no net force
acting on it - which means no net acceleration. That does not mean it does not move - but it means that its speed does not change.

It falls at a constant velocity! This velocity is called terminal velocity.</text>

= Drag force =

The actual force of air resistance is quite complicated. Experiment by moving a book through the air with the face of the book and then the side of
the book forward, you will agree that the area of the book makes a difference as to how much you must work in order to move the book at the same speed in
both cases. This is why racing cars are slim-lined in design, and not shaped like a big box!

Get a plastic container lid (or anything waterproof) swing it around in air and then try to swing it around under water. The density of the water is much
larger than the air, making you have to work harder at swinging the lid in water. This is why boats and submarines are a lot slower than aeroplanes!

So we know that density, area and speed all play a role in the drag force.The expression we use for drag force is

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}D=\frac{1}{2}C\rho Av^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(9.25)
|}


where ''C'' is a constant which depends on the object and fluid interactions, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density, ''A'' is the area and ''v'' is the velocity.</text>

This article seems to contradict much of what is written in the Tigon wikipedia article. - anon

the article on Ligers and Tigons is an informative one and should not be deleted.
Hybrids exist in many species, that is a fact and one that most children should have no trouble understanding. Frankly I fail to understand the logic behind deleting a page because most adults have not heard of the content.. isn't that what information books are all about, informing us? Pabsy.

This page is informative and I can see no reason to delete it from the book. Hybrids happen in many species and my children have no trouble understanding that fact. Frankly i fail to understand the logic in deleting a page on the grounds that a reader has never heard of the content or that the content could confuse a child. isn't that what information books are all about.. informing us?
oh come on... why stop at deleting a page on hybrid cats?, children are confused with Algebra, logarithms, times tables... lets delete the lot..simple.

: Are you sure that lions and tigers can cross-breed? Do they even co-exist anywhere? Visit [http://uncyclopedia.org Uncyclopedia] - you will absolutely love it. [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 8 July 2005 12:52 (UTC)

== Merger ==
Content to make an entire book on Tigons and Ligers is quite frankly absurd.  This section should be merged into the WikiJunior Book of Lions or Tigers.

== Confusing ==

&quot;Due to conservation efforts, deliberate hybridization is prohibited in most zoos. However, it happens regularly by accident, and some private breeders try to breed ligers for novelty purposes.&quot;

I am 12, I find this confusing: deliberate hybridization, novelty purposes, conservation efforts. &quot;Not allowed&quot; is probably more understandable than &quot;prohibited&quot;. &quot;Owners&quot; might be easier than &quot;private breeders.&quot;

&quot;They are instinctively social animals. Tigers, on the other hand, are instinctively solitary. The offspring of a lion-tiger share the conflicting instincts of both their parents.&quot;

I would say this sentence like this-

&quot;Lions naturally like to live together in groups, but tigers like to live by themselves.&quot; (The second sentence doesn't make any sense to me.)

&quot;Ligers were originally assumed to be sterile, which is true for most hybrid species such as the mule (a cross between a horse and a donkey). However, females can be fertile.&quot;

I thought &quot;sterile&quot; meant clean, but my father told me that it means that they can't have babies. I guess that &quot;fertile&quot; means they can.

== Illustrations ==

This article is crying out for photographs.  Unfortunately our options are a bit limited.  All the hybrid pictures on commons reside in [[commons:Category:Pantherinae]] ([[commons:Category:Hybrid Cats]] is just a partial duplicate).  Our options look to be:

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tigon1.jpg|2005 tigon
Image:Tigon2.jpg
Image:Tigon3.jpg
Image:Tigon4.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The last tigon picture is ok, but the rest leave a lot to be desired, especially for a kids book.  I'm still looking for more free images, but I'm not holding my breath on this one.  What do you folks think?  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 08:37, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Essay 3: Pressure and Forces'''

Author: Asogan Moodaly

Asogan Moodaly received his Bachelor of Science degree (with honours) in Mechanical Engineering from the University
of Natal, Durban in South Africa. For his final year design project he worked on a 3-axis filament winding machine for composite (Glass
re-enforced plastic in this case) piping. He worked in Vereeniging, Gauteng at Mine Support Products (a subsidiary of Dorbyl Heavy
Engineering) as the design engineer once he graduated. He currently lives in the Vaal Triangle area and is working for Sasol Technology
Engineering as a mechanical engineer, ensuring the safety and integrity of equipment installed during projects.

=Pressure and Forces=

In the mining industry, the roof (hangingwall) tends to drop as the face of the tunnel (stope) is excavated for rock containing gold.

As one can imagine, a roof falling on one's head is not a nice prospect! Therefore the roof needs to be supported.

[[Image:Fhsst_press1.png|363px|]]

The roof is not one big uniform chunk of rock. Rather it is broken up into smaller chunks. It is assumed that the biggest chunk of rock
in the roof has a mass of less than 20 000 kg therefore each support has to be designed to resist a force related to that mass.
The strength of the material (either wood or steel) making up the support is taken into account when working out the minimum required
size and thickness of the parts to withstand the force of the roof.

[[Image:Fhsst_press2.png|363px|]]

Sometimes the design of the support is such that the support needs to withstand the rock mass without the force breaking the roof..

Therefore hydraulic supports (hydro = water) use the principles of force and pressure such that as a force is exerted on the support,
the water pressure increases. A pressure relief valve then squirts out water when the pressure (and thus the force) gets too large.
Imagine a very large, modified doctor's syringe.

[[Image:Fhsst_press3.png|363px|]]

In the petrochemical industry, there are many vessels and pipes that are under high pressures. A vessel is a containment unit (Imagine a
pot without handles, that has the lid welded to the pot that would be a small vessel) where chemicals mix and react to form other
chemicals, amongst other uses.

[[Image:Fhsst_press4.png|335px|]]

The end product chemicals are sold to companies that use these chemicals to make shampoo, dishwashing liquid, plastic containers,
fertilizer, etc. Anyway, some of these chemical reactions require high temperatures and pressures in order to work. These pressures
result in forces being applied to the insides of the vessels and pipes. Therefore the minimum thickness of the pipe and vessels walls
must be determined using calculations, to withstand these forces. These calculations take into account the strength of the material
(typically steel, plastic or composite), the diameter and of course the pressure inside the equipment.</text>

== Non Si Units for pressure ==
'''PSI:''' PSI stands for pounds per square inch. One PSI is equal to 6,894.76 Pascals

'''Atm:''' Atm stands for Atmosphere. This is the atmospheric pressure at sea level. I atm is equal to 101,325 Pascals

===Hydrostatic pressure (head pressure)===
Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure due to the weight of a fluid.
:&lt;math&gt;
p = \rho g h\,
&lt;/math&gt;
where:

* ρ (rho) is the density of the fluid (i.e., the practical density of fresh water is 1000 kg/m3);
* g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s2 on earth's surface);
* h is the height of the fluid column (in metres). Other units can be used if the rest of the units used in the equation are defined in a consistent way. 

It is important to realize that air is a fluid. This equation can be used to find the pressure created by air.  This also means that if we are trying to find the pressure of a liquid open to the atmosphere, we must add in the atmospheric pressure to the pressure of the liquid to find the total pressure.

==Notes==
===1===
Pressure is force divided by area, so in a sense it does have a direction as force has a direction.  The term pseudovector is sometimes used for such quantities.</text>

= Thermal Properties of Materials = R

== Specific heat capacity ==
Conversion of macroscopic energy to microscopic kinetic energy thus tends to raise the temperature, while the reverse conversion lowers it. It is easy to show experimentally that the amount of heating needed to change the temperature of a body by some amount is proportional to the amount of matter in the body. Thus, it is natural to write

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta Q=MC\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(23.4)
|}

'''Riaan Note: not sure about the equation numbers, sticking to those in the PDF released the 1st of March 2005'''

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of material, &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of energy transferred to the material, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the change of the material's temperature. The quantity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called the specific heat of the material in question and is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of a unit mass of material one degree in temperature. &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; varies with the type of material. Values for common materials are given in table 22.2.

== Specific latent heat ==
When a material changes phases from solid to liquid, or from liquid to gas, a certain amount of energy is involved in this change of space.

== Internal energy ==

== First law of thermodynamics ==

We now address some questions of terminology. The use of the terms ''heat''  and ''quantity of heat'' to indicate the amount of microscopic kinetic energy inhabiting a body has long been out of favor due to their association with the discredited ''caloric'' theory of heat. Instead, we use the term internal energy to describe the amount of microscopic energy in a body. The word heat is most correctly used only as a verb, e. g.,  ''to heat the house'' . Heat thus represents the transfer of internal energy from one body to another or conversion of some other form of energy to internal energy. Taking into account these definitions, we can express the idea of energy conservation in some material body by the equation


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = \Delta Q - \Delta W&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (first law of thermodynamics)
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; is the change in internal energy resulting from the addition of heat &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q&lt;/math&gt; to the body and the work &lt;math&gt;\Delta W&lt;/math&gt; done by the body on the outside world. This equation expresses the first law of thermodynamics. Note that the sign conventions are inconsistent as to the direction of energy flow. However, these conventions result from thinking about heat engines, i. e., machines which take in heat and put out macroscopic work. Examples of heat engines are steam engines, coal and nuclear power plants, the engine in your automobile, and the engines on jet aircraft.</text>

= Electrostatics =
The study of the effects of static charges. These charges are produced by too many or too few electrons. Electrons, in turn, are the most movable charge forms, and are found spread around the positive charge in the nucleus of the atom.
If there are too few electrons, a positive charge will appear. If there are too many, a negative charge will appear. If the charges are in balance, then no charge is detected.
The electron is a fundamental particle,and has interesting characteristics, besides the charge, it spins, and this spin gives rise to a magnetic field, much like an electric motor.

The decision to call some charges positive and others negative was ''arbitrary''. This gives rise to a potential misunderstanding when charges are moving in a circuit. This will be deferred to a later section, on electricity.

The fundamental study of these charges in isolation can best be observed by experiment. If we generate a charge by friction, say fur on hard rubber, or silk on glass, we can transfer the charge to a small ball coated with aluminum foil. This ball is held up by a thin thread. Nylon or silk work well.

If however the air is damp, the charge will leak off the metal balls.

Two such balls, charged by the same static source will repel each other. If we use two different sources, they will attract each other. Maybe.

We can measure the amount of attraction or repulsion by a simple means. If we measure the weight of these balls, then we know that they are attracted by the earth. Other forces on these balls will cause them to swing away from hanging straight down. 

By measuring the movement, or the angle, we can figure out what tiny force is pushing the ball away from the vertical. The tangent function is the perfect candidate to resolve this problem. ((add more text and diagrams here))

It would be nice to find out what happens when some charge is removed. It turns out, that if we use a third ball, of the same size as the other two, we can exactly halve the charge.

From this we can see that we can measure the effects of increasing distance, and decreasing charge.</text>

= Charge =

All objects surrounding us (including people!) contain large amounts of electric charge. Charge can be negative or
positive and is measured in units called coulombs (C). Usually, objects contain the same amount of positive
and negative charge so its effect is not noticeable and the object is called electrically neutral. However, if a small imbalance is
created (i.e. there is a little bit more of one type of charge than the other on the object) then the object is said to be
electrically charged.

Some rather amusing examples of what happens when a person becomes charged are for example when you charge your hair by combing it with a
plastic comb and it stands right up on end! Another example is when 
you walk fast over a nylon carpet and then touch a metal doorknob and
give yourself a small shock (alternatively you can touch your friend and shock them!)

Charge has 3 further important properties:

* Charge is always conserved. Charge, just like energy, cannot be created or destroyed.
* Charge comes in discrete packets. The smallest unit of charge is that carried by one electron called the elementary charge, e, and by convention, it has a negative sign ( &lt;math&gt;e = -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \rm {C} &lt;/math&gt; ).
* Charged objects exert electrostatic forces on each other. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

| The word `electron' comes from the Greek word for amber! The ancient Greeks observed that if you rubbed a piece of amber,
you could use it to pick up bits of straw. (Attractive electrostatic force!)
|}


You can easily test the fact that like charges repel and unlike charges attract by doing a very simple experiment. Take a glass
rod and rub it with a piece of silk, then hang it from its middle with a piece string so that it is free to move. If you then bring another
glass rod which you have also charged in the same way next to it, you will see the rod on the string turn away from the rod in your hand
i.e. it is repelled. If, however, you take a plastic rod, rub it with a piece of fur and then bring it close to the rod on the string, you
will see the rod on the string turn towards the rod in your hand i.e. it is attracted!

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost1.png|553px|]]

What actually happens is that when you rub the glass with silk, tiny amounts of negative charge are transferred from the glass onto the
silk, which causes the glass to have less negative charge than positive charge, making it '''positively charged'''. When you
rub the plastic rod with the fur, you transfer tiny amounts of negative charge onto the rod and so it has more negative charge than
positive charge on it, making it '''negatively charged'''.

== Conductors and Insulators ==
Some materials allow charge carriers to move relatively freely through them (e.g. most metals, tap water, the human body) and these materials are called conductors. Other materials, which do not allow the charge carriers to move through them (e.g. plastic, glass), are called non-conductors or
insulators.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Aside: As mentioned above, the basic unit of charge, namely the elementary charge, e, is carried by the electron. In a conducting
material (e.g. copper), when the atoms bond to form the material, some of the outermost, loosely bound electrons become
detached from the individual atoms and so become free to move around. The charge carried by these electrons can move around in the
material! In insulators, there are very few, if any, free electrons and so the charge cannot move around in the material.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


If an excess of charge is put onto an insulator, it will stay where it is put and there will be a concentration of charge in that area on the object. 
However, if an excess of charge is put onto a conductor, the charges of like sign will repel each other and spread out over the surface of the
object. When two conductors are made to touch, the total charge on them is shared between the two. If the two conductors are identical,
then each conductor will be left with half of the total charge.</text>

= Electrostatic Force =

As we now know, charged objects exert a force on one another. If the charges are at rest then this force between them is
known as the electrostatic force. An interesting characteristic of the electrostatic force is that it can be either attractive or repulsive, unlike the
gravitational force which is only ever attractive. The relative charges on the two objects is what determines
whether the force between the charged objects is attractive or repulsive. If the objects have opposite charges they
attract each other, while if their charges are similar they repel each other (e.g. two metal balls which
are negatively charged will repel each other, while a positively charged ball and negatively charged ball will attract one another).

It is this force that determines the arrangement of charge on the surface of conductors. When we place a charge on a spherical
conductor the repulsive forces between the individual like charges cause them to spread uniformly over the surface of the sphere. However, for
conductors with non-regular shape there is a concentration of charge near the point or points of the object.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost3.png|236px|]]

This collection of charge can actually allow charge to leak off the conductor if the
point is sharp enough. It is for this reason that buildings often have a lightning rod on the roof to remove any charge the
building has collected. This minimises the possibility of the building being struck by lightning.

This ''spreading out'' of charge would not occur if we were to place the charge on an insulator since charge cannot move in insulators.

== Coulomb's Law ==

The behaviour of the electrostatic force was studied in detail by Charles Coulomb around 1784. Through his observations he was able to
show that the electrostatic force between any point two point charges is directly proportional to their magnitude and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.
Thus if F is the force, Q1 and Q2 are the charges and R is their distance apart. then the law is summarized as    
                ''' F=(Q1Q2)/(R^2)''' 
                           
where ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the charge on the one point-like object, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the charge on the second, and ''r'' is the distance between the two.
Remember her F is the mutual force that acts on both the charges exerted by one another as in Newtons third law of motion.

The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point-like charges is given by ''Coulomb's Law'':


{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F = k \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (12.1)
|}

and the proportionality constant ''k'' is called the ''electrostatic constant''. We will use the value 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}k=8.99\times10^9 {\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2.}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The value of the electrostatic constant is known to a very high precision (9 decimal places). Not many physical
constants are known to as high a degree of accuracy as ''k''.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Aside: Notice how similar Coulomb's Law is to the form of Newton's
Universal Law of Gravitation between two point-like particles:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_G=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the masses of the two particles, ''r'' is the distance between them, and ''G'' is the gravitational constant. It is
very interesting that Coulomb's Law has been shown to be correct no matter how small the distance, nor how large the charge:
for example it still applies inside the atom (over distances smaller than &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}\rm {m}&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let's run through a simple example of electrostatic forces.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

=== Worked Example 59 Coulomb's Law I===

'''Question:''' Two point-like charges carrying charges of +3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/sup&gt; C and &amp;minus;5&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/sup&gt; C are 2 m apart. 
Determine the magnitude of the force between them and state whether it is attractive or repulsive.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

First draw the situation:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost4.png|329px|]]


Step 2 : 

Is everything in the correct units? Yes, charges are in coulombs [C] and distances in meters [m].

Step 3 : 

Determine the magnitude of the force: Using Coulomb's Law we have

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F &amp;=&amp; k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\\&amp;=&amp; (8.99\times10^{9} {\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2}) \frac{(+3\times10^{-9}{\rm C})(-5\times 10^{-9}{\rm C})}{(2 {\rm m})^2}\\ &amp;=&amp;-\frac{(8.99)(3)(5)}{4}(10^{-9})\frac{(N\cdot m^2/C^2\!\!\!/)(C^2)}{m^2}\\&amp;=&amp; -3.37\times10^{-8} \rm N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus the ''magnitude'' of the force is &lt;math&gt;3.37\times10^{-8}\rm {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The minus sign is a result of the two point charges having opposite signs.

Step 4 : 

Is the force attractive or repulsive? Well, since the two charges are oppositely charged, the force is ''attractive''. We can also
conclude this from the fact that Coulomb's Law gives a negative value for the force.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Next is another example that demonstrates the difference in magnitude between the gravitational force and the electrostatic force.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 60 Coulomb's Law II===
'''Question:''' Determine the electrostatic force and gravitational force between two electrons 1Aring apart (i.e. the forces felt inside an atom)
'''Answer:'''
Å
Step 1 : 

First draw the situation:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost5.png|336px|]]

'''Riaan Note: this image is faulty, recreate'''


Step 2 : 

Get everything into S.I. units: The charge on an electron is &lt;math&gt;-1.60\times10^{-19}\rm C&lt;/math&gt;, the mass of an electron is &lt;math&gt;9.11\times10^{-31}\rm kg&lt;/math&gt;, and 1 &amp;Aring; = &lt;math&gt;1\times10^{-10}\rm m&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3 : 

Calculate the electrostatic force using Coulomb's Law:



&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E&amp;=&amp;k\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}=k\frac{e\cdot e}{1\AA^2}\\&amp;=&amp;(8.99\times10^{9}\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2)\frac{(-1.60\times10^{-19}{\rm C})(-1.60\times10^{-19}\rm C)}{(10^{-10}\rm m)^2}\\&amp;=&amp;2.30\times10^{-8}\rm N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Hence the ''magnitude'' of the electrostatic force between the electrons is &lt;math&gt;2.30\times10^{-8}\rm N&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the electrons carry like charge and from this we know the force must be
repulsive. Another way to see this is that the force is positive and thus repulsive.)

Step 4 : 

Calculate the gravitational force:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E&amp;=&amp;G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}=G\frac{m_e\cdot m_e}{(1\AA)^2}\\&amp;=&amp;(6.67\times10^{-11}{\rm N\cdot m^2/kg^2})\frac{(9.11\times10^{-31}{\rm C})(9.11\times10^{-31}{\rm kg})}{(10^{-10}{\rm m})^2}\\&amp;=&amp;5.54\times10^{-51}{\rm N}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The magnitude of the gravitational force between the electrons is &lt;math&gt;5.54\times10^{-51}\rm N&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Notice that the gravitational force between the electrons is much smaller than the electrostatic force. For this reason, the gravitational
force is usually neglected when determining the force between two charged objects.

We mentioned above that charge placed on a spherical conductor spreads evenly along the surface. As a result, if we are far
enough from the charged sphere, electrostatically, it behaves as a point-like charge. Thus we can treat spherical conductors (e.g. metallic
balls) as point-like charges, with all the charge acting at the centre. 

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 61 Coulomb's Law: Challenge Question===

'''Question:''' In the picture below, X is a small negatively charged sphere with a mass of 10kg. It is suspended from the roof by an insulating rope
which makes an angle of 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; with the roof. Y is a small positively charged sphere which has the same magnitude of charge as X. Y is fixed to the wall by means of an
insulating bracket. Assuming the system is in equilibrium, what is the magnitude of the charge on X?

'''Answer:'''
How are we going to determine the charge on X? Well, if we know the force between X and Y we can use Coulomb's Law to determine their
charges as we know the distance between them. So, firstly, we need to determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force between X and Y.

Step 1 : 

Is everything in S.I. units? The distance between X and Y is &lt;math&gt;50{\rm cm}=0.5\rm m&lt;/math&gt;, and the mass of X is 10kg.

Step 2 : 

Draw the forces on X (with directions) and label.

Step 3 : 

Determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force (''F''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;). Since nothing is moving (system is in equilibrium) the
vertical and horizontal components of the forces must cancel. Thus

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E=T\sin(60^o) \qquad\qquad F_g=T\sin(60^o).\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The only force we know is the gravitational force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''mg''. Now we can calculate the magnitude of ''T'' from above:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T=\frac{F_g}{\sin(60^o)}=\frac{(10{\rm kg})(10\rm m/s^2)}{\sin(60^o)}=1155{\rm N}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Which means that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E=T\cos(60^o)=1154\rm N\cdot \cos(60^o)=577.5\rm N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now that we know the magnitude of the electrostatic force between X and Y, we can calculate their charges using Coulomb's
Law. Don't forget that the magnitudes of the charges on X and Y are the same: &lt;math&gt;|Q_{\rm X}|=|Q_{\rm Y}|&lt;/math&gt;. The magnitude of the
electrostatic force is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_E &amp;=&amp; k\frac{|Q_{\rm X}Q_{\rm Y}|}{r^2}= k\frac{Q_{\rm X}^2}{r^2}\\ |Q_{\rm X}|&amp;=&amp;\sqrt{\frac{F_E r^2}{k}}\\&amp;=&amp;\sqrt{\frac{(577.5{\rm N})(0.5{\rm m})^2}{8.99\times10^{9}{\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2}}}\\&amp;=&amp;1.27\times10^{-4}{\rm C}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Thus the charge on X is &lt;math&gt;-1.27\times10^{-4}{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

= Electric Fields =

We have learnt that objects that carry charge feel forces from all other charged objects. It is useful to determine what the effect of a
charge would be at every point surrounding it. To do this we need some sort of reference.

We know that the force that one charge feels due to another depends on both charges (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). How then can we talk about
forces if we only have one charge? The solution to this dilemma is to introduce a test charge. We then determine the force that would
be exerted on it if we placed it at a certain location. If we do this for every point surrounding a charge we know what would happen if we put a test charge at any location. 

This map of what would happen at any point we call a field map. It is a map of the electric field ''due to a charge''. It tells us how
large the force on a test charge would be and in what direction the force would be.

Our map consists of the lines that tell us how the test charge would move if it were placed there.

== Test Charge ==

This is the key to mapping out an electric field. The equation for the force between two electric charges has been shown earlier and is:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (12.2)
|}

If we want to map the field for ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then we need to know exactly what would happen if we put ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at every point around ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But
this obviously depends on the value of ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a time when we need to agree on a convention. What should ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be when we
make the map? By convention we choose ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = + 1''C''.

This means that if we want to work out the effects on any other charge we only have to multiply the result for the test charge by the
magnitude of the new charge.

The electric field strength is then just the force per unit of charge and has the same magnitude and direction as the force on our
test charge but has different units: 

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E=k\frac{Q_1}{r^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (12.3)
|}

The electric field is the force per unit of charge and hence has units of newtons per coulomb [N/C].

So to get the force the electric field exerts we use:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=EQ\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (12.4)
|}

Notice we are just multiplying the electric field magnitude by the magnitude of the charge it is acting on.

== What do field maps look like? ==

The maps depend very much on the charge or charges that the map is being made for. We will start off with the simplest possible
case. Take a single positive charge with no other charges around it. First, we will look at what effects it would have on a test
charge at a number of points.

=== Positive Charge Acting on Test Charge ===

At each point we calculate the force on a test charge, ''q'', and represent this force by a vector.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost8.png|293px|]]

We can see that at every point the positive test charge, ''q'', would experience a force pushing it away from the charge, ''Q''. This is because
both charges are positive and so they repel. Also notice that at points further away the vectors are shorter. That is because the force
is smaller if you are further away.

If the charge were negative we would have the following result.

=== Negative Charge Acting on Test Charge ===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost9.png|293px|]]

Notice that it is almost identical to the positive charge case. This is important - the arrows are the same length because the
magnitude of the charge is the same and so is the magnitude of the test charge. Thus the magnitude of the force is the same.
The arrows point in the opposite direction because the charges now have opposite sign and so the test charge is
attracted to the charge.

Now, to make things simpler, we draw continuous lines showing the path that the test charge would travel. This means we don't have to work
out the magnitude of the force at many different points.

=== Electric Field Map due to a Positive Charge ===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost10.png|291px|]]

Some important points to remember about electric fields:

* There is an electric field at every point in space surrounding a charge.
* Field lines are merely a representation - they are not real. When we draw them, we just pick convenient places to indicate the field in space.
* Field lines always start at a right-angle (90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;) to the charged object causing the field.
* Field lines never cross!

== Combined Charge Distributions ==

We look at the field of a positive charge and a negative charge placed next to each other. The net resulting field would be the addition of the
fields from each of the charges. To start off with let us sketch the field maps for each of the charges as though it were in isolation.

=== Electric Field of Negative and Positive Charge in Isolation ===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost11.png|562px|]]

Notice that a test charge starting off directly between the two would be pushed away from the positive charge and pulled towards the
negative charge in a straight line. The path it would follow would be a straight line between the charges.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost12.png|553px|]]

Now let's consider a test charge starting off a bit higher than directly between the charges. If it starts closer to the positive charge
the force it feels from the positive charge is greater, but the negative charge does attract it, so it would move away from the
positive charge with a tiny force attracting it towards the negative charge. As it gets further from the positive charge the force from the
negative and positive charges change and they are equal in magnitude at equal distances from the charges. After that point the negative charge starts to
exert a stronger force on the test charge. This means that the test charge moves towards the negative charge with only a small force away
from the positive charge.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost13.png|553px|]]

Now we can fill in the other lines quite easily using the same ideas. The resulting field map is:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost14.png|553px|]]

=== Two Like Charges I: The Positive Case ===

For the case of two positive charges things look a little different. We can't just turn the arrows around the way we did
before. In this case the test charge is repelled by both charges. This tells us that a test charge will never cross half way because the
force of repulsion from both charges will be equal in magnitude. 

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost15.png|553px|]]

The field directly between the charges cancels out in the middle. The force has equal magnitude and opposite direction. Interesting
things happen when we look at test charges that are not on a line directly between the two.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost16.png|553px|]]

We know that a charge the same distance below the middle will experience a force along a reflected line, because the problem is
symmetric (i.e. if we flipped vertically it would look the same). This is also true in the horizontal direction. So we use this fact to
easily draw in the next four lines.

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost17.png|553px|]]

Working through a number of possible starting points for the test charge we can show the electric field map to be:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost18.png|553px|]]

=== Two Like Charges II: The Negative Case ===

We can use the fact that the direction of the force is reversed for a test charge if you change the sign of the charge that is influencing
it. If we change to the case where both charges are negative we get the following result:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost19.png|553px|]]

== Parallel plates ==
One very important example of electric fields which is used extensively is the electric field between two charged parallel plates. In this
situation the electric field is constant. This is used for many practical purposes and later we will explain how Millikan used it to
measure the charge on the electron.

=== Field Map for Oppositely Charged Parallel Plates ===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost20.png|312px|]]

This means that the force that a  would feel at any point between the plates would be identical in magnitude and direction. The
fields on the edges exhibit fringe effects, i.e. they bulge outwards. This is because a test charge placed here would feel the
effects of charges only on one side (either left or right depending on which side it is placed). Test charges placed in the
middle experience the effects of charges on both sides so they balance the components in the horizontal direction. This isn't the case on the edges.

===The Force on a Test Charge between Oppositely Charged Parallel Plates===

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost21.png|312px|]]

==What about the Strength of the Electric Field?==
When we started making field maps we drew arrows to indicate the strength of the field and the direction. When we moved to lines you might have asked
&quot;Did we forget about the field strength?&quot;. We did not. Consider the case for a single positive charge again:

[[Image:Fhsst_electrost22.png|312px|]]

Notice that as you move further away from the charge the field lines become more spread out. In field map diagrams the closer field lines are together the stronger the field. 
This brings us to an interesting case. What is the electric field like if the object that is charged has an irregular shape.</text>

== Work Done and Energy Transfer in a Field ==

When a charged particle moves in an electric field work is done and energy transfers take place. This is exactly analogous to the case
when a mass moves in a gravitational field such as that set up by any massive object.

=== Work done by a field ===
====Gravitational Case====
A mass held at a height ''h'' above the ground has '''gravitational potential energy''' since, if released, it will fall under the action
of the gravitational field. Once released, in the absence of friction, only the force of gravity acts on the mass and the mass accelerates in
the direction of the force (towards the Earth's centre). 

[[Image:Fhsst electrost23.png|182px|]]

In this way, work is done by the field. When the mass falls a distance ''h'' (from point A to B), the work done is,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; Fs\\&amp;=&amp; mgh\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In falling, the mass loses gravitational potential energy and gains kinetic energy.

'''Energy is conserved!'''

The work done by the field is equal to the energy transferred,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W = \mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_k = \mathrm{Loss\ in\ }E_p\qquad\mathrm{(a\ falling\ mass)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Electrical Case====
A charge in an electric field has '''electrical potential energy''' since, if released, it will move under the action of the electric
field. When released, in the absence of friction, only the electric force acts on the charge and the charge accelerates in the direction
of the force (for positive charges the force and acceleration are in the direction of the electric field, while negative charges experience
a force and acceleration in the opposite direction to the electric field.) Consider a positive charge +''Q'' placed in the uniform electric
field between oppositely charged parallel plates.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost24.png|182px|]]

The positive charge will be repelled by the positive plate and attracted by the negative plate (i.e. it will move in the direction of the electric field lines). In this way, work is done by the field. In moving the charge a distance ''s'' in the electric field, the work done is,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; Fs\\&amp;=&amp; QEs\qquad\mathrm{since\ }E={F\over Q}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In the process of moving, the charge loses electrical potential energy and gains kinetic energy. The work done by the field is equal to the energy transferred,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_k = \mathrm{Loss\ in\ }E_p\qquad\mathrm{(charge\ moving\ under\ the\ influence\ of\ an\ electric\ field)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Work done by us ===
====Gravitational Case====

In order to return the mass ''m'' in Figure 12.1 to its original position (i.e. lift it a distance ''h'' from B back to A) we have to apply a force ''mg'' to balance the force of gravity. An amount of work ''mgh'' is done by the lifter. In the process, the mass gains gravitational potential energy,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}mgh &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_p\qquad\mathrm{(lifting\ a\ mass)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Electrical Case====

In order to return the charge in Figure 12.2 to its original position (i.e. from B back to A) we have to exert a force ''QE'' on the
charge to balance the force exerted on it by the electric field. An amount of work ''QEs'' is done by us. In the process, the charge gains
electrical potential energy,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}QEs &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_p\qquad\mathrm{(charge\ moved\ against\ an\ electric\ field)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In summary, '''when an object moves under the influence of a field, the field does work and potential energy is transferred into kinetic
energy. Potential energy is lost, while kinetic energy is gained. When an object is moved against a field we have to do work and the object gains potential energy.'''

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

=====Worked Example 62 Work done and energy transfers in a field=====

'''Question:'''
A charge of +5nC is moved a distance of 4&amp;nbsp;cm against a uniform electric field of magnitude &lt;math&gt;2\times10^{12}\mathrm{N.C^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; from A to B.

(a) Calculate the work done in moving the charge from A to B.
(b) The charge is now released and returns to A. Calculate the kinetic energy of the charge at A.

'''Answer:'''
(a)
Step 1 : 

We are given the values of the charge, the field and the distance the charge must move. All are in the correct units.

Step 2 : 

Since the charge is positive we have to do work to move it from A to B (since this is against the field). This work is given by,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; QEs\\&amp;=&amp; (5\times10^{-9})(2\times10^{12})(0.04)\\&amp;=&amp; 400\ \mathrm{J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

(b)

Step 3 : 

When released the charge moves under the influence of the electric field and returns to A. Work is now done by the field and the work done is equal to the kinetic energy gained,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Gain\ in\ }E_k &amp;=&amp; QEs\\&amp;=&amp; (5\times10^{-9})(2\times10^{12})(0.04)\\&amp;=&amp; 400\ \mathrm{J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the charge started at rest, the gain in kinetic energy is the final kinetic energy,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_k^{\mathrm{at\ A}} &amp;=&amp; 400\ \mathrm{J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Electrical Potential Difference ==

Consider a positive test charge + ''Q'' placed at A in the electric field of another positive point charge.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost25.png|297px|]]

The test charge moves towards B under the influence of the electric field of the other charge. In the process the test charge loses
electrical potential energy and gains kinetic energy. Thus, at A, the test charge has more potential energy than at B - '''A is said to
have a higher electrical potential than B'''. The potential energy of a charge at a point in a field is defined as the work required to move that charge from infinity to that point.

The '''potential difference between two points''' in an electric field is defined as the '''work required to move a unit positive test charge from the point of lower potential to that of higher potential'''. If an amount of work ''W'' is required to move a charge ''Q'' from one point to another, then the potential difference between the two points is given by,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}V &amp;=&amp;{W\over Q}\qquad \mathrm{unit:J.C^{-1}\ or\ V\ (the\ volt)}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

From this equation it follows that one volt is the potential difference between two points in an electric field if one joule of
work is done in moving one coulomb of charge from the one point to the other.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 63 Potential difference===

'''Question:'''
A positively charged object Q is placed as shown in the sketch. The potential difference between two points A and B is &lt;math&gt;4\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{V}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst electrost26.png|191px|]]

(a) Calculate the change in electrical potential energy of a +2nC charge when it moves from A to B.
(b) Which point, A or B, is at the higher electrical potential? Explain.
(c) If this charge were replaced with another of charge -2nC, in what way would its change in energy be affected?

'''Answer:'''
(a) 
The electrical potential energy of the positive charge decreases as it moves from A to B since it is moving in the direction of the electric field produced by the object Q. This loss in potential energy is equal to the work done by the field,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Loss\ in\ Electrical\ Potential\ Energy} &amp;=&amp; W\\&amp;=&amp;VQ\qquad \mathrm{(Since\ }V={W\over Q})\\&amp;=&amp; (4\times10^{-4})(2\times10^{-9})\\&amp;=&amp; 8\times10^{-13}\ \mathrm{J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

(b) Point A is at the higher electrical potential since work is required by us to move a positive test charge from B to A.
(c) If the charge is replaced by one of negative charge, the electrical potential energy of the charge will increase in moving from A to B (in this case we would have to do work on the charge).

As an example consider the electric field between two oppositely charged parallel plates a distance ''d'' apart maintained at a potential
difference ''V''.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost27.png|227px|]]

This electric field is uniform so that a charge placed anywhere between the plates will experience the same force. Consider a positive test charge ''Q'' placed at point O just off the surface of the negative plate. In order to move it towards the positive plate we have to apply a force ''QE''. 
The work done in moving the charge from the negative to the positive plate is, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; Fs \\&amp;=&amp; QEd,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

but from the definition of electrical potential, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W &amp;=&amp; VQ.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Equating these two expressions for the work done, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}QEd &amp;=&amp; VQ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and so, rearranging,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E &amp;=&amp; {V\over d}.\qquad \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 64 Parallel plates===
'''Question:'''
Two charged parallel plates are at a distance of 180&amp;nbsp;mm from each other. The potential difference between them is &lt;math&gt;3600\ \mathrm{V}&lt;/math&gt; as shown in the diagram.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost28.png|236px|]]

(a) If a small oil drop of negligible mass, carrying a charge of &lt;math&gt;+6.8\times10^{-9}\ \mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt;, is placed between the plates at point X, calculate the magnitude and direction of the electrostatic force exerted on the droplet.

(b) If the droplet is now moved to point Y, would the force exerted on it be bigger, smaller or the same as in (a)?

'''Answer:'''
(a)

Step 1 : 

First find the electric field strength between the plates,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E &amp;=&amp; {V \over d}\\&amp;=&amp; {3600\over 0.180}\\&amp;=&amp; 20000\ \mathrm{N.C^{-1}\ from\ the\ positive\ to\ the\ negative\ plate}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 2 : 

Now the force exerted on the charge at X is,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F &amp;=&amp; QE\\&amp;=&amp; (6.8\times10^{-9})(20000)\\&amp;=&amp; 1.36\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{down}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

(b)

|Figure 12.3: An oil drop suspended between oppositely charged parallel plates. 
|-
| [[Image:Fhsst electrost29.png|221px|]]
|}

Step 3 : 

The same. Since the electric field strength is uniform, the force exerted on a charge is the same at all points between the plates.

== Millikan's Oil-drop Experiment ==

Robert Millikan measured the charge on an electron by studying the motion of charged oil drops between oppositely charged parallel plates.

Consider one such negative drop between the plates in Figure 12.3. Since this drop is negative, the electric field exerts an upward force on the drop. In addition to this upward force, gravity exerts a downward force on the drop. Millikan adjusted the electric field strength between the plates by varying the potential difference applied across the plates. In this way, Millikan was able to bring the drops to rest.  *EDIT* Millikan's experiment was ment to have the drops fall at a constant rate.  At this constant rate the force of the earth on the drop and the force of the field on the drop are equal *End EDIT*

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{\mathrm{up}} &amp;=&amp; F_{\mathrm{down}}\\QE &amp;=&amp; mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;E={V \over d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Q{V \over d} &amp;=&amp; mg,\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and, therefore,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Q &amp;=&amp; {mgd\over V}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Millikan found that all drops had charges which were multiples of &lt;math&gt;1.6\times10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Since objects become charged by gaining or losing electrons, the charge on an electron must be &lt;math&gt;-1.6\times10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt;. The magnitude of the electron's charge is denoted by ''e'',

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}e &amp;=&amp; 1.6\times10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 65 Charge===

'''Question:'''
A metal sphere carries a charge of &lt;math&gt;+3.2\times10^{-8}\ \mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt;. How many electrons did it have to lose to attain its charge?

'''Answer:'''
Since the sphere is positive it lost electrons in the process of charging (when an object loses negative charges it is left positive). In fact, it lost,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{3.2\times10^{-8}\over 1.6\times10^{-19}}&amp;=&amp; 2\times10^{11}\ \mathrm{electrons}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 66 Millikan oil-drop experiment===

'''Question:'''
In a Millikan-type experiment a positively charged oil drop is placed between two horizontal plates, 20&amp;nbsp;mm apart, as shown.

[[Image:Fhsst electrost30.png|227px|]]

The potential difference across the plates is 4000V. The drop has a mass of &lt;math&gt;1.2\times10^{-14}&lt;/math&gt; and a charge of &lt;math&gt;8\times10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt;.
(a) Draw the electric field pattern between the two plates.
(b) Calculate:

# the electric field intensity between the two plates.
# the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on the drop.
# the magnitude of the Coulomb force acting on the drop.

(c) The drop is observed through a microscope. What will the drop be seen to do? Explain.
(d) Without any further calculations, give two methods that could be used to make the drop remain in a fixed position.

'''Answer:'''
(a)

[[Image:Fhsst electrost31.png|227px|]]

(b) 
1. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E &amp;=&amp; {V \over d}\\&amp;=&amp; {4000 \over 0.02}\\&amp;=&amp; 2\times 10^5\ \mathrm{V.m^{-1}\ up}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

2.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{\mathrm{grav}} &amp;=&amp; mg\\&amp;=&amp; (1.2\times10^{-14})(10)\\&amp;=&amp; 1.2\times 10^{-13}\mathrm{N}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

3.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{\mathrm{Coulomb}} &amp;=&amp; QE \\&amp;=&amp; (8\times10^{-19})(s\times10^5)\\&amp;=&amp; 1.6\times10^{-13}\mathrm{N}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

(c) Since &lt;math&gt;F_{up}&gt;F_{down}&lt;/math&gt;, the drop accelerates upwards. 

(d) The Coulomb force can be decreased by decreasing the electric field strength between the plates. Since &lt;math&gt;E={V\over d}&lt;/math&gt;, this can be done either by increasing ''d'' or decreasing ''V''.</text>

== A capacitor ==

A capacitor is simply two conductors separated by a dielectric (insulator).
A capacitor (historically known as a &quot;condenser&quot;) is a device that stores energy in an electric field &lt;!-- by accumulating an internal imbalance of electric charge ((Is there a better way to explain this ?)) --&gt;.

The most common kind of capacitor has two parallel plates with
a (fairly) uniform electric field between the plates.

A battery can be used to fill one end of the capacitor with electrons and drain electrons from the other end of the capacitor.
This is known as charging.
Charging a capacitor creates a charge imbalance between the two plates and creates a voltage that stops the capacitor from
charging.
When capacitors are connected to a battery, current flows only until the capacitor becomes charged to the same voltage as the battery.
When the capacitor is charged to the same voltage as the battery, current stops flowing -- the capacitor acts like an open circuit.
It is as if the capacitor gained infinite resistance.

If we pull a capacitor out of the circuit, it retains the voltage to which it was charged.
(In real capacitors, the excess electrons on one plate slowly leak over to the other plate.
But the higher the quality of the capacitor, the closer it acts like an &quot;ideal capacitor&quot;.
An &quot;ideal capacitor&quot; would hold that charge forever.
)

Just as the capacitor charges it can be discharged.

== An inductor ==

If we are going to talk of inductive circuits we need a definition of a inductor.

An inductor is simply a coil of wire (or some other conductive material).
An inductor is a device which stores energy in a magnetic field.

An inductor only resists changes in current. An ideal inductor does not offer any resistance to direct current, except when the current is switched on and off, in which case it makes the change more gradual. However, all real-world inductors are constructed from material with finite electrical resistance, which opposes even direct current.
&lt;!-- Is the above *functional* explaination adequate,
or do we need to delve into magnetic fields etc. ?
--&gt;

Whenever current flows, it creates a magnetic field proportional to the current.
(In other words, whenever electrons move, they create a magnetic field --
proportional to both how many electrons there are, and how fast their average speed is).
Coiling the wire concentrates that field inside the coil.

A changing magnetic field always induces a voltage in any wire.

When we apply a voltage source to the inductor --
for example, when we energize the field winding of an electric fan by plugging it in --
the current will flow through the coil,
creating a magnetic field.

As more and more current flows, the magnetic field also ''increases'' proportionally.
The changing magnetic field creates a &quot;back-emf&quot; (the voltage across the coil).
That same wire, when straightened out, would act like a short circuit --
but when formed into a coil, much less current goes through it.

If we applied a constant DC voltage to this coil, the current would keep increasing more and more, until something failed.

As you know, the voltage supplied by the wall socket isn't DC. It returns to zero then increases in the opposite direction many times a second.

When the voltage returns to zero, the current through the inductor stays constant --
the constant current causes a constant magnetic field,
the constant magnetic field causes zero &quot;back-emf&quot;.
When the supply voltage reverses direction,
the current through the coil decreases,
causing the magnetic field to decrease.
Because the magnetic field is ''decreasing'',
it induces a &quot;back-emf&quot; voltage across the inductor
in the opposite direction than when the magnetic field was ''increasing''.
(Something interesting happens after the magnetic field decreases all the way to zero,
but we don't have time to talk about that).

To summarize, at first, the current through the coil goes from + to -, just like a resistor or a charging capacitor. But just after the voltage reverses, the current continues going in the same direction, which is now - to +. This makes inductors unlike any other component known to mankind. We say that &quot;in an inductor, the voltage leads the current&quot; or ELI.

&lt;!--
&quot;but we have learnt that a changing magnetic field induces a current in a wire.&quot;
&quot;So when the current turns off the magnetic field
decreases inducing another current in the wire. As the field decreases in strength so does the induced magnetic field.&quot;
Gaa -- who writes this stuff ?
A changing magnetic field induces a *voltage* in a wire.
Let's try to get it right, people.
--&gt;

Normally inductors are made of copper wire, but not always (Example: aluminum wire, or spiral pattern etched on circuit board). The
material around and within the coil affects its properties  common types are air-core (only a coil of wire), iron-core, and ferrite
core. Iron and ferrite types are more efficient because they conduct the magnetic field much better than air.
Ferrite is more
efficient than iron because stray electricity cannot flow through it.

{| 
|- 
|[[Image:fhsst_magnify.png|110px]]
|Some inductors have more than a core, which is just a rod the coil is formed about. Some are formed like transformers, using two E-shaped 
pieces facing each other, the wires wound about the central leg of the E's. The E's are made of laminated iron/steel or ferrite.

Important qualities of an inductor:

There are several important properties for an inductor.

* Current carrying capacity is determined by wire thickness.
* Q, or quality, is determined by the uniformity of the windings, as well as the core material and how thoroughly it surrounds the coil.
* Last but not least, the inductance of the coil.

The inductance is determined by several factors.

* coil shape: short and squat is best
* core material
* windings: winding in opposite directions will cancel out the inductance effect, and you will have only a resistor.

== A comparison of capacitors and inductors ==

* In capacitors, current leads voltage.
* In inductors, voltage leads current.

I remember this by saying &quot;ELI the ICE man&quot;.

= active circuit elements, diode, LED and field effect transistor, operational amplifier =

== Diode ==

A diode functions as the electronic version of a one-way valve. By restricting the direction of movement of charge carriers, it allows
an electric current to flow in one direction, but blocks it in the opposite direction. It is a one-way street for current.

[[Image:fhsst_diodesym.png|diodesym.png]]

[[Image:fhsst_diode.png|diode.png]]

Diode behavior is analogous to the behavior of a hydraulic device called a check valve. A check valve allows fluid flow through it in
one direction only:

[[Image:fhsst_checkvalve.png|checkvalve.png]]

Check valves are essentially pressure-operated devices: they open and allow flow if the pressure across them is of the correct
&quot;polarity&quot; to open the gate (in the analogy shown, greater fluid pressure on the right than on the left). If the pressure is of the
opposite &quot;polarity,&quot; the pressure difference across the check valve will close and hold the gate so that no flow occurs.

Like check valves, diodes are essentially &quot;pressure-&quot; operated (voltage-operated) devices. The essential difference between
forward-bias and reverse-bias is the polarity of the voltage dropped across the diode. Let's take a closer look at the simple
battery-diode-lamp circuit shown earlier, this time investigating voltage drops across the various components:

[[Image:fhsst_diodeexplanation.png|diodeexplanation.png]]

When the diode is forward-biased and conducting current, there is a small voltage dropped across it, leaving most of the battery voltage
dropped across the lamp. When the battery's polarity is reversed and the diode becomes reverse-biased, it drops all of the battery's
voltage and leaves none for the lamp. If we consider the diode to be a sort of self-actuating switch (closed in the forward-bias mode and
open in the reverse-bias mode), this behavior makes sense. The most substantial difference here is that the diode drops a lot more
voltage when conducting than the average mechanical switch (0.7 volts versus tens of millivolts).

This forward-bias voltage drop exhibited by the diode is due to the action of the depletion region formed by the P-N junction under the
influence of an applied voltage. When there is no voltage applied across a semiconductor diode, a thin depletion region exists around
the region of the P-N junction, preventing current through it. The depletion region is for the most part devoid of available charge
carriers and so acts as an insulator:

[[Image:fhsst_realdiode.png|realdiode.png]]

== LED ==

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when charge flows in the correct direction through it. If you
apply a voltage to force current to flow in the direction the LED allows it will light up.

[[Image:fhsst_ledsym.png|ledsym.png]]

This notation of having two small arrows pointing away from the device is common to the schematic symbols of all light-emitting
semiconductor devices. Conversely, if a device is light-activated (meaning that incoming light stimulates it), then the symbol will
have two small arrows pointing toward it. It is interesting to note, though, that LEDs are capable of acting as light-sensing devices:
they will generate a small voltage when exposed to light, much like a solar cell on a small scale. This property can be gainfully
applied in a variety of light-sensing circuits. 

The color depends on the semiconducting material used to construct the LED, and can be in the near-ultraviolet, visible or infrared
part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

=== Physical function ===

Because LEDs are made of different chemical substances than normal rectifying diodes, their forward voltage drops will be different.
Typically, LEDs have much larger forward voltage drops than rectifying diodes, anywhere from about 1.6 volts to over 3 volts,
depending on the color. Typical operating current for a standard-sized LED is around 20 mA. When operating an LED from a DC
voltage source greater than the LED's forward voltage, a series-connected &quot;dropping&quot; resistor must be included to prevent
full source voltage from damaging the LED. Consider this example circuit:

[[Image:fhsst_ledusage1.png|ledusage1.png]]

With the LED dropping 1.6 volts, there will be 4.4 volts dropped across the resistor. Sizing the resistor for an LED current of 20 mA
is as simple as taking its voltage drop (4.4 volts) and dividing by circuit current (20 mA), in accordance with Ohm's Law (''R'' = ''E''/''I''). This
gives us a figure of 220 &amp;Omega;. Calculating power dissipation for this resistor, we take its voltage drop and multiply by its current
(P=IE), and end up with 88 mW, well within the rating of a 1/8 watt resistor. Higher battery voltages will require larger-value dropping
resistors, and possibly higher-power rating resistors as well. Consider this example for a supply voltage of 24 volts:


[[Image:fhsst_ledusage2.png|ledusage2.png]]

Here, the dropping resistor must be increased to a size of 1.12 k&amp;Omega; in order to drop 22.4 volts at 20 mA so that the LED still receives
only 1.6 volts. This also makes for a higher resistor power dissipation: 448 mW, nearly one-half a watt of power! Obviously, a
resistor rated for 1/8 watt power dissipation or even 1/4 watt dissipation will overheat if used here.

Dropping resistor values need not be precise for LED circuits. Suppose we were to use a 1 k&amp;Omega; resistor instead of a 1.12 k&amp;Omega; resistor
in the circuit shown above. The result would be a slightly greater circuit current and LED voltage drop, resulting in a brighter light
from the LED and slightly reduced service life. A dropping resistor with too much resistance (say, 1.5 k&amp;Omega; instead of 1.12 k&amp;Omega;) will
result in less circuit current, less LED voltage, and a dimmer light. LEDs are quite tolerant of variation in applied power, so you
need not strive for perfection in sizing the dropping resistor.

Also because of their unique chemical makeup, LEDs have much, much lower peak-inverse voltage (PIV) ratings than ordinary rectifying
diodes. A typical LED might only be rated at 5 volts in reverse-bias mode. Therefore, when using alternating current to power an LED, you
should connect a protective rectifying diode in series with the LED to prevent reverse breakdown every other half-cycle:

[[Image:fhsst_ledusage3.png|ledusage3.png]]

=== Light emission ===

The wavelength of the light emitted, and therefore its color, depends on the materials forming the pn junction. A normal diode,
typically made of silicon or germanium, emits invisible far-infrared light (so it can't be seen), but the materials used for an LED have
emit light corresponding to near-infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet frequencies.

=== Considerations in use ===

Unlike incandescent light bulbs, which can operate with either AC or DC, LEDs require a DC supply of the correct electrical polarity.
When the voltage across the pn junction is in the correct direction, a significant current flows and the device is said to be forward
biased. The voltage across the LED in this case is fixed for a given LED and is proportional to the energy of the emitted photons. If the
voltage is of the wrong polarity, the device is said to be reverse biased, very little current flows, and no light is emitted.

Because the voltage versus current characteristics of an LED are much like any diode, they can be destroyed by connecting them to a
voltage source much higher than their turn on voltage.

The voltage drop across a forward biased LED increases as the amount of light emitted increases because of the optical power being radiated. One
consequence is that LEDs of the same type can be readily operated in parallel. The turn-on voltage of an LED is a function of the color,
a higher forward drop is associated with emitting higher energy (bluer) photons. The reverse voltage that most LEDs can sustain
without damage is usually only a few volts. Some LED units contain two diodes, one in each direction and each a different color
(typically red and green), allowing two-color operation or a range of colors to be created by altering the percentage of time the
voltage is in each polarity.

=== LED materials ===

LED development began with infrared and red devices made with gallium arsenide. Advances in materials science have made possible
the production of devices with ever shorter wavelengths, producing light in a variety of colors.

Conventional LEDs are made from a variety of inorganic minerals, producing the following colors:

* aluminium gallium arsenide ''(AlGaAs)'': red and infrared
* gallium arsenide/phosphide ''(GaAsP)'': red, orange-red, orange, and yellow
* gallium nitride ''(GaN)'': green, pure green (or emerald green), and blue
* gallium phosphide ''(GaP)'': red, yellow and green
* zinc selenide ''(ZnSe)'': blue
* indium gallium nitride ''(InGaN)'': bluish-green and blue
* silicon carbide ''(SiC)'': blue
* diamond ''(C)'': ultraviolet
* silicon ''(Si)'' - under development

'''Note to self:''' The above list is taken from public sources, but at least one LED given as blue does not produce blue light. (There is a good
chance that almost none do, because of the higher frequency of blue.) This is a common problem in daily life due to the majority of
mankind being ignorant of colour theory and conflating blue with light blue with cyan, the latter often called &quot;sky blue&quot;. A cyan LED
may be distinguished from a blue LED in that adding a yellow phosphor to the output makes green, rather than white light. And
often aqua is called blue-green when in actuality the latter is cyan, and light cyan-green would be aqua. What adds to the confusion
is that cyan LEDs are enclosed in blue plastic. A great amount of work is needed to dispel these intuitive myths of colour mixing
before accurate descriptions of physical phenomena and their production can happen. - This needs to be sorted out 

=== Blue and white LEDs and Other colors ===

Commercially viable blue LEDs based invented by Shuji Nakamura while working in Japan at Nichia Corporation in 1993 and became widely
available in the late 1990s. They can be added to existing red and green LEDs to produce white light.

Most &quot;white&quot; LEDs in production today use a 450nm &amp; 470nm blue GaN (gallium nitride) LED covered by a yellowish phosphor coating
usually made of cerium doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Ce) crystals which have been powdered and bound in a type of viscous
adhesive. The LED chip emits blue light, part of which is converted to yellow by the YAG:Ce. The single crystal form of YAG:Ce is
actually considered a scintillator rather than a phosphor. Since yellow light stimulates the red and green receptors of the eye, the
resulting mix of blue and yellow light gives the appearance of white.

The newest method used to produce white light LEDs uses no phosphors at all and is based on homoepitaxially grown zinc selenide (ZnSe) on
a ZnSe substrate which simultaneously emits blue light from its active region and yellow light from the substrate.


=== Other colors ===

Recent color developments include pink and purple. They consist of one or two phosphor layers over a blue LED chip. The first phosphor
layer of a pink LED is a yellow glowing one, and the second phosphor layer is either red or orange glowing. Purple LEDs are blue LEDs
with an orange glowing phosphor over the chip. Some pink LEDs have run into issues. For example, some are blue LEDs painted with
fluorescent paint or fingernail polish that can wear off, and some are white LEDs with a pink phosphor or dye that unfortunately fades
after a short tme.

Ultraviolet, blue, pure green, white, pink and purple LEDs are relatively expensive compared to the more common reds, oranges,
greens, yellows and infrareds and are thus less commonly used in commercial applications.

The semiconducting chip is encased in a solid plastic lens, which is much tougher than the glass envelope of a traditional light bulb or
tube. The plastic may be colored, but this is only for cosmetic reasons and does not affect the color of the light emitted.

=== Operational parameters and efficiency ===

Most typical LEDs are designed to operate with no more than 30-60 milliwatts of electrical power. It is projected that by 2005,
10-watt units will be available. These devices will produce about as much light as a common 50-watt incandescent bulb, and will
facilitate use of LEDs for general illumination needs.

{| 
|- 
|
[[Image:fhsst_magnify.png|110px]]
|In September 2003 a new type of blue LED was demonstrated by the company Cree, Inc. to have 35% efficiency at 20 mA. This produced a commercially packaged white light having 65 lumens per watt at 20 mA, becoming the brightest white LED commercially available at the time.
|}

=== Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) ===

If the emissive layer material of an LED is an organic compound, it is known as an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED). To function as a
semiconductor, the organic emissive material must have conjugated pi bonds. The emissive material can be a small organic molecule in a
crystalline phase, or a polymer. Polymer materials can be flexible such LEDs are known as PLEDs or FLEDs.

Compared with regular LEDs, OLEDs are lighter and polymer LEDs can have the added benefit of being flexible. Some possible future
applications of OLEDs could be:

* Light sources
* Wall decorations
* Luminous cloth
* Computer screens
* Televisions

=== LED applications ===

Here is a list of known applications for LEDs, some of which are further elaborated upon in the following text:

* in general, commonly used as information indicators in various types of embedded systems (many of which are listed below)
* thin, lightweight message displays, e.g. in public information signs (at airports and railway stations, among other places)
* status indicators, e.g. on/off lights on professional instruments and consumers audio/video equipment
* infrared LEDs in remote controls (for TVs, VCRs, etc.)
* clusters in traffic signals, replacing ordinary bulbs behind colored glass
* car indicator lights and bicycle lighting  also for pedestrians to be seen by car traffic
* calculator and measurement instrument displays (seven segment displays), although now mostly replaced by LCDs
* red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and [alpha]numeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained: aircraft cockpits, submarine and ship bridges, astronomy observatories, and in the field, e.g. night time animal watching and military field use
* red or yellow LEDs are also used in photographic darkrooms, for providing lighting which does not lead to unwanted exposure of the film

LEDs offer benefits in terms of maintenance and safety.

* The typical working lifetime of a device, including the bulb, is ten years, which is much longer than the lifetimes of most other light sources.
* LEDs fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt burn-out of incandescent bulbs.
* LEDs give off less heat than incandescent light bulbs and are less fragile than fluorescent lamps.
* Since an individual device is smaller than a centimetre in length, LED-based light sources used for illumination and outdoor signals are built using clusters of tens of devices.

Because they are monochromatic, LED lights have great power advantages over white lights where a specific color is required.
Unlike the white lights, the LED does not need a filter that absorbs most of the emitted white light. Colored fluorescent lights are
made, but they are not widely available. LED lights are inherently colored, and are available in a wide range of colors. One of the
most recently introduced colors is the emerald green (bluish green, about 500 nm) that meets the legal requirements for traffic signals
and navigation lights.

There are applications that specifically require light that does not contain any blue component. Examples are photographic darkroom safe
lights, illumination in laboratories where certain photo-sensitive chemicals are used, and situations where dark adaptation (night
vision) must be preserved, such as cockpit and bridge illumination, observatories, etc. Yellow LED lights are a good choice to meet
these special requirements because the human eye is more sensitive to yellow light.

== Transistor ==

The transistor is a solid state semiconductor device used for amplification and switching, and has three terminals. The transistor
itself does not amplify current though, which is a common misconception, but a small current or voltage applied to one
terminal controls the current through the other two, hence the term transistor  a voltage- or current-controlled resistor. ''It is
the key component in all modern electronics''. In digital circuits, transistors are used as very fast electrical switches, and
arrangements of transistors can function as logic gates, RAM-type memory and other devices. In analog circuits, transistors are
essentially used as amplifiers.

Transistor was also the common name in the sixties for a transistor radio, a pocket-sized portable radio that utilized transistors
(rather than vacuum tubes) as its active electronics. This is still one of the dictionary definitions of transistor.

[[Image:fhsst_bothtranistortypes.png|bothtranistortypes.png]]

The only functional difference between a PNP transistor and an NPN transistor is the proper biasing (polarity) of the junctions when
operating. For any given state of operation, the current directions and voltage polarities for each type of transistor are exactly
opposite each other.

Bipolar transistors work as current-controlled current regulators. In other words, they restrict the amount of current that can go
through them according to a smaller, controlling current. The main current that is controlled goes from collector to emitter, or from
emitter to collector, depending on the type of transistor it is (PNP or NPN, respectively). The small current that controls the main
current goes from base to emitter, or from emitter to base, once again depending on the type of transistor it is (PNP or NPN,
respectively). According to the confusing standards of semiconductor symbology, the arrow always points against the direction of electron
flow:

[[Image:fhsst_tranistorcurrents.png|tranistorcurrents.png]]

Bipolar transistors are called bipolar because the main flow of electrons through them takes place in two types of semiconductor
material: P and N, as the main current goes from emitter to collector (or vice versa). In other words, two types of charge
carriers - electrons and holes - comprise this main current through the transistor.

As you can see, the controlling current and the controlled current always mesh together through the emitter wire, and their electrons
always flow against the direction of the transistor's arrow. This is the first and foremost rule in the use of transistors: all currents
must be going in the proper directions for the device to work as a current regulator. The small, controlling current is usually
referred to simply as the base current because it is the only current that goes through the base wire of the transistor.
Conversely, the large, controlled current is referred to as the collector current because it is the only current that goes through
the collector wire. The emitter current is the sum of the base and collector currents, in compliance with Kirchhoff's Current Law.

If there is no current through the base of the transistor, it shuts off like an open switch and prevents current through the collector.
If there is a base current, then the transistor turns on like a closed switch and allows a proportional amount of current through
the collector. Collector current is primarily limited by the base current, regardless of the amount of voltage available to push it.
The next section will explore in more detail the use of bipolar transistors as switching elements.

=== Importance ===

The transistor is considered by many to be one of the greatest discoveries or inventions in modern history, ranking with banking
and the printing press. Key to the importance of the transistor in modern society is its ability to be produced in huge numbers using
simple techniques, resulting in vanishingly small prices. Computer &quot;chips&quot; consist of millions of transistors and sell for rands, with
per-transistor costs in the thousandths-of-cents.

The low cost has meant that the transistor has become an almost universal tool for non-mechanical tasks. Whereas a common device,
say a refrigerator, would have used a mechanical device for control, today it is often less expensive to simply use a few million
transistors and the appropriate computer program to carry out the same task through &quot;brute force&quot;. Today transistors have replaced
almost all electromechanical devices, most simple feedback systems, and appear in huge numbers in everything from computers to cars.

Hand-in-hand with low cost has been the increasing move to &quot;digitizing&quot; all information. With transistorized computers offering
the ability to quickly find (and sort) digital information, more and more effort was put into making all information digital. Today
almost all media in modern society is delivered in digital form, converted and presented by computers. Common &quot;analog&quot; forms of
information such as television or newspapers spend the vast majority of their time as digital information, being converted to analog only
for a small portion of the time.


== The transistor as a switch ==

Because a transistor's collector current is proportionally limited by its base current, it can be used as a sort of current-controlled
switch. A relatively small flow of electrons sent through the base of the transistor has the ability to exert control over a much
larger flow of electrons through the collector. Suppose we had a lamp that we wanted to turn on and off by means of 
a switch. Such a circuit would be extremely simple:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitch.png|tasswitch.png]]

For the sake of illustration, let's insert a transistor in place of the switch to show how it can control the flow of electrons through
the lamp. Remember that the controlled current through a transistor must go between collector and emitter. Since it's the current
through the lamp that we want to control, we must position the collector and emitter of our transistor where the two contacts of
the switch are now. We must also make sure that the lamp's current will move against the direction of the emitter arrow symbol to
ensure that the transistor's junction bias will be correct: 

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchnpn.png|tasswitchnpn.png]]

In this example I happened to choose an NPN transistor. A PNP transistor could also have been chosen for the job, and its
application would look like this:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchpnp.png|tasswitchpnp.png]]

The choice between NPN and PNP is really arbitrary. All that matters is that the proper current directions are maintained for the sake of
correct junction biasing (electron flow going against the transistor symbol's arrow).

Going back to the NPN transistor in our example circuit, we are faced with the need to add something more so that we can have base
current. Without a connection to the base wire of the transistor, base current will be zero, and the transistor cannot turn on,
resulting in a lamp that is always off. Remember that for an NPN transistor, base current must consist of electrons flowing from
emitter to base (against the emitter arrow symbol, just like the lamp current). Perhaps the simplest thing to do would be to connect
a switch between the base and collector wires of the transistor like this:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitch1.png|tasswitch1.png]]

If the switch is open, the base wire of the transistor will be left &quot;floating&quot; (not connected to anything) and there will be no current
through it. In this state, the transistor is said to be cutoff. If the switch is closed, however, electrons will be able to flow from
the emitter through to the base of the transistor, through the switch and up to the left side of the lamp, back to the positive
side of the battery. This base current will enable a much larger flow of electrons from the emitter through to the collector, thus
lighting up the lamp. In this state of maximum circuit current, the transistor is said to be saturated.

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitch2.png|tasswitch2.png]]

Of course, it may seem pointless to use a transistor in this capacity to control the lamp. After all, we're still using a switch
in the circuit, aren't we? If we're still using a switch to control the lamp - if only indirectly - then what's the point of having a
transistor to control the current? Why not just go back to our original circuit and use the switch directly to control the lamp
current?

There are a couple of points to be made here, actually. First is the fact that when used in this manner, the switch contacts need only
handle what little base current is necessary to turn the transistor on, while the transistor itself handles the majority of the lamp's
current. This may be an important advantage if the switch has a low current rating: a small switch may be used to control a relatively
high-current load. Perhaps more importantly, though, is the fact that the current-controlling behavior of the transistor enables us
to use something completely different to turn the lamp on or off. Consider this example, where a solar cell is used to control the
transistor, which in turn controls the lamp:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchsolarcell.png|tasswitchsolarcell.png]]

Or, we could use a thermocouple to provide the necessary base current to turn the transistor on:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchthermocouple.png|tasswitchthermocouple.png]]

Even a microphone of sufficient voltage and current output could be used to turn the transistor on, provided its output is rectified
from AC to DC so that the emitter-base PN junction within the transistor will always be forward-biased:

[[Image:fhsst_tasswitchmicrophone.png|tasswitchmicrophone.png]]

The point should be quite apparent by now: any sufficient source of DC current may be used to turn the transistor on, and that source of
current need only be a fraction of the amount of current needed to energize the lamp. Here we see the transistor functioning not only
as a switch, but as a true amplifier: using a relatively low-power signal to control a relatively large amount of power. Please note
that the actual power for lighting up the lamp comes from the battery to the right of the schematic. It is not as though the small
signal current from the solar cell, thermocouple, or microphone is being magically transformed into a greater amount of power. Rather,
those small power sources are simply controlling the battery's power to light up the lamp.

=== Field-Effect Transistor (FET) ===

'''Note: Schematic can be found under GFDL on wikipedia'''

The schematic symbols for p- and n-channel MOSFETs. The symbols to the right include an extra terminal for the transistor body
(allowing for a seldom-used channel bias) whereas in those to the left the body is implicitly connected to the source.

The most common variety of field-effect transistors, the enhancement-mode MOSFET (metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect
transistor) consists of a unipolar conduction channel and a metal gate separated from the main conduction channel by a thin layer of
(SiO2) glass. This is why an alternative name for the FET is 'unipolar transistor.' When a potential difference (of the proper
polarity) is impressed across gate and source, charge carriers are introduced to the channel, making it conductive. The amount of this
current can be modulated, or (nearly) completely turned off, by varying the gate potential.

Because the gate is insulated, no DC current flows to or from the gate electrode. This lack of a gate current and the ability of the
MOSFET to act like a switch, allows particularly efficient digital circuits to be created, with very low power consumption at low
frequencies. The power consumption increases markedly with frequency, because the capacitive loading of the FET control
terminal takes more energy to slew at higher frequencies, in direct proportion to the frequency. Hence, MOSFETs have become the dominant
technology used in computing hardware such as microprocessors and memory devices such as RAM. Bipolar transistors are more rugged and
hence more useful for low-impedance loads and inductively reactive (e.g. motor) loads.

Power MOSFETs become less conductive with increasing temperature and can therefore be applied in shunt, to increase current capacity,
unlike the bipolar transistor, which has a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, and is therefore prone to thermal
runaway. The downside of this is that, while the power FET can protect itself from overheating by diminishing the current through
it, high temperatures need to be avoided by using a larger heat sink than for an equivalent bipolar device. Macroscopic FET power
transistors are actually composed of many little transistors. They are stacked (on-chip) to increase breakdown potential and paralleled
to reduce Ron, i.e. allowing for more current, bussing the gates to provide a single control (gate) terminal.

The depletion mode FET is a little different. It uses a back-biased diode for the control terminal, which presents a capacitive load to
the driving circuit in normal operation. With the gate tied to the source, a DFET is fully on. Changing the potential of a DFET
(pulling an N-channel gate downward, for example) will turn it off, i.e. 'deplete' the channel (drain-source) of charge carriers.
MOSFETs, formerly called IGFETs (for Insulated Gate Field-Effect Transistor) can be depletion-mode, enhancement-mode, or mixed-mode,
but are almost always enhancement mode in modern commercial practice. This means that, with the source and gate tied together
(thus equipotential) the channel will be off (high impedance or non-conducting). The n-channel device (reverse for P-channel), like
in the DFET, is turned on by raising the potential of the gate. Typically, the gate on a MOSFET will withstand +-20V, relative to
the source terminal. If one were to raise the gate potential of an n-channel device without limiting the current to a few milliamps,
one would destroy the gate diode, like any other small diode. Why do we typically think of n-channel devices as the default? In silicon
devices, the ones that use majority carriers that are electrons, rather than holes, are slightly faster and can carry more current
than their P-type counterparts. The same is true in GaAs devices.

The FET is simpler in concept than the bipolar transistor and can be constructed from a wide range of materials.

The most common use of MOSFET transistors today is the CMOS (complementary metallic oxide semiconductor) integrated circuit
which is the basis for most digital electronic devices. These use a totem-pole arrangement where one transistor (either the pull-up or
the pull-down) is on while the other is off. Hence, there is no DC drain, except during the transition from one state to the other,
which is very short. As mentioned, the gates are capacitive, and the charging and discharging of the gates each time a transistor
switches states is the primary cause of power drain. 

The C in CMOS stands for 'complementary.' The pull-up is a P-channel device (using holes for the mobile carrier of charge) and the
pull-down is N-channel (electron carriers). This allows busing of the control terminals, but limits the speed of the circuit to that
of the slower P device (in silicon devices). The bipolar solutions to push-pull include 'cascode' using a current source for the load.
Circuits that utilize both unipolar and bipolar transistors are called Bi-Fet. A recent development is called 'vertical P.'
Formerly, BiFet chip users had to settle for relatively poor (horizontal) P-type FET devices. This is no longer the case and
allows for quieter and faster analog circuits.

A clever variant of the FET is the dual-gate device. This allows for two opportunities to turn the device off, as opposed to the
dual-base (bipolar) transistor which presents two opportunities to turn the device on.

FETs can switch signals of either polarity, if their amplitude is significantly less than the gate swing, as the devices (especially
the parasitic diode-free DFET) are basically symmetrical. This means that FETs are the most suitable type for analog multiplexing. With
this concept, one can construct a solid-state mixing board, for example.

The power MOSFET has a 'parasitic diode' (back-biased) normally shunting the conduction channel that has half the current capacity
of the conduction channel. Sometimes this is useful in driving dual-coil magnetic circuits (for spike protection), but in other
cases it causes problems.

The high impedance of the FET gate makes it rather vulnerable to electrostatic damage, though this is not usually a problem after the
device has been installed.

A more recent device for power control is the insulated-gate bipolar transistor, or IGBT. This has a control structure akin to a MOSFET
coupled with a bipolar-like main conduction channel. These have become quite popular.</text>

= Electronic Logic Gates =

The simplest form of electronic logic is diode logic (DL). This allows AND and OR gates to be built, but not inverters, and so is an
incomplete form of logic. To built a complete logic system, valves or transistors can be used. The simplest family of logic gates using
bipolar transistors is called resistor-transistor logic, or RTL. Unlike diode logic gates, RTL gates can be cascaded indefinitely to
produce more complex logic functions. These gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed, the resistors used in RTL
were replaced by diodes, leading to diode-transistor logic, or DTL. It was then discovered that one transistor could do the job of two
diodes in the space of one diode, so transistor-transistor logic, or TTL, was created. In some types of chip, to reduce size and power
consumption still further, the bipolar transistors were replaced with complementary field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), resulting in
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic.

For small-scale logic, designers now use prefabricated logic gates from families of devices such as the TTL 7400 series invented by
Texas Instruments and the CMOS 4000 series invented by RCA, and their more recent descendants. These devices usually contain
transistors with multiple emitters, used to implement the AND function, which are not available as separate components.
Increasingly, these fixed-function logic gates are being replaced by programmable logic devices, which allow designers to pack a huge
number of mixed logic gates into a single integrated circuit. 

Electronic logic gates differ significantly from their relay-and-switch equivalents. They are much faster, consume much
less power, and are much smaller (all by a factor of a million or more in most cases). Also, there is a fundamental structural
difference. The switch circuit creates a continuous metallic path for current to flow (in either direction) between its input and its
output. The semiconductor logic gate, on the other hand, acts as a high-gain voltage amplifier, which sinks a tiny current at its input
and produces a low-impedance voltage at its output. It is not possible for current to flow between the output and the input of a
semiconductor logic gate.

Another important advantage of standardised semiconductor logic gates, such as the 7400 and 4000 families, is that they are
cascadable. This means that the output of one gate can be wired to the inputs of one or several other gates, and so on ad infinitum,
enabling the construction of circuits of arbitrary complexity without requiring the designer to understand the internal workings
of the gates.

In practice, the output of one gate can only drive a finite number of inputs to other gates, a number called the 'fanout limit', but
this limit is rarely reached in the newer CMOS logic circuits, as compared to TTL circuits. Also, there is always a delay, called the
'propagation delay', from a change an input of a gate to the corresponding change in its output. When gates are cascaded, the
total propagation delay is approximately the sum of the individual delays, an effect which can become a problem in high-speed circuits.

The US symbol for an AND gate is: AND symbol and the IEC symbol is AND symbol.

The US circuit symbol for an OR gate is: OR symbol and the IEC symbol is: OR symbol.

The US circuit symbol for a NOT gate is: NOT symbol and the IEC symbol is: NOT symbol.

In electronics a NOT gate is more commonly called an inverter. The circle on the symbol is called a bubble, and is generally used in
circuit diagrams to indicate an inverted input or output. 

The US circuit symbol for a NAND gate is: NAND symbol and the IEC symbol is: NAND symbol.

The US circuit symbol for a NOR gate is: NOR symbol and the IEC symbol is: NOR symbol.

In practice, the cheapest gate to manufacture is usually the NAND gate. Additionally, Charles Peirce showed that NAND gates alone (as
well as NOR gates alone) can be used to reproduce all the other logic gates.

Two more gates are the exclusive-OR or XOR function and its inverse, exclusive-NOR or XNOR. Exclusive-OR is true only when exactly one of
its inputs is true. In practice, these gates are built from combinations of simpler logic gates.

The US circuit symbol for an XOR gate is: XOR symbol and the IEC symbol is: XOR symbol</text>

= Counting circuits =

An arithmetic and logical unit (ALU) adder provides the basic functionality of arithmetic operations within a computer, and is a
significant component of the arithmetic and logical unit. Adders are composed of half adders and full adders, which add two-bit binary
pairs, and ripple carry adders and carry look ahead adders which do addition operations to a series of binary numbers.

==Half Adder==
A half adder is a logical circuit that performs an addition operation on two binary digits. The half adder produces a sum and a carry value which are both binary digits.

Sum(s) = A xor B

= Introduction to the idea of a quantum =

Imagine that a beam of light is actually made up of little &quot;packets&quot; or &quot;bundles&quot; of energy, called '''quanta'''. 

It's like looking at a crowd of people from above. At first, it seems as though they are one huge patch, without any spaces between
them. You would never suspect that they were people. But as you move closer, you slowly begin to see that they are individuals, and when you get even closer, you may even recognize a few. Light seems like a continuous wave at first, but when we zoom in at the subatomic level, we notice that a beam of light actually consists of little &quot;packets&quot; of energy, or quanta.  (You will not be able to tell the particles of light apart though because they are of the same energy, and thus identical.  The fact that they can't be distinguished has to do with how a laser works.)

The only thing which differentiates one quantum from another is the energy contained in individual quanta (or &quot;packets&quot;). The &quot;packets&quot; are assigned a particular energy, depending on the frequency (or to put it simply: the colour) of the light wave. Quanta of '''Violet''' coloured light have the '''maximum''' energy and that of ''Red'' have the ''minimum'' energy.


This idea introduces the concept of the quantum (particle) nature of light, which is demonstrated by the photoelectric effect. When a
metal surface is illuminated with light, electrons can be emitted from the surface. This is known as the photoelectric effect . It was explained by the theoretical physicist Albert Einstein.</text>

= The wave-particle duality =

Looking at things we can see with our eyes, it seems that wave and particle behavior belong to distinct types of object, but as science reached the atomic and subatomic levels it gradually appeared that each of these is really a property shared by everything.  We start by talking about light, but the same concepts apply to everything else, at the atomic scale of size and momentum.

The wave nature of light is demonstrated by diffraction, interference, and polarization of light  and the particle nature oflight is demonstrated by the photoelectric effect. So light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, but only shows one or the
other, depending on the kind of experiment we perform. A wave-type experiment shows the wave nature, and a particle-type experiment
shows particle nature.

How do we know light acts like a wave?

Demonstrating that light has wave properties: imagine dropping a pebble in water - you see circular waves stretching out in ever widening circles. Now imagine placing a barrier (for example a card or piece of wood) in the path of the wave - but a barrier with a slot cut in it. What you would see is the wave hit that barrier and its slot - and a second wave would emenate from the other side of the slot (these would be semicircular waves).  This is easy to see at home - try it in a bath of water - well, light waves do the same thing.  However, now imagine having not one slot in the barrier, but two. What you would see then is the initial wave hit the barrier - and two semicircular waves emenate from the other side - one from the other side of each slot. The key point is that these two semicircular waves would crash into each other at some point - they would 'interfere' with each other. Where their respective waves were both 'high' they would add up and you would get a peak. Similarly where their respective waves were both low they would add up (you would get an even deeper trough), but where they were in opposite states (one high, one low) they would cancel each other out.  If you could stand on the shore with your eye at water level what you would see is a series of peaks and gaps - a sort of stripped imaged. This is exactly what we see when we place a detector (for example a piece of photographic film) on the other side of the two slots when you pass a light wave light through the two slots. You see the stripped pattern where the peaks have left an image (light had fallen on the photo paper) and the gaps (where light had not fallen on the paper) - indicating that 'interference' had taken place - and that indicates that light must be behaving like a wave. 

Actually you see a hint of this in supermarkets, when they scan the bar codes with lasers.  Ordinary light is a mixture of wavelengths, so that the diffraction patterns of different wavelengths cover each other up.  The light from a laser is all the same wavelength, so the random diffraction patterns are visible as speckles.


Now, we consider light to behave not as a wave, but as particles. But what do we call a 'particle' of light?

Photon : A photon is a quantum (energy packet) of light.

Imagine a sheet of metal. On the surface, there are electrons that can be set free. If a photon comes along and strikes the surface of the metal, then it will give its entire energy packet to one electron. This means that the electron now has some energy, and
it may escape (leave the surface) if this energy Ek (kinetic energy) is greater than the minimum energy required to free an electron Emin.

Now, suppose the electron needs 5eV of kinetic energy to escape. And suppose this little photon has just 2eV of energy in its energy
packet. Then the electron will not leave the surface of the metal. But suppose the photon has 8eV of energy. This means that the
electron will emerge with 3eV of kinetic energy.

Note that this does not mean the photon can give 5eV of energy to one electron and 3eV to another. A photon will give all of its
energy to just one electron.

The minimum amount of energy needed for an electron to escape (electrons do not normally leave a metal whenever they please), is
called the work function of the metal. In our example, the work function is 5eV. The work function has a different value for each
metal: 4.70eV for copper and 2.28eV for sodium. It is worth mentioning that the best conductors tend to be those with the smallest work functions.
(For Advanced Readers: Work Function actually  represents the energy required to overcome the negative potential energy of the electron which is caused by the electrostatic attraction acting on the electron by the nucleus)

The frequency of the radiation is directly related to the energy of the photon.  It is important because if the frequency (and hence the energy) of the photon is below a certain threshold value, no electrons will be emitted. Even if the intensity of the light is increased, and the light is allowed to fall on the surface for a long period of time, if the frequency of the radiation is below the threshold frequency, electrons will not be emitted.

The energy of the photon is calculated using the formula: E = hν    (where h = 6.57 X 10^-34 J-s is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of the radiation).

The kinetic energy of an electron that escapes from the metal is equal to the energy of the photon minus the work function, Φ, i.e.

Ek = (hν) - Φ

The electrons emerge with a range of velocities from zero up to a maximum Vmax. The maximum kinetic energy, (1/2)m(Vmax)^2, depends
(linearly) on the frequency of the radiation, and is independent of its intensity.

For incident radiation of a given frequency, the number of electrons emitted per unit time is proportional to the intensity of the
radiation.

Electron emission takes place from the instant the light shines on the surface, i.e. there is no detectable time delay.


What are the uses of the photoelectric effect? 

The most common use of photoelectric effect is in solar cells. Light energy from the sun is used to excite electrons out of metal surfaces which can then be made to flow in a circuit (i.e., replace a conventional cell!). The current obtained depends on the intensity (or simply: the brightness) of the light.

For this (and other work), Einstein received the Nobel Prize (Physics) in 1921 (&quot;...for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.&quot;).</text>

= Inside atomic nucleus =

Amazingly enough, the human mind that is contained inside a couple of liters of human's brain, is able to deal with extremely large as well as extremely small objects such as the whole universe and its smallest building blocks. So, what are these building blocks? As we already know, the universe consists of galaxies, which consist of stars with planets moving around. The planets are made of molecules, which are bound groups (chemical compounds) of atoms.

There are more than stars in the universe. Currently, scientists know over 12 million chemical compounds i.e. 12 million
different molecules. All this variety of molecules is made of only a hundred of different atoms. For those who believe in beauty and
harmony of nature, this number is still too large. They would expect to have just few different things from which all other substances
are made. In this chapter, we are going to find out what these elementary things are.</text>

= What the atom is made of =

The Greek word &lt;math&gt;\alpha\tau o\mu o\nu&lt;/math&gt; (atom) means indivisible. The discovery of the fact that an atom is
actually a complex system and can be broken in pieces was the most important step and pivoting point
in the development of modern physics.

It was discovered (by Rutherford in 1911) that an atom consists of a positively charged nucleus and negative electrons moving around it.
At first, people tried to visualize an atom as a microscopic analog of our solar system where planets move around the sun. This naive
planetary model assumes that in the world of very small objects the Newton laws of classical mechanics are valid. This, however, is not
the case.

The microscopic world is governed by quantum mechanics which does not have such notion as trajectory. Instead, it describes the
dynamics of particles in terms of quantum states that are characterized by probability distributions of various observable quantities.

For example, an electron in the atom is not moving along a certain trajectory but rather along all imaginable trajectories with
different probabilities. If we were trying to catch this electron, after many such attempts we would discover that the electron can be
found anywhere around the nucleus, even very close to and very far from it. However, the probabilities of finding the electron at
different distances from the nucleus would be different. What is amazing: the most probable distance corresponds to the classical trajectory!

You can visualize the electron inside an atom as moving around the nucleus chaotically and extremely fast so that for our ``mental
eyes'' it forms a cloud. In some places this cloud is more dense while in other places more thin. The density of the cloud
corresponds to the probability of finding the electron in a particular place. Space distribution of this density (probability)
is what we can calculate using quantum mechanics. Results of such calculation for hydrogen atom are shown in Fig. 15.1 . As was mentioned above, the most probable distance (maximum of the curve) coincides with the Bohr radius. 

Quantum mechanical equation for any bound system (like an atom) can have solutions only at a discrete set of energies &lt;math&gt;E_1, E_2, E_3 \dots&lt;math&gt; &lt;/math&gt;, etc. There are simply no solutions for the energies &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in between these values, such as, for instance, &lt;math&gt;E_1 &lt; E &lt; E_2&lt;/math&gt;. This is why a bound system  of microscopic particles cannot have an arbitrary energy and can only be in one of the quantum states. Each of such states has certain energy and certain space configuration, i.e. distribution of the probability. A bound quantum system can make transitions from one quantum state to another either spontaneously or as a result of interaction  with other systems. The energy conservation law is one of the most fundamental and is valid in quantum world as well as in classical world. This means that any transition between the states with energies &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt; is accompanied with either emission or absorption of the energy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E=|E_i-E_j|&lt;/math&gt;. This is how an atom emits light. 

An electron is a very light particle. Its mass is negligible as compared to the total mass of the atom. For example, in the lightest
of all atoms, hydrogen, the electron constitutes only 0.054% of the atomic mass. In the silicon atoms that are the main component of the
rocks around us, all 14 electrons make up only 0.027% of the mass. Thus, when holding a heavy rock in your hand, you actually feel the
collective weight of all the nuclei that are inside it.</text>

= Nucleus =

Is the nucleus a solid body? Is it an elementary building block of nature?! Although it is very small, a nucleus consists of something even smaller. 

== Proton ==

The only way to do experiments with such small objects as atoms and nuclei, is to collide them with each other and watch what happens. Perhaps you think that this is a barbaric way, like colliding a ''Mercedes'' and ''Toyota'' in order to learn what is under their bonnets. But with microscopic particles nothing else can be done.

In the early 1920s Rutherford and other physicists made many experiments, changing one element into another by striking them with
energetic helium nuclei. They noticed that all the time hydrogen nuclei were emitted in the process. It was apparent that the
hydrogen nucleus played a fundamental role in nuclear structure and was a constituent part of all other nuclei. By the late 1920's
physicists were regularly referring to hydrogen nucleus as ''proton''. The term ''proton'' seems to have been coined by
Rutherford, and first appears in print in 1920.

== Neutron ==

Thus it was established that atomic nuclei consist of protons. The number of protons in a nucleus is
such that makes up its positive charge. This number, therefore, coincides with the atomic number of
the element in the Mendeleev's Periodic table. 

This sounded nice and logical, but serious questions remained. Indeed, how can positively charged protons stay together in a
nucleus? Repelling each other by electric force, they should fly away in different directions. Who keeps them together?

Furthermore, the proton mass is not enough to account for the nuclear masses. For example, if the protons were the only particles
in the nucleus, then a helium nucleus (atomic number 2) would have two protons and therefore only twice the mass of hydrogen. However,
it actually is four times heavier than hydrogen. This suggests that it must be something else inside nuclei in addition to protons.

These additional particles that kind of ''glue'' the protons and make up the nuclear mass, apparently, are electrically neutral. They
were therefore called ''neutrons''. Rutherford predicted the existence of the neutron in 1920. Twelve years later, in 1932, his
assistant James Chadwick found it and measured its mass, which turned out to be almost the same but slightly larger than that of the proton.

==  Isotopes ==

Thus, in the early 1930s it was finally proved that atomic nucleus consists of two types of particles, the protons and neutrons. The protons are positively
charged while the neutrons are electrically neutral. The proton charge is exactly equal but opposite to that of the electron. The
masses of proton and neutron are almost the same, approximately 1836 and 1839 electron masses, respectively.

Apart from the electric charge, the proton and neutron have almost the same properties. This is why there is a common name for them:
''nucleon''. Both the proton and neutron are nucleons, like a man and a woman are both humans. In physics literature, the proton is
denoted by letter &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the neutron by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes, when the difference between them is unimportant, it is used the letter &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; 
meaning nucleon (in the same sense as using the word ''person'' instead of man or woman).

Chemical properties of an element are determined by the charge of its atomic nucleus, i.e. by the number of protons. This number is
called the ''atomic number'' and is denoted by letter &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. The mass of an atom depends on how many nucleons its nucleus contains.
The number of nucleons, i.e. total number of protons and neutrons, is called the ''atomic mass number'' and is denoted by letter &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 

Standard nuclear notation shows the chemical symbol, the mass number and the atomic number of the isotope.

[[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl2.png|13px|]]

For example, the iron nucleus (26-th place in the Mendeleev's periodic table of the elements) with 26 protons and 30 neutrons is denoted as &lt;math&gt;{}^{56}_{26}{\rm Fe}\ &lt;/math&gt;, where the total nuclear charge is &lt;math&gt;Z=26&lt;/math&gt; and the mass number &lt;math&gt;A=56&lt;/math&gt;. The number of neutrons is simply the difference &lt;math&gt;N=A-Z&lt;/math&gt;(here, it is used the same letter &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, as for nucleon, but this should not cause any confusion). Chemical symbol is inseparably linked with &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.  This is why the lower index is sometimes omitted and you may encounter the simplified notation like &lt;math&gt;{}^{56}{\rm Fe}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we add or remove a few neutrons from a nucleus, the chemical properties of the atom remain the same because its charge is the
same. This means that such atom should remain in the same place of the Periodic table. In Greek, ''same place'' reads &lt;math&gt;\acute{\iota}\sigma o\varsigma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\tau \acute{o}\pi o\varsigma&lt;/math&gt; (isos topos). The nuclei, having the same number of protons, but
different number of neutrons, are called therefore ''isotopes''.

Different isotopes of a given element have the same atomic number &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, but different mass numbers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; since they have different 
numbers of neutrons &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Chemical properties of different isotopes of an element are identical, but they will often have great
differences in nuclear stability. For stable isotopes of the light elements, the number of neutrons will be almost equal to the number
of protons, but for heavier elements, the number of neutrons is always greater than &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and the neutron excess tends to grow when 
&lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; increases. This is because neutrons are kind of glue that keeps repelling protons together. The greater the repelling charge, the
more glue you need.</text>

= Nuclear force =

Since atomic nuclei are very stable, the protons and neutrons must be kept inside them by some force and this force
must be rather strong. What is this force? All of modern particle physics was discovered in the effort to understand this force!

Trying to answer this question, at the beginning of the twentieth century, physicists found that all they knew before, was inadequate to explain how the nucleus held together in spite of the electrostatic repulsion of the protons pushing it apart.
They knew only gravitational and electromagnetic forces. It was clear that the forces holding
nucleons were not electromagnetic. Indeed, the protons, being positively charged, repel each other and all nuclei would decay in a
split of a second if some other forces would not hold them together. On the other hand, it was also clear that they were not
gravitational, which would be too weak for the task.

The simple conclusion was that nucleons are able to attract each other by yet unknown ''nuclear forces'', which are stronger than
the electromagnetic ones. Further studies proved that this hypothesis was correct.

Nuclear force has rather unusual properties. Firstly, it is charge independent. This means that in all pairs &lt;math&gt;nn&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;pp&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;np&lt;/math&gt; nuclear forces are the same. 

Secondly, at distances of about &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt; meter, the nuclear force is attractive and very strong, roughly 100 times stronger than electromagnetic repulsion.  

Thirdly, the nuclear force is of a very short range. If the nucleons
move away from each other for more than few ''fermi'' (1 fermi = 1 fm [femtometer] = &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt; meter) the nuclear attraction practically disappears. Therefore the nuclear force looks like a ''strong man with very short arms''.</text>

== Binding energy and nuclear masses ==
When a system of particles is bound, you have to spend certain energy to disintegrate it, i.e. to separate the particles. The easiest way to do it is to strike the system with
a moving particle that carries kinetic energy, like we can destroy a glass bottle with a bullet or a stone. If our bullet-particle moves
too slow (i.e. does not have enough kinetic energy) it cannot disintegrate the system. On the other hand, if its kinetic energy is
too high, the system is not only disintegrated but the separated particles acquire some kinetic energy, i.e. move away with some
speed. There is an intermediate value of the energy which is just enough to destroy the system without giving its fragments any speed.
This minimal energy needed to break up a bound system is called ''binding energy'' of this system. It is usually denoted by letter &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. 

== Nuclear energy units ==
The standart unit of energy, the ''joule'', is too large to measure the energies associated with individual
nuclei. This is why in nuclear physics it is more convenient to use a much smaller unit called megaelectronvolt (MeV). This is the
amount of energy that an electron acquires after passing between two charged plates with the potential difference (voltage) of one
million volts. Sounds very huge, isn't it? But look at this relation
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1\,{\rm MeV}=1.602\times10^{-19}\,{\rm J}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and think again. In the units of MeV, most of the energies in nuclear world can be expressed by values with only few digits before
decimal point and without ten to the power of something. For example, the binding energy of proton and neutron (which is the
simplest nuclear system and is called ''deuteron'') is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;B_{pn}=2.225\,{\rm MeV}\ .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The simplicity of the numbers is not the only advantage of using the unit MeV. Another, more important advantage, comes from the fact
that most of experiments in nuclear physics are collision experiments, where particles are accelerated by electric field and
collide with other particles. From the above value of &lt;math&gt;B_{pn}&lt;/math&gt;, for instance, we immediately know that in order to break up deuterons,
we need to bombard them with a flux of electrons accelerated through a voltage not less than 2.225 million volts. No calculation is
needed! On the other hand, if we know that a charged particle (with a unit charge) passes through a voltage, say, 5 million volts, we
can, without any calculation, say that it acquires the energy of 5 MeV. It is very convenient. Isn't it?

== Mass defect ==
Comparing the masses of atomic nuclei with the masses of the nucleons that constitute them, we encounter a
surprising fact: Total mass of the nucleons is greater than mass of the nucleus! For example, for the deuteron we have
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;m_d &lt; m_p + m_n\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center
where &lt;math&gt;m_d&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;m_p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;m_n&lt;/math&gt; are the masses of deuteron, proton and neutron, respectively. The difference is rather small,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(m_p+m_n)-m_d= 3.968\times10^{-30}\,{\rm kg}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
but on the nuclear scale is noticeable since the mass of proton, for example,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;m_p=1672.623\times10^{-30}\,{\rm kg}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
is also very small. This phenomenon is called ''''mass defect''''.
Where the mass disappears to, when nucleons are bound?
To answer this question, we notice that the energy of a bound state is lower than the energy of free particles. Indeed, to liberate them
from a bound complex, we have to give them some energy. Thinking in the opposite direction, we conclude that, when forming a bound
state, the particles have to get rid of the energy excess, which is exactly equal to the binding energy. This is observed
experimentally: When a proton captures a neutron to form a deuteron, the excess energy of 2.225MeV
is emitted via electromagnetic radiation.
A logical conclusion from the above comes by itself: When proton and neutron are bounding, some part of their mass disappears together
with the energy that is carried away by the radiation. And in the opposite process, when we break up the deutron, we give it the
energy, some part of which makes up the lost masses
Albert Einstein came to the idea of the equivalence between the mass and energy long before any experimental evidences were found. In his
theory of relativity, he showed that total energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; of a moving body with mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is 
{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E=\frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.1)
|}
where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is its velocity and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the speed of light. Applying this 
equation to a non-moving body (&lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;), we conclude that it possesses the ''rest'' energy
{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_0=mc^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.2)
|}
simply because it has mass. As you will see, this very formula is the basis for making nuclear bombs and nuclear power stations!

All the development of physics and chemistry, preceding the theory of relativity, was based on the assumption that the mass and energy
of a closed system are conserving in all possible processes and they are conserved separately. In reality, it turned out that the
conserving quantity is the ''mass-energy'', 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm kin}+E_{\rm pot}+E_{\rm rad}+mc^2={\rm const}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
i.e. the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy, the energy of radiation, and the mass of the system.
In chemical reactions the fraction of the mass that is transformed into other forms of energy (and vice versa), is so small that it is
not detectable even in most precise measurements. In nuclear processes, however, the energy release is very often millions times
higher and therefore is observable.
You should not think that mutual transformations of mass and energy are the features of only nuclear and atomic processes. If you break
up a piece of rubber or chewing gum, for example, in two parts, then the sum of masses of these parts will be slightly larger than the
mass of the whole piece. Of course we will not be able to detect this ''mass defect'' with our scales. But we can calculate it, using
the Einstein formula (15.1). For this, we would need to measure somehow the mechanical work ''W'' used to break up the whole 
piece (i.e. the amount of energy supplied to it). This can be done by measuring the force and displacement in the breaking process.
Then, according to Eq. (15.2), the mass defect is
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta m=\frac{W}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To estimate possible effect, let us assume that we need to stretch a piece of rubber in 10cm before it breaks, and the average force
needed for this is 10N (approximately 1 kg). Then 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;W=10\,{\rm N}\times 0.1\,{\rm m}=1\,{\rm J} &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;
and hence
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta m=\frac{1\,{\rm J}}{(299792458\,{\rm m/s})^2}\approx1.1\times10^{-17}\,{\rm kg}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
This is very small value for measuring with a scale, but huge as compared to typical masses of atoms and nuclei.

== Nuclear masses ==
Apparently, an individual nucleus cannot be put on a scale to measure its mass. Then how can nuclear masses be measured?
This is done with the help of the devices called ''mass spectrometers''. In them, a flux of identical nuclei, accelerated to
a certain energy, is directed to a screen where it makes a visible mark. Before striking the screen, this flux passes through magnetic
field, which is perpendicular to velocity of the nuclei. As a result, the flux is deflected to certain angle. The greater the
mass, the smaller is the angle (because of inertia). Thus, measuring the displacement of the mark from the center of the screen, we can
find the deflection angle and then calculate the mass.
Since mass and energy are equivalent, in nuclear physics it is customary to measure masses of all particles in the units of energy,
namely, in MeV. Examples of masses of subatomic particles are given in Table 15.1

The values given in this table, are the energies to which the nuclear masses are equivalent via the Einstein formula 15.1.

There are several advantages of using the units of MeV to measure particle masses. First of all, like with nuclear energies, we avoid
handling very small numbers that involve ten to the power of something. For example, if we were measuring masses in kg, the
electron mass would be  &lt;math&gt;m_e=9.1093897 \times 10^{-31}&lt;/math&gt; kg. When masses are given in the equivalent energy units, it is very easy to
calculate the mass defect. Indeed, adding the masses of proton and neutron, given in the second and third rows of Table 15.1, and subtracting the mass of &lt;math&gt;{}^2_1&lt;/math&gt;H, 
we obtain the binding energy 2.225MeV of the deuteron without further ado. One more advantage comes from particle physics. In collisions of very fast moving particles new particles (like
electrons) can be created from vacuum, i.e. kinetic energy is directly transformed into mass. If the mass is expressed in the
energy units, we know how much energy is needed to create this or that particle, without calculations.</text>

= Radioactivity =

As was said before, the nucleus experiences the intense struggle between the electric repulsion of protons and
nuclear attraction of the nucleons to each other. It therefore should not be surprising that there are many nuclei that are
unstable. They can spontaneously (i.e. without an external push) break in pieces. When the fragments reach the distances where the
short range nuclear attraction disappears, they fiercely push each other away by the electric forces. Thus accelerated, they move in
different directions like small bullets making destruction on their way. This is an example of nuclear radioactivity but there are
several other varieties of radioactive decay.

== Discovery of radioactivity ==

Nuclear radioactivity was discovered by Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1896. Following Wilhelm Roentgen who
discovered the X-rays, Becquerel pursued his own investigations of these mysterious rays.

The material Becquerel chose to work with contained uranium. He found that the crystals containing uranium and exposed to sunlight,
made images on photographic plates even wrapped in black paper. He mistakenly concluded that the sun's energy was being absorbed by
the uranium which then emitted X-rays. The truth was revealed thanks to bad weather.katie

On the 26th and 27th of February 1896 the skies over Paris were overcast and the uranium crystals Becquerel intended to expose to
the sun were returned to a drawer and put over (by chance) the photographic plates. On the first of March, Becquerel developed the
plates and to his surprise, found that the images on them were clear and strong. Therefore the uranium emitted radiation without an
external source of energy such as the sun. This was the first observation of the nuclear radioactivity.

Later, Becquerel demonstrated that the uranium radiation was similar to the X-rays but, unlike them, could be deflected by a
magnetic field and therefore must consist of charged particles. For his discovery of radioactivity, Becquerel was awarded the 1903 Nobel
Prize for physics.

== Nuclear alpha, beta, and gamma rays ==

Classical experiment that revealed complex content of the nuclear radiation, was done as
follows. The radium crystals (another radioactive element) were put at the bottom of a narrow straight channel made in a thick piece of
lead and open at one side. The lead absorbed everything except the particles moving along the channel. This device therefore produced a
flux of particles moving in one direction like bullets from a machine gun. In front of the channel
was a photoplate that could register the particles. 

Without the magnetic field, the image on the plate was in the form of one single dot. When the device was immersed into a perpendicular
magnetic field, the flux of particles was split in three fluxes, which was reflected by three dots on the photographic plate.

One of the three fluxes was straight, while two others were deflected in opposite directions. This showed that the initial flux contained
positive, negative, and neutral particles. They were named respectively the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; particles. 


The &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-rays were found to be the &lt;math&gt;{}^4&lt;/math&gt;He nuclei, two protons and two neutrons bound together. They have weak penetrating ability,
a few centimeters of air or a few sheets of paper can effectively block them. The &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-rays proved to be electrons. They have a 
greater penetrating power than the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-particles and can penetrate 3mm of aluminum. The &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-rays are not deflected 
because they are high energy photons. They have the same nature as the radio waves, visible light, and the X-rays, but have much
shorter wavelength and therefore are much more energetic. Among the three, the &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-rays have the greatest penetrating power being 
able to pass through several centimeters of lead and still be detected on the other side.

== Danger of the ionizing radiation ==

The &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; particles moving through matter, collide with atoms and knock out
electrons from them, i.e. make positive ions out of the atoms. This is why these rays are called ''ionizing radiation''.

Apart from ionizing the atoms, this radiation destroys molecules. For humans and all other organisms, this is the most dangerous
feature of the radiation. Imagine thousands of tiny tiny bullets passing through your body and making destruction on their way.
Although people do not feel any pain when exposed to nuclear radiation, it harms the cells of the body and thus can make people
sick or even kill them. Illness can strike people years after their exposure to nuclear radiation. For example, the ionizing particles
can randomly modify the DNA (long organic molecules that store all the information on how a particular cell should function in the
body). As a result, some cells with wrong DNA may become cancer cells.

Fortunately, our body is able to repair some damages caused by radiation. Indeed, we are constantly bombarded by the radiation
coming from the outer space as well as from the inner parts of our own planet and still survive. However, if the number of damages
becomes too large, the body will not cope with them anymore.

There are established norms and acceptable limits for the radiation that are considered safe for human body. If you are going to work in
contact with radioactive materials or near them, make sure that the exposure dose is monitored and the limits are adhered to.

You should understand that no costume can protect you from &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-rays! Only a thick wall of concrete or metal can stop 
them. The special costumes and masks that people wear when handling radioactive materials, protect them not from the rays but from
contamination with those materials. Imagine if few specks of radioactive dirt stain your everyday clothes or if you inhale
radioactive atoms. They will remain with you all the time and will shoot the ''bullets'' at you even when you are sleeping.

In many cases, a very effective way of protecting yourself from the radiation is to keep a certain distance away. Radiation from nuclear
sources is distributed equally in all directions. Therefore the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of dangerous particles passing every second through a 
unit area (say &lt;math&gt;1 cm^2&lt;/math&gt;) is the total number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of particles emitted during 1 second, divided by the surface of a sphere 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;n=\frac{N}{4\pi r^2}\ &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance at which we make the observation. From this simple formula, it is seen that the radiation intensity falls
down with increasing distance quadratically. In other words, if you increase the distance by a factor of 2, your exposure to the
radiation will be decreased by a factor of 4.

== Decay law ==

Unstable nuclei decay spontaneously. A given nucleus can decay next moment, next day or even next century. Nobody
can predict when it is going to happen. Despite this seemingly chaotic and ''unscientific''
situation, there is a strict order in all this.

Atomic nuclei, being microscopic objects, are ruled by quantum probabilistic laws. Although we cannot predict the exact moment of
its decay, we can calculate the probability that a nucleus will decay within this or that time interval. Nuclei decay because of
their internal dynamics and not because they become ''old'' or somehow ''rotten''.

To illustrate this, let us imagine that yesterday morning we found that a certain nucleus was going to decay within 24 hours with the
probability of 50%. However, this morning we found that it is still ''alive''. This fact does not mean that the decay probability for
another 24 hours increased. Not at all! It remains the same, 50%, because the nucleus remains the same, nothing wrong happened to
it. This can go on and on for centuries.

Actually, we never deal with individual nuclei but rather with huge numbers of identical nuclei. For such collections (ensembles) of
quantum objects, the probabilistic laws become statistical laws. Let us assume that in the above example we had 1 million identical
nuclei instead of only one. Then by this morning only half of these nuclei would survive because the decay probability for 24 hours was
50%. Among the remaining 500000 nuclei, 250000 will decay by tomorrow morning, then after another 24 hours only 125000 will
remain and so on.

The number of unstable nuclei that are still ''alive'' continuously decreases with time according to the curve shown in Fig. 15.2

{| 
|+ '''Figure: 15.2 ''' ''The time T1/2 during which one half of the initial amount of unstable particles decay, is called their half-life time.''
|[[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl3.png|fhsst_atomnucl3.png]]
|}

If initially, at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, their number is &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt;, then after certain time interval &lt;math&gt;T_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; only half of these nuclei will 
remain, namely, &lt;math&gt;\frac12 N_0&lt;/math&gt;. Another one half of the remaining half will decay during another such interval. So, after the time
&lt;math&gt;2T_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, we will have only one quarter of the initial amount, and so on. The time interval &lt;math&gt;T_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, during which one half of 
unstable nuclei decay, is called their ''half-life time''. It is specific for each unstable nucleus and vary from a fraction of a
second to thousands and millions of years. A few examples of such lifetimes are given in Table 15.2

== Radioactive dating ==

Examining the amounts of the decay products makes possible radioactive dating. The most famous is the
''Carbon dating'', a variety of radioactive dating which is applicable only to matter which was once living and presumed to be
in equilibrium with the atmosphere, taking in carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis.

Cosmic ray protons blast nuclei in the upper atmosphere, producing neutrons which in turn bombard nitrogen, the major constituent of
the atmosphere. This neutron bombardment produces the radioactive isotope &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt;C. The radioactive carbon-14 combines 
with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and is incorporated into the cycle of living things.

The isotope &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt; decays (see Table 15.2) inside living bodies but is replenished
from the air and food. Therefore, while an organism is alive, the concentration of this isotope in the body remains constant. After
death, the replenishment from the breath and food stops, but the isotopes that are in the dead body continue to decay. As a result
the concentration of  &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt;C in it gradually decreases according to the curve shown in Fig. 15.2. The time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; on this Figure 
corresponds to the moment of death, and &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium concentration of &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt;C in living organisms. 

Therefore, by measuring the radioactive emissions from once-living matter and comparing its activity with the equilibrium level of
emissions from things living today, an estimation of the time elapsed can be made. For example, if the rate of the radioactive
emissions from a piece of wood, caused by the decay of &lt;math&gt;{}^{14}_{6}&lt;/math&gt;C, is one-half lower than from living trees, 
then we can conclude that we are at the point &lt;math&gt;t=T_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; on the curve 15.2, i.e. it is elapsed exactly one
half-life-time period. According to the Table 15.2, this means that the tree, from which this piece of wood was made, was cut approximately 5730 years ago.

This is how physicists help archaeologists to assign dates to various organic materials.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Central banks&lt;/b&gt; are national banks that primarily control the monetary policy of the national economy, through changes in the &lt;i&gt;interest rate&lt;/i&gt;. However, they also perform other duties, such as holding reserves of foreign currency, bankrolling government borrowing, and acting as the 'banker's bank', or the 'lender of last resort'.

There are two types of central bank, those that are state-controlled or at best quasi-independent, and those that are fully independent such as the US [[w:Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve]] and UK [[w:Bank of England|Bank of England]] (since 1997). Due to the potential for political interference in economic policy, with aims other than macroeconomic stability, the potential for infamous &lt;i&gt;boom and bust&lt;/i&gt; cycles in an economy is greater for non-independent central banks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Organizing the book ==
I noticed your new book [[Using Ratpoison]]. It seems to get very professional. I just want to let you know at an early stage, that a prefered way of creating subpages is &quot;/&quot; or &quot;:&quot; (without spaces before and afterwards), where &quot;/&quot; gives you the additional advantage that you get an automatic link back to your main page. Have a look at the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]] or the recent conversion at [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]]. 
I'd therefore recommend to organize your book like this:
 [[Using Ratpoison]]        &lt;- should be what you currently call Table of Contents
 [[Using Ratpoison/Cover]]  &lt;- Move your cover here (you can link from the bookshelf here)
 [[Using Ratpoison/Introduction]]  &lt;- move &quot;What is Ratpoison&quot; and &quot;Pros and cons&quot; here
 [[Using Ratpoison/Your first steps]]
and so on.
Avoid having too many subpages if you don't have the content yet. For your book, 3 or 4 subpages are enough (more can be easily created later as soon as you have enough content). If there are questions, just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:11, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:Thank you very much for your feedback. This is in fact my first wikibook, so I am glad for any hints that I can get. I will edit the pages subsequently as soon as I can find some spare time. [[User:Etnoy|Etnoy]] 08:16, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty here to implement this.  Don't forget that the pipe character '|' can be used to show a link name that differs from the link path, for clarity's sake.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:04, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:Actually, it looks like Etnoy has this well in-hand, the bookshelf just needs a little cleanup.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:09, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Reorganisation ==
I merged the two ToCs, it might be prudent to delete the old one.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:21, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, now that I think of it, this should go in the ToC, and the Cover should go here. [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:21, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: Done!  Hope that's made it a little more prettiful.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:28, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

= Nuclear Reactions =

Those of you who studied chemistry, are familiar with the notion of chemical reaction, which, in essence, is
just regrouping of atoms that constitute molecules. As a result, reagent chemical compounds are
transformed into product compounds.

In the world of nuclear particles, similar processes are possible. When nuclei are close to each other, nucleons from one nucleus can
''jump'' into another one. This happens because there are attractive and repulsive forces between the nucleons. The complicated interplay
of these forces may cause their regrouping. As a result, the reagent particles are transformed into product particles. Such
processes are called ''nuclear reactions''.

For example, when two isotopes &lt;math&gt;{}^3_2&lt;/math&gt;He collide, the six nucleons constituting them, can rearrange in such a way that the isotope
&lt;math&gt;{}^4_2&lt;/math&gt;He is formed and two protons are liberated. Similarly to chemical reactions, this process is denoted as

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}^3_2{\rm He} + {}^3_2{\rm He} \longrightarrow{}^4_2{\rm He} + p + p + 12.86\,{\rm MeV}\ \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (15.3)
|}

The same as in chemical reactions, nuclear reactions can also be either exothermic (i.e. releasing energy) or endothermic (i.e.
requiring an energy input). The above reaction releases 12.86MeV of energy. This is because the total mass on the left hand side of
Eq. (15.3) is in 12.86MeV greater than the total mass of the products on the right hand side (you can
check this using Table 15.1).

Thus, when considering a particular nuclear reaction, we can always learn if it releases or absorbs energy. For this, we only need to
compare total masses on the left and right hand sides of the equation. Now, you can understand why it is very convenient to
express masses in the units of energy.

Composing equations like (15.3), we should always check the superscripts and subscripts of the nuclei in order
to have the same number of nucleons and the same charge on both sides of the equation. In the above example, we have six nucleons
and the charge +4 in both the initial and final states of the reaction. To make the checking of nucleon number and charge
conservation easier, sometimes the proton and neutron are denoted with superscripts and subscripts as well, namely, &lt;math&gt;{}^1_1p&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;{}^1_0n&lt;/math&gt;. 

In this case, all we need is to check that sum of superscripts and sum of subscripts are the same on both sides of the equation.</text>

= Detectors =

How can we observe such tiny tiny things as protons and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-particles? There is no microscope that would be 
able to discern them. From the very beginning of the sub-atomic era, scientists have been working on the development of special
instruments that are called particle detectors. These devices enable us either to register the mere fact that certain particle has passed
through certain point in space or to observe the trace of its path (the trajectory). Actually, this is as good as watching the
particle. Although the particle sizes are awfully small, when passing through some substances, they leave behind visible traces of
tens of centimeters in length. By measuring the curvature of the trajectory of a particle deflected in electric or magnetic field, a
physicist can determine the charge and mass of the particle and thus can identify it.

== Geiger counter ==

The most familiar device for registering charged particles is the Geiger counter. It cannot tell
you anything about the particle except the fact that it has passed through the counter. The counter consists of a thin metal cylinder
filled with gas. A wire electrode runs along the center of the tube and is kept at a high voltage (&lt;math&gt;\sim 2000&lt;/math&gt;V) relative to the 
cylinder. When a particle passes through the tube, it causes ionization of the gas atoms and thus an electric discharge between
the cylinder and the wire. The electric pulse can be counted by a computer or made to produce a ''click'' in a loudspeaker. The number
of counts per second tells us about intensity of the radiation.

== Fluorescent screen ==

The very first detector was the fluorescent screen. When a charged particle hits the screen, a human
eye can discern a flash of light at the point of impact. In fact, we all use this kind of detectors every day when watching TV of looking
at a computer (if it does not have an LCD screen of course). Indeed, the images on the screens of their electron-ray tubes are formed by
the accelerated electrons.

== Photo-emulsion ==

Another type of particle detector, dating back to Becquerel, is the nuclear photographic emulsion.
Passage of charged particles is recorded in the emulsion in the same way that ordinary black and white photographic film records a
picture. The only difference is that nuclear photoemulsion is made rather thick in order to catch a significant part of the particle
path. After the developing, a permanent record of the charged particle trajectory is available.

== Wilson's chamber ==

In the fields of sub-atomic physics and nuclear physics, Wilson's cloud chamber is the most fundamental
device to observe the trajectories of particles. Its basic principle was discovered by C. T. R. Wilson
in 1897, and it was put to the practical use in 1911. 

The top and the side of the chamber are covered with round glasses of several centimeters in diameter. At the bottom of the chamber, a
piston is placed. The air filled in the chamber is saturated with vapor of water. When pulling down the piston quickly, the volume of
the chamber would be expanded and the temperature goes down. As a result, the air inside would be supersaturated with the vapor. If a
fast moving charged particle enters the chamber when it is in such a supersaturated state, the vapor of water would condense along the
line of the ions generated by the particle, which is the path of the particle. Thus we can observe the trace, and also take a photograph.
To make clear the trace, a light is sometimes illuminated from the side. When placing the cloud chamber in a magnetic field, we can
obtain various informations about the charged particle by measuring the curvature of the trace and other data. The bubble chamber and
the spark chamber have taken place of the cloud chamber which is nowadays used only for the educational purposes. Wilson's cloud
chamber has however played a very important role in the history of physics.

== Bubble chamber ==

Bubble chamber is a particle detector of major importance during the initial years of high-energy physics.
The bubble chamber has produced a wealth of physics from about 1955 well into the 1970s. It is based on the principle of bubble
formation in a liquid heated above its boiling point, which is then suddenly expanded, starting boiling where passing charged particles
have ionized the atoms of the liquid. The technique was honoured by the Nobel prize award to D. Glaser in 1960. Even today, bubble
chamber photographs provide the aesthetically most appealing visualization of subnuclear collisions.

== Spark chamber ==

Spark chamber is a historic device using electric discharges over a gap between two electrodes with
large potential difference, to render passing particles visible. Sparks occurred where the gas had been ionized. Most often, multiple
short gaps were used, but wide-gap chambers with gaps up to 40 cm were also built. The spark chamber is still of great scientific
value in that it remains relatively simple and cheap to build as well as enabling an observer to view the paths of charged particles.</text>

= Nuclear Energy =

Nuclei can produce energy via two different types of reactions, namely, ''fission'' and ''fusion''
reactions. Fission is a break up of a nucleus in two or more pieces (smaller nuclei). Fusion is the opposite process: Formation of a
bigger nucleus from two small nuclei.

A question may arise: How two opposite processes can both produce energy? Can we make an inexhaustible souce of energy by breaking up
and then fusing the same nuclei? Of course not! The energy conservation law cannot be circumvented in no way. When speaking
about fusion and fission, we speak about different ranges of nuclei. Energy can only be released when either light nuclei fuse or heavy nuclei fission.

To understand why this is so, let us recollect that for releasing energy the mass of initial nuclei must be greater than the mass of
the products of a nuclear reaction. The mass difference is transformed into the released energy. And why the product nuclei can
loose some mass as compared to the initial nuclei? Because they are more tightly
bound, i.e. their binding energies are lager.

Fig. 15.3 shows the dependence of the binding energy &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; per nucleon on the number &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of nucleons constituting a 
nucleus. As you see, the curve reaches the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;\sim9&lt;/math&gt;MeV per nucleon at around &lt;math&gt;A\sim50&lt;/math&gt;. The nuclei with such 
number of nucleons cannot produce energy neither through fusion nor through fission. They are kind of ''ashes'' and cannot serve as a
fuel. In contrast to them, very light nuclei, when fused with each other, make more tightly bound products as well as very heavy nuclei
do when split up in lighter fragments.


{|

|}

In fission processes, which were discovered and used first, a heavy nucleus like, for example, uranium or plutonium, splits up in two
fragments which are both positively charged. These fragments repel each other by an electric force and move apart at a high speed,
distributing their kinetic energy in the surrounding material. 

In fusion reactions everything goes in the opposite direction. Very light nuclei, like hydrogen or helium isotopes, when approaching
each other to a distance of a few fm (&lt;math&gt;1fm = 10^{-13}&lt;/math&gt;cm), experience strong attraction which overpowers their Coulomb (that is
electric) repulsion. As a result the two nuclei fuse into a single nucleus. They collapse with extremely high speeds towards each
other. To form a stable nucleus they must get rid of the excessive energy. This energy is emitted by ejecting a neutron or a photon.</text>

= Nuclear Reactors =

Since the discovery of radioactivity it was known that heavy nuclei release energy in the processes of
spontaneous decay. This process, however, is rather slow and cannot be influenced (speed up or slow down) by humans and therefore could
not be effectively used for large-scale energy production. Nonetheless, it is ideal for feeding the devices that must work
autonomously in remote places for a long time and do not require much energy. For this, heat from the spontaneous-decays can be
converted into electric power in a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. These generators have been used to power space probes
and some lighthouses built by Russian engineers. Much more effective way of using nuclear energy is based on another type of
nuclear decay which is considered next.

== Chain reaction ==

The discovery that opened up the era of nuclear energy was made in 1939 by German physicists O. Hahn,
L. Meitner, F Strassmann, and O. Frisch. They found that a uranium nucleus, after absorbing a neutron, splits into two fragments. This
was not a spontaneous but induced fission 

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}n+ {}^{235}_{92}{\rm U} \longrightarrow {}^{140}_{54}{\rm Xe} +{}^{94}_{38}{\rm Sr}+ n + n + 185\,{\rm MeV}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.4)
|}

that released &lt;math&gt;\sim185&lt;/math&gt;MeV of energy as well as two neutrons which could cause similar reactions on surrounding nuclei. The fact that
instead of one initial neutron, in the reaction (15.4) we obtain two neutrons, is crucial. This gives us the possibility to make the so-called ''chain reaction''
schematically shown in Fig. 15.4.


{|
|+ '''Figure 15.4: ''' ''Chain reaction on uranium nuclei.''
|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl5.png|400px|]]
|}

In such process, one neutron breaks one heavy nucleus, the two released neutrons break two more heavy nuclei and produce four
neutrons which, in turn, can break another four nuclei and so on. This process develops extremely fast. In a split of a second a huge
amount of energy can be released, which means explosion. In fact, this is how the so-called atomic bomb works.

Can we control the development of the chain reaction? Yes we can! This is done in nuclear reactors that produce energy for our use.
How can it be done?

== Critical mass ==

First of all, if the piece of material containing fissile nuclei is too small, some neutrons may
reach its surface and escape without causing further fissions. For each type of fissile material there is therefore a minimal mass of a
sample that can support explosive chain reaction. It is called the ''critical mass''. For example, the critical mass of &lt;math&gt;{}^{235}_{92}{\rm U}&lt;/math&gt;is approximately 50kg. 
If the mass is below the critical value, nuclear explosion is not possible, but the energy is still released and the sample becomes hot. The
closer mass is to its critical value, the more energy is released and more intensive is the neutron radiation from the sample.

The criticality of a sample (i.e. its closeness to the critical state) can be reduced by changing its geometry (making its surface
bigger) or by putting inside it some other material (boron or cadmium) that is able to absorb neutrons. On the other hand, the
criticality can be increased by putting neutron reflectors around the sample. These reflectors work like mirrors from which the
escaped neutrons bounce back into the sample. Thus, moving in and out the absorbing material and reflectors, we can keep the sample
close to the critical state. 

== How a nuclear reactor works ==

In a typical nuclear reactor, the fuel is not in one piece, but in the form of several hundred
vertical rods, like a brush. Another system of rods that contain a neutron absorbing material (control rods) can move up and down in
between the fuel rods. When totally in, the control rods absorb so many neutrons, that the reactor is shut down. To start the reactor,
operator gradually moves the control rods up. In an emergency situation they are dropped down automatically.

To collect the energy, water flows through the reactor core. It becomes extremely hot and goes to a steam generator. There, the heat
passes to water in a secondary circuit that becomes steam for use outside the reactor enclosure for rotating turbines that generate
electricity.

== Nuclear power in South Africa ==

By 2004 South Africa had only one commercial nuclear reactor supplying power into the national grid.
It works in Koeberg located 30km north of Cape Town. A small research reactor was also operated at Pelindaba as part of the
nuclear weapons program, but was dismantled.

Koeberg Nuclear Power station is a uranium Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). In such a reactor, the primary coolant loop is pressurised so
the water does not boil, and heat exchangers, called steam generators, are used to transmit heat to a secondary coolant which
is allowed to boil to produce steam. To remove as much heat as possible, the water temperature in the primary loop is allowed to
rise up to about &lt;math&gt;300^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;C which requires the pressure of 150 atmospheres (to keep water from boiling).

The Koeberg power station has the largest turbine generators in the southern hemisphere and produces 1800 megawatts of electrical 
power. Construction of Koeberg began in 1976 and two of its Units were commissioned in 1984-1985. Since then, the plant has been in
more or less continuous operation and there have been no serious incidents.

Eskom that operates this power station, may be the current technology leader. It is developing a new type of nuclear reactor, a
modular pebble-bed reactor (PBMR). In contrast to traditional nuclear reactors, in this new type of reactors the fuel is not
assembled in the form of rods. The uranium, thorium or plutonium fuels are in oxides (ceramic form) contained within spherical
pebbles made of pyrolitic graphite. The pebbles, having a size of a tennis ball, are in a bin or can. An inert gas, helium, nitrogen or
carbon dioxide, circulates through the spaces between the fuel pebbles. This carries heat away from the reactor.

Ideally, the heated gas is run directly through a turbine. However since the gas from the primary coolant can be made radioactive by
the neutrons in the reactor, usually it is brought to a heat exchanger, where it heats another gas, or steam.

The primary advantage of pebble-bed reactors is that they can be designed to be inherently safe. When a pebble-bed reactor gets
hotter, the more rapid motion of the atoms in the fuel increases the probability of neutron capture by &lt;math&gt;{}^{238}_{92}&lt;/math&gt;U isotopes 
through an effect known as Doppler broadening. This isotope does not split up after capturing a neutron. This reduces the number of
neutrons available to cause  &lt;math&gt;{}^{235}_{92}&lt;/math&gt;U fission, reducing the power output by the reactor. This natural negative
feedback places an inherent upper limit on the temperature of the fuel without any operator intervention.

The reactor is cooled by an inert, fireproof gas, so it cannot have a steam explosion as a water reactor can.

A pebble-bed reactor thus can have all of its supporting machinery fail, and the reactor will not crack, melt, explode or spew
hazardous wastes. It simply goes up to a designed &quot;idle&quot; temperature, and stays there. In that state, the reactor vessel
radiates heat, but the vessel and fuel spheres remain intact and undamaged. The machinery can be repaired or the fuel can be removed.

A large advantage of the pebble bed reactor over a conventional water reactor is that they operate at higher temperatures. The
reactor can directly heat fluids for low pressure gas turbines. The high temperatures permit systems to get more mechanical energy from
the same amount of thermal energy. 

Another advantage is that fuel pebbles for different fuels might be used in the same basic design of reactor (though perhaps not at the
same time). Proponents claim that some kinds of pebble-bed reactors should be able to use thorium, plutonium and natural unenriched
Uranium, as well as the customary enriched uranium. One of the projects in progress is to develop pebbles and reactors that use the
plutonium from surplus or expired nuclear explosives. 


On June 25, 2003, the South African Republic's Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism approved ESKOM's prototype 110MW
pebble-bed modular reactor for Koeberg. Eskom also has approval for a pebble-bed fuel production plant in Pelindaba. The uranium for
this fuel is to be imported from Russia. If the trial is successful, Eskom says it will build up to ten local PBMR plants on
South Africa's seacoast. Eskom also wants to export up to 20 PBMR plants per year. The estimated export revenue is 8 billion rand a
year, and could employ about 57000 people.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition''', or '''[[w:J2ME|J2ME]]''', is a collection of [[w:java programming language|Java]] [[w:Application Programming Interface|API]]s targeting embedded consumer products such as [[w:Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]s, [[w:cell phone|cell phone]]s and other consumer appliances.

J2ME has become a popular option for creating games for cell phones, as they can be emulated on a [[w:Personal computer|PC]] during the development stage and easily uploaded to the phone.  This contrasts with the difficulty of developing, testing, and loading games for other special gaming platforms such as those made by [[w:Nintendo|Nintendo]], [[w:Sony|Sony]], and others, as expensive system-specific hardware and kits are required.

Often, introductions of J2ME gloss over areas that the beginning J2ME developer might improve  their learning process  and hopefully this set of articles will remove that obstacle.  What we will cover is the history leading up to [[w:J2ME|J2ME]]'s birth and beyond.  We will also cover the complexity of the whole J2ME API ecological system and hopefully this will help you in your J2ME development projects and applications.

Overall, the change from analogue to digital in both devices and infrastructure serving those devices has been the third unseen character in this J2ME evolution. Changes from analogue methods of cellular communciation to such standards as [[w:CDMA|CDMA]], [[w:TDMA|TDMA]],and [[w:WCDMA|WCDMA]]. Also, drastic changes in the vehicle computing and digital tv realm involving new standards such as [[w:DVB|DVB]], [[w:MHP|MHP]], [[w:HAVi|HAVi]], [[w:MPEG4|MPEG4]], [[w:OSGi|OSGi]], and etc have changed how computer languages such as Java and the J2ME platform interact with this new area.

===A brief history of Java on Mobile Devices (pre-platform and pre-jcp)===
This history is called pre-platform and occurs before the 1999 Sun event of renaming java portions as platform editions.  In the 1992  time span [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]] Engineers and  Venture Capital funded Startups contributed to a project called Green ({{Web_reference | title=Green | work=The Brief History of the Green Project | URL=http://today.java.net/jag/old/green/}}) to bring new Virtual Machine execution framework to embedded devices.  The device was called Star7 and was powered by a SPARC CPU.

The language which was called OAK at the time and its features were the result of the merge of FirstPerson, ON,  and Sun Microsystems. Although, not mentioned in this brief history ({{Web reference | title=Java 5th Birthday | work=JAVA TECHNOLOGY: THE EARLY YEARS | URL=http://java.sun.com/features/1998/05/birthday.html}}).  The first JVM was in fact completed by ON and based on Smalltalk according to The official Wiki version of history of Java Language ({{Web reference | title=Java History | work=The official Wiki version of history of Java Language | URL=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaHistory}}). Thus, the having the small foot print of a Virtual Machine not only benefited the birth of [[w:Java|Java]] but its steady climb during this period into browsers and the start of its rebirth into mobile devices.

Although Sun Microsystems concluded that some of its role during this period was to drive the Consumer Device market away from WINTEL to [[w:SPARC|SPARC]] processors it was the application killer app side that survived this risky startup time period. 

====PersonalJava (pJava)====
Sun's second exploration of java on mobile devices was centered around the idea of deploying a subset of JDK1.1.8 ({{Web reference | title=JDK1.1.8 | work=Java Development Kit 1.1.8_10 | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/archive/jdk/1.1.8_010/index.html}}) on mobile devices that have a more in depth display as opposed to just a character display. At this time, around 1998, one of the target devices for [[w:PersonalJava|PersonalJava]] was set boxes as evidence by press such as McNealy touts Java on set boxes ({{Web reference | title=McNealy | work= McNealy touts Java Everywhere, TCI deal | URL=http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980112.emcnealy.htm}}).

As the PersonalJava spec ({{Web reference | title=PersonalJava spec | work=PersonalJava API Specification | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/personaljava/spec-1-1/pJavaSpec.html}}) was introduced in 1998 it was nicknamed pJava by Sun Microsystems.  Because pJava uses a subset of JDK1.1.8, SUN Microsystems released a pJava Emulation Environment ({{Web reference | title=pJava Emulation Environment | work=PersonalJava Emulation Environment | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/personaljava/pj-emulation.html}}) to assist developers in testing their applets and applications for pJava Compliance.

====EmbeddedJava====
[[w:EmbeddedJava|EmbeddedJava]] ({{Web reference | title=EmbeddedJava | work=EmbeddedJava Application Environment | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/embeddedjava/}}) was based on JDK1.1.6 ({{Web reference | title=JDK1.1.6 | work=JDK1.1.6 Download | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/archive/jdk/1.1.6_009/}}) and was targeted for those mobile devices that only had a character display.

====JavaPhone====
The Mobile device OEMs found that the PersonalJava and EmbeddedJava solutions lacked those APIs that would allow access to pure telephony functionality on Mobile Devices.  Thus [[w:JavaPhone|JavaPhone]] API ({{Web reference | title=JavaPhone | work=JavaPhone API | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/javaphone/index.jsp}}) was designed by [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]] to be vertical expansion of PersonalJava to add telephony functionality to deployed java solutions on Mobile devices.

====JavaTV====
[[w:JavaTV|JavaTV]] ({{Web reference | title=JavaTV | work=Java TV API | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/javatv/}}) is designed to provide java apis for the set box and headless network terminals beyond what PersonalJava provides that are specific to the iTV/DTV platform such as [[w:HAVi|HAVi]], [[w:DVB-MHP|DVB-MHP]], and etc.

====AutoJava====
AutoJava was also a 1998 [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]] push into telematics (Auto) and did not get enough traction to survive as a separate api.

====JavaOS====
[[w:JavaOS|JavaOS]] ({{Web reference | title=JavaOS | work=JavaOS: A StandAlone Java Environment | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/javatv/}}) targets the underlying RealTimeOS ([[w:RTOS|RTOS]]) structure of the OS that typcially is deployed on Mobile Devices or Embedded Devices. JavaOS was launched by SUN Microsystems in the fall of 1996 and was based on the JDK1.0. ChorusOS which was bought  during JavaOS development by SUN Microsystems was later spun off as ChorusOS ({{Web reference | title=ChorusOS OpenSource | work=ChorusOS Open Source | URL=http://www.experimentalstuff.com/Technologies/ChorusOS/}}).

===Birth of J2ME===
As you can see by this NewsFlash ({{Web reference | title=SUN NewsFlash | work=SUN ANNOUNCES KEY CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY TO BRING THE POWER OF THE JAVA PLATFORM TO AUTO, TV AND PHONE MARKETS | URL=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/1998-03/sunflash.980324.14.html}}) in the spring of 1998 the Mobile Device market was being stormed by java but not in a very structured fashion.  As you can see from an Interview of the Father of KVM ({{Web reference | title=Interview of the Father of the KVM | work=J2ME Luminary Antero Taivalsaari | URL=http://developers.sun.com/techtopics/mobility/midp/luminaries/taivalsaari/}}) Sun was behind the scenes responding to this fragmentation in the Mobile Device space by innovating a new JVM for Mobile Devices and the first set of J2ME platform specs and as a project was nicknamed Spotless.

===J2ME is Alive===
In the time period of 1998-1999 SUN Microsystems reveals its behind the scenes work in defeating fragmentation in the Mobile Device space by announcing the formation of the [[w:Java Community Process|Java Community Process]] and reorganizing these fragments of java apis for mobile devices into the [[w:J2ME|J2ME]], Microediton Platform.  Let us now go over how J2ME is organized against API fragmentation in the Mobile Device space.

====J2ME Configurations====
Sun Microsystems came up with the idea that a configuration API would cover the runtime aspects of J2ME deployed on a device. The smallest J2ME configurations are actually subsets of the largest J2ME configuration.  The runtime aspects are covered by having these specific classes in the configuration api:

* Core Java classes
* Java programming language features
* Virtual Machine features

Currently, there are the configurations of CLDC (Connected Limited Device Configuration) and CDC (Connected Device Configuration). 

=====Connected Limited Device Configuration=====
The [[w:Connected Limited Device Configuration|CLDC]] covers devices below 512k size of memory for the JVM environment and removes JNI, user defined class loaders, some class verification items of the class verification process (the reason why we MIDlet Preverify MIDlets compiled to be deployed on CLDC devices) and reflection to fit into this small footprint. The JVM on CLDC devices is called KVM (K-VirtualMachine), nicknamed K-VirtualMachine for kilobyte. The application lifecycle concepts from javaTV and the installation concepts of javaPhone found their way into this Connected Limited Device Configuration. The JSRs for CLDC are:

* {{Web reference | title=CLDC1.0 | work=Connected Limited Device Configuration 1.0 JSR30 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=30}}  This Connected Limited Device Configuration 1.0 targets devices with 128k to 512k memory (256kROM/256RAM or less), limited power or battery operation, connectivity to some network at low speeds, and user interface.
* {{Web reference | title=CLDC1.1 | work=Connected Limited Device Configuration 1.1 JSR139 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=139}}  This Connected Limited Device Configuration 1.1 targets devices with 160K or more memory, processor speeds of 8-32MHZ, limited power or battery operation, and user interface.  This configuration adds extends CLDC1.0 to included floating point math.
very good

=====Connected Device Configuration=====
The [[w:Connected Device Configuration|CDC]] covers devices above the 512k size of memory for the JVM environment. The garbage collector is a separate pluggable item into the CVM deployed on CDC devices.  The threads are implemented not as OS specific but as fully implemented threads within the CVM and are known as Green Threads.  Threads can also be implemented as OS native threads. Class file verification takes place in the CVM on the device just as in J2SE java platform on desktop systems. The JVM on CDC devices is known as a CVM or the C-VirtualMachine. The JSRs for CDC are:

* {{Web reference | title=Connected Device Configuration 1.0 | work=Connected Device Configuration 1.0 JSR36 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=36 | date=March 17 | year=2005}} This Connected Device Configuration 1.0 targets devices with 512k minimum ROM/128k minimum RAM, connectivity to some network, supports a complete installation of a complete JVM, and  more full featured user interfaces compared to CLDC.
* {{Web reference | title=Connected Device Configuration 1.1 | work=Connected Device Configuration 1.1 JSR218 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=218 | date=March 17 | year=2005}}  This Connected Device Configuration 1.1 extends/updates the CDC1.0 to update J2SE APIs used in CDC1.0 to J2SE 1.4 APIs. Memory size was increased from 128k ROM to 256k ROM.

====J2ME Profiles====
Profiles provide APIs that focus on a specific group of devices.  These devices typically have the same or similar user interfaces (screen and inputs), how the device connects to the network, how the device stores data, and etc.  Currently, the Profile Name indicates the Family name of this group of devices or a common functionality with this group of devcies.  For example, the MIDP (MID Profile) is for the group of Mobile Information Devices. J2ME Profiles are:

=====Mobile Information Device Profile=====
The Mobile Information Device Profile extends and enhances the CLDC to provide a Java environment to develop applications on Mobile information appliances and voice communication devices.  The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=MIDP1.0 | work=Mobile Information Device Profile 1.0 JSR37 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=37}}  This Mobile Information Device Profile 1.0 extends the CLDC1.0 java environment in a vertical way to support MIDlet application development on devices targeted in the CLDC1.0 spec by providing a GUI toolkit, persistent data storage,  messaging, networking components, and security.  Although, attributes of JavaPhone and Java Telephony are mentioned in the spec; JavaPhone telephony attributes are not included as classes in MIDP1.0 but later on completed as a separate JSR and API package.
* {{Web reference | title=MIDP2.0 | work=Mobile Information Device Profile 2.0 JSR118 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=118}}  This Mobile Information Device Profile 2.0 extends MIDP1.0 to include https networking, the domain security model with digital certificates, formally includes OTA provisioning, push architecture of MIDlets responding to events, game functionality added to LCDUI, small xml parser, and a base sound API.
* {{Web reference | title=MIDP3.0 | work=Mobile Information Device Profile 3.0 JSR271 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=271}}  This Mobile Information Device Profie 3.0 extends MIDP2.0 to allow MIDlets to be auto-launched, run in background within the same VM, and enable inter-MIDlet communication.  Extended functionality includes secure record stores/removable record stores, IPv6, multiple network interfaces per device, and additional MIDlet provisioning in addition to OTA.

=====Foundation Profile=====
The Foundation Profile is what can be called a vertical specification profile.  A vertical specification profile specifies the targeted family of devices by memory size and the optional profiles that may plugin more functionality in addition to this profile. The GUI APIs are often Profiles plugged in on top of this Profile. Typical rich network devices include set top boxes (iTV), auto-computing (telematics), and etc. The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=Foundation Profile 1.0 | work=Foundation Profile 1.0 JSR46 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=46}}  This Foundation Profile 1.0 targets devices with 128k minimum ROM/512k minimum RAM, connectivity to some network, and no graphical user interface provided by this profile on top of the CDC1.0.
* {{Web reference | title=Foundation Profile 1.1 | work=Foundation Profile 1.1 JSR219 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=219}}  This Foundation Profile 1.1 is on top of the CDC1.1 which supports J2SE 1.4 APIs.  Targeted devices memory is increased to 256k minimum ROM/512k minimum RAM. Some APIs included to specify functionality for IPv6, security, and more math support.
hi am the one who wrote it.

=====Personal Profile=====
This Personal Profile provides high web fidelity to device with a rich network connection  and can use the heavy weight applet classes that were part of the PersonalJava spec. While Personal Profile, JSR62, supports PersonalJava1.1.x and PersonalJava1.2.x of the PersonalJava Application Environment; Personal Profile 1.1 supports the adoption of the subset of J2SE1.4 APIs as Personal Profile 1.0 was based on the subset of J2SE1.3 APIs. The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=Personal Profile 1.0 | work=Personal Profile 1.0  JSR62 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=62}}  This Personal Profile 1.0 targets devices with 1.5Megs of minimum ROM/1Megs of minimum RAM, and a robust network connection is on top of the CDC1.0 and Foundation Profile1.0 and allows applications developed with pJava Emulation Environment Specification 1.1.x and 1.1.2 to run on devices targeted by this profile.
* {{Web reference | title=Personal Profile 1.1 | work=Personal Profile 1.1 JSR216 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=216}}  This Personal Profile 1.1 extends the Personal Profile 1.0 to update APIs to J2SE 1.4 and to make sure optional Graphics Packages derived from J2SE 1.4 APIs can be deployed on top of this profile. Devices targeted now are of minimum memory size of 3.5Megs ROM/3.5 RAM.

=====Personal Basis Profile=====
This Personal Basis Profile provides a basic graphical user interface, ie the AWT lighweight APIs, on top of the CDC and Foundation Profile and is considered as a subset to the Personal Profiles. This profile also provides the xlet classes required for JavaTV. The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=Personal Basis Profile 1.0 | work=Personal Basis Profile 1.0 JSR129 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=129}}  This Personal Basis Profile 1.0 is deployed on top of the CDC1.0 and Foundation Profile 1.0 targeting devices with 2Megs minimum ROM/1Megs minimum RAM.  the lightweight AWT apis are based on JDK1.1 not JDK1.3 APIs to meet the smaller foot print requirements.
* {{Web reference | title=Personal Basis Profile 1.1 | work=Personal Basis Profile 1.1 JSR217 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=217}}  This Personal Basis Profile 1.1  extends the Personal Basis Profile 1.0 by updating all APis to derived from J2SE 1.4 APIs to be compatible with optional graphics APIs such as AGUI.

=====Information Module Profile=====
This Information Module Profile supports embedded network connected devices without a graphical user interface.  This profile is a subset of the MIDP1.0 profile without the LCDUI classes of MIDP1.0. The typical devices target are modems, household devices, and industrial metering devices.  While IMP is a subset of MIDP1.0, IMP-NG is a subset of MIDP2.0. The JSRs for this profile are:

* {{Web reference | title=IMP | work=Information Module Profile JSR195 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=195}}  This Information Module Profile  is a subset of  MIDP1.0 missing the LCDUI classes.
* {{Web reference | title=IMP-NG | work=Information Module Profile-Next Generation JSR228 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=228}}  This Information Module Profile-Next Generation si a subset of mIDP2.0 without the LCDUI classes.

=====Digital Set Top Box Profile=====
This Digital Set Top Box Profile is a subset of JavaTV and is targeted for the smaller set top boxes that deploy OCAP. Thus, this profile differs from the javaTV (CDC, PP PBP) setup in that its on top of CLDC not CDC to support a smaller device memory foot print. However, several concepts are borrowed from the JavaTV items in Personal Basis Profile such as the xlet lifecycle. The JSR for this profile is:

* {{Web reference | title=Digital Set Top Box Profile | work=Digital Set Top Box Profile JSR242 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=242}}  This Digital Set Top Box Profile is a subset of Personal Java and JavaTV and is based on the current java classes in OCAP. Xlets developed with this Profile are upward compatible with the JavaTV (CDC, PP, and PBP) combination.

=====J2ME Optional Packages and APIs=====
During 1999 to 2001 the concept of J2ME Optional  Packages and APIs was introduced to provide additional packages and APIs on top of J2ME Profiles to add specific functionality to certain classes of devcies. Some profile JSRs were changed to this new Optional Package concept:

* {{Web reference | title=RMI | work=RMI Optional Package JSR66 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=66}}  The RMI Optional Package provides interoperable J2SE RMI support on top of the CDC and Foundation Profile.
* {{Web reference | title=PDA | work=PDA Optional Package JSR75 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=75}} The PDA Optional Package is on top of the CLDC and provides optional APIs common to PDAs and handsets. For example, the PIM functionality in JavaPhone makes its re-introduciton into J2ME Platform devices within this ooptional package. FileConnection API is added to allow GCF to access removeable media storage.

=====J2ME Technology for the Wireless Industry=====
Due to the increasing complexity of J2ME, JTWI was proposed in 2002.  The J2ME Technology for the Wireless Industry, also known as {{Web reference | title=JTWI1.0 | work=JSR185 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=185}}, sets a clear architecture concept of what optional packages and APIs match up with which Profiles. This concept covers CLDC1.0, CLDC1.1, CDC1.0, and MIDP2.0 family of devices.  The optional packages and APIs are:

* {{Web reference | title=Wireless Messaging API | work=Wireless Messaging API JSR120 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=120}}  The Wireless Messaging API provides classes to support messaging application development on the J2ME Platform.
* {{Web reference | title=Mobile Media API | work=Mobile Media API JSR135 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=135}}  The Mobile Media API supports audio and multimedia on both the CLDC and CDC of the J2ME Platform.

The 2nd version of the JTWI2.0 was split along CLDC and CDC configuration lines into is {{Web reference | title=JSR248 | work=JTWI2.0 Mobile Service Architecture for CLDC | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=248}} and {{Web reference | title=JSR249 | work=JTWI2.0 Mobile Service Architecture for CDC | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=249}}

===Conclusion===
Although, other OS specific solutions such as [[w:Mobile development|extending C/C++ to the mobile platform]] has gotten its first burst of adoption; preliminary work in the forms of javaPhone, javaTV, embeddedJava, PersonalJava, and establishment of the J2ME Platform provided the basis for the successfull push of J2ME  and its steady climb to become the market leader on mobile devices.  While, not all of JavaPhone functionality is in full MIDP devices as of yet; this other API brings rest of the JavaPhone to the J2ME Platform:

* {{Web reference | title=Mobile Telephony API (MTA) | work=Mobile Telephony (MTA) JSR253 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=253}}  The Mobile Telephony API provides the classes to control the calls on both CLDC and CDC devices.  

As we head into the future of Mobile Devices, the Java Community Process Contributors to the J2ME Platform have been busy creating new JSRs to cover new advances Mobile Technology.  For example:

* {{Web reference | title=Unified Message Box Access API (UMBA-API) | work=Unified Message Box Access API JSR266 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=266}}  Specifies the API to manage message boxes and theri content on mobile devices.
* {{Web reference | title=Contactless Communication API | work=Contactless Communication API JSR257 | URL=http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=257}}  Specifies the API for contactless communication such as through RFID tags and etc.

= Nuclear Fusion =

For a given mass of fuel, a fusion reaction like

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;{}^2_1{\rm H} + {}^3_1{\rm H} \longrightarrow{}^4_2{\rm He} + n +; 17.59\,{\rm MeV}\ &lt;/math&gt;.
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.5)
|}

yields several times more energy than a fission reaction. This is clear from the curve given in Fig. 15.3. Indeed,
a change of the binding energy (per nucleon) is much more significant for a fusion reaction than for a fission reaction.
Fusion is, therefore, a much more powerful source of energy. For example, 10 g of deuterium which can be extracted from 500 litres of water and 15 g of tritium produced from 30 g of lithium would give enough fuel for the lifetime electricity needs of an average person in an industrialised country. 

But this is not the only reason why fusion attracted so much attention from physicists. Another, more fundamental, reason is that the fusion reactions were responsible for the synthesis of the initial amount of light elements at primordial times when the universe was created. Furthermore, the synthesis of nuclei continues inside the stars where the fusion reactions produce all the energy which reaches us in the form of light.


== Thermonuclear reactions ==

If fusion is so advantageous, why is it not used instead of fission reactors? The problem is in the
electric repulsion of the nuclei. Before the nuclei on the left hand side of Eq. (15.5) can fuse, we have to bring
them somehow close to each other to a distance of about a femtometer. This is not an easy task! They both are positively charged and ''refuse'' to approach each other. What we can do is to make a mixture of the atoms containing such nuclei and heat it up. At high temperatures the atoms move very fast. They fiercely collide and loose all the electrons. The mixture becomes ''plasma'', i.e. a mixture of bare nuclei and free moving electrons. If the temperature is high enough, the colliding nuclei can overcome the electric repulsion and approach each other to a fusion distance. When the nuclei fuse, they release much more energy than was spent to heat up the plasma. Thus the initial energy ''investment'' pays off. The typical temperature needed to ignite the reaction of the type (15.5) is extremely high. In fact, it is the same temperature that our sun has in its center, namely, about 15 megakelvins. This is why the reactions (15.3), (15.5), and the like are called ''thermonuclear reactions''.

== Human-made thermonuclear reactions ==

The same as with fission reactions, the first application of thermonuclear reactions was in
weapons, namely, in the hydrogen bomb, where fusion is ignited by the explosion of an ordinary (fission)
plutonium bomb which heats up the fuel to solar temperatures while compressing it immensely. 

In an attempt to make a controllable fusion, people encounter the problem of holding the plasma. It is relatively easy to achieve a
high temperature (with laser pulses, for example). But as soon as plasma touches the walls of the container, it immediately cools
down. To keep it from touching the walls, various ingenious methods are tried, such as strong magnetic field and laser beams directed to
plasma from all sides. In spite of all efforts and ingenious tricks, no fusion reactor has demonstrated that it can produce more energy than it consumed creating and containing the plasma.  A giant thermonuclear reactor is being planned by the international community to be built in Cadarache, France.  It will be the largest of its kind, and theoreticians predict that it may be within the parameters needed to sustain a fusion reaction and extract energy.

== Cold fusion ==

To visualize the struggle of the nuclei approaching each other, imagine yourself pushing a metallic ball towards the top of a slope
shown in Fig. 15.5. The more kinetic energy you give to the ball, the higher it can climb. Your
purpose is to make it fall into the narrow well that is behind the barrier.

{|
|+ '''Figure 15.5: ''' ''Effective nucleus-nucleus potential as a function of the separation between the nuclei.''
|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl6.png|282px|]]
|}

In fact, the curve in Fig.15.5 shows the dependence of relative potential energy &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm eff}&lt;/math&gt; 
between two nuclei on the distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; separating them. The deep narrow well corresponds to the strong short-range attraction, and
the &lt;math&gt;\sim1/R&lt;/math&gt; barrier represents the Coulomb (electric) repulsion. The nuclei need to overcome this barrier in order to ''touch'' each
other and fuse, i.e. to fall into the narrow and deep potential well. One way to achieve this is to give them enough kinetic energy,
which means to rise the temperature. However, there is another way based on the quantum laws.

As you remember, when discussing the motion of the electron inside
an atom (see [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus:What_the_atom_is_made_of|What the atom is made of]]), we said that it formed a
''cloud'' of probability around the nucleus. The density of this cloud diminishes at very short and very long distances but never
disappears completely. This means that we can find the electron even inside the nucleus though with a rather small probability.

The nuclei moving towards each other, being microscopic objects, obey the quantum laws as well. The probability density for finding
one nucleus at a distance ''R'' from another one also forms a cloud. This density is non-zero even under the barrier and on the other
side of the barrier. This means that, in contrast to classical objects, quantum particles, like nuclei, can penetrate through
potential barriers even if they do not have enough energy to go over it! This is called the ''tunneling effect''.

The tunneling probability strongly depends on thickness of the barrier. Therefore, instead of lifting the nuclei against the
barrier (which means rising the temperature), we can try to make the barrier itself thinner or to keep them close to the barrier for such
a long time that even a low penetration probability would be realized.

How can this be done? The idea is to put the nuclei we want to fuse, inside a molecule where they can stay close to each other for a long
time. Furthermore, in a molecule, the Coulomb barrier becomes thinner because of electron screening. In this way fusion may
proceed even at room temperature.

This idea of ''cold fusion'' was originally (in 1947) discussed by F. C. Frank and (in 1948) put forward by A. D. Sakharov, the
''father'' of Russian hydrogen bomb, who at the latest stages of his career was worldwide known as a prominent human rights activist and
a winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace. When working on the bomb project, he initiated research into peaceful applications of nuclear
energy and suggested the fusion of two hydrogen isotopes via the reaction (15.5) by forming a molecule of them
where one of the electrons is replaced by a muon.

The muon is an elementary particle (see [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus:Elementary_particles|Elementary particles]]) which has the same characteristics as an electron. The only difference between them is that the muon is 200 times heavier than the electron. In other words, a muon is a heavy electron. What will happen if we make a muonic atom of hydrogen, that is a bound state of a proton and a muon? Due to its large mass the muon would be very
close to the proton and the size of such atom would be 200 times smaller than that of an ordinary atom. This is clearly seen from the
formula for the atomic Bohr radius 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_{\mbox{Bohr}}=\frac{\bar{h}^2}{me^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where the mass is in the denominator.

Now, what happens if we make a muonic molecule? It will also be 200 times smaller than an ordinary molecule. The Coulomb barrier will be
approximately 200 times thinner and the nuclei 200 times closer to each other. This is just what we need! Speaking in terms of the effective
nucleus-nucleus potential shown in Fig. 15.5, we can say that the muon modifies this potential in such a way that a second minimum appears.
Such a modified potential is (schematically) shown in Fig. 15.6

{|
|+ '''Figure 15.6: ''' ''Effective nucleus-nucleus potential (thick curve) for nuclei confined in a molecule. Thin curve shows the corresponding 
 distribution of the probability for finding the nuclei at a given distance from each other.''
|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl7.png|282px|]]
|}

The molecule is a bound state in the shallow but wide minimum of this potential. Most of the time, the nuclei are at the distance
corresponding to the maximum of the probability density distribution (shown by the thin curve). Observe that this density is not zero
under the barrier (though is rather small) and even at &lt;math&gt;R=0&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the system can (with a small probability) jump from the
shallow well into the deep well through the barrier, i.e. can tunnel and fuse.

Unfortunately, the muon is not a stable particle. Its lifetime is only &amp;asymp; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;6&lt;/sup&gt; s. This means that a muonic molecule cannot 
exist longer than 1 microsecond. As a matter of fact, from a quantum mechanical point of view, this is quite a long interval.

The quantum mechanical wave function (that describes the probability density) oscillates with a frequency which is proportional to the energy of the system. With a typical binding energy of a muonic molecule of about 300 eV this frequency is 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; Hz or 100 PHz.

This means that the particle hits the barrier with this frequency and during 1 microsecond it makes &lt;math&gt;10^{11}&lt;/math&gt; attempts to jump through 
it. The calculations show that the penetration probability is &amp;asymp; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, during 1 microsecond nuclei can penetrate through 
the barrier 10000 times and fusion can happen much faster than the decay rate of the muon. Cold fusion via the formation of muonic molecules was done 
in many laboratories, but unfortunately, it cannot solve the problem of energy production for our needs. The obstacle is the negative efficiency, 
''i.e.'' to make muonic cold fusion we have to spend more energy than it produces. The reason is that muons do not exist like protons or electrons. 
We have to produce them in accelerators. This takes a lot of energy. Actually, the muon serves as a catalyst for the fusion reaction. After helping one pair of nuclei to fuse, the muon is liberated from the molecule and can form another molecule, and so on. It was estimated that the efficiency of the energy production would be positive only if each muon ignited at least 1000 fusion events. Experimentalists tried their best, but by now the record number is only 150 fusion events per muon. This is too few. The main reason why the muon does not catalyze more reactions is that it is eventually trapped by a &lt;math&gt;{}^4&lt;/math&gt;He nucleus which is a by-product of fusion. Helium captures the muon into an atomic orbit with large binding energy, and it cannot escape.


Nonetheless, the research in the field of cold fusion continues. There are some other ideas of how to keep nuclei close to each
other. One of them is to put the nuclei inside a crystal. Another way out is to increase the penetration probability by using
molecules with special properties, namely, those that have quantum states with almost the same energies as the excited states on the
compound nucleus. Scientists try all possibilities since the energy demands of mankind grow continuously and therefore the stakes in
this quest are high.</text>

= Elementary Particles =

In our quest for the elementary building blocks of the universe, we delved inside the atomic nucleus and found
that it is composed of protons and neutrons. Are the three particles, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the blocks we are looking for? The answer is ''no''. Even before the structure of the atom was understood, Becquerel discovered the radioactivity (see [[FHSST_Physics/Atomic Nucleus/Radioactivity#Discovery_of_radioactivity|Discovery of radioactivity]]) that afterwards puzzled physicists and forced them to look deeper - inside protons and neutrons.</text>

= Beta Decay =

Among the three types of radioactivity, the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; rays were easily explained. The emission of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; 
particle is kind of lop-sided fission reaction, when an initial nucleus spontaneously
decays in two fragments one of which is the nucleus &lt;math&gt;{}^4_2&lt;/math&gt;He (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; particle). The &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; 
rays are electromagnetic quanta (photons) emitted by a nuclear system when it transits from one quantum
state to another (similar to an atom emitting visible light when an electron drops to a lower energy level).


The &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; rays posed the puzzle. On the one hand, they are just electrons and you may think that it looks simple. But on the other
hand, they are not the electrons from the atomic shell. It was found that they come from inside the nucleus! After the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay, the 
charge of the nucleus increases in one unit,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}^A_Z\left(\mbox{parent nucleus}\right)\,\longrightarrow\,{}^A_{Z+1}\left(\mbox{daughter nucleus}\right)+e\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

which is in accordance with the charge conservation law.

There was another puzzle associated with the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; decay: The emitted electrons did not have a fixed energy. Measuring their
kinetic energies, you could find very fast and very slow electrons as well as the electrons with intermediate speeds. How could
identical parent nuclei, after losing different amount of energy, become identical daughter nuclei? Perhaps energy is not conserved in
the quantum world? The possibility was so astounding that even Niels Bohr put forward the idea of statistical nature of the energy conservation law.

To explain the first puzzle, it was first suggested that neutron is a bound state of proton and electron. At that time, some physicists
believed that if something is emitted from an object, it must be present in that object before the emission. They could
not imagine that a particle could be created from vacuum.

The naive &lt;math&gt;(pe)&lt;/math&gt; model of the neutron contradicted the facts. Indeed, it was known already that the &lt;math&gt;pe&lt;/math&gt; bound state is the 
hydrogen atom. A neutron is much smaller than the hydrogen atom. Therefore, it would be unusually tight binding, and perhaps with something else
involved that keeps the size small. By the way, this ''something else'' could also save the energy conservation law. In 1930,
Wolfgang Pauli suggested that in addition to the electron, the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; decay involves another particle, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, that is emitted 
along with the electron and carries away part of the energy. For example,

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}^{234}_{90}{\rm Th}\,\longrightarrow\,{}^{234}_{91}{\rm Pa} + e^{-} + \bar{\nu}\ .\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.6)
|}


This additional particle was called ''neutrino'' (in Italian the word ''neutrino'' means small neutron). The neutrino is electrically
neutral, has extremely small mass (maybe even zero, which is still a question in 2004) and very weakly interacts with matter. This is why
it was not detected experimentally till 1956. The ''bar'' over &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; 
in Eq. (15.6) means that in this reaction actually the anti-neutrino is emitted (see the discussion
on anti-particles further down in Sec. [[FHSST_Physics/Atomic Nucleus/Particle_Physics|Elementary particles: Particle Physics]]).</text>

=Particle Physics =

In an attempt to explain the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; decay and to understand internal structure of the neutron a new branch of physics was born,
the ''particle physics''. The only way to explore the structure of sub-atomic particles is to strike them with other particles in order
to knock out their ''constituent'' parts. The simple logic says: The more powerful the impact, the smaller parts can be knocked out.

At the beginning the only source of energetic particles to strike other particles were the cosmic rays. Earth is constantly bombarded
by all sort of particles coming from the outer space. Atmosphere protects us from most of them, but many still reach the ground.

==Antiparticles ==

In 1932, studying the cosmic rays with a bubble chamber, Carl Anderson made a photograph of two symmetrical tracks of charged
particles. The measurements of the track curvatures showed that one track belonged to an electron and the other was made by a particle
having the same mass and equal but positive charge. These particles were created when a cosmic &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
quantum of a high energy collided with a nucleus. 


The discovered particle was called ''positron'' and denoted as &lt;math&gt;e^+&lt;/math&gt; to distinguish it from the electron, which sometimes is 
denoted as &lt;math&gt;e^-&lt;/math&gt;. It was the first antiparticle discovered. Later, it was found that every particle has its ''mirror reflection'', the
antiparticle. To denote an antiparticle, it is used ''bar'' over a particle symbol. For example, &lt;math&gt;\bar{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the anti-proton, which 
has the same mass as an ordinary proton but a negative charge.

When a particle collides with its ''mirror reflection'', they annihilate, i.e. they burn out completely. In this collision, all
their mass is transformed into electromagnetic energy in the form of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; quanta. For example, if an electron collides with a 
positron, the following reaction may take place 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}e^-+e^+\,\longrightarrow\,\gamma+\gamma\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where two photons are needed to conserve the total momentum of the system.

In principle, stable antimatter can exist. For example, the pair of &lt;math&gt;\bar{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^+&lt;/math&gt; can form an atom of anti-hydrogen with exactly 
the same energy states as the ordinary hydrogen. Experimentally, atoms of anti-helium were obtained. The problem with them is that,
surrounded by ordinary matter, they cannot live long. Colliding with ordinary atoms, they annihilate very fast.

There are speculations that our universe should be symmetric with respect to particles and antiparticles. Indeed, why should
preference be given to matter and not to anti-matter? This implies that somewhere very far, there must be equal amount of anti-matter,
i.e. anti-universe. Can you imagine what happens if they meet?

==Muon, mesons, and the others ==

In yet another cosmic-ray experiment a particle having the same properties as the electron but &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;207 times heavier, was 
discovered in 1935. It was given the name ''muon'' and the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. For a long time it remained ''unnecessary'' particle in the 
picture of the world. Only the modern theories harmonically included the muon as a constituent part of matter (see [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus_elementary:Quarks_and_leptons|Elementary particles: Quarks and leptons]]).


The same inexhaustible cosmic rays revealed the &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; mesons 
in 1947. The &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; mesons (or simply ''pions'') were theoretically predicted twelve years before by Yukawa, as the
mediators of the strong forces between nucleons. The &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; mesons, however, were unexpected. Furthermore, they showed very strange
behaviour. They were easily created only in pairs. The probability of the inverse process (i.e. their decay) was &lt;math&gt;10^{13}&lt;/math&gt; times lower than the probability of their creation.

It was suggested that these particles possess a new type of charge, the ''strangeness'', which is conserving in the strong
interactions. When a pair of such particles is created, one of them has strangeness &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; and the other &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;, so the total strangeness 
remains zero. When decaying, they act individually and therefore the strangeness is not conserving. According to the suggestion, this is
only possible through the weak interactions that are much weaker than the strong interactions (see Sec. [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus_elementary:Forces_of_nature|Elementary particles: Forces of nature]]) and thus the decay probability is much lower.

The golden age of particle physics began in 1950-s with the advent of particle accelerators, the machines that produced beams of
electrons or protons with high kinetic energy. Having such beams available, experimentalists can plan the experiment and repeat it,
while with the cosmic rays they were at the mercy of chance. When the accelerators became the main tool of exploration, the particle
physics acquired its second name, the ''high energy physics''.


During the last half a century, experimentalists discovered so many new particles (few of them are listed in Table 15.5) that it became obvious that
they cannot all be elementary. When colliding with each other, they produce some other particles. Mutual transformations of the particles
is their main property.

Physicists faced the problem of particle classification similar to the problems of classification of animals, plants, and chemical
elements. The first approach was very simple. The particles were divided in four groups according to their mass: ''leptons'' (light
particles, like electron), ''mesons'' (intermediate mass, like pion), ''baryons'' (heavy particles, like proton or neutron), and
''hyperons'' (very heavy particles).

Then it was realized that it would be more logical to divide the particles in three families according to their ability to interact
via weak, electromagnetic, and strong forces (in addition to that, all particles experience gravitational attraction towards each
other). Except for the gravitational interaction, the photon (&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; quantum) participates only in electromagnetic 
interactions, the leptons take part in both weak and electromagnetic interactions, and ''hadrons'' are able to interact via all forces
of nature (see [[FHSST_Physics_atomic_nucleus_elementary:Forces_of_nature|Elementary particles: Forces_of_nature]]).

In addition to conservation of the strangeness, several other conservation laws were discovered. For example, number of leptons is
conserving. This is why in the reaction (15.6)  we have an electron (lepton number &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt;) and anti-neutrino (lepton number &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;) in the final 
state. Similarly, the number of baryons is conserving in all reactions.

The quest for the constituent parts of the neutron has led us to something unexpected. We found that there are several hundreds of
different particles that can be ''knocked out'' of the neutron but none of them are its parts. Actually, the neutron itself can be
knocked out of some of them! What a mess! Further efforts of experimentalists could not find an order, which was finally
discovered by theoreticians who introduced the notion of ''quarks''.</text>

= Quarks and Leptons =

While experimentalists seemed to be lost in the maze, the theoreticians groped for the way out. Using an extremely complicated
mathematical technique, they managed to group the hadrons in such families which implied that all known (and yet unknown) hadrons are
built of only six types of particles with fractional charges. The main credit for this (in the form of Nobel Prize) was given to
M. Gell-Mann and G. Zweig.

At first, they considered a subset of the hadrons and developed a theory with only three types of such truly elementary particles.
When Murray Gell-Mann thought of the name for them, he came across the book &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; by James Joyce. The line &quot;Three quarks
for Muster Mark!&quot; appeared on page 383 of that book (the word ''quark'' there is a merging of the words ''quart'' and ''quack'', among others). He needed a name for three particles and this was the answer. Thus the term ''quark'' was coined.

Later, the theory was generalized to include all known particles, which required six types of quarks. Modern theories require also
that the number of different leptons should be the same as the number of different quark types. According to these theories, the
quarks and leptons are truly elementary, i.e. they do not have any internal structure and therefore are of a zero size (pointlike).
Thus, the world is constructed of just twelve types of elementary building blocks that are given in Table 15.4. Amazingly enough, the electron
that was discovered before all other particles, more than a century ago, turned out to be one of them!

After Gell-Mann, who used a funny name (quark) for an elementary particle, the fundamental physics was flooded with such names. For
example, the six quark types are called ''flavors'' (for cottage cheese, this is appropriate indeed), the three different states in
which each quark can be, are called ''colors'' (red, green, blue) etc. Modern physics is so complicated and mathematical, that people
working in it, need such kind of jokes to ''spice unsavoury dish with flavors''. The funny names should not confuse anybody.
Elementary particles do not have any smell, taste, or colour. These terms simply denote certain properties (similar to electric charge)
that do not exist in human world.


==Hadrons ==

There are particles that are able to interact with each other by the so-called ''strong forces''. Another name for these forces is ''nuclear forces''. They are very strong at short distances (&lt;math&gt;\sim 10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;m), 
and very quickly vanish when the distance between the particles increases. All these particles are called ''hadrons''. The protons and neutrons are examples of hadrons. 
As you remember, we learned about the existence of huge variety of particles when trying to look inside a nucleon, more particularly, the neutron. 
So, what the neutron is made of? Can we get the answer at last, after learning about the quarks? Yes, we can. According to modern theories, all hadrons are composed of quarks. 
The quarks can be combined in groups of two or three. The boundstates of two quarks are called ''mesons'', and the boundcomplexes of three quarks are called ''baryons''. 
No other numbers of quarks can form observable particles (Recently, experimentalists and theoreticians started to actively discuss the possibility of the existence of pentaquarks, exotic particles that are bound complexes of five quarks.). 

[[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl8.png|fhsst_atomnucl8.png]]


Nucleons are baryons and therefore consist of three quarks while the pion is a meson containing only two quarks, as schematically shown
in Fig. 15.7. Comparing this figure with Table 15.4, you can see why quarks have fractional charges. Counting the total charge of a
hadron, you should not forget that anti-quarks have the opposite charges. The baryon number for an anti-quark also has the opposite
sign (negative). This is why mesons actually consist of a quark and anti-quark in order to have total baryon number zero.

==Particle reactions ==

At the early stages of the particle physics development, in order to find the constituent parts of various particles, experimentalists
simply collided them and watched the ''fragments''. However, this straightforward approach led to confusion. For example, the reaction
between the &lt;math&gt;\pi^-&lt;/math&gt; meson and proton,

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\pi^- + p\,\longrightarrow\, K^0 + \Lambda^0\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.8)
|}

would suggest (if naively interpreted) that either &lt;math&gt;K^0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^0&lt;/math&gt; is a constituent part of the nucleon while the pion is 
incorporated into the other ''fragment''. On the other hand, the same collision can knock out different ''fragments'' from the same
proton. For example,

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\pi^- + p\,\longrightarrow\, \pi^0 + n\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(15.9)
|}

which leads to an absurd suggestion that neutron is a constituent part of proton. 

The quark model explains all such ''puzzles'' nicely and logically. Similarly to chemical reactions that are just rearrangements of
atoms, the particle reactions of the type (15.8 and 15.9)  are just rearrangements of the quarks. The only difference is that, in contrast to chemistry
where the number of atoms is not changing, the number of quarks before the collision is not necessarily equal to their number after
the collision. This is because a quark from one colliding particle can annihilate with the corresponding antiquark from another
particle. Moreover, if the collision is sufficiently powerful, the quark-antiquark pairs can be created from vacuum.

It is convenient to depict the particle transformations in the form of the so-called ''quark flow diagrams''. On such diagrams, the
quarks are represented by lines that may be visualized as the trajectories showing their movement from the left to the right.

|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl9.png|450px|]]
|}

For example, the diagram given in Fig. 15.8,  shows the quark rearrangement for the reaction (15.8). As you can see, when
the pion collides with proton, its &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt; quark annihilates with the &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; quark from the proton. At the same time, 
the &lt;math&gt;s\bar{s}&lt;/math&gt; pair is created from the vacuum. Then, the &lt;math&gt;\bar{s}&lt;/math&gt; quark binds with the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; quark to form the strange meson &lt;math&gt;K^0&lt;/math&gt;, while the &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; quark goes together with the &lt;math&gt;ud&lt;/math&gt; pair as the strange baryon &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^0&lt;/math&gt;.

The charge-exchange reaction (15.9) is a more simple rearrangement process shown in Fig. 15.9. You may wonder why
the quark and antiquark of the same flavor in the &lt;math&gt;\pi^0&lt;/math&gt; meson do not annihilate. Yes they do, but not immediately. And due to this
annihilation, the lifetime of &lt;math&gt;\pi^0&lt;/math&gt; is 100 million times shorter than the lifetime of &lt;math&gt;\pi^{\pm}&lt;/math&gt; (see Table 15.3).

Despite its simplicity, the quark-flow diagram technique is very powerful method not only for explaining the observed reactions but
also for predicting new reactions that have not yet been seen in experiments. Knowing the quark content of particles (which is
available in modern Physics Handbooks), you can draw plenty of such diagrams that will describe possible particle transformations. The
only rule is to keep the lines continuous. They can disappear or emerge only for a quark-antiquark pair of the same flavor.

However, the continuity of the quark lines is valid only for the processes caused by the strong interaction. Indeed, the
&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay of a free neutron (caused by the weak forces),

|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}n\,\longrightarrow\, p+e^-+\bar{\nu}_e\ ,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (15.10)
|}

as well as the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay of the nuclei, indicate that quarks can change flavor. In particular, the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay 
(15.10 or 15.6) happens because the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; quark transformes into the &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; quark,

|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (15.11)
|}

due to the weak interaction, as shown in Fig. 15.10

==Quark confinement ==

At this point, it is very logical to ask if anybody observed an isolated quark. The answer is ''no''. Why? And how can one be so
confident of the quark model when no one has ever seen an isolated quark?

Basically, you can't see an isolated quark because the quark-quark attractive force does not let them go. In contrast to all other
systems, the attraction between quarks grows with the distance separating them. It is like a rubber cord connecting two balls. When
the balls are close to each other, the cord is not stretched and the balls do not feel any force. If, however, you try to separate the
balls, the cord pulls them back. The more you stretch the cord, the stronger the force becomes (according to the Hook's law of
elasticity). Of course, a real rubber cord would eventually break. This does not happen with the quark-quark force. It can grow to
infinity. This phenomenon is called the ''confinement of quarks''. 

Nonetheless, we are sure that the nucleon consists of three quarks having fractional charges. A hundred years ago Rutherford, by
observing the scattering of charged particles from an atom, proved that its positive charge is concentrated in a small nucleus.
Nowadays, similar experiments prove the existence of fractional point-like charges inside the nucleon.

The quark model actually is much more complicated than the quark-flow diagrams. It is a consistent mathematical theory that
explains a vast variety of experimental data. This is why nobody doubts that it reflects the reality.</text>

=Forces of Nature =

If asked how many types of forces exist, many people start counting on their fingers, and when the count exceeds ten, they answer
''plenty of''. Indeed, there are gravitational forces , electrical, magnetic, elastic, frictional forces, and also forces of wind, of
expanding steam, of contracting muscles, etc.

If, however, we analyze the root causes of all these forces, we can reduce their number to just a few fundamental forces (or ''fundamental interactions'', as physicists say).

For example, the elastic force of a stretched rubber cord is due to the attraction between the molecules that the rubber is made of.
Looking deeper, we find that the molecules attract each other because of the electromagnetic attraction between the electrons of
one molecule and nuclei of the other. Similarly, if we depress a piece of rubber, it resists because the molecules refuse to approach
each other too close due to the electric repulsion of the nuclei. Therefore the elasticity of rubber has the electromagnetic origin.

Any other force in the human world can be analyzed in the same manner. After doing this, we will find that all forces that we see
around us (in the macroworld), are either of gravitational or electromagnetic nature. As we also know, in the microworld there are
two other types of forces: The strong (nuclear) forces that act between all hadrons, and the weak forces that are responsible for
changing the quark flavors.

Therefore, all interactions in the Universe are governed by only four fundamental forces: Strong, electromagnetic, weak and
gravitational. These forces are very different in strength and range. Their relative strengths are given in Table 15.5. The most strong is the nuclear
interaction. The strength of the electromagnetic forces is one hundred times lower. The weak forces are nine orders of magnitude
weaker than the nuclear forces, and the gravity is 38 orders of magnitude weaker! It is amazing that this subtle interaction governs
the cosmic processes. The reason is that the gravitational forces are of long range and always attractive. There is no such thing as
negative mass that would screen the gravitational field, like negative electrons screen the field of positive nuclei.

==Towards the unified force ==

Physicists always try to simplify things. Since there are only four fundamental forces, it is tempting to ask &quot;If only four, then why
not only one?&quot;. Can it be that all interactions are just different faces of one master force?

The first who started the quest for unification of forces was Einstein. After completing his general theory of relativity, he
spent 30 years in unsuccessful attempts to unify the electromagnetic and gravity forces. At that time, it seemed logical because both of
them were infinite in range and obeyed the same inverse square law. Einstein failed because the unification should be done on the basis
of quantum laws, but he tried to do it using the classical concepts.

==Electro-weak unification ==

Now it is known that despite the similarities in form of the gravity and electromagnetic forces, the gravity will be the last to yield to
unification. The more implausible unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces turned out to be the first successful step towards the
unified interaction.

In 1979, the Nobel prize was awarded to Weinberg, Salam, and Glashow, who developed a unified theory of electromagnetic and weak
interactions. According to that theory, the electromagnetic and weak forces converge to one ''electro-weak'' interaction at very high
collision energies. The theory also predicted the existence of heavy particles, the &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; (vector bosons), with masses around 80000MeV and 
90000MeV, respectively. These particles were discovered in 1983, which brought experimental verification to the new theory.

==Grand unification ==

The next step was to try to combine the electro-weak theory with the theory of the strong interactions (i.e. quark theory) in a single
theory. This work was called the ''grand unification''. Currently, physicists discuss versions of such theory that predicts the
convergence of the three forces at awfully high energies &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{17}&lt;/math&gt;MeV. The quarks and leptons in this theory, are the 
unified ''leptoquarks''.

The grand unification is not that successful as the electro-weak theory. It has the problem of mathematical consistency and
contradicts to at least one experiment. The matter is that it predicts the proton decay,

&lt;math&gt;p\,\longrightarrow\, e^+ +\pi^0\ &lt;/math&gt;,

that does not conserve both the baryon and lepton numbers, with the lifetime of &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{29}&lt;/math&gt;years. The measurements show, however, 
that the lifetime of the proton is at least &lt;math&gt;10^{32}&lt;/math&gt; years. 

==Theory Of Everything ==

Some people believe that the grand unification has an inherent principal flaw. According to them, one cannot unify the forces step
by step (leaving the gravity out), and the correct way is to combine all four forces in the so-called ''theory of everything''.

There are few different approaches to unifying everything. One of them suggests that all fundamental particles (quarks and leptons)
are just vibrating modes of string loops in multidimensional space. The electron is a string vibrating one way, the up-quark is a string
vibrating another way, and so on. The other approach introduces a new level of fundamental particles, the ''preons'', that could be
constituent parts of quarks and leptons. The quest goes on. 

Everyone agrees that constructing the theory of everything would in no way mean that biology, geology, chemistry, or even physics had
been solved. The universe is so rich and complex that the discovery of the fundamental theory would not mean the end of science. The
ultimate theory of everything would provide an unshakable pillar of coherence forever assuring us that the universe is a comprehensible place.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the '''Using Ratpoison Wikibook'''.

==Purpose==
This is intended to be a book aimed at the intermediate/advanced GNU/Linux user who wants to start using the Ratpoison Window manager. 

Thusly, only the window manager itself will be covered- this guide assumes that you have a working system running, from the kernel up to the X11 Windowing System, and it assumes you have competent grasp on Linux- this book will not teach you how to use GNU/Linux in general. Please see your distribution documentation or the [[Linux Guide]] to learn Linux in general.

==Who is this guide suitable for?==
Basically, any GNU/Linux or BSD user who wants to try something new or exciting, but also the user who wants to experiment with a different approach to mouse usage.

==What is ratpoison?==
Ratpoison is a window manager written for X Window, and principally developed by Linux users (though it should run on any operating system and platform [[Wikipedia:X Window|X Window]] does). It is very different from most other window managers in that it is a ''[[Wikipedia:Tiling window manager|tiling window manager]]'' and because it tries to minimize or completely eliminate the use of the mouse, in order to relieve stress on the arms and shoulders. 

In keeping with this old-school approach, ratpoison is also extremely lightweight, and there are no &quot;fat library dependencies&quot;, no fancy graphics beyond what other programs provide, and no window decoration. While this might seem odd at first, starting to use it is in fact quite simple. 
If you've ever used the [[Wikipedia:GNU Screen|GNU Screen]] terminal multiplexer or [[Wikipedia:GNU Emacs|GNU Emacs]], you'll be quite familiar with the interface, since most of the hotkeys and design ideas are borrowed from those programs. Indeed, the developers are very much fans of Emacs, as evidenced in one of the FAQs: 
:*''&quot;I want feature XYZ.&quot;''
:**''&quot;What you want is probably already in Emacs. If you don't use Emacs, start. If do use Emacs, use it more. If you *still* can't do what you want to do, you probably shouldn't do it.&quot;'' (sic)

===Pros===
#Ratpoison is extremely lightweight and will therefore start up and run very quickly; it will also run well on ancient hardware as well as more modern setups such as a 32-way SPARC.
#Rodent usage is minimized and the keyboard is promoted, relieving your arms and shoulders and decreasing the risk of injury
#Ratpoison works well with multiple monitors. &lt;!-- I wouldn't say *very* well- the site has to include a workaround a &quot;Dead space&quot; problem on two monitors so... --&gt;
#Ratpoison key-bindings are very similar to those of GNU Screen and should be familiar to users with experience using Screen.

===Cons===
#High learning curve. Not particularly suited for UNIX beginners, without a lot of customization- this is a window manager written by experts for experts, so to speak.
#Some programs like the GIMP (which uses a multitude of small windows) are simply not designed to work with tiling window managers and do not work very well.
#Java GUI applications have some issues with the way Ratpoison handles window parenting and most Java GUI applications will only render as a grey box. (This problem could be solved by issuing 'export AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit' command before starting Java app).

==Concepts==
To start with, ratpoison has some radically different concepts about using a computer. First, you cannot drag windows around the &quot;desktop&quot;, all windows are maximized to the full screen size and that cannot be changed. Because of this, you don't need window decorations, since they would steal precious space. When you look at a program, the only thing you see is the program. You are not forced to look at only one program at a time however: a window can be subdivided into a number of adjacent (but not overlapping!) frames; each of these frames holds a single program which is maximized within its frame. In Emacs terms, there is one window, split into one or more frames, in which each buffer is shown in one and only one frame.

'''Escaping From Prison'''

A man is inside a prison cell. The cell is completely empty except for the man and a table. There are no doors or windows to escape from. There is also a desert surrounding the prison. At the edge of the desert is a town. The man escapes and traverses the desert to reach the town without walking over the desert. How?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Many people confuse the role of CLDC in J2ME application development. It alone is not a framework for application development because you need more than a configuration to produce J2ME applications({{Web reference | title=J2ME | work=The J2ME Platform | URL=http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:J2ME:The_J2ME_Platform}}).  You can think of CLDC as the spec that helps define the subset of the J2ME language items such as input/output, math, and etc that the Java Virtual Machine uses as its set of rules in actually runing MIDlets under the Mobile Information Device Profile(MIDP).

==Package Structure==
We can get a clearer picture of this by observing what each package in the CLDC defines as the J2ME java subset.  Although its not clear from the javadocs, Sun Microsystems does not separate MIDP and CLDC javadocs, these are the actual packages of CLDC({{Web reference | title=cldcapi | work=CLDC API Documentation, V1.0 | URL=http://java.sun.com/j2me/docs/pdf/cldcapi.pdf}}):

===CLDC1.0 list of Packages under java.*===
*java.lang.*
*java.io.*
*java.util.*

Thus, we have classes that deinfe the java language subset attributes used. How the java language susbet defintions for input/output are used. Also, a language definition of the subset of java.util.* from the full java language.

====Math Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.lang.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.lang.Long
*java.lang.Short
*java.lang.Integer

Notice when compared to J2SE math we have no floating point(Float class) and no double(Double class).

====Utility Classes(CLDC1.0)  from J2SE1.3====
*java.lang.Math
*java.util.Random

====System Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.lang.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.lang.System
*java.lang.Object
*java.lang.Runtime
*java.lang.Thread
*java.lang.Throwable
*java.lang.String
*java.lang.StringBuffer

====Data Type Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.lang.* package from J2SE1.3 excluding math====
*java.lang.Boolean
*java.lang.Byte
*java.lang.Character

====Collection Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.util.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.util.Enumeration
*java.util.Hashtable(see note in conclusion, from jdk1.1.8 not jse1.3)
*java.util.Stack
*java.util.Vector(see note in conclusion, from jdk1.1.8 not jse1.3)

====Calendar and Time Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.util.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.util.Calendar
*java.util.Date
*java.util.TimeZone

====IO Classes(CLDC1.1) excluding GCF in java.io.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.io.Writer
*java.io.Reader
*java.io.ByteArrayInputStream
*java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream
*java.io.DataInputStream
*java.io.DataOutputStream
*java.io.InputStream
*java.io.OutputStream
*java.io.InputStreamWriter
*java.io.OuputStreamWriter
*java.io.PrintStream

====Exception Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.util.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.util.EmptyStackException
*java.util.NoSuchElementException

====Exception Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.io.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.io.EOFException
*java.io.IOException
*java.io.InterruptedException
*java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException
*java.io.UTFDataFormatException

====Error Classes(CLDC1.0) in java.lang.* package from J2SE1.3====
*java.lang.Error
*java.lang.VirtualMachineError
*java.lang.OutOfMemoryError



The other clases are mixed in with MIDP in the javadocs, thus I will list the full list of CLDC classes under the javax.microedition.io.* package.  The class is the capitalized name at the right sight of the dot ending the package.


===CLDC1.0 list of classes under javax.microedition.io.*===
*javax.microedition.io.InputConnection
*javax.microedition.io.Connection
*javax.microedition.io.StreamConnection
*javax.microedition.io.OutputConnection
*javax.microedition.io.Datagram
*javax.microedition.io.DatagramConnection
*javax.microedition.io.StreamConnectionNotifier
*javax.microedition.io.ContentConnection
*javax.microedition.io.ConnectionNotFoundException
*javax.microedition.io.Connector


The common aspect that sets these classes apart is that they are interfaces defining the capabilities of the input/output connections.  The classes in java.io.* define the java language attributes that input/output classes in javax.microedition.io.* use as their rule set.

===CLDC1.1 additional classes===
*java.lang.Float
*java.lang.Double
*java.lang.Math

==GCF, General Connection Framework==
In the J2ME platform the J2SE IO is replaced with a smaller General Connection Framework(GCF). 

===javax.microedition.io GCF Classes from CLDC1.0===
*javax.microedition.io.InputConnection
*javax.microedition.io.Connection
*javax.microedition.io.StreamConnection
*javax.microedition.io.OutputConnection
*javax.microedition.io.DatagramConnection
*javax.microedition.io.StreamConnectionNotifier
*javax.microedition.io.ContentConnection
*javax.microedition.io.HttpConnection

==Conclusion==
In conclusion, under the subset of java language for CLDC we do not have floating point math, no double, no class loaders, no sockets and no serialization.  A smaller IO framework known as GCF is used.

While the javadocs read MID Profile in top right corner the actual Configuration or Profile they belong to is noted down before the class method summary is listed as:

&lt;i&gt;since CLDC1.0&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;since MIDP1.0&lt;/i&gt;

Note, that not all classes are based on JDK1.3

===Classes(CLDC1.0) Based on JDK1.1.8 instead of JDK1.3===
*java.util.Vector
*java.util.Hashtable


These classes were based on JDK1.1.8 to conserve space.

===CLDC1.0 Limitations===
*Unicode Translation to and from reader/writer bytes is limited
*Does not support java.util.Properties from J2SE but limited stuff can be acquire as System.getProperty(String key) that starts with the keyword microedition

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.75}}

In case you're wondering, UV mapping stands for the technique used to &quot;wrap&quot; a 2D image texture onto a 3D mesh. &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are the names of the axes of a plane, since &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are used for the coordinates in the 3D space.  For example: increasing your &quot;V&quot; on a sphere might move you along a longitude line (north or south), while increasing your &quot;U&quot; might move you along a line of latitude (east or west).

Another explanation can be gleaned from the Blender manual. Imagine a paper 3D model of an object, e.g. a sphere, that is to be laid flat on a table. Each of the 3D coordinates of the sphere can be mapped to the 2D coordinate on the flat piece of paper. Blender provides another view of the vertices (coordinates) in the UV/Image Editor. You can select and edit these 2D vertices just like in the 3D Editor window. The purpose of this unwrapping of the coordinates is just to map these coordinates to images/pictures so that the 3D image can have a realistic looking surface with textures derived from these images.

==The Basics of UV Mapping==

=====Add a sphere=====
We'll use a sphere for this demonstration. Delete the initial cube (x). Then, create a new model, a sphere ('''{{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift+A}}''' → Add → Mesh → UV Sphere). Leave the settings at default for now.

[[Image:UV_sphere.png|300px]]

=====Mark a UV seam=====
In edit mode, select a ring of vertices around the widest part of the sphere (the equator, if you will). This can be done easily by holding down {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift + Alt}} and right-clicking on the 'equator'.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl+E}} and select ''Mark Seam'', or select ''Mesh'' → ''Edges'' → ''Mark Seam''. This tells the UV unwrapper to cut the mesh along these edges.

[[Image:Sphere_with_marked_seams.png|300px]]

=====Unwrap the mesh=====
Next, create a window for the UV mapping: click and drag left the small lined area in the top right corner of the 3D window, a new window will be created. Set its window type to &quot;UV/Image Editor&quot; with the drop down box at the bottom left corner of the new window or with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift+F10}}.

[[Image:Blender icosphere and UV Image Editor.png|600px]]

In the 3D View window, select all your vertices by pressing 'A', and press ''U'' → ''Unwrap''. In the UV/Image editor you should see all the vertices/faces/edges of the model represented, or 'mapped', in 2D space.

If you don't see anything, you need to select UV Editing from the Screen Layout dropdown in the UV/Image editor window.

[[Image:UV_unwrapped_sphere.png|400px]]

=====Apply an image=====
Now we're going to actually use this UV map. Save the following image (click to view in full high resolution (4,096 × 2,048 pixels)):

[[Image:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|500px]]

Load it in the UV/Image Editor window by clicking ''Image'' → ''Open Image'' or by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt+O}}. Then with the grab, rotate and scale tools, adjust the UV islands (the UV groups that aren't connected to each other) so that it fits nicely on top of the image as shown. To select a UV island, hover the mouse over the island and press a vertex and {{B3D:N2P/Do|L}}.

''Note: Since the aspect ratio of the image will warp the UV's, it may be easier to simply re-unwrap the mesh exactly the same way you did before. You can then adjust the UV's as needed.'' 

If you have issues fitting to the image use X and Y letters after pressing S.  This will adjust the shape to fit the image.

[[Image:Blender icosphere textured.png|600px]]

=====Admire your new creation=====
Back in the 3D View window, go into Object mode. The next drop-down menu to the right of the mode menu is the Viewport Shading (Draw Type) menu; use it to set the Viewport Shading to Textured. Note that parts of the model will be shadowed and other parts illuminated based on the location of the lights in your scene. Try adding more lights and moving them around so you see the model more clearly, and try to use this lighting preview to 'Rough' your lights. (you can add more lights Shift-A-Lamp and right click lamp to move to where light is needed)

To make the texture visible in renderings, you also need to add the texture to the sphere as a new material. In the Properties window, switch to the Material context by clicking the small shaded-sphere button. Create a new material by pressing the ''New'' button, leave the settings as they are for now; then switch to the Texture context. Create a new texture and select the type to be 'Image or Movie'. Select the globe texture from the dropdown menu.

[[File:Texture select2.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Then go to the mapping menu and set the Coordinates to 'UV' and the 'Map' to 'UVMap', leave the projection at 'Flat'. This will make use of the the UV's we unwrapped earlier.
To make the globe a bit smoother, switch to the Modifier context in the Properties window and add a subsurf modifier; set the number of subdivisions to 2. Then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|T}}, if you had no Tool-shelf, in the 3D viewport and select 'Smooth' under the shading options. This will make the globe far smoother and more realistic.

Now, simply press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render your scene!

[[Image:Blender Blue Marble.jpg]]

Note that in the above render I've changed the lighting and the camera position to make the image more interesting. I also added a star background, you can find the settings for this in the World context (a pretty relevant coincidence) in the Properties window and the texture settings for the World.

Go to the '''World''' properties and check both '''Blend Sky''' and '''Real Sky''', set all 3 colours (Horizon, Zenith, Ambient) to '''black'''. Go to '''Texture''' settings and if you weren't already there, click on the '''World''' texture settings (upper left globe icon) and set the type to '''Voronoi'''.
Scroll down to '''Colors''' panel and check '''Ramp''' and set the 0 to: white and alpha 1 and 1 to: black alpha 0.
Now will happen some magic: set '''Distance Metric''' to '''Minkowski 1/2''', in '''Noise''' section set size to '''.002''' and set 2 of Feature Weights at around .5.
Finally, in '''Influence''' panel, check '''Horizon''', '''Zenith Up''' and '''Zenith Down'''. That will do the trick. In some older versions there was a standard option for this but it has &quot;disapparated&quot; if you know what I mean.

[[File:World star settings 1.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[File:World star settings 2.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

==Alternative method==

If you looked around the textured globe we just made, you would have noticed that around the 'equator' there were lines, or 'seams', where the two UV islands met. This is a common problem with UV mapping and there are a couple of ways to avoid it. In our case, since we're using a sphere, the best way to remove the seams is to use spherical mapping.

First download one of the textures from this link: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/BlueMarble_2002.php. Then use this texture for your globe instead of the one we first downloaded.

Go into edit mode, and select all the vertices of sphere. Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|U}} → ''Sphere Projection''. If you've got the UV/Image editor open you should see a very different UV map, as shown below. Note that only the 'Unwrap' option will use the seams we just made, all of the other options completely ignore it.

You can also try, especially handy when you use a more detailed map in the place of the seam:
First unwrap with cube projection and then with sphere projection. It's now a square like UV.

[[Image:Sphere_projection.png|450px]]

Now lets make the UVs fit more evenly over the texture. In the UV/Image editor, press ''UVs'' → ''Constrain to Image Bounds''. This will make sure that during editing none of the UVs will go over the bounds of the texture; if they did, it would cause the texture to repeat itself in the area of the UVs outside the bounds.

Now select all the UVs with {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} and scale them up till it is stopped by the image bounds. In my case, there is one vertex in the top-right corner, and a few in the bottom-right corner that are quite distant from the rest of the UVs; to fix this, I simply selected those vertices and moved them closer to the rest of the UVs.

[[Image:Sphere_UVs_edited.png|400px]]

Now simply scale all the UVs by the X axis until the UVs stretch over all of the image. Doing this is exactly the same as scaling in the 3D viewport, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}}, then drag the mouse.

Now rerender your model, and you will see that there are no seams!
You can also use an image with clouds. if you render this you will see seams. you can fake this away a bit by making the diffuse at material sea-blue by using the color picker after rendering the first render (If it looks good it is good).

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
While in [[Programming:J2ME:The_J2ME_Platform|The J2ME Platform]] we covered the whole J2ME platform, in this article we will be covering Mobile Information Device Profile 1.0(MIDP1.0).  While CLDC covers the subset of Java language used in MIDP devices, MIDP covers such areas as the graphical user interface and etc.

==Connection Protocols==
The CLDC defines the language definitions and operation of the input/output. However, the protocols that flow over this connection are defined by the Mobile Information Device Profile(MIDP).  In the MIDP1.0 the HTTP protocol is defined and used by the javax.microedition.io.HttpConnection class.

==MIDlet==
In MIDP application development the application container in which everything occurs is called the MIDlet.  The javax.microedition.midlet.* package set of classes define the MIDlet lifecycle and the MIDlet states.

===MIDlet classes===
*javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet
*javax.microedition.midlet.MIDletStateChangeException

==RMS==
RMS, or Record Management Storage, is the persistent storage used in MIDP mobile devices.  While the RMS classes define how the RMS operates they do not define how much total kilobytes the RMS can take off the heap.  That information is usually found by either reading the OS datasheet when the OS includes their own JVM, such as SymbianOS, or from the JVM datasheet itself, or the device series datasheet.

===RMS classes===
*javax.microedition.rms.InvaidRecordIDException
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordComparator
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordEnumeration
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordFilter
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordListener
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStore
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStoreException
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStoreFullException
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStoreNotFoundException
*javax.microedition.rms.RecordStoreNotOpenException

==LCDUI, the MIDP GUI APIs==
In MIDP MIDlet development there are two APIs defined for the graphical user interface that are contained in the same '''Limited Connected Device User interface(LCDUI)''' packages. The low level API gives pixel control over placement of graphical items on the screen and is used heavily in games.  The high level interface has lightweight widgets to make business application gui building easier for developers.

===Displayable Object===
Both the High Level LCDUI API and the Low Level LCDUI API use the displayable object to send graphical data/objects to the screen to be displayed.

====Displayable Classes====
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Display
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Display

===High Level LCDUI API===
The High Level LCDUI API classes are:

====High Level LCDUI API Classes====
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Alert
*javax.microedition.lcdui.AlertType
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Choice
*javax.microedition.lcdui.ChoiceGroup
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Form
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Gauge
*javax.microedition.lcdui.ImageItem
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Item
*javax.microedition.lcdui.ItemStateListener
*javax.microedition.lcdui.List
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Screen
*javax.microedition.lcdui.StringItem
*javax.microedition.lcdui.TextBox
*javax.microedition.lcdui.TextField
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Ticker

====Screen====
At this point, we have to be careful as there are two Screens referred to in javadocs. We are referring to the both subclasses of Screen that are in the Displayable class.  Both encapsulate the High Level API. The first subclass of Screen under Displayable does not allow the removing of high level widgets once they are placed on screen such as List, TextBox, and Alert. The second subclass of Screen under Displayable allows one to place and remove widgets.

===Low Level LCDUI API===
An easy way to keep these two APIs clear in your mind is that High Level APIs are always have more classes than the Low Level APIs so that more complex graphical objects can be generated by just using a few methods.NKS

====Low Level LCDUI API Classes====
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Canvas
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Font
*javax.microedition.lcdui.Image

==Conclusion==
With these short concepts in mind you should be able to understand that the CLDC covers the [[w:java language|java language]] subset used in MIDlet development and the MIDP classes cover the user interface, connection protocols, and persistent storage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This article covers the evolution of [[w:Java Virtual Machine|java Virtual Machine]]s within the [[w:MIDP|MIDP]] family of devices for the J2ME Platform.  J2ME developers will find this information useful in determining whether their specific target devices support on device emulation and other beneficial information required for their application development on mobile devices.

==Brief History of Java Virtual Machines in MIDP devices==
In 1999 the K-Virtual Machine for CLDC/MIDP devices was introduced by [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]].  Motorola demoed several different devices such as pagers running KVM at the 1999 JavaOne conference({{Web reference | title=Taking it to the Streets | work=Taking it to the Streets: Motorola and the K Machine | URL=http://java.sun.com/features/1999/06/moto.html}}).

As Sun Microsystems Engineers were tackling the problem of optimizing the Java Virtual Machine, they came up with the Java Platform Debugger Architecture({{Web reference | title=JPDA | work=Java Platform Debugger Architecture Home Page | URL=http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/}}) as a full debug infrastructure to assist java developers in debugging Java applications in a running mode operation using the JVM itself to provide the debugging functionality.

As mobile devices have a small memory size foot print, its obvious that the full JPDA could not be implemented in JVMs for mobile devices.  Thus, the lowest part of the JPDA, Java Debug Wire Protocol(JDWP), was implemented as KVM Debug Wire Protocol(KDWP) on the KVM.  Typically in the J2SE platform you would use an IDE to connect its JVM to the application JVM to collect this data that the JDWP sends from the application JVM.  In the mobile J2ME development environment you would use Sun's WTK on device debug implementation or an OEM Vendors emulator to serve in place of the IDE JVM collecting data from the mobile device KVM through the KDWP conduit.

A more full mobile JDPA was researched by faculty(Jim Vallino and Hans-Peter Bischof) of Rochester Institute of Technology  and students(Jon Coles, Zakir Mahomedy, Brian Koponen, Jeff Myers, John Mikucki, Aaron Deitrich)({{Web reference | title=KVMDB Project | work=Debugging Java Programs on the Palm Platform | URL=http://www.se.rit.edu/~jrv/research/KVMDB_Project.html}}) and this contributed to Sun Microsystems own KDPA product in 2001 for the KVM({{Web reference | title=Tasneem Sayeed-JavaOne Slides | work=Technical Overview of K Virtual Machine(KVM) with an in depth look at new features | URL=http://www.eos.dk/web/jaooslides/session_TasneemSayeed.pdf}}). 

With the release of J2SE 1.3.x, Sun Microsystems introduced the Java HotSpot Java Virtual Machine technology to the java developers community.  The introduction of HotSpot Optimized JVM technology to CLDC/MIDP devices(known as Monty) occurred in 2001({{Web reference | title=CLDC HI Whitepaper | work=CLDC HotSpot Implementation Virtual Machine | URL=http://java.sun.com/j2me/docs/pdf/CLDC-HI_whitepaper-February_2005.pdf}}).  The HotSpot Java Virtual Machine for CDC/J2ME Platform devices was introduced in 2004.

==K Virtual Machine==
KVM1.0 and onward are based on the Spotless non optimized JVM architecture ({{Web reference | title=Spotless | work=The Spotless System Homepage | URL=http://research.sun.com/spotless/}}).  All KVMs have the KVM Platform Debug Architecture and debugging is facilitated by a Debug Proxy within the Sun Microsystems WTK or vendor OEM emulator/simulator to connect the debug data and memory intensive debug operations up with occurring in the IDE JVM ({{Web reference | title=Tasneem Sayeed-JavaOne Slides | work=Technical Overview of K Virtual Machine(KVM) with an in depth look at new features | URL=http://www.eos.dk/web/jaooslides/session_TasneemSayeed.pdf}}).

Even with both those parts the KDWP portion on the mobile device has to be compiler turn-on enabled when the KVM for that device is first compiled and deployed to that device.  Some OEM vendors did not enable this feature due to memory/speed constraints faced in their own KVM implementation on their device series. Typically, KVM has a performance of 30% to 80% when compared to the JDK 1.1.x on the desktop.

===Basic KVM Features===
*30% to 80% of JDK 1.1.x desktop speed performance without Just-In-Time compiling technology
*Implemented in C
*Small memory foot print size of 60-72kb
*Platform independent Green Threads
*Ports to Linux, Windows, Solaris, and Windows CE
*Basic bytecode interpreter

==KVM Platform Debug Architecture==
*Based on existing JDWP (Java Debug Wire Protocol)
*Memory-intensive operations moved to Debug Agent (aka Debug Proxy) on Desktop Workstation
*KVM implements subset of JDPW command set (KDWP)

==CLDC HotSpot Implementation Virtual Machine==
The HotSpot term from both the mobile and the desktop implementations refers to the use of an adaptive compiler to only compile bytecode into native instructions for frequent used methods (hotspots). The infrequent methods are interpreted using an optimized interpreter. This improves performance over the KVM bytecode interpreter by a factor of 5 to 7 times.

Because over 90% of all MIDP devices use the ARM family of processors, the CLDC HotSpot VM Implementation uses three methods to optimize for the ARM processors known as Thumb Mode Support.  

===Thumb Mode Support===
*VM can be compiled into 16-bit Thumb machine code
*The dynamic adaptive compiler can be configured to generate 16-bit thumb machine code
*The optimized interpreter was implemented using the 32-bit ARM instruction set 
 
Another new feature when compared to the KVM is a multitasking option to run multiple threads and MIDLets in one JVM on mobile devices. These new multitasking features are implemented without relying on the underlying operating system.

This Virtual Machine implementation also implements the JDPA compliant technology first introduced in the KVM as KDWP. It is enabled by compiling the CLDC-HI VM and deploying it on a mobile device. Not every OEM vendor has made enough optimization of this CLDC-HI VM on their specific processor used and mobile hardware and thus some mobile devices with MIDP2.0 have this feature turned off.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''[[w:MIDlet|MIDlet]]''' is a [[w:Java programming language|Java]] program for embedded devices, more specifically the [[w:J2ME|J2ME]] virtual machine. Generally, these are games and applications that run on a [[w:cell phone|cell phone]].

==Introduction==
Since class verification in [[w:J2SE|J2SE]] takes up 50&amp;nbsp;[[w:Kilobyte|KB]] and the lack of space in [[w:Mobile Information Device Profile|MIDP]] devices, the class verification has been broken up to a part that is completed by the developer and apart completed by the Mobile [[w:Java Virtual Machine|JVM]] itself. The developer-directed class verification stage is called MIDlet preverification, which occurs after the class is compiled.

==What Tasks Preverification Completes==
Generally, the preverification task annotates the class files with notes that the small incomplete class verifier in the Mobile VM reads and uses to do a fast class verification to enable the Mobile VM to then run the resulting bytecodes. The resulting [[w:Bytecode|bytecodes]] are valid bytecodes, because the annotations are using attributes of the bytecode to make the notes for the Mobile VM to read in doing its final incomplete class verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Web reference | title=What is preverification? | work=What is preverification? Why do I receive error messages from the [[w:Connected Limited Device Configuration|CLDC]]/[[w:K virtual machine|KVM]] when I do not preverify my class files? | url=http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=201507}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===JVM Class File Verification===
According to The Java Virtual Machine Specification,&lt;ref&gt;{{Web reference | title=VM Spec | work=The Java Virtual Machine Specification | url=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html}} ISBN 0201432943&lt;/ref&gt; class file verification is completed in four passes before full startup of the JVM occurs in running bytecode of an application:

====Pass 1====
*Correct magic number in the first four bytes.
*Byte code attributes must be the proper length.
*The class file cannot be truncated or have extra bytes at end.
*Constant pool must not contain any superficial data.

====Pass 2====
*Ensures that final classes are not subclassed and that the final methods are not overridden.
*Checks that every class except &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; has a direct superclass.
*Ensures that the constant pool meets documented static constraints.
*Checks that all field references and method references in the constant pool have valid names, valid classes, and a valid type descriptor.

====Pass 3====
During linking, the verifier checks the code array of the code attribute by performing a data flow analysis to ensure these items are true:
*That the operand stack is always the same size and contains the same types of values.
*No local variable is accessed unless it is known to contain a value of an appropriate type.
*Methods are invoked with the appropriate arguments.
*Fields are assigned only using values of appropriate types.
*All [[wiktionary:opcode|opcodes]] have appropriate type arguments on the operand stack and in the local variable array.

====Pass 4====
This is the pass where class loading occurs to finalize the class verification process.

===Preverification steps===
*The preverification places a StackMap Attribute, which is a sub attribute of the Code attribute, which describes variable types used and operand stack items.
*Inlines all subroutines and removes jumps.&lt;ref&gt;({{Web reference | title=Ubiquitous Services | work=Ubiquitous Services Services on Mobile Devices | url=http://www.nm.ifi.lmu.de/Vorlesungen/ws0405/ubiserv/07-devices-10.01.05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*By default, it generates a class file for the Java code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Web reference | title=J2ME Tutorial, Part 1: Creating MIDlets? | work=By default, the preverifier will create the preverified version of your class file in a folder called output in the current directory. It will preserve the package structure…. | url=http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2005/02/09/j2me1.html?page=2#step4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Preverification preverifies the compiled classes by inserting annotations in the StackMap portion of the Code attribute describing variable types used and operand stack items. This and inlining all subroutines and removing jumps reduces the first three passes of the J2SE verification process to something more manageable with the mobile device memory sizes in completing the last fourth pass on the mobile device within the mobile jvm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|JavaScript|History of JavaScript|Code Structuring|prog=0}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This chapter will describe current JavaScript community standards and best practices that every programmer should know.

== &lt;tt&gt;document.write&lt;/tt&gt; ==
This is deprecated. Use &lt;tt&gt;innerHTML&lt;/tt&gt; or DOM manipulation methods instead.

In XHTML, &lt;tt&gt;document.write&lt;/tt&gt; does not work, but you can achieve the same effects with DOM manipulation methods[http://w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq#docwrite].

==JavaScript protocol==

Try to avoid links that exist solely for executing JavaScript code.

 &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:resumeFancyVersion()&quot;&gt;See my résumé!&lt;/a&gt;

Instead consider:
  &lt;a href=&quot;resumePlainVersion.html&quot; onclick=&quot;return !resumeFancyVersion()&quot;&gt;See my résumé!&lt;/a&gt;

Users with JavaScript enabled will be provided with the JavaScript-embellished version of content (perhaps using DHTML), whereas those without will be redirected to a XHTML page that provides it statically. This is more accessible than having an &lt;a&gt; element lacking a normal href attribute value. First, it uses [[w:XHTML|proper language semantics]]. Second, it provides access to your content for users without JavaScript. Third, it detects whether the function execution succeeded and redirects JS-enabled readers too in case of a failure.

The onclick expression evaluates to a Boolean value. If the function succeeds to perform the desired effect and returns true, the onclick will return a failure and hyperlink not execute. When the function fails for whatever reason, the false, null or undefined value will evaluate to true and not prevent the link from being executed. Alternatively, if you do not wish to provide a static equivalent, you may embed the onclick attribute within an element with less demanding semantics:

 &amp;lt;strong onclick=&quot;resumeFancyVersion()&quot;&amp;gt;See my résumé!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;

Thus no user agent will be confused upon reading a reduced &lt;a&gt; element.

== Email validation ==

Many people use JavaScript functions to immediately catch the most common sorts of errors in form entry.
For example, some web forms ask people to enter the same thing twice.
Other web forms ask people to enter an email address.
Then they do a quick check to see if what was entered looks at least vaguely like an email address:

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
function isValidEmail(string) {
  // These comments use the following terms from RFC2822:
  // local-part, domain, domain-literal and dot-atom.
  // Does the address contain a local-part followed an @ followed by a domain?
  // Note the use of lastIndexOf to find the last @ in the address
  // since a valid email address may have a quoted @ in the local-part.
  // Does the domain name have at least two parts, i.e. at least one dot,
  // after the @? If not, is it a domain-literal?
  // This will accept some invalid email addresses
  // BUT it doesn't reject valid ones. 
  var atSym = string.lastIndexOf(&quot;@&quot;);
  if (atSym &lt; 1) { return false; } // no local-part
  if (atSym == string.length - 1) { return false; } // no domain
  if (atSym &gt; 64) { return false; } // there may only be 64 octets in the local-part
  if (string.length - atSym &gt; 255) { return false; } // there may only be 255 octets in the domain

  // Is the domain plausible?
  var lastDot = string.lastIndexOf(&quot;.&quot;);
  // Check if it is a dot-atom such as example.com
  if (lastDot &gt; atSym + 1 &amp;&amp; lastDot &lt; string.length - 1) { return true; }
  // Check if could be a domain-literal.
  if (string.charAt(atSym + 1) == '[' &amp;&amp; string.charAt(string.length - 1) == ']') { return true; }
  return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;!--
Please feel free to improve on this code.
But don't fall into the trap of &quot;improving&quot; it so much that it incorrectly rejects valid addresses.

http://javascript.internet.com/forms/check-email.html (broken link)

--&gt;

Unfortunately, some other &quot;email validation&quot; JavaScript functions reject perfectly valid email addresses. For example, some [http://www.javascriptsource.com/forms/email-validation---basic.html incorrectly reject] valid addresses that include &quot;+&quot; signs.

The original email address syntax (RFC 821) did allow &quot;+&quot; signs. RFC 822, published in the same month (August 1982), also allowed them. The current version of the syntax is given in [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2821.html RFC2821]/[http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html RFC2822]. Section 3 of [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3696.html RFC3696] gives useful examples of unusual valid email addresses.
&lt;!--
The relevant parts of RFC821:

  &lt;mailbox&gt; ::= &lt;local-part&gt; &quot;@&quot; &lt;domain&gt;
  &lt;local-part&gt; ::= &lt;dot-string&gt; | &lt;quoted-string&gt;
  &lt;dot-string&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt; | &lt;string&gt; &quot;.&quot; &lt;dot-string&gt;
  &lt;string&gt; ::= &lt;char&gt; | &lt;char&gt; &lt;string&gt;
  &lt;char&gt; ::= &lt;c&gt; | &quot;\&quot; &lt;x&gt;
  &lt;c&gt; ::= any one of the 128 ASCII characters, but not any
           &lt;special&gt; or &lt;SP&gt;
  &lt;SP&gt; ::= the space character (ASCII code 32)
  &lt;special&gt; ::= &quot;&lt;&quot; | &quot;&gt;&quot; | &quot;(&quot; | &quot;)&quot; | &quot;[&quot; | &quot;]&quot; | &quot;\&quot; | &quot;.&quot;
           | &quot;,&quot; | &quot;;&quot; | &quot;:&quot; | &quot;@&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot; | the control
           characters (ASCII codes 0 through 31 inclusive and
           127)

If I'm reading this correctly,
&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;$&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;!&quot;, &quot;%&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; are all treated the same, as &quot;&lt;c&gt;&quot;, ordinary (not special) valid characters in the &quot;local-part&quot; of an email address.

Some people apparently think &quot;+&quot; is not a valid character in the local-part of an email address.
Why?
--&gt;

After validation, many JavaScript programmers encode the email address
using &lt;tt&gt;encodeURIComponent()&lt;/tt&gt;
to work-around certain client-side languages that can't seem to handle plus signs properly.&lt;ref&gt;
Jan Wolter.
[http://unixpapa.com/js/querystring.html &quot;JavaScript Madness: Query String Parsing&quot;]
2011.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39078 PHP bug #39078: Plus sign in URL arg received as space].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of the quoting rules used for email addresses makes it impractical to test the local-part of an address or a domain literal completely. Given that there isn't necessarily a real mailbox corresponding to a valid local-part how much extra download time is worth spending on a complex validation script?

=== Examples valid according to RFC2822 ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[wikipedia:en:Murder|Murder]] is the intentional taking of the life of another person.  Killing an individual may not be considered for various reasons, such as self-defense.

==Legal view of murder==

Not all cases of illegal killing constitute murder. For example, unintentionally caused deaths due to [[wikipedia:en:recklessness|recklessness]] or [[wikipedia:en:negligence|negligence]] are treated in most countries as the lesser crime of [[wikipedia:en:involuntary manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]] or criminally negligent homicide. Similarly, intentional killings without premeditation are sometimes charged as voluntary manslaughter rather than murder. In addition, some illegal killings have legal defenses such as [[wikipedia:en:insanity|insanity]] or [[wikipedia:en:diminished capacity|diminished capacity]]).

Some cases of premeditated, intentional killing have lawful excuse and thus are not legally murder. These include killing non-surrendered enemy combatants in time of war, killing a person who poses an immediate threat to the lives of oneself or others (i.e., in self-defense), executing a person in accordance with a sentence of death, and, in some countries, [[wikipedia:en:abortion|abortion]] under defined circumstances. Sometimes killings under extreme provocation or duress are legally excused as [[wikipedia:en:justifiable homicide|justifiable homicide]].

Most countries allow conditions that &quot;affect the balance of the mind&quot; to be regarded as mitigating circumstances against murder. This means that a person may be found guilty of &quot;manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility&quot; rather than murder, if it can be proved that they were suffering from a condition that affected their judgement at the time. [[wikipedia:en:Depression|Depression]], [[wikipedia:en:post-traumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] and medication side-effects are examples of conditions that may be taken into account when assessing responsibility. A somewhat different defense is [[wikipedia:en:insanity|insanity]], which is almost exclusively used in cases of psychosis such as that caused by schizophrenia. Also, some countries, such as Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and Australia, allow [[wikipedia:en:post-partum depression|post-partum depression]], or 'baby-blues', as a defense against murder of a child by a mother, provided that a child is less than a year old. See also [[wikipedia:en:crime of passion|crime of passion]].

==Christianity==

===Old Testament===

:''Do not commit murder.'' [[wikipedia:en:Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 5:17 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=5]
:''Do not commit murder.'' [[wikipedia:en:Exodus|Exodus]] 20:12 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=20]

===New Testament===

:''...no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.'' (1 John 3:15)
:''murderers... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.'' (Revelation 21:8)
:''Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.'' (Matthew 5:21)
:''Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill'' (Romans 13:9)
:Listing sins: ''Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings'' (Galatians 5:21) 
:Listing sins: ''Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.'' (Revelation 9:21)
:Listing sins: ''murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars'' (Revelation 21:8)

===Abortion===

Many Christians, especially conservative Christians, oppose [[wikipedia:en:abortion|abortion]], [[wikipedia:en:capital punishment|capital punishment]] and [[wikipedia:euthanasia|euthanasia]] on the grounds that it ends a life and thus constitutes murder.

===Justified murder and execution===
There are many passages in the Bible that could be construed as justifying either murder or capital punishment.

:''Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death.  Such evil must be purged from Israel.''  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)
:''You should not let a sorceress live.''  (Exodus 22:17 NAB)
:''If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.''  (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)
:''A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death.''  (Leviticus 20:27 NAB)
:''Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death.''  (Exodus 21:15 NAB)
:''If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness.''  (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)
:''But if this charge is true (that she wasn't a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father's house.  Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.''  (Deuteronomy  22:20-21 NAB)
:''If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or you intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him.  Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you.  You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.  And all Israel, hearing of this, shall fear and never do such evil as this in your midst.''  (Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB)
:''Suppose a man or woman among you, in one of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, has done evil in the sight of the LORD your God and has violated the covenant by serving other gods or by worshiping the sun, the moon, or any of the forces of heaven, which I have strictly forbidden.  When you hear about it, investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, then that man or woman must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death.''  (Deuteronomy 17:2-5 NLT)
:''One day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father got into a fight with one of the Israelite men.  During the fight, this son of an Israelite woman blasphemed the LORD's name.  So the man was brought to Moses for judgment.  His mother's name was Shelomith. She was the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan.  They put the man in custody until the LORD's will in the matter should become clear.  Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and tell all those who heard him to lay their hands on his head.  Then let the entire community stone him to death.  Say to the people of Israel: Those who blaspheme God will suffer the consequences of their guilt and be punished.  Anyone who blasphemes the LORD's name must be stoned to death by the whole community of Israel.  Any Israelite or foreigner among you who blasphemes the LORD's name will surely die.''  (Leviticus 24:10-16 NLT)
:''Suppose there are prophets among you, or those who have dreams about the future, and they promise you signs or miracles,  and the predicted signs or miracles take place.  If the prophets then say, 'Come, let us worship the gods of foreign nations,' do not listen to them.  The LORD your God is testing you to see if you love him with all your heart and soul.  Serve only the LORD your God and fear him alone.  Obey his commands, listen to his voice, and cling to him.  The false prophets or dreamers who try to lead you astray must be put to death, for they encourage rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of slavery in the land of Egypt.  Since they try to keep you from following the LORD your God, you must execute them to remove the evil from among you.''  (Deuteronomy 13:1-5 NLT)
:''But any prophet who claims to give a message from another god or who falsely claims to speak for me must die.'  You may wonder, 'How will we know whether the prophecy is from the LORD or not?'  If the prophet predicts something in the LORD's name and it does not happen, the LORD did not give the message.  That prophet has spoken on his own and need not be feared.''  (Deuteronomy 18:20-22 NLT)
:''So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired.  As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies.  Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies.  So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever.  Amen.  That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires.  Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.  And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, burned with lust for each other.  Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved.  When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done.  Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.  They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful.  They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents.  They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving.  They are fully aware of God's death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway.  And, worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.''  (Romans 1:24-32 NLT)
:''For the LORD had said to Moses, 'Exempt the tribe of Levi from the census; do not include them when you count the rest of the Israelites.  You must put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, along with its furnishings and equipment.  They must carry the Tabernacle and its equipment as you travel, and they must care for it and camp around it.  Whenever the Tabernacle is moved, the Levites will take it down and set it up again.  Anyone else who goes too near the Tabernacle will be executed.''  (Numbers 1:48-51 NLT)
:''The LORD then gave these further instructions to Moses: 'Tell the people of Israel to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you forever.  It helps you to remember that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.  Yes, keep the Sabbath day, for it is holy.  Anyone who desecrates it must die; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community.  Work six days only, but the seventh day must be a day of total rest.  I repeat: Because the LORD considers it a holy day, anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death.''  (Exodus 31:12-15 NLT)
:''All who curse their father or mother must be put to death.  They are guilty of a capital offense.''  (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)
:''If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.''  (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)
:''A priest's daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death.''  (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)
:''If you find it (that a person in a town worships another god) and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.'' (Deuteronomy 13 NLT)
:''Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.''  (Exodus 22:19 NAB)
:''They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.''  (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)
:''If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, &quot;You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.&quot;  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.''  (Zechariah 13:3 NAB)

==Islam==

Most Muslim scholars believe that all murder is forbidden in Islam.  Some people claim, however that Islam is tolerant of murder, such as writer [[wikipedia:en:Robert Spencer|Robert Spencer]] [http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/818429/posts].

:''And slay not the soul which God has forbidden except for the just cause'' (Koran 17:33)
:''If anyone killed a person not in retaliation for murder or to spread mischief in the land, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind. And if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole of mankind'' (Surah Al-Maaida 5:32)
:''Fight for the sake of Allah those that fight against you, but do not attack them first. Allah does not love the aggressors.'' (Koran 2:190)
:''The Prophet Mohamad said to his army before going to a fight &quot;Depart in the name of Allah, and by his help. And kill not any old man nor young boy nor child, nor woman, But be good doers for Allah loves those who do good.'' (Hadeeth)

===Allah guiding human hands===

:''It is not us who slay them but Allah, in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself.'' (Koran 8:17; cp. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:190)
:''Allah &quot;will punish them by our hands'' (Koran 9:14).

===Martyrdom===

Some sects of Islam believe that those who kill or are killed by unbelievers will enter Paradise after death (Koran 9:111).


:''fight (non-Muslims) and let them find harshness in you'' (Koran 9:123).
:''So when you meet (in fight/war), strike off the heads of the disbelievers and wound many of them, then bind a bond firmly (take as captives). Thereafter, either for generosity or ransom (according to what benefits Islam) until the war lays down its burden...'' (Koran 47:4). 
:''slay or crucify or cut the hands and feet of those who wage a war against Allah and His messenger, that they be expelled from the land with disgrace'' (Koran 5:33).

==Buddhism==

One of the [[wikipedia:en:Five Precepts|Five Precepts]] is ''I undertake to abstain from harming living beings.'' [http://buddhism.about.com/od/ethics/a/IB5.htm].

''Some material for this page was taken from [http://wikipedia.org Wikipedia]'s [[GFDL]] article on [[wikipedia:en:murder|murder]].''

== How Maxwell Fixed Ampère's Law ==

When Maxwell was looking at Ampere's Law, he realised that changing electric fields acted like currents, but this was not present in its current form. So Maxwell added it, and the full version of Ampere's Law became:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf {B} = \mu_0 \mathbf {J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

This realization came about due to the fact that previously Ampere's law was not compatible with the conservation of charge/continuity equation. Upon taking the divergence of Ampere's original equation, it is found that the divergence of the current is equal to zero, which is not in accordance with the conservation of charge.  This paradox was resolved through the introduction of the displacement current.

== Using The New Law ==

When we look at this in a vacuum and combine it to Faraday's Law of Induction:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf {B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

And then we solve this, we can see that it's a wave travelling with velocity c.

== Sketch Proof ==

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\int (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) dt = \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into Ampere's Law gives:

:&lt;math&gt;-\nabla \times \int (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) dt = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

We now use the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

And similarly:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

This should look familiar to you, it's a second derivative with respect to location, equal to a negative second derivative with respect to time. It's a sine function (really imaginary exponential, but it's satisfactory to use sine here). That moves at velocity
&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}&lt;/math&gt;.

And experimental values of these numbers gave results extremely close to the observed value of speed of light.

::''This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other radiations if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws.'' --Maxwell 1865

== How do we really know light is an electromagnetic wave? ==

Just the fact that the speed comes out correct and the fact that light has wave behaviors (interference and diffraction) is not enough -- after all, ''gravitational'' waves would also have these properties. Perhaps the most compelling evidence that light is an ''electromagnetic'' wave is that 
* The reflection of light from conductors and from dielectrics behaves as one expects from Maxwell's equations
* The polarization of light produced by reflection and scattering is as one expects from Maxwell
* High intensity lasers can cause air and other (dielectric) materials to &quot;break down&quot;. This looks like a tiny spark, just as one would expect if light is made of electric and magnetic fields, with the electric field causing dielectric breakdown.
* There is a continuum of radiation types, from radio waves, which we ''know'' are electromagnetic because we fabricate it (and capture their charges with antennas), to light, through microwaves, far infrared, near infrared, light (and beyond). These radiation types exhibit properties continuously and smoothly varying with their wavelength, without jumps.</text>

= Origin of the Universe =

Looking deep inside microscopic particles, physicists need to collide them with high kinetic energies. The
smaller parts of matter they want to observe, the higher energy they need. This is why they build more and more powerful
accelerators. However, the accelerators have natural limitations. Indeed, an accelerator cannot be bigger than the size of our planet.
And even if we manage to build a circular accelerator around the whole earth (along the equator, for example), it would not be able
to reach the energy of &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{17}&lt;/math&gt;MeV at which the grand unification of fundamental interactions takes place.

So, what are we to do? How can we test the theory of everything? Is it possible at all? Yes, it is! The astronomically high values, like
&lt;math&gt;\sim10^{17}&lt;/math&gt;MeV, should be looked for in the cosmos, of course. Our journey towards extremely small objects eventually leads us to
extremely large objects, like whole universe.

Equations of Einstein's theory of relativity can describe the evolution of the universe. Physicists solved these equations back in
time and found that the universe had its beginning. Approximately 15 billion years ago, it started from a zero size point that exploded
and rapidly expanded to the present tremendous scale. This latter point will ever not sufficiently stressed: Big Bang has been an '''Expansion of Space''', and not an expansion in space. At the first instants after the explosion, the matter was at such incredibly high
density and temperature that all particles had kinetic energies even higher than the unification energy &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{17}&lt;/math&gt;MeV. This means 
that at the very beginning there was only one single force and no difference among fundamental particles. Everything was unified and ''simple''.

You may ask ''So what? How can so distant past help us?''. In many ways! The development of the universe was governed by the
fundamental forces. If our theories about them are correct, we should be able to reproduce (with calculations) how that development
proceeded step by step. During the expansion, all the nuclei and atoms in the cosmos were created. The amounts of different nuclei
are not the same. Why? Their relative abundances were determined by the processes in the first moments after the explosion. Thus,
comparing what follows from the theories with the observed abundances of chemical elements, we can judge validity of our theories.

Nowadays, the most popular theory, describing the history of the universe, is the so-called ''Big-Bang'' model. The diagram given
in Fig. 15.11, shows the sequence of events which led to the creation of matter in its present form.

Nobody knows what was before the Big Bang and why it happened, but it is assumed that just after this enigmatic cataclysm, the universe
was so dense and hot that all four forces of nature (strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational) were indistinguishable and
therefore gravity was governed by quantum laws, like the other three types of interactions. A complete theory of quantum gravity has not
been constructed yet, and this very first ''epoch'' of our history remains as enigmatic as the Big Bang itself.

The ideal ''democracy'' (equality) among the forces lasted only a small fraction of a second. By the time &lt;math&gt;t\sim 10^{-43}&lt;/math&gt; sec the universe cooled down to 
&lt;math&gt;\sim 10^{32}&lt;/math&gt;K and the gravity separated. The other three forces, however, remained unified into one universal
interaction mediated by an extremely heavy particle, the so-called &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; boson, which could transform leptons into quarks and 
vice versa.


When at &lt;math&gt;t\sim 10^{-35}&lt;/math&gt; sec most of the &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; bosons decayed, the 
quarks combined in trios and pairs to form nucleons, mesons, and other hadrons. The only symmetry which lasted up to
&lt;math&gt;\sim10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;sec, was between the electromagnetic and weak forces mediated by the &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; particles. 
From the moment when this last symmetry was broken (&lt;math&gt;\sim10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;sec) until the universe 
was about one second old, neutrinos played the most significant role by mediating the neutron-proton transmutations and therefore fixing
their balance (neutron to proton ratio).

Already in a few seconds after the Big Bang nuclear reactions started to occur. The protons and neutrons combined very rapidly to
form deuterium and then helium. During the very first seconds there were too many very energetic photons around which destroyed these
nuclei immediately after their formation. Very soon, however, the continuing expansion of the universe changed the conditions in
favour of these newly born nuclei. The density decreased and the photons could not destroy them that fast anymore.

During a short period of cosmic history, between about 10 and 500 seconds, the entire universe behaved as a giant nuclear fusion
reactor burning hydrogen. This burning took place via a chain of nuclear reactions, which is called the ''&lt;math&gt;pp&lt;/math&gt;-chain'' because the 
first reaction in this sequence is the proton-proton collision leading to the formation of a deuteron. Nowadays, the same
&lt;math&gt;pp&lt;/math&gt;-chain is the main source of energy in our sun and other stars.

But how do we know that the scenario was like this? In other words, how can we check the Big-Bang theory? Is it possible to prove
something which happened 15 billion years ago and in such a short time? Yes, it is! The &lt;math&gt;pp&lt;/math&gt;-chain fusion, 

[[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl13.png|416px|]]

is the key for such a proof.

|- 
| [[Image:Fhsst_atomnucl14.png|416px|]]
|}

As soon as the nucleosynthesis started, the amount of deuterons, helium isotopes, and other light nuclei started to increase. This is
shown in Fig. 15.12 for &lt;math&gt;{}^2&lt;/math&gt;H and &lt;math&gt;{}^4&lt;/math&gt;He. The temperature and the density, however, continued to decrease. After a few minutes
the temperature dropped to such a level that the fusion practically stopped because the kinetic energy of the nuclei was not sufficient
to overcome the electric repulsion between nuclei anymore. Therefore the abundances of light elements in the cosmos were fixed (we call
them the ''primordial abundances''). Since then, they practically remain unchanged, like a photograph of the past events, and
astronomers can measure them. Comparing the measurements with the predictions of the theory, we can check whether our assumptions
about the first seconds of the universe are correct or not.

Astronomy and the physics of microworld come to the same point from different directions. The Big Bang theory is only one example of
their common interest. Another example is related to the mass of neutrino. When Pauli suggested this tiny particle to explain the
nuclear &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-decay, it was considered as massless, like the photon. However, the experiments conducted recently, indicate that
neutrinos may have small non-zero masses of just a few eV.

In the world of elementary particles, this is extremely small mass, but it makes a huge difference in the cosmos. The universe
continues to expand despite the fact that the gravitational forces pull everything back to each other. The estimates show, that the
visible mass of all galaxies is not sufficient to stop and reverse the expansion. The universe is filled with a tremendous number of
neutrinos. Even with few eV per neutrino, this amounts to a huge total mass of them, which is invisible but could reverse the expansion.

Thus, the cooperation of astronomers and particle physicists has led to significant advances in our understanding of the universe and its
evolution. The quest goes on. Albert Einstein once said &quot;The most incomprehensible thing about this Universe is that it is comprehensible.&quot;</text>

The word telescope originates from the Greek language (''τηλεσκόπιο''), and it means literally ''far-seeing''. It is an instrument that is intended to gather information, usually in the form of light or other energy, about a distant location that can not be perceived directly by the unaided eye. Telescopes let you magnify faint stars, and see finer detail. This allows you to, for example, distinguish one star as two stars that are very close (such as Mizar A and B).

Telescopes are used by astronomers to gather visual and other information the human eye alone cannot see. They do so by means of a large collector surface that then directs the incoming energy photons into a smaller focusing lens. This large surface also allows the resolution of fine details that are too close together for the human eye to discern. It was through his usage of the telescope that Galileo discovered that the celestial spheres weren't perfect, as had been thought. He could see sunspots, and the lunar &quot;seas&quot;.

Today, observational astronomy covers the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Telescopes detecting other fundamental particles are also very common. Nonetheless, we shall start with our most familiar part in the field, the optical region in the spectrum.

Some difficulties with telescopes are '''chromatic aberration''' (different colors focused at different points) and '''spherical aberration''' (light isn't focused at a single point). Spherical aberration can occur when the reflecting mirror in a telescope isn't a true parabola.

'''Adaptive optics''' are used to compensate for atmospheric distortion which is caused by small changes in the refractive index of the atmosphere, which is responsible for the &quot;twinkling&quot; effect.

The Light Gathering Power of a telescope is measured by the area of the lens divided by the area of the eye.

Large telescopes are housed inside '''observatories'''. One of the most famous is the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, named after James Lick, a streetcar baron, who made donations to have the observatory built. When he died, he was buried beneath it.

'''Light pollution''' makes stargazing difficult. This is caused by fixtures (such as streetlamps) that allow light to go up into the atmosphere where it is reflected and creates a &quot;fog&quot; of light that makes viewing very dim distant objects difficult.

==The spectrum==
Our sense of sight is based upon particles of electro-magnetic energy that are emitted by objects and then collected by our eyes. These particles are vibrating quanta of energy that are known as ''photons''. Every photon oscillates at a particular frequency, and the range of all possible frequencies is called the ''spectrum''.

Human eyes are attuned to a particular frequency range of photons that lie within the visual portion of the spectrum. We can not directly view photons that vibrate at frequencies above or below this range, although measuring instruments have been constructed to measure these parts of the spectrum.

All the information we have about the planets in our solar system, and the stars and galaxies comes to us from photons that have traveled that great distance. It is almost exclusively by means of these photons that astronomers have been able to assemble our current knowledge of the universe beyond the Earth.

''(Some people are working on the [[Wikipedia: Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory| Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory]] and the [[Wikipedia: Virgo interferometer | Virgo interferometer ]] to try to detect gravity waves, composed of &quot;gravitons&quot;, that have traveled that great distance.)''

'''Fibers''' are long chains of [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]] that are undigestable to the human digestive tract. Consuming enough fiber in your diet is important, as it bulks up the stools and allows them to retain moisture better, resulting in easier defecation. 

Some foods that have high amounts of fiber include [[Cookbook:Legumes|legumes or beans]], [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichokes]], [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]], [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]], [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]], and [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]].

'''Mutton''' can either mean the meat from an adult sheep (contrast with [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]]), or meat from a [[Cookbook:Goat|goat]]. Most English-speaking countries refer to sheep meat as mutton, whereas some [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian]] and [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean]] use the term for goat.

Mutton from adult sheep is more flavoursome than lamb, but is fattier and tougher to cook. It would easier to cook the meat if it could be seasoned with ginger, which softens the meat and makes it cook faster. Ginger also removes the musky smell of the meat. Mutton is increasingly hard to find, as butchers and supermarkets move more towards easier cooking cuts of meat. Mutton is preferred over lamb for stews and long-simmered curries.

Mutton from goat (sometimes called ''chevon'') is much leaner than both lamb and mutton from sheep. It is a very flavoursome meat, well suited to spicy stews and curries. Being very lean, oil or fat often needs to be added to the meal, especially when pan-frying or barbecuing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Burns''' should be immediately immersed in cold running water, or shower for large area.  Do not wait to remove clothes.  This should be maintained for at least 10-15 minutes.  

Continue for at least 1 hour with cold pack, partially insulated with clean fabric (cotton, thin toweling), or further immersion in iced water.  Blistered or open burn wounds should be cleaned and covered with non-adhesive gauze (preferably bactericidal) and cotton dressing.  DO NOT use butter, oils or any similar treatment which can trap heat and increase risk of infection.  Also do not use antiseptics that may aggravate sensitive skin.  

Consult a medical physician immediately for any large, deep, infected or otherwise serious burn.

Aloe vera extract, silverdene (Silver Sulfazdiazine), topical analgaesics and NSAID are commonly used medications.  Consult a doctor before use.

Burns are sustained by electricity, heat , chemical or radiation (sunburn). There are three levels of burns, including first degree burns (Superficial burn), second degree burns (Partial thickness burn) and third degree burns (Full thickness burn). The first degree burn is typical sunburn with symptoms such as redness of the skin and pain. Second degree often has blisters and severe pain. Third degree can be caused by fires and caustic chemicals. Often the victim will feel no pain because the nerves have been destroyed, even though the skin is deeply charred.

Burns that cover more than ten percent of the body, or are larger than the casualty's palm, are medical emergencies and need to be treated as such. Also ANY burns to the face, hands or groin should be considered critical and require an examination by a physician.

 | '''Learning Objectives'''

* define the purpose of SGML, HTML, and XML
|}


There are four central problems in data management: capture, storage, retrieval, and exchange of data.
The purpose of this book is to address '''XML''', ''a technology for managing data exchange''.  The foundational XML chapters in this book are structured by a 'data model' approach.  The first chapter introduces the reader to the XML document, XML schema, and XML stylesheet with a single entity example.  Subsequent chapters expand upon the XML basics with multiple-entity examples and a one-to-one relationship, a one-to-many relationship, or a many-to-many relationship.

XML is a tool used for data exchange.  Data exchange has long been an issue in information technology, but the Internet has elevated its importance. Electronic data interchange (EDI), the traditional data exchange standard for large organizations, is giving way to XML, which is likely to become the data exchange standard for all organizations, irrespective of size.

[[w:Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] supports the electronic exchange of standard business documents and is currently the major data format for electronic commerce. A structured format is used to exchange common business documents (e.g., invoices and shipping orders) between trading partners. In contrast to the free form of e-mail messages, EDI supports the exchange of repetitive, routine business transactions. Standards mean that routine electronic transactions can be concise and precise. The main standard used in the United States and Canada is known as  [[w:ANSI_ASC_X12 | X.12]], and the major international standard is [[w:UN/EDIFACT| UN/EDIFACT]]. Firms adhering to the same standard can share data electronically.

The Internet is a global network potentially accessible by nearly every firm, with communication costs typically less than those of traditional EDI. Consequently, the Internet has become the electronic transport path of choice between trading partners. The simplest approach is to use the Internet as a means of transporting EDI documents. But because EDI was developed in the 1960s, another approach is to reexamine the technology of data exchange. A result of this rethinking is XML, but before considering XML we need to learn about SGML, the parent of XML.

==SGML==
For a typical U.S. firm, it is estimated that document management consumes up to 15 percent of its revenue, nearly 25 percent of its labour costs, and anywhere between 10 and 60 percent of an office worker’s time. The '''[[w:Standard Generalized Markup Language|Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)]]''' is designed to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of document management.

A '''[[w:markup_language|markup language]]''' embeds information about a document within the document's text. In the following example, the markup tags indicate that the text contains details of a city. Note also that the city's name, state, and population are identified by specific tags. Thus, the reader—a person or a computer—is left in no doubt as to meaning of ''Athens'', ''Georgia'', or ''100,000''. Note also the latitude and location of the city are explicitly identified with appropriate tags. SGML’s usefulness is based upon both recording text and the meaning of that text.

'''Exhibit 1: Markup language'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;city&gt; 
       &lt;cityname&gt;Athens&lt;/cityname&gt; 
       &lt;state&gt;GA&lt;/state&gt;
       &lt;description&gt; Home of the University of Georgia&lt;/description&gt;
       &lt;population&gt;100,000&lt;/population&gt;
       &lt;location&gt;Located about 60 miles Northeast of Atlanta&lt;/location&gt;
       &lt;latitude&gt;33 57' 39&quot; N&lt;/latitude&gt;
       &lt;longitude&gt;83 22' 42&quot; W&lt;/longitude&gt;
&lt;/city&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

SGML is a vendor-independent [[w:International_Organization_for_Standardization|International Standard]] ([[w:List_of_ISO_standards|ISO]] 8879) that defines the structure of documents.  Developed in 1986 as a [[w:Metalanguage|meta language]], SGML is the parent of both [[w:HTML|HTML]] and [[w:XML|XML]]. Because SGML documents are standard text files, SGML provides cross-system portability. When technology is rapidly changing, SGML provides a stable platform for managing data exchange. Furthermore, SGML files can be transformed for  publication in a variety of media. The use of SGML preserves textual information independent of how and when it is presented. Organizations reap long-term benefits when they can   store documents in a single, independent standard that can then be converted for display in any desired media.

SGML has three major advantages for data management:
*'''Reuse''': Information can be created once and reused many times.  
*'''Flexibility''': SGML documents can be published in any format. The same content can be printed, presented on the Web, or delivered with a text synthesis. Because SGML is content-oriented, presentation decisions can be delayed until the output format is decided. 
*'''Revision''': SGML supports revision and version control. With content version control, a firm can readily track the changes in documents. 

A short section of SGML demonstrates clearly the features and strength of SGML (see Exhibit 2). The tags surrounding a chunk of text describe its meaning and thus support presentation and retrieval. For example, the pair of tags &lt;airline&gt; and &lt;/airline&gt; surrounding “Delta” identify the airline making the flight.

'''Exhibit 2: SGML example'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
   &lt;flight&gt;
       &lt;airline&gt;Delta&lt;/airline&gt;
       &lt;flightno&gt;22&lt;/flightno&gt;
       &lt;origin&gt;Atlanta&lt;/origin&gt;
       &lt;destination&gt;Paris&lt;/destination&gt;
       &lt;departure&gt;5:40pm&lt;/departure&gt;
       &lt;arrival&gt;8:10am&lt;/arrival&gt;
   &lt;/flight&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The preceding SGML code can be presented in several ways by applying a [[w:Style_sheet_(web_development)|style sheet]] to the file. For example, it might appear as

Delta flight 22 flies from Atlanta to Paris leaving 5:40pm and arriving 8:10am

or as

{| width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;lightgreen&quot;
|-
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Airline&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Flight&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Destination&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Departure&lt;/font&gt;
| align=&quot;left&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ffff66&quot; | &lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Arrival&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;left&quot; | Delta
| align=&quot;left&quot; | 22
| align=&quot;left&quot; | Atlanta
| align=&quot;left&quot; | Paris
| align=&quot;left&quot; | 5:40pm
| align=&quot;left&quot; | 8:10am
|}


If the data are stored in HTML format and rendered on a Web site (as in Exhibit 3), then the meaning of the data has to be inferred by the reader. This is generally quite easy for humans, but impossible for machines. Furthermore, the presentation format is fixed and can only be altered by rewriting the HTML. If you are not familiar with HTML, you should read the WikiBooks chapter on [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/XHTML|XHTML]], an extension of HTML, before reading the next chapter.

'''Exhibit 3: HTML rendering example'''
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
    Delta flight 22 flies from Atlanta to Paris leaving 5:40pm and arriving 8:10am
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Meaning and presentation should be independent''', and this is an important reason why SGML is more powerful than HTML.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: linen; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
SGML is a markup language that defines the structure of documents and is preferred to HTML as it can be transformed into a variety of media.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==XML==

Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. A time-consuming challenge is to exchange data between such systems. XML is a generic data storage format that comes bundled with a number of tools and technologies that should make it easier to exchange specific XML 'applications' between incompatible systems. Since XML is open and generic, it is expected that as time progresses, more and more organizations and people will jump onto the XML bandwagon, both developers and data users. This should make XML the ultimate viable technology for certain types of data exchange.

XML is used not only for exchanging information, but also for publishing Web pages. XML's very strict syntax allows for smaller and faster Web browsers and as such is well suited for use with [[w:Personal_digital_assistant|Personal Digital Assistants]] (PDAs) and [[w:Mobile_phone|cellphones]].  [[w:Web_browser|Web browsers]] that interpret HTML documents, on the other hand, are bloated with programming code to compensate for HTML’s not so strict coding.  

The types of data generally well suited for encoding as XML are those where field lengths are unknown and unpredictable and where field contents are predominantly textual. 

An [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/Data_schemas|XML schema]] allows for the exchange of information in a standardized structure.  A schema defines custom markup tags that can contain attributes to describe the content that is enclosed by these tags.  Information from the tagged data in the XML document can be extracted using an application called a “parser”, and with the use of an XML stylesheet the data can be formatted for a Web page.

XML's power lies in the combination of custom markup tags and content in a defined XML document.  The purpose of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is to make information self-describing. Based on SGML, XML is designed to support electronic  commerce.  The definition of XML, completed in early 1998 by the [[w:World_Wide_Web_Consortium|World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), describes it as a meta language — a language to generate languages. XML should steadily replace HTML on many Web sites because of some key advantages. The major differences between XML and HTML are captured in the following table.

'''Exhibit 4: XML vs HTML'''

{| align=&quot;center&quot; cellspacing=10
 |- align=&quot;center&quot;
 | '''XML'''
 | '''HTML'''
 |-
 | Information content
 | Information presentation
 |-
 | Extensible set of tags
 | Fixed set of tags
 |-
 | Data exchange language
 | Data presentation language
 |-
 | Greater hypertext linking
 | Limited hypertext linking
 |}


The eXtensible in XML means that a new data exchange language can be created by defining its structure and tags.  For example, the [http://www.opengis.org/ OpenGIS Consortium] designed a [[w:Geography_Markup_Language|Geography Markup Language]] (GML)  to facilitate the electronic exchange of geographic information. Similarly, the [http://www.opentourism.org Open Tourism Consortium] is working on the definition of TourML to support exchange of tourism information. The insurance industry uses data corresponding to the XML based standard [http://www.acord.org ACORD] for electronic data exchange. Another good example of XML in action is [http://www.newsml.org NewsML&amp;trade;].

In this text we will cover all the features of XML, but at this point let us introduce a few of the key features.


&lt;div style=&quot;background: linen; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 80%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
'''Applications of XML''':

Before we start learning more about how an XML document is structured, let us point out what XML can be used for. The four major implementations of XML are:

'''Publication''': Database content can be converted into XML and afterwards into HTML by using an [[w:XSL_Transformations|XSLT]] stylesheet. Making use of this technique, complex websites as well as print media like PDF files can be generated. Information no longer has to be stored in different formats (i.e. RTF, DOC, PDF, HTML). Content can be stored in the neutral XML format and then, using appropriate layout style sheets and transformations, brochures, websites, or datalists can be generated (See more in [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/Database and XML|Chapter 17]].)

An example of the capability of XML and XSLT can be found at http://www.emimusic.de: This website contains approximately 20,000 pages with profiles of the artists, their products and the titles of the songs. These pages are generated using a XSLT script. Based on the script used it will also be possible to create a catalog in PDF format. Please see below for more details.

'''Interaction''': XML can be used for accessing and changing data interactively. This man&lt;-&gt;machine communication usually happens via a web browser (see [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/Cocoon|Chapter 12]]).

'''Integration''': Using XML, homogenous and heterogenous applications can be integrated. In this case, XML is used to describe data, interfaces, and protocols. This machine-machine communication helps integrate [[w:Relational_database|relational databases]] (i.e. by importing and exporting different formats).

'''Transaction''': XML helps to process transactions in applications like online marketplaces, supply chain management, and e-procurement systems.

&lt;/div&gt;

===Key features of XML===
* Elements have both an opening and a closing tag
* Elements follow a strict hierarchy, with documents containing only one root element
* Elements cannot overlap other elements
* Element names must obey XML naming conventions
* XML is case sensitive

XML will improve the efficiency of data exchange in several important ways, which include:
* '''write once and format many times:''' Once an XML file is created it can be presented in multiple ways by applying different XML stylesheets. For instance, the information might be displayed on a web page or printed in a book.
* '''hardware and software independence:''' XML files are standard text files, which means they can be read by any application.
* '''write once and exchange many times:''' Once an industry agrees on a XML standard for data exchange, data can be readily exchanged between all members using that standard.
* '''Faster and more precise web searching:''' When the meaning of information can be determined by a computer (by reading the tags), web searching will be enhanced. For example, if you are looking for a specific book title, it is far more efficient for a computer to search for text between the pair of tags &lt;booktitle&gt; and &lt;/booktitle&gt; than search an entire file looking for the title. Furthermore, spurious results should be eliminated.
* '''data validation''' XML allows data validation using XSD or DTD which is a contractual agreement between two interacting parties.

===10 reasons to use XML===
# XML is a widely accepted open standard.
# XML allows to clearly separate content from form (appearance).
# XML is text-oriented.
# XML is extensible.
# XML is self-describing.
# XML is universal; meaning internationalization is no problem.
# XML is independent from platforms and programming languages.
# XML provides a robust and durable format for information storage.
# XML is easily transformable.
# XML is a future-oriented technology.

===The major XML elements===
The major XML elements are:
* '''XML document''': An XML file containing XML code.
* '''XML schema''': An XML file that describes the structure of a document and its tags.
* '''XML stylesheet''': An XML file containing formatting instructions for an XML file.
In the next few chapters you will learn how to create and use each of these elements of XML.

=== Creating a markup file ===
Any text editor can be used to create a markup file (e.g. an HTML file). In this book, we use the text editor within [[w:NetBeans|NetBeans]], an open source [[w:Integrated_development_environment| Integrated Development Environment (IDE)]] for Java, because NetBeans supports editing and validation of XML files. Before proceeding, you should download and install NetBeans from http://www.NetBeans.org/.

The examples in this book use NetBeans to illustrate proper XML code.  For an alternative to NetBeans, see [[../Exchanger XML Lite/]]

==Case Studies in XML Implementation==

===XML at United Parcel Service (UPS)===
“UPS is a service company and it is all about scale and speed,” says Geoff Chalmers, Project Leader at UPS eSolutions Department.  In 2003, UPS had $33.5 billion annual revenue and 357,000 employees worldwide.  Six percent of the United States' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on any given day is in the UPS system.

UPS uses technology extensively.  The Information Systems department employs 4,000 people.  The company's web site has 166 different country home pages and is supported by 44 applications.

UPS delivers around 13 million packages every day, and customers can track these shipments via the UPS Web site, which receives around 200 million hits daily.  Nineteen of the applications within ups.com are XML OnLine Tool ([[w:Web service|Web services]]) applications.

UPS’s online tools are developed specifically to be integrated with customers’ applications.  This makes the customer’s task simpler, easier, and faster.  UPS verified the importance of simplicity and speed, via “[http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/bussol/offering/technology/automated_shipping/pbm.html CampusShip],” a product that has been one of the UPS’s most successful in the last 10 years.  UPS CampusShip® is a Web-based, UPS-hosted shipping system.  Using an Internet connection, employees can ship their own packages and letters from any desktop, while management maintains overall control of shipping activities.  UPS CampusShip® allows simultaneous shipper autonomy and managerial cost-control within the organization. This product has been successful because no installation or software maintenance is required and it is quick to implement.  XML Online Tools enabled cheap and fast evolution of CampusShip®.

UPS favors XML especially because it is agnostic; platform and language independent.  These features make XML very flexible and powerful.  It is also decoupled and scalable. XML has enabled UPS to target a broader market and reduce customer interaction, and thus the cost of customer service. Another positive feature of XML is that it is backward compatible.  The adoption of XML has reduced maintenance, implementation, and usage costs significantly within UPS.

However these advantages don’t come without a price.  “XML is inefficient in so many ways” says Chalmers.  XML unfortunately takes more CPU and bandwidth than the other technologies.  Yet bandwidth and CPU are cheap and getting cheaper everyday, so this is a gradually disappearing problem.

Nevertheless, Chalmers also thinks that XML doesn’t work well in databases.  He says that it is too wordy and it is an exchange medium rather than a database medium. There were some early attempts to tightly integrate XML and databases.  Because databases do supply structure and identification to data as does XML, the value-add of XML-database integration is limited to applying hierarchical structure.   On the other hand, if data is to be stored as a blob, then XML makes sense.  Another problem that he points out about XML is that business rules cannot be expressed in XML schemas.

Finally, raw XML programming and debugging can be challenging.  Therefore, UPS’s enterprise customers are starting to explore the code generators and embedded facilities to be found in [[w:Microsoft_.NET|.NET]] and [[w:BEA_Services|BEA]].  However, hand coding by experienced in-house engineers is a must for the high availability, scalability, and performance that UPS requires for the UPS OnLine Tools.

===XML at EMI Music===

'''How is it used?'''

EMI Music Germany GmbH &amp; Co. KG, a famous German record label, displays information about the artists it is affiliated with  [http://www.emi.de/ on its website]. Visitors are able to explore all their audio or video productions.
The whole website consists of nearly 20,000 pages that contain information about artists and their products (CD, DVD, LP). Everything is properly linked and systematically grouped.

After all, there is data to be provided for every artist, albums, samples, pictures, descriptions or article codes. The site is updated on a daily basis and is subject to change by a web editor whenever it’s necessary. Now this is a fairly complex and large amount of data to be handled.

This is where XML comes into play. The data, which is stored in a database, has been transformed into XML code. Now an XSLT stylesheet converts this data into HTML code, which can be easily read by any web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer or Firefox).

'''What's the benefit?'''

The advantage of XML is that the programming effort is considerably lower as compared to other formats. This is because XML lies at the point of intersection of XSLT and HTML.

It’s also no problem for the web editor to update the website. Using XML makes it easy for the person in charge to deal with this large amount of data.

'''Going beyond…'''
On the basis of the XML scripts thus far produced by EMI Music, the company could easily produce a PDF-formatted catalog or design i-Mode pages for the current mobile phone generation. Thanks to XML, this can be done with little extra effort.

==A brief history of XML==
In the late 60s Charles Goldfarb, Raymond Lorie and Edward Mosher all working for IBM started to develop GML (Generalized Markup Language), a text formatting language. The language was successfully applied for internal documentation procedures. As it used to be common, the document editing was performed in the batch-mode. GenCode, another procedure to define generic formatting codes for the typesetting systems of various software producers, was developed by the GCA (Graphic Communications Association) at about the same time. Both of these technologies, GML syntactically and GenCode semantically, served as basis for the development of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). The process of standardization started at the U.S. Standardization institute ANSI in the early 80s and in 1986 SGML finally passed as ISO standard ISO2879:1986.

SGML is reckoned to be a complex and comprehensive language (the specification extends 500 pages). However, the success of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) proved that the concepts of SGML were appropriate. SGML-based HTML was developed by [[w:Tim Berners-Lee|Tim Berners-Lee]] in Geneva, in the early 90s in order to illustrate and link documents in the Internet. Meanwhile, HTML developed as the most successful format for all electronical documents. The Internet was originally designed as a space for human-human and human-machine communication but lately machine-machine communication has gained tremendous importance, putting a completely new challenge on the computer languages used. 

HTML is a descriptive language for the presentation of documents. The main focus is on the presentation, meaning that an HTML-document mixes the presented data and its formatting instruction. A human being may recognize the displayed semantic by means of the presentation and the context meaning; a machine or (better-said) software is unable to.

In 1996 a team under the guidance of Jos Bosak attending the W3C-consortium was established to make SGML web-suitable. The result was a 30-page specification, which received in February 1998 the status of a  &quot;W3C-recommendation&quot; and was named &quot;Extensible Markup Language (XML)&quot;. 

The most important goals developing XML were:
* XML should be compatible with SGML
* XML should be easy to use in the Internet
* The number of optional characteristics should be minimized 
* XML-documents should be easy to generate and human-readable 
* XML should be supported by a variety of application 
* It should be easy to write programs for XML
* XML should be put into practice on time

In the terminology of markup languages, a description formulated in XML is called a XML-document, albeit the content has nothing to do with text processing.

==Why is this book not an XML document?==
If you have accepted the ideas presented in this chapter, the question is very pertinent. The simple answer is that we have been unable to find the technology to support the creation of an open text book in XML. We need several pieces of technology
* An XML language for describing a book. [http://www.docbook.org/ DocBook] is such a language, but the structure of a book is quite complex, and DocBook (reflecting this complexity) cannot be quickly mastered
* A Wiki that works with a language such as DocBook
* A XML stylesheet that converts XML into HTML for displaying the book's content

There is a project to create [http://wiki.wikiml.org/index.php?WikiMl WikiMl] (Wiki MarkupLanguage), and this might be used at some point.

== Working with fractions ==

Mixed numbers and top heavy fractions:

A mixed number is an integer and a fraction, eg 2 and a half, a top heavy fraction is a fraction with a larger numerator than demominator, eg 3/2.  For multiplication and division you must not use mixed numbers.  They can be used in addition and subtraction (do the integers and fractions seperately and combine the result) if this is not too confusing.

Simplest terms:
Multiplying (or dividing) the numinator and denominator by the same number will not change the fraction.  A fraction is put into its simplest terms by dividing both by the largest integer that goes into both a whole number of times, this can be done in stages using small integers such as 2 and 3, 5 and 10 repeatedly.

Multiplication:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{c}*\frac{b}{d} = \frac{ab}{cd}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ab=a*b.  

Division:

To divide fractions; remember that a fraction &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; a division.  Fractions can be stacked like so:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}}&lt;/math&gt;

The rule to remember to simplify is that anything under an odd number of lines goes on the bottom and anything under an even number of lines goes on the top (0 is even for this purpose) thus:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{ad}{bc}&lt;/math&gt;

It is easier (perhaps) to remember that the the second fraction in the division gets turned upside down.


Addition and subtraction:

For addition the denomintators of the two fractions must be the same - if this is so then simply add (or subtract) the numerators:


 &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{b} = \frac{a+c}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

If the denominators are not the same then a common denominator must be found, the simplest way to do this is take the product of the denominators allthough if one is a multiple of the other simply multiplying it by the aplicable integer works aswell.  Remember to multiply the numerators by the same number.  In general:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+cb}{bd}&lt;/math&gt;


But for example

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{5}+\frac{b}{10} = \frac{2a+b}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

Is possible.

Remember that young children will not understand the algebraic formulation here.  The art of primary teaching is finding a way to make this make sense to young children. However, teachers need to know these general rules.

'''Shrimp''' and '''prawns''' are crustaceans, related to [[Cookbook:Lobster|lobster]], [[Cookbook:Crab|crab]], [[Cookbook:Crayfish|crayfish]], and [[Cookbook:Krill|krill]]. Prawns are not shrimp, but are generally indistinguishable in culinary usage; see the recipes listed below for details.

To remove the shells, start by pinching away the leg-like gill structure. Then split the shell from there, pulling it off the rest of the way. You may wish to remove the &quot;vein&quot; on the back, which is actually the digestive tract. If the shrimp are already deveined, they will be split along the back, and a good way to peel them is to simply squeeze forefinger and thumb against the tail. This will push the &quot;meat&quot; out and allow you to easily pluck off the remnants of the shell. Of course, this results in tail-less shrimp.

The easiest way to cook shrimp is by [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]]. Simply place them into a pot of boiling water and cook them until they change color, generally becoming pink. You can serve the shrimp with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]], [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]], a mixture of both, or a fancier [[Cookbook:Cocktail Sauce|cocktail sauce]].

Shrimp also go well in [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], including [[Cookbook:Fried Rice|fried rice]].

A more difficult and dangerous [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep fat frying]] procedure can be used to produce [[Cookbook:Fried Shrimp|fried shrimp]]. There are several types including [[Cookbook:Southern Fried Shrimp|Southern fried shrimp]] (non-puffy batter containing [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]) or [[Cookbook:Chinese Fried Shrimp|Chinese fried shrimp]] (puffy cornmeal-free batter, as used in westernized [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] cooking), and [[Cookbook:Tempura|tempura]] (thin and sometimes flakey [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] style).

The shells and tails from peeled shrimp can be used to make a stock. Simply place the shells and tails in a pot with a small amount of water, bring to a boil, then cover and simmer while you prepare the rest of the dish. This stock can then be used to flavour the dish, and/or used as a component of the cooking liquid to make shrimp-flavoured rice.

:'''''The concept of input is perhaps the single most important concept of second language acquisition. . . . In fact, no model of second language acquisition does not avail itself of input in trying to explain how learners create second language grammars''''' (Gass, 1997, p. 1)

:'''''We cannot ignore the fact that learners need access to abundant amounts of comprehensible input in order for acquisition to happen.''''' (Wong, 2005, p. 34)

== Introduction ==
While there is disagreement among [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Second_language_acquisition | second language acquisition (SLA)]] researchers and theorists concerning many aspects of SLA, there is quite broad consensus on the obvious importance of input in acquiring a FL. That is, in order for spoken and/or written competence in a FL to be acquired, the language must be encountered in spoken and/or written form.

In addition, there is increasing evidence that the amount of input, that is, the frequency with which various forms of language are encountered is an important determining factor in SLA. Ellis (2002) has reviewed how several aspects of language acquisition, including phonology, orthography, vocabulary, morphology, and syntax, depend on the frequency of exposure.  This is also the case for first language acquisition as it has been shown that native English speakers take less time to produce the past tense form of frequent irregular verbs (e.g., went) compared to less frequent irregular verbs (e.g., slung) (Prasada, Pinker, et al., 1990; Seidenberg &amp; Bruck 1990).

Ellis (2002) summarizes the importance of input frequency in language acquisition thus:

:For language learners to be accurate and fluent in their generalizations they need to have processed sufficient exemplars that their accidental and finite experience is truly representative of the total population of language of the speech community in terms of its overall content, the relative frequencies of that content, and the mappings of form to functional interpretation.  The enormity of the lexical pool, the range of frequencies from 60,000 per million down to 1 per million and below, and the wide range of different linguistic constructions, when considered from the point of view of sampling theory, makes it clear that the necessary representative experience for fluency must be vast indeed. (p. 167)

So the case has been made that language learners need considerable exposure to the target language if they hope to attain any useful degree of fluency in it.  And it becomes less of a puzzle to understand why FL learners, particularly those who attempt to acquire a FL in settings lacking extensive exposure to the language, typically fall far short of anything approaching native speaker fluency in their FL. &lt;&lt;add Cummins info here about hours of exposure in traditional and immersion classes&gt;&gt;

If frequent exposure to a FL is necessary for its acquisition, the question then arises as to the kind of input that is best for developing proficiency.  One well known and highly influential (and controversial) answer to this question has been provided by Krashen in a series of articles and books on SLA theory and practice (Krashen, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1992, 1994, 1997). Krashen’s theory of SLA consists of five major hypotheses, the one of most relevance here being the Input Hypothesis (Krashen, 1981, p. 100).  The Input Hypothesis states that in order for language acquisition to occur, the input must have an appropriate degree of difficulty.  The appropriate level of difficulty, according to Krashen, is what he calls level i + 1, that is, just a bit beyond the learner’s current ability (i), but not so difficult to seriously impair comprehension nor so easy that no new language challenges are encountered.  By encountering a constant but small proportion of new language forms among familiar ones in a meaningful, communicative context, the learner is able to infer the meaning and function of the new forms using the linguistic and extralinguistic context provided by the situation.

All of Krashen’s hypotheses about SLA have been criticized by other SLA theorists and researchers over the last quarter-century, including his Input Hypothesis.  Concerning the latter, it has been noted that there is no clear way to know what i + 1 would be for any particular learner (Gregg, 1984; White, 1987) and no way to make sure a learner is exposed to input at i + 1 rather than i + 0 (too easy) or i + 2 (too hard).  But in spite of these problems, it is nonetheless the case that the notion of i + 1 enjoys general acceptance in many fields of learning, such as Ausubel’s (1963) theory of verbal learning and Vygotsky’s (1978) Zone of Proximal Development to account for the development of higher mental skills.  The matching of a task’s challenge to the learner’s skill is also an important component of the Flow Theory as developed by Csikszentmihalyi (see Egbert, 2003).  Ways of exposing language learners to i + 1 input will be considered later below.

The field of SLA has gone through many changes since sustained scientific study of the acquisition, learning, and teaching of second languages began in the 1950s.  While much work still needs to be done in the field and much disagreement remains concerning many key aspects of second language acquisition, learning, and teaching, there appears to be a developing consensus concerning the necessary and optimal conditions for acquiring a second language as an adult.  Necessary (if not sufficient) conditions include lots of comprehensible input in aural and/or written form, at least some of which is slightly beyond the linguistic ability of the learner, but still largely comprehensible given the linguistic and extralinguistic context and the learner’s real-world knowledge.  We will now explore the ways in which the Internet can be used to provide such input to autonomous second language learners.

=== Books and Documents ===

====Multiple Languages====

[[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Project Gutenberg | Project Gutenberg]] [http://www.gutenberg.org]. Although we may usually think of the World Wide Web as the largest repository of text-based language materials, the use of the Internet as a means to disseminate texts actually began many years before the Web came into existence.  In 1971, Michael Hart began Project Gutenberg in order to make books freely available to the world’s readers.  As of August, 2006, Project Gutenberg has made over 19,000 public domain books available to anyone with an Internet connection.  Although the majority of these books are in English, 24 other languages are also represented including Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Sanskrit, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Welsh, and Yiddish.

Due to copyright restrictions, Project Gutenberg includes only older books, usually those first published before 1930.  Nonetheless, Project Gutenberg  is a useful resource for anyone interested in obtaining older and classic books in the languages mentioned above that can be read on a computer monitor or printed out.

=== Comic strips and comic books ===

Comic strips and comic books available on the web are variously referred to as [[wikipedia:Webcomic | webcomics]], web comics and online comics. They include both comics available only online as well as web versions of printed and syndicated comics

By pairing text with illustrations and treating varied themes ranging from inane comedy to graphic violence, webcomics provide an valuable if perhaps unused means of developing proficiency in a foreign language and are particularly valuabe to exposing learners to modern, vernacular forms of the language.

===Online Course Material===

There is a large and increasing amount of educational material on the Web provided by universities worldwide to support online courses and degree programs. This is an excellent source of material academic reading material in several languages. The [http://www.ocwconsortium.org/ Open Courseware Consortium] is one source of such materials with [http://www.ocwconsortium.org/about/members.shtml consortium members] in Austria, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Portugal, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela and Vietnam. [http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html Massachusetts Institute of Technology] is at the forefront in providing free online course materials with materials for hundreds of courses and also provides [http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Global/OCWHelp/avocw.htm audio and video] for many of these courses. MIT is also involved in [http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Global/AboutOCW/Translations.htm translating] many of these course materials into [http://www.universia.net Spanish, Portuguese], and [http://core.org.cn Chinese].

=== Encyclopedias ===

==== Multilingual ====

[http://www.wikipedia.org '''Wikipedia'''] is the &quot;free-content encyclopedia that anyone can edit&quot; with reference articles in over 100 languages.  It has over 1,000,000 articles in [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Main Page | English]] and over 50,000 articles in [http://de.wikipedia.org German], [http://fr.wikipedia.org French], [http://ja.wikipedia.org Japanese], [http://nl.wikipedia.org Dutch], [http://pl.wikipedia.org Polish] and [http://sv.wikipedia.org Swedish]. For learners of English, there are over 3,000 articles in [http://simple.wikipedia.org Simple English].  Wikipedia has particularly good coverage of topics relating to information technology.

Because Wikipedia articles exist in many languages and anyone may edit them, language students may do more with the articles than just use them as sources of input.  For example, Chinese students studying English reading may find it useful to translate Wikipedia articles that exist in English into Chinese and thereby contribute to the Chinese-language version of the Wikipedia.  Or, Chinese students focusing on English writing may choose instead to translate Chinese-language Wikipedia articles into English, or create new articles in the English-language Wikipedia about their city or college or important people in their community and thereby contribute to the Chinese cultural content of the English-language Wikipedia. While Wikipedia editing lends itself easily to group work, by requiring students to logon using their name or ID, teachers can see the contribution of each student as well as see all changes and additions each student has made.  That native speakers of the target language may make additional changes is something that the students can watch for (using a &quot;my watchlist&quot;) to see how their writing is corrected.

==== Spanish ====

*[http://www.kalipedia.com '''Kalipedia'''] Kalipedia is a free, online, Spanish-language encyclopedia oriented toward secondary education begun on 16 October 2007. It is published by Grupo Santillana which is owned by Grupo Prisa. Its content is controlled centrally, but users can make suggestions for corrections.

=== Monolingual and Bilingual Dictionaries, Thesauruses, Translators and Concordance Tools ===

Foreign language readers of texts written for native speakers will surely encounter many words and phrases whose meaning they can only guess.  While inferring the meaning of new words and phrases based on context and knowledge of the subject matter is a good skill for foreign language readers to develop, there are times when a reader may want or need to find a definition using either a monolingual dictionary or a FL to L1 translation dictionary.  Fortunately, there are many such dictionaries available at no cost on the Web.

====Multilingual====

*The '''WordTranslator''' option of the [http://toolbar.google.com Google Toolbar] for the [[wikipedia:Firefox | Firefox]] and [[wikipedia:Internet Explorer| Internet Explorer]] web browsers provides mouse-over translations of English words into Chinese (traditional and simplified), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Spanish. No non-English to English-language translations are provided, however, so this feature is useful primarily for readers of English as a second language.

*For English-speakers reading non-English languages, [http://www.wordchamp.com '''WordChamp'''] provides a free [http://www.wordchamp.com/lingua2/Reading.do Web Reader] that provides instant mouse-over translations in many different languages (best coverage is provided for French, German, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese, but there is a significant amount of vocabulary in a dozen other languages, and registered users can add their own vocabulary). There are over 60,000 audio recordings of native speakers (in eleven languages), which can be listened to while reading a site. This is a very powerful tool for reading foreign-language texts (WordChamp also includes other tools that are discussed in the Exercise and Assessment sections of this wikibook), although translations for many low-frequency words are not provided, the latest version of WordChamp allows users to add their own translations which in a wiki fashion should dramatically increase the word coverage.

*Ultralingua [http://www.ultralingua.net] also provides translations by clicking on words found on webpages. A few free lookups can be made each day. A subscription of $29.95 per year is required to allow up to 500 lookups per day. Unlike WordChamps web reader, Ultralingua's does not provide pronunciations of any words. It is also limited to translating among English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, but it currently appears to have greater coverage of words in these languages than does WordChamp's web reader (which is free; see above).

* [http://www.word2word.com World2World Language Resource] provides links to bilingual translation dictionaries involving 192 languages (from Abadani to Zarma), including many specialized dictionaries, e.g., computer culture and technology. 

* English speakers learning Spanish, French or Italian, or speakers of any of the latter languages learning English will find the online versions of Collins translation dictionaries provided by [http://www.wordreference.com WordReference.com] useful.  As noted on their website, their English-Spanish dictionary alone contains more than 160,000 words and more than 230,000 translations and would take up 1290 pages of paper to print.  Particularly handy is that WordReference can be used as a browser add-on tool which allows the user to quickly translate any word found in any Web page using Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator on a Windows computer.

* Another useful online word resource is the [http://www.onelook.com OneLook Dictionary Search], a “search engine for words” with links to 5 million words in over 90 online dictionaries.  [http://www.freedict.com Freedict] provides two-way bilingual dictionaries online that link English to 16 other languages.

* [http://www.eloquentsw.com/livedictionary.html '''LiveDictionary'''] provides mouse-over, pop-up monolingual and bilingual dictionary support for Macintosh Safari 1 users under Panther (OS 10.3). (The Macintosh Tiger 10.4 OS includes pop-up dictionary support for Safari 2.)

* [[wikimedia:Link_Everything_Online | '''LEO''']], (for [http://www.leo.org &quot;Link Everything Online&quot;]) is an impressive resource for language learners needing bilingual, bidirectional [http://dict.leo.org/?lang=de&amp;lp=ende German-English] (410,686  entries) and [http://dict.leo.org/?lang=de&amp;lp=frde German-French] (139,073 entries) dictionaries.  LEO provides not only definitions but also grammatical information, usage examples, idioms, and pronunciation (including audio) for any English or German word entered.  For example, entering the words “eye” produced not only five German translations of “eye,” but also 28 verbs and verb phrases containing eye (e.g., “to catch someone’s eye”), 22 phrases and collocations (e.g., “in the twinkling of an eye”) and more than 50 composed entries (e.g., “eagle eye”).  In addition, every word that appears as part of a definition or example is linked to a definition and other entries of its own.

* The [http://www.visualthesaurus.com Visual Thesaurus] is a subscription-based ($2.95/month) visual thesaurus in English (version 3), Dutch, French, German and Spanish (beta version).

* [http://www.lextutor.ca The Compleat Lexical Tutor] developed by Tom Cobb provides some useful and unique vocabulary resources for learners of English and French.

=== [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Personal_digital_assistant | PDAs]] (Personal Digital Assistants) ===

While the availability of interesting multilingual texts and language tools on the Internet gives language learners access to a wide range of second reading material that could not be obtained otherwise, using a desktop or laptop computer is not always the most convenient means for reading them.  Printouts, of course, can be made, but printing takes time, consumes paper and ink, and produces output that can be inconvenient to carry around.  An alternative that combines the accessibility of the Internet with the portability of a palm-sized device involves using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to store and display FL texts.  While reading a book, magazine or newspaper article from a PDA requires the reader to put up with small type on a small screen, this may be compensated by the advantage of having foreign-language reading material always available and accessible at any time, such as while commuting in a bus or train or waiting in line at a bank or ticket office.  The most popular PDAs are those that use the Palm or Pocket PC operating system and the least expensive PDA with enough memory to be used for such a system is currently the [http://www.palmone.com/us/products/handhelds/zire21/ Palm Zire 21] which has 8MB of memory and a monochrome screen for $99.

==== Connecting PDAs to the Internet ====

There are two ways to put Web content on a PDA such as those produced by [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:PalmOne%2C_Inc. | Palm or PalmOne]], [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Pocketpc | Pocket PC]], or [[metawikipedia:wikipedia:Zaurus | Zaurus]].  The first is to connect the PDA directly to the Internet for web browsing.  This requires that the PDA be connected to the Internet using a wired connection (which limits its mobility) or a wireless connection (which requires a more expensive PDA and a wireless Internet subscription service or public WiFi access point).  The second way involves using a desktop or laptop to obtain web content and then transferring the content from personal computer to PDA.  Do to its significantly lower cost and the wide availability of personal computers, this latter method is recommended.

* [http://manybooks.net '''Manybooks.net'''] claims to have &quot;10,425 eBooks formatted for reading on your Palm, PocketPC, Zaurus, Rocketbook, or Symbian cellphone&quot; obtained from Project Gutenberg and other sources formatted for downloading to and reading on a PDA.  In addition to English which represents the majority of books, texts are also available in Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Sanskrit, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, and Welsh.

* [http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/gut '''gut'''] is a free program that can convert any plain-text file into Plucker format (see below) for downloading to a Palm PDA.  gut is particularly useful for converting the many Project Gutenberg etexts that have not already been converted for use on a PDA and are therefore not available on Manybooks.net.

* [http://www.avantgo.com '''AvantGo'''] is “a free service that delivers thousands of mobile websites to consumers on their personal data assistants (PDAs) and smartphones” (from AvantGo’s website).  Information from these mobile websites (called “channels”) is downloaded to one’s PDA (Windows CE, Palm OS or Symbian) via either wireless surfing or while synching with one’s Internet-connected personal computer.  While the majority of AvantGo’s mobile channels are in English, several free non-English channels are also available.  These include BBC Mundo and Punto-com (Spanish), Le Monde interactif – actualités and Ici Radio-Canada.ca (French), and Spiegel Online (German).  All of these channels provide current news articles updated at least daily.  Other FL AvantGo channels are in Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian and Swedish (do an “advanced search” after registering to find these).

* A main advantage of AvantGo is that it automatically downloads the latest versions of the channels you have selected each time you synch your PDA.  However, language learners may want to transfer to their PDAs websites and articles found on websites that are not included in AvantGo. [[metawikipedia:wikipedia: Plucker | '''Plucker''']] [http://plkr.org (official website)] is a free, open-source “web-clipping” program that allows the user to download any Website and (optionally) its links to a Palm PDA thereby allowing users to “carry the web in the Palm of your hand!” (from website).   Having Plucker installed on your Palm OS device also allows the user to access the ebooks provided by Manybooks.net described in the previous section.

==== Bilingual Dictionaries for PDAs====

If one is going to be reading a FL on a PDA, a bilingual dictionary will certainly prove useful.  Fortunately, there is no shortage of such dictionaries, but unlike those available on the Web, they are not free.

There are two main types of translating dictionaries available for PDAs.  The first type provides minimal translation and grammatical information (and may not even include the grammatical gender of French, Spanish or German nouns).  An example of this type are the Bdicty Dictionary Readers provided by [http://www.beiks.com Beiks] for Palm OS, PocketPC, eBookMan and Zaurus plus WinCE and Java smartphones.  The advantage of this minimalist approach is that these dictionaries are relatively inexpensive and take up little memory.  A software bundle consisting of all the Palm OS BDicty dictionaries needed for two-way translation plus phrase books for English with Spanish, French and German can be had for $24.95, all taking up less than a total of 4 megabytes of total memory.  

The other type of bilingual dictionaries for PDAS have larger word lists, more complete translations, usage examples and grammatical information. The bilingual dictionaries provided by [http://www.ultralingua.com Ultralingua] are of this type and include conjugation information for many verbs in certain versions of their PDA dictionaries.  Ultralingua provides two-way bilingual PDA (Palm and Pocket PC) dictionaries for English paired with French, German, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian, Norwegian, Latin and Esperanto as well as French-German, French-Spanish, French-Italian, Spanish-Portuguese, and German-Spanish. Users can also add there entries to these dictionaries and access them from other Palm or Pocket PC applications. Two disadvantages of the Ultralingual dictionaries compared to the minimalist BDicty dictionaries are the former’s higher cost ($29.95 for each language pair) and increased memory demands of about 3 MB for each dictionary installed.

Many of these PDA dictionaries are available in free trial versions that are limited either in the amount of entries included or the amount of days the software will operate without purchasing a registration key.

There is an enormous amount and variety of reading material available via the Internet in all of the world’s commonly studied languages and many less-commonly ones, too.  Books, newspapers and magazines articles are available to anyone with Internet access (even relatively slow telephone modems) using a computer with a web browser.  And many of these texts can be easily downloaded to a PDA for instant access anywhere and anytime.

=== Internet Audio ===

For autonomous language learners interested in improving their listening comprehension, the Internet now provides a diversity of audio sources comparable to what is available in text.  A wide range of audiobooks in many languages are available for free or purchase and radio stations from almost every country in the world are now streaming their broadcasts on the Internet.  These are accessible to any Internet-connected computer on which the appropriate streaming media player has been installed, even using a relatively slow telephone modem.  The most popular formats for streaming audio programs on the Internet are those playable on [[wikipedia:Real Player | RealPlayer]] (for Windows, Macintosh and Unix/Linux) or [[wikipedia:Windows Media Player | Windows Media Player]] (for Windows or Macintosh) with [[wikipedia:QuickTime | QuickTime]] (for Windows and Macintosh) and [[wikipedia:WinAmp | WinAmp]] (for Windows) also occasionally encountered.  Almost all audio on the Web is playable with one of these free players and some programs are provided in two or more of these formats.  Audio programs may be provided in both live and pre-recorded (on-demand) format with some pre-recorded programs available for download (allowing the user to play the program later without having to be connected to the Internet).

While the Internet links provided above connect to many interesting Internet radio stations in Spanish, French and German, readers may well want to find there own sources of audio programs in these and other languages.  Fortunately, there are many directories of Internet radio stations on the web that can help language learners find radio stations in a desired country and/or language.  Several of these that have been found useful are:

* [http://radiotime.com RadioTime] provides links to &quot;10,000+ radio stations and shows&quot; (from website). Radio stations providing Internet streaming can be easily found in different languages by searching by [http://radiotime.com/region/c_0/Browse_Locations.aspx &quot;browsing by location&quot;] and choosing the country where the desired language is spoken. Registered users (free) can store favorite stations as presets stored in user-defined directories. For a fee, RadioTime also provides software for users to automatically record desired radio shows as predetermined times either via the Internet or off the air using their USB radio receiver. 
* [http://www.reciva.com/ Reciva Radio Directory] The Reciva Internet Radio Directory lists over 5,000 stations in 327 categories that can be searched by name, country and genre.

These can be heard using an Internet-connected personal compter or a [[Wikipedia:Internet_radio_device | Internet radio device]] using Reciva technology. As most of the audio streams are in Windows Media Player (WMP), Macintosh users should download and install the free [[Wikipedia:Flip4Mac | Flip4Mac]] plug-in, which enables the playing of WMP streams and files on QuickTime, and/or [[Wikipedia:VLC_media_player | the VLC media player]].

==== Enhancing Convenience, Accessibility and Portability of Internet Audio ====

While the current accessibility of FL radio on the Internet is a marvelous resource for FL students, there are a number of factors which limit the usability of this resource.  This section will address several of these limitations and suggest ways of overcoming them.

Reliability and playback control. One problem with listening to Internet radio is its lack of reliability.  While broadcast radio stations are usually very reliable and are only rarely interrupted by extreme weather, power blackouts, or equipment failure, this is not the case for many Internet radio stations.  Interruptions in service may be due to software or hardware problems at the providers end, high demand (unlike broadcast radio, an Internet radio station can be received only by some finite number of listeners), interruptions to the user’s Internet service, or Internet traffic jams and slowdowns causing an audio player to lose its data stream.

Although there is nothing that an individual user can do about these problems except try again later, there is a way to automatically restart dropped audio streams by embedding the audio link in a web page that refreshes periodically.  Users who have some knowledge of HTML and webpage design can see how this is done [http://www.uiuc.edu/ph/www/g-cziko/fl_radio/fl_radio here] by viewing the source for the page.  Users of this page to gain access to live programs in Spanish, French and German will notice a brief pause every 30 minutes when the page refreshes.  If the link had been lost during this time, it will be automatically connected again (if available).  This website also allows listeners to construct a playlist of desired recorded (on-demand) programs with an option to repeat the list indefinitely.  Having one or more programs repeat indefinitely is one way to give FL learners repeated exposure to the same program to aid in comprehension.  These playlist and repeat features are especially useful when combined with one of the low-power radio rebroadcast options described below.

The popularity of VCRs is due partly to their ability to record television shows for playback later at a more convenient time.  Listeners of Internet radio can also record live and archived (on-demand) programs using [http://www.replay-radio.com Replay Radio].  Costing $29.95 with a free demo version available, Replay Radio allows the user of a Windows computer to schedule recordings of favorite audio sites which are stored as [[Wikipedia:Mp3 | MP3]] files that can be played back using any one of many programs and playback devices, such as Apple’s iPod music player or other portable MP3 player.  Setting up one-time or automated daily or weekly recordings is quite easy using this software.  Another audio recording program of interest is [http://www.relaxingsoftware.com/recallbuy.htm Total Recall].  A $20 shareware program for Windows, Total Recall lacks Replay Radio’s automatic scheduling function, but it allows recording (to MP3 and WAV format) of any audio produced by one’s computer, including an attached microphone.  For Macintosh users, WireTap [http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/freebies/ Wire Tap] is a free program that records all audio produced by the computer.  [http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/ Audio Hijack] provides added features for recording audio from the Mac, including the ability to restrict recording to a selected program and set start and stop times for unattended operation (see [http://www.macworld.com Macworld’s] March 2004 issue for a review of these and another streaming audio recording software).

==== Speed Control (Variable-Speed Playback)====

Intermediate-level FL learners will undoubtedly find that many of the radio programs produced for domestic audiences use language that is simply too fast for good comprehension.  While there is nothing one can do about this for normal broadcast radio, there are ways to control the speed of Internet radio.

Versions 9 and 10 [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/mp10/default.aspx Windows Media Player] (WMP) for Windows XP includes a variable speed playback control for locally stored files in WMA, WMV, WM, MP3 or ASF format.  Speed can be varied continuously from half (0.5) to twice (2.0) normal speed without changing the pitch of the audio (avoiding the “chipmunk effect”).  (Users of WMP 9 should note that only slow (0.5), normal and fast (1.4) speeds can be selected from the Play command (Play &gt; Play Speed).  To set the playback speed anywhere between 0.5 and 2.0 go to Now Playing &gt; Enhancements &gt; Play Speed Settings.)

Although WMP speed control cannot be used for live or recorded (on-demand) streaming audio, some providers of FL Internet radio allow users to download their archived audio programs.  Radio France Internationale, for example, allows users to download (“télécharger”) all of its recent news broadcasts in both RealPlayer and WPM format (go to [http://www.rfi.fr/Fichiers/ecouter/audiocarte.asp audiocarte]).  One can download the desired broadcast in WMP by clicking on the WMP icon (an arrowhead inside of a multicolored circle) and then play it back as slow as 0.5 using the WMP 9 player for Windows XP.

[[metawikipedia:wikipedia:QuickTime|QuickTime Player]] version 7 and higher (free) for Macintosh and Windows also permits speed control on playback of MP3 and some other types of audio files as well as MP4 (video).  To use this feature, go to Windows -&gt; Show A/V Controls and move the slider anywhere from 1/2 to three times normal speed. The ability of QuickTime Player to vary the playback speed of MP3 and MP4 files means that it is possible to play any audio or video podcasts at a slower or faster speed than normal. By right-clicking on an audio or video podcast in iTunes and selecting &quot;Show Song File,&quot; the selected file can be opened and played with QuickTime Player instead of with iTunes which does not provide speed control.

[[metawikipedia:wikipedia:iTunes|iTunes]] does not allow variable-speed playback.  However, by right-clicking (control-click for Macintosh) on a desired track and selecting &quot;Show Song File&quot;, it is easy to find the actual MP3 file. Then right-clicking on the file will allow you to play the file using Windows Media Player or QuickTime Player.  On the Macintosh with OS X, it is possible to drage the file into the QuickTime Player icon if you have this on your task bar to play the file.

A more powerful and flexible speed control option for Internet audio is a commercial plug-in called 2xAV from [http://www.enounce Enounce]. Available in versions for both RealOne Player and WMP (for Windows computers only), ''2xAV'' allows speed control of all RealPlayer and WMP content, whether stored locally or streaming from the Internet.  Allowing speed control anywhere between 0.3 and 2.0 times normal speed, 2xAV’s ability to control the speed of streaming audio is particularly useful for FL learners.  This works best, however, for archived (on-demand) audio as slowing down or speeding up live streams results in playback gaps as the player’s buffer either overflows (during slow playback) or is exhausted (during fast playback).  2xAV in either WMP or RealPlayer versions costs $29.95 with a free trial download available.

'''The Amazing Slow Downer''' by [http://www.ronimusic.com/ Roni Music] ($44.95 for Macintosh and Windows) allows you to speed up or slow down audio on a Mac from -50% to 400% normal speed. You have the ability to control the pitch, keeping it the same level as the original speed or highering or lowering it, and there is a built-in equalizer. You can then save the sped-up or slowed-down files for later playback on one's MP3 player or computer. You can listen to audio from most non-proprietary formats (MP3, WAV, AIFF) and WMA on Windows. You can also listen to the audio from MP4 video files, however the video is not displayed. The product is intended principally for musicians who want to transcribe music or play music at different speeds, but can easily be used for slowing down L2 audio to help with listening comprehension. The Amazing Slow Downer can be very useful for those L2 learners who own a Mac and would like to vary the speed on sound files to help practise listening comprehension.

Although language learners will more often find it useful to slow down the speed of FL Internet radio programs, playing audio at faster than normal speeds may also be useful for listening practice and assessment.  It has been found that some people can listen and understand speech at up to four times normal speed. [http://www.heingartner.com/fasttalk/Now_Hear_This,_Quickly.htm] Having students listen repeatedly to an audio extract at progressively higher speeds that provide comprehensible yet challenging input may be an effective way to “push” the development of a language learner’s listening proficiency by keeping the audio at i + 1.  Having a student adjust the speed of presentation to the fastest speed that remains comprehensible may also provide a way for self-assessment of listening proficiency.

==== Accessibility and Portability ====

While recording and speed control software operate on the dimension of time to make FL Internet radio more convenient and accessible, there are also ways to make Internet radio more convenient and accessible on the dimension of space.  Although predicted to disappear shortly after the introduction of television, the continued existence and popularity of AM and FM broadcast radio is largely due to the fact that broadcast radio can be listened to anywhere (home, car, park, beach) at anytime using small, portable, and low-cost equipment (AM/FM portable radios can be found for less than $10).

This is certainly not the case for Internet radio. Internet radio requires a computer connected to the Internet. While the availability of wireless Internet access (WiFi) continues to grow (particularly on college campuses), using WiFi with a laptop computer is still not nearly as convenient as broadcast radio, and cannot easily be used while walking on campus, driving, or working around one’s home.

One way for FL Internet radio to approach the same convenience and portability of broadcast radio is to use an unlicensed, low-power FM or AM transmitter to broadcast FL Internet programs in one’s home or on a high school or college campus.  This is legal under [[Wikipedia:Part_15 | Part 15]] of [[Wikipedia:Federal_Communications_Commission | FCC]] regulations in the U.S, with similar laws existing in Canada (this option is currently not permitted in the U.K.).  For home use, the [http://www.ccrane.com/radios/fm-transmitters/fm-transmitter.aspx &quot;Digital FM Transmitter&quot;] sold by [http://www.ccrane.com the C. Crane Company] allows one to broadcast Internet radio from a computer on any FM frequency between 87.9 and 107.9 MHz.  This $69.95 unit (which includes an integrated telescoping antenna and can be powered using two AA batteries or the included AC adaptor) allows one to listen to Internet radio in any room of one’s house or apartment that has an FM radio or stereo system with an FM tuner, or outside near the house using a portable radio.  The high-quality, stereophonic signal provided by this unit makes it also quite suitable for listening to music.  Although the transmitter is quite weak out of the box, a simple [http://www.xmfan.com/viewtopic.php?t=3257&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0 modification] can be made that will increase its power so that is can be picked up throughout a entire home.

The [http://www.progressive-concepts.com/info/item.html?id=71 Panaxis ACC100 FM transmitter] available from [http://www.progressive-concepts.com Progressive Concepts] for $199.95 has a stronger monophonic signal than the Crane stereo transmitter and it had been used for about two years to broadcast Radio France Internationale throughout the Foreign Languages Building of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and to much of the quad located to the west and north of the building on 90.5 FM.  The audio output of an Internet-connected computer was connected to the transmitter’s input with the transmitter’s three-foot wire antenna simply taped to the inside of an office window in the French Department.  Another FM transmitter (not tested) designed to be used with Windows or Macintosh computers via a USB port is the [http://www.canakit.com/Contents/Items/UX300.asp USB UX300 transmitter] for $97.76.

Better broadcast coverage is possible using low-power AM transmitters.  Two approaches are possible in the U.S.  The first is to use an FCC certified transmitter that produces no more than 100 milliwatts (1/10 watt) of power and uses an antenna no more than three meters long.  While this power is less than that produced by a small Christmas tree light, a quality transmitter properly installed can be heard a mile or more away, covering most school and university campuses.  One such transmitter that has received good reviews is the [http://www.am1000rangemaster.com Rangemaster 1000] which is available in versions ranging from about $800 to $1000.  It is also possible to link several Rangemaster 1000 transmitters together to provide yet greater coverage. [http://www.itsyourstation.com ItsYourStation.com] has installed many of these transmitters in schools and colleges throughout the U.S. and will provide a turn-key system including studio components for between $2000 and $4000.

An inexpensive approach to low power AM broadcasting is to build your own Part 15, 100 milliwatt transmitter kit. [http://www.ontheair3.com Low Power Radio and Broadcast Company] offers several models of high quality, high performance AM transmitter kits. They are available in both unassembled or assembled. Prices start at $159.95 and have the range of 1/4 to 2 miles when using an outdoor antenna and are ideal for schools, churches, and community broadcasting. These kits are legal to use and comply with Part 15 regulations.

The second approach to low-power AM broadcasting in the U.S. is to take advantage of [[Wikipedia:Part_15 | Part 15]] of [[Wikipedia:Federal_Communications_Commission | FCC]] rules and regulations that permit educational institutions in the U.S. to broadcast signals in the AM broadcast band without limit to the signal strength reaching no more than 30 meters beyond the campus boundaries.  Referred to as Campus Free Radiate (CFR), this approach makes it possible to cover an entire large campus with a centrally located transmitter putting out as much power as needed (10 watts should easily cover a large campus) as long as the signal strength does not exceed specified limits off campus.  Many U.S. universities make use of such systems for unlicensed educational and student radio stations, including Indiana University and Arizona State University, using equipment costing less than $4000 (including transmitter, antenna coupler and antenna) available from [http://www.radiosystems.com Radio Systems].  

There are two things to keep in mind if radio is to be used to make Internet foreign language radio programs more accessible and portable on an educational campus.  First, all unlicensed low-power transmitters must not cause interference to licensed radio stations.  Second, in most cases written permission to rebroadcast Internet radio programs using low-power FM or AM transmitters to locations outside of one’s own home or personal property must be obtained from the copyright holders.  Fortunately, such permission is usually granted at no cost from [http://www.rnw.nl Radio Nederlands], [http://www.rfi.fr Radio France Internationale] and [http://www.dw-world.de the Deutsche Welle] for rebroadcast on the college campuses.  In contrast, neither [http://www.rtve.es/rne/ree/ Radio Exterior España] nor [http://www.bbc.co.uk the BBC] currently allows rebroadcast of its programs obtained from the Internet.  However, Radio Exterior de España will send audio CDs of their programs for rebroadcast on a regular basis (see www.rtve.es/rne/ree/Intercambios.htm) and the BBC will also send CDs of past Spanish programs produced by [http://www.bbcmundo.com BBC Mundo] in Spanish for free rebroadcast.  The radio programs produced by [http://www.voa.gov the Voice of America] in 45 languages are in the public domain and may be rebroadcast without obtaining written permission.

[http://latinoradioservice.org The Latino Radio Service] of [http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/lacasa La Casa Cultural Latina] of [http://www.uiuc.edu the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] appears to be the only low-power AM campus station broadcasting FLs in the U.S. Beginning operation in January 2005, the Latino Radio Service provides news, culture, information and music programs in Spanish and Portuguese using programming available via the Internet (see [http://www.flickr.com/photos/gcziko/sets/72057594117130897/ photos of transmitting equipment]).

Used alone or in combination with the recording and speed-control software described above, low-power broadcasting of Internet FL radio programs has the potential to make FLs very accessible on high school and college campuses throughout the U.S., Canada and any other country that permits such unlicensed low-power broadcasting for educational use (imagine the popularity such systems would enjoy at Chinese universities, if permitted by authorities, for broadcasting programming in English!).

===Podcasts and Podcasting===

[[Wikimedia:Podcasting | Podcasting]] is a way making audio files available to the Internet (see [http://www.ipodlounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/understanding-the-podcasting-revolution/ iPodloung article on podcasting].  Users can subscribe to various feeds (for a directory see [http://www.ipodder.org ipooder.org]) using software that automatically downloads new files (programs) to their computer which can then be automatically &quot;synched&quot; to a portable digital music player.

There are hundreds if not thousands or audio programs available as podcasts in English, with fewer available in other languages.  Podcasting has great potential in allowing language learners to always have with them new and interesting audio programs in their language they are studying.  See the [[Wikipedia:List_of_radio_stations_with_podcasts | list of radio stations with podcasts]].

On 28  June 2005 Apple released '''iTunes''' 4.9 for the Macintosh and Windows.  This was the first  version of iTunes that provides support for podcast reception and production.  You can read more about [http://www.ipodlounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/the-complete-guide-to-itunes-49-with-podcasts/ iTunes 4.9 and how to use it to play and subscribe to podcasts].

In version 6.  of iTunes, podcasts in languages other than English can be found by clicking on &quot;Podcasts&quot; as the source in the left column, than clicking the arrow next to &quot;Podcast&quot; on the top left of the main window and then scrolling down and under &quot;Categories&quot; selecting &quot;International&quot; and then the desired language. A wide range of podcasts focused on learning languages are also available under the &quot;Education&quot; category.

'''MyPodder''' by podcastready [http://www.podcastready.com/ (official site)] makes it possible to receiver podcasts directly on a digital media player, PDA, USB memory or memory card without having to first download and store the podcasts on a computer. Once the device is loaded with the MyPodder program files, it will find and download subscribed podcasts when connected to any Windows computer with a live Internet connection.

'''Yahoo! Podcasts''' [http://podcasts.yahoo.com (official site)]'provides an extensive directory of podcasts and allows you to play selected podcasts from their Web interface.  If Internet Explorer is used as your browser, you can also vary the speed of playback using this interface.

====English Speech Accents====
[http://accent.gmu.edu/ The Speech Accent Archive] developed at George Mason University  presents a large set of speech samples from a variety of language backgrounds. Native and non-native speakers of English read the same paragraph and are carefully transcribed. The archive is used by people who wish to compare and analyze the accents of different English speakers&quot; (from website).

==Text and Audio==

In addition to using the Internet as source of FL materials for reading or listening, the Internet also provides language learners the opportunity to read and listen to the same material at the same time or different times.  Processing both text and audio forms of a FL can be especially valuable for students of English and other languages with writing systems that provide unreliable clues to the pronunciation of words (as in “tough,” “bough,” “though,” and “cough”). Both pre-reading a text before listening and simultaneous reading and listening to a text can greatly aid comprehension and provide the student with important information on how words are written and pronounced in the FL.

Here is an [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302244 article on how song lyrics can be added to iTunes 5 or later as well as the iPod Nano and fifth generation iPods]. Of course, one can also add transcripts to voice (non-music) MP3 and AAC (M4P) files on iTunes and these iPods.

===English===

It can be difficult, to find websites that provide audio programs with written transcripts.  Two good sources for learners of English that provide text and accompanying audio are [http://web.archive.org/web/20080516013505/http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish VOA] and the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish BBC]. Both provide news and feature articles in both text and audio form so that the learner can pre-read the text before listening to the audio or read along with the broadcast. Taiwan English-language radio station [http://www.icrt.com.tw ICRT] also provides transcripts and downloadable audio files and podcast versions of its [http://www.icrt.com.tw/en/eznews_am.php morning] and [http://www.icrt.com.tw/en/eznews_pm.php afternoon] “EZ News” that includes (actually, not-so-easy) news of Taiwan and world news.

[http://english.donga.com/ Dong-A news] is another web news that provides news in four languages--Korean, Chinese (simplified), Japanese, and English with both text and audio forms. Learners can also compare texts in English and in other three languages. It is a resource not only for learning English, but for learning Chinese, Japanese, and Korean as well.

Another source of text with accompanying video are ebooks and, particularly those that are in the public domain and are offered for free in both text and audio versions (see Audiobooks above). For example, here can be found the [http://literalsystems.com/abooks/audio/goblin_market audiobook version of the poem ''Goblin Market''] by Christina Rossetti.  Although the text version of this poem is not to be found on the LiteralSystems website, a Google search of the opening words &quot;Morning and evening maids heard the goblins cry&quot; quickly reveals where the [http://www.poetryconnection.net/poets/Christina_Rossetti/17738 full text of this poem] can be found.

[http://loudlit.org LoudLit.org] provides several books, short stories and poems that are presented both via text and audio.

[http://www.britishcouncil.org/professionals-podcast-english-listening-downloads-homepage.htm/ British Council] provides audio clips and text files for listening practice. Audioscripts also contains comprehension questions.

===Spanish===

*[http://www.e-spanyol.hu/en/transcript.php Learn Spanish Online] This is a link to a various amount of Spanish transcripts and their audio online. There are a couple of sounds and the rest focus on pronunciation of letters, words, vowel combinatinos and more. It also goes through pronunciation of commonly used words and phrases in Spanish by native Speakers. They speak slowly enough to be understood and follow the transcript perfectly. Really good as far as pronunciation, listening and following the transcript are concerned.

===Text to Audio Activities===

For online text and matching audio, the following activity involving initial reading and variable-speed listening may prove valuable in improving both reading and listening comprehension of a language.

# Read text, using [http://www.wordchamp.com/lingua/ReadingChampSetup.do WordChamp Web Reader] and/or online dictionaries as needed for comprehension.
#Play audio, reducing speed using [[Wikipedia: Windows Media Player | Windows Media Player]] (to set the playback speed anywhere between 0.5 and 2.0 go to View &gt; Enhancements &gt; Play Speed Settings)or Enounce's [http://www.enounce.com/ 2xAV] plug-in ($29.95) for [[Wikipedia: RealPlayer | RealPlayer]] as necessary for comprehension.
#Play audio repeatedly at slightly faster speeds until there is 100% comprehension at normal speed.
#Consider playing audio again at faster than normal speed for speed listening training.

=== Internet Video ===

In addition to text and audio input, the Internet also promises to be a useful and engaging source of FL input using video (accompanied by audio).  Its present capabilities, however, are still somewhat limited.  Even with a broadband connection and fast computer, Internet video for the most is limited to small, poor-resolution images.  While Internet audio quality often approaches or matches CD quality, there is nothing yet on the Internet that approaches the video quality obtained by even an inexpensive color television set.

A techology called [[Wikipedia:Vodcast | '''vodcasting''']] permits the publication and viewing of on-demand video via the web, much like podcasting allows for audio programs (see also [http://www.vodcast.nl VODcast.nl]).

[[wikipedia:Google Video | Google Video]] [http://video.google.com] has an increasing number of playable videos.  Most appear to be in English, but other languages are available, too.

==== DVD Players (hardware) for Language Learners ====
Language learners wishing to improve their language proficiency in a foreign language by viewing foreign-language movies and other programs available on DVDs, may find certain features available on some DVD players useful.  These include:

* '''Universal features'''
** ''Zone-free capability'' allows playing DVDs from any region in the world (see [[Wikipedia:Dvd#Region_codes | region codes]])
** ''PAL-to-NTSC and NTSC-to-PAL conversion'' allows playing PAL format DVDs (e.g., European) on NTSC televisions (e.g., U.S.) and vice versa
** ''Universal voltage capability'' allows operation of player from 110 (e.g., in U.S.) to 240 volts (e.g., Europe)

* '''Special playback features'''
** '''Variable-speed playback'' with audio that does not change frequency
** ''Instant replay'' with or without selectable jump-back time interval (about 6 seconds is good to hear a sentence or phrase repeated)
** ''A-B Repeat'' allows the user to indicate with a remote control keypress points A and B while the DVD is playing; player then continuously repeats the A-B segment until a third keypress which causes the DVD to play normally again.

* '''DVD Player Information and Reviews'''

** ''Malata DVP-558.'' Purchased (by GC) from HK [http://www.hkflix.com HK Flix.com] in March 2005 for $159.95 US plus $14.95 US for shipping to the U.S.  This model has all the universal features listed above.  The only special playback feature it has is A-B repeat.  With this feature, if the A-B button on the remote control is pressed twice, the player will repeat the section from A (where first pressed) to B (where pressed second).  This A-B section will be continuously repeated until the A-B button is pressed a third time at which time normal playback continues.

==== DVD Movies ====

Viewing movies in a foreign language can an entertaining and effective way to improve one's listening comprehension in a foreign language.  Due to the fast, colloquial speech used in many movies, even intermediate to advanced learners of a foreign language can experience considerable difficulty in understanding the language used in a movie.

The availability of [[wikimedia:Closed captions | '''closed captions''']] on DVD movies can greatly facilitate the comprehension of foreign-language movies.  Provided for deaf or hearing handicapped viewers, closed captions allow the foreign-language viewer to see (read) what the characters are saying by providing on the screen a transcript of the audio porton of the film.  However, while closed captions are quite common on DVDs released in the U.S. and Canada, they are less likely to be found on other DVDs.  In addition, the captions provided by some DVD movies are not a verbatim transcriptions of the spoken script but rather often paraphrase what is being said, thereby compomising their value for language learners.

Also very useful but even less common is the provision audio description.  Intended primarily four the blind and visually handicapped, [[wikimedia:Audio description | '''audio description''']] provides a spoken description of the scenes and actions of a movie.  By listening to the audio description, language learners can learn many new words as they are used in a meaningful context.

Information is provided below on DVD movies that include subtitles, closed captions and/or audio description in the movie's original language.

== Games ==

Games can also be a source of meaningful input for students and can be used to supplement content-based lessons.

Note that games not specifically meant to be &quot;educational&quot; can also be very useful. Varieties of game that involve a lot of language that must be understood to solve puzzles, or with a compelling storyline told with language are the best. If solving a puzzle rests on understanding the language used by the game, there is more motivation to figure out the meaning than if the language is not necessary to playing the game.

There are various practicalities to playing games in other languages. Computer and handheld games don't tend to be region-locked so the only problem in that case is importing the games. If the target language is spoken somewhere within the region (as defined by games companies) then for console gaming it's just a matter of importing the material. If the target language is only spoken outside of your region, consoles will (usually) either have to be imported or modified to play foreign games.

== Conclusion ==

As described above, the wide variability of interesting and high-quality FL text and audio now available via the Internet provides an extremely valuable resource for FL learners.  A computer anywhere in the world connected to the Internet allows access to these materials in dozens of not hundreds of languages.  As detailed above, the resources for learners of Spanish, French and German (not to mention English for ESL learners) are particularly abundant, including daily newspapers, current magazines and interesting radio programs.

But these resources will have little impact on one’s developing language proficiency unless they are accessed frequently.  For autonomous language learning, this can probably best be accomplished by incorporating FL reading and listening into one’s daily activities by using them as regular sources of news, education, and entertainment.  Two of the most convenient techniques described above for accomplishing this is to use a PDA to automatically download FL news and a low-power FM or AM transmitter to make FL radio readily accessible anywhere in one’s home or on one’s campus.

Such timely and interesting text and audio can also be incorporated into FL courses by assigning listening and readings activities to be done outside of class and discussed in class.  Sources of FL text and recorded (on-demand) audio could be delivered via Web-based learning management systems such as Blackboard (www.blackboard.com) or WebCT (www.webct.com) and incorporated into assignments and assessments activities.  Other activities could include having students find their own favorite sources of FL text and audio on the Internet and sharing these with their classmates (possibly via the creation of websites with descriptions of and links to the sources).

Another possible incentive for autonomous student use of FL text and audio on the Internet is obtaining academic credit for FL proficiency acquired outside of formal classes.  In the United States, approximately 1,800 colleges and universities are members of the American Council on Education (ACE) which has established [http://www.languagetesting.com/actfl_article.htm guidelines] for awarding academic credit for FL proficiency as assessed by the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) of the American Council of Teachers of Foreign Languages ([http://www.actfl.org ACTFL]).  This test can be taken for a fee via telephone in 37 languages.

A final recommendation for the use of these Internet resources for FL learning is to show students the resources that are available for language learning on the Internet and ways to use these resources.  These resources include not only the input resources for reading and listening considered in this paper but also resources for finding language learning partners (Tandem learning partners) on the Internet and using computer-mediated communication (CMC) to interact with them so that both partners can improve their FL proficiency in reading, writing, listening and/or speaking (see Cziko and Park, 2003; Cziko, 2004).  Allowing FL students to develop an appreciation for the resources available on the Internet and providing ideas for their use such as those provided in this paper suggest a new version of the ancient Chinese proverb that would go something like this:  “Provide a foreign language student with a language lesson and the student will learn for an hour.  Show a foreign language student how to make use of the Internet for language learning, and the student will learn for a lifetime.”

==Interaction: Introduction==
The 21st century has often been coined as the “Age of Communication” with the rapid development of cell phones, the internet, e-mail, satellite communications, instant messenger programs, and new technologies such as voice over IP.  These progressions have made communication across incredible distances exceptionally affordable and available.  '''In the field of autonomous technology assisted language learning (ATALL), one should remember that “autonomous” means “self-sufficient”, not “solo”.'''  This new framework of communication supports individualized and independent learning within a network of peers around the world that provides interactions through extensive use of online learning and other technologies(Ng &amp; Nicholas 2007).

Instead of being limited to basic input and output exercises, the learner can link up with a native speaker of the target language and engage in real time or asynchronous conversations.  This can be done through text, audio, and video in a variety of formats.  Numerous websites and programs also provide simple networking tools with user profiles so that one can find the ideal match for his/her interaction.  Massively-multiplayer environments such as Second Life also provide a virtual world for interaction that is alive twenty-four hours a day.  The format and setup of the interaction can therefore be easily customized to the learner’s schedule and preferences.

Interestingly, interaction via online methods has also shown certain advantages over face to face conversation.  Beyond the simplicity of sitting down at two separate computers instead of physically bringing two people to the same location, it also provides a more comfortable environment that can make learners more willing to communicate (Freiermuth &amp; Jarrell 2006).  Similar to how some people prefer writing a letter instead of dealing with a face to face confrontation, online communication by e-mail or even in a chatroom can remove the stress of being physically in front of a person.  The learner no longer has to worry about his/her physical appearance or “filling in the silence”, and can better focus on the language and communication.

Through the use of technology, the lone autonomous language learner can now tap into a plethora of methods for authentic interactions.  It lets him/her use and practice the target language the way it was originally created: for free communication and expression of ideas between two different beings.

== Introduction ==

While extensive L2 input, output and interaction may be necessary for developing L2 proficiency, for some (most?) learners input and interaction may not be sufficient to attain high levels of L2 proficiency and grammatical accuracy.  There are often certain aspects of a L2 that are difficult to acquire without devoting special attention and practice to them.

'''Drills''' involve focused repetition of certain tasks designed to aid the acquisition of vocabulary or certain grammatical structures. WordChamp is an example of a program that allows learners to create their own vocabulary list and review them using a variety of drills using reading and audio.


'''Input enhancement''' refers to a group of techniques for focusing a learner's attention on aspects of the language that may otherwise go unnoticed and unlearned (see Wong, 2005). Enhanced input includes '''input flood''', '''textual enhancement''', and '''structured input''' activities.

'''Task-based language learning activities''' (see Nunan, 1999) may also be a way of helping language learners notice and learn form-function relationships in a second language. (perhaps this should be in the Interaction section of this Wikibook?)

'''Language reconstruction''' tasks may provide another way for L2 students to improve their L2 proficiency.  Such tasks can involve either reading/writing or listening/speaking and involve the learner repeating (via writing or speaking) L2 segments that they have just read or heard.  Tools to allow L2 learners to select their own audio or written text for such practice can be provided in a Web-based environment.

Finally, there are '''web- and computer-based language courses''' (see Courseware below) in a wide variety of formats, from total, structured immersion in the second language (e.g., Rosetta Stone) to approaches which rely heavily on the memorization of L1-L2 correspondences (e.g., the Pimsleur Method). Between these two extremes is a less commonly used method that gradually moves from L1 to L2 by gradually adding L2 words and phrases and removing L1 ones. An example of this can be found in Power-Glide's [http://www.power-glide.com/power_glide_demos_1.asp &quot;Diglot Weave&quot;] (also called &quot;sandwich stories in China).

For autonomous learners, factors such as cost (free or cheap being best), accessibility (web-based being best) and the ability for a learner to keep track of his or progress may be particularly important.

==Vocabulary==

===== Multilingual =====

*[http://www.vocabulary.com/'''vocabulary.com''']includes various kinds of exercises such as  Fill-in-the-Blanks, Definition Match, Synonym/Antonym Encounter, Crosswords, Word Finds, True or False Sentences, and Contextual Stories.

== Structured Input == 
Structured input (SI) activities, as developed by Van Patten and his associates, is a type of processing instruction (PI) developed to &quot;force&quot; L2 learners to pay attention to certain aspects of the L2, particularly those that are redundant and not salient, such as indefinite and definite articles for a Chinese learner of English and the subjunctive for American learners of French and Spanish. Structured output activities may also be useful to help L2 learners acquire difficult aspects of the L2. Providing such exercises on the Web would allow L2 learner worldwide to work on and acquire the &quot;stubborn&quot; aspects of their L2.

*Running dictation (extracted from IACC Newsletter, 18 November 2005, Issue 2 (newsletter@iacc.com.tw)

&quot;Here's one of my favourite games called Running Dictation. It works extremely well and by doing this activity, the students get to practice all the skills.

Aims
To develop clearer pronunciation. To wake up a sleepy class!

You need
Choose a short piece of text (e.g. five lines) and make enough copies of the text for one   per pair of students.

Procedure      

Stick the texts up around the room, away from where the students are sitting.
Put students into pairs and allocate them a text on the wall. Give each pair a text that is far away from them.
Now ask one person in each pair to sit where they are with a pen/pencil and paper. Their partner has to stand up and 'run' to their text, read it, probably chunk by chunk, memorise it, run back to their partner and dictate it, helping in any way they can. However they cannot actually write it (e.g. 'No, &quot;actually&quot; has got 2 &quot;l&quot;s.' 'There's a new line there.' etc.).
The winners are the pair with the first absolutely correct version of the text.

Extension/variation
The activity can then be redone, with a different text and with the other member of the pair acting as 'runner'. NB This activity can be very noisy so you may need to check with neighbouring classes that it will not disturb them too much.

Have Fun!!&quot;

Another individual variation of this type of task it to provide a text on one side of a sheet of paper and the student has to copy it with no errors on the other side.  This will force the student to memorize chunks of the text because the student will not be able to see the text while writing.

===== Conclusion =====

Dictation (copy spoken language) and lectation (copy written language) exercises are easily provided via computer (e.g., as Moodle quiz) because the output to score is written.

These techniques can also be used as tools for [[Autonomous Technology-Assisted Language Learning/Assessment | assessment]].

==== Meaning (Gloss) Reconstruction ====

===== Dictogloss =====

==== Technology for Language Reconstruction ====

Available from [http://www.multilingualbooks.com Multilingual Books], the [http://www.multilingualbooks.com/instant-replay.html '''Instant Replay Digital Cassette Recorder'''] ($49), (also called &quot;Language Repeater&quot;) is a combination audio cassette player/recorder and digital player/recorder that allows you to easily an automatically repeat phrases from an audio cassette tape.  This allows a language learner opportunities for repeated listening.  There is also a mode that automatically pauses after playing a phrase (as defined by breath pauses) and then switches automatically to record mode.  After the user has finished recording the phrase, it will playback the learner's recording and then compare it to the cassette tape.  It will repeat the same phrase over and over, providing multiple opportunities for listening and repeating until the user does not say anything, at which time it will play the next phrase.

I [GC] believe that this playback and recording modes of this machine can be used for effective language-learning exercises.  As the audio cassette is somewhat dated technology, it would be great if the same functions (and additional ones, such as variable speed playback) were made available on a portable music player for playing audio files and on computer software for playing audio and video files, CDs and DVDs.

This machine can also be a very useful tool for transcribing audio tapes.  In the playback and compare mode, the user can just say &quot;again&quot; or &quot;hey&quot; (anything) and the machine will repeat the phrase again.  If the user is silent, it will play the next phrase.

(Please note that the Instant Replay Digital CD/MP3 Recorder mentioned on the same webpage is no longer available, but the vendor is attempting to make a similar model available soon).

Here are what appear to be [http://www.idall.com.cn/english/products.asp?cateid=Language+Repeater more sophisticated language repeaters].

The [http://http://catarina.ai.uiuc.edu/textpresenter/ '''Text Presenter'''] is a prototype developed by Richard Sproat of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

It provides feedback after each entry by showing errors.

== Text Exerciser ==

Adapted from discussion between Gary Cziko and Errol O'Neill 2005.04.04

Errol discovered an interesting French exercise at http://fog.ccsf.cc.ca.us/~creitan/clark.htm that contrasts the imperfect and past perfect tenses in French.

What is nice is about this exercise is that (a) it takes place within a meaningful paragraph, (b) provides opportunities for needed input relevant to aspects of grammar to be acquired, and (d) &quot;forces&quot; the learner to pay attention to form, and (d) provides feedback for each right or wrong answer.

I am wondering if this type of exercise couldn't be adapted so that it provides input flood (i.e., many examples of a targeted structure), enhanced text and structured input all in one exercise (see Wong, 2005).

This could be accomplished with different views of the same paragraph as follows:

1. Normal view with correct tenses included.  To the extent that there are many examples of a target structure, this would be '''input flood'''.

2. Clicking on a button would turn all the targeted tenses into a larger font with a distinctive color (e.g., Big and Green).  This would be '''enhanced input'''.

3. A different button would put the paragraph into the form of the original exercise, requiring the student to choose the correct verb form (Errol wants to make it even harder by providing only the infinitive and requiring the student to type the correct form rather than just recognize it).  This would be '''structured input'''.  Then as each correct form is chosen (or typed), it would turn back into normal text, that is back to no. 1, '''input flood''' again.

Students could repeat the cycle as many times as they wanted.  All this could be easily set up by someone with basic computer programming and web design skills.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now, wouldn't it be really neat if the preparation of these different views could be done automatically?  That is, find an interesting text and have a program provide the three views above.  For example, you find an authentic interesting text that has lots of articles, pronouns, and past tense varieties.  You paste this text into a window and then tell the program that you want to focus on articles.  Of course, nothing has to be done for view 1 ('''input flood''').  But then the learner tells the program that he or she wants to emphasize (enhance) the articles.  The program then finds all the articles, enhances them by making them big and green, et voilà, you have '''enhanced text'''.  Then the student presses another button and the program creates the '''structured input''' exercise by taking each article and adding the other two articles as choices (e.g., if the correct choice is &quot;the&quot;, it adds &quot;a&quot; and [blank] (no article) as choices.  This is the structured input view which requires that the student choose the correct article.  As each correct article is chosen, the other choices disappear and it turns back into normal text and the cycle can be repeated, either with the same grammatical focus, of with and different one (e.g., past tense forms or pronouns).

This should also be pretty easy to set up for something as simple as articles (a, the, null) and pronouns (he, she , it , they) in English.  Tenses are a bit tougher perhaps as the program would have to know how to generate other tenses to create the distractors, e.g., if it sees &quot;bought&quot; it would have to generate something like &quot;was buying&quot;, &quot;have bought&quot;, &quot;had bought&quot;, etc.

An even more sophisticated program would first analyze the text and see what forms were most common and suggest what types of grammatical forms the student could use the text to focus on (it would not suggest focusing on pronouns if there were few pronouns).

I think this could be a very useful programming, combining the best of current input techniques that focus on form while allowing the learner to choose the text that he or she is interested in.

As it would create useful exercises from normal text, we could call it the &quot;Text Exerciser&quot; and would be a great ATALL tool.

== Grammar Consciousness-Raising (GCR) ==

See Fotos and Ellis in Wong (2005) input enhancement book (2005)

* Grammar consciousness raising (GCR) 
** Target structure: ''many'' vs. ''much'' vs. ''a lot of'' vs. ''lots of''
*** Correct: He has many brothers. 
*** Incorrect: *He has many money. 

*** Correct: He has much money
*** Incorrect: *He has much sisters. 

*** Correct: He has a lot of good ideas. 
*** Correct: He has a lot of confidence.
*** Correct: He has lots of good ideas.
*** Correct: He has lots of confidence.

** Complete the following sentences and describe the rules that underlie the use of many, much and a lot of. 
*** When you are describing something you can count (like apples) , you use ________, ________ or ________. 
*** When you are describing something you cannot count (like apple sauce), you use ________, ________ or ________.
*** You can use __________ or ___________ with both things you can count (like apples) and things you cannot count (like apple sauce).

Note 1: You cannot use the trick of always using ''a lot of'' or ''lots of'' for asking questions.  You must instead use ''how'' + ''many'' for count nouns and ''how'' + ''much'' for mass (uncountable) nouns.

Note 2: Many languages, such as French, German and Spanish, use the same word (''beaucoup'', ''viel'', ''mucho'') to describe &quot;lots of&quot; for both countable and mass nouns.  So the use of ''much'' vs. ''many'' in English is likely to cause difficulty for natives speakers of these languages learning English as an additional language.

== Introduction ==

Learners engaged in ATALL may wish to periodically assess their reading, writing, listening and/or speaking ability in their L2.  Such assessment can provide useful feedback on progress made and allow learners to target remaining areas of L2 weakness.  In addition, learners may be able to obtain academic credit for L2 proficiency attained autonomously.

==Output Format Basics==
[[Image: Format tab.png]]


When you render a scene in Blender, by default a small window will open showing your image. If you want to publish your picture, you may want to render it a bit bigger. To do this, you have to open the Scene context ('''F10''') and locate the Format tab (usually on the right).

You will see some settings there. Let's go through their meanings:
* [[Image:Format_settings_sizeX.png]]SizeX: This parameter sets the width of the image in pixels.
* [[Image:Format_settings_sizey.png]]SizeY: This parameter sets the height of the image in pixels.
* [[Image:Format_settings_aspXaspY.png]]AspX, AspY: These parameters specify the aspect ratio of the pixels. By default, this is 100:100, because a pixel on a computer screen has equal width and height. These settings can be used for screens whose pixels don't have equal width and height. For example, on a PAL system one pixel's width/height ratio is 54:51, which you can select there easily. Notice that these parameters don't change the size of the image.
Don't forget, setting the number of pixels changes the resolution.  Resolutions for your computer desktop are normally 1024x768, but can be larger.  This means that it is 1,024 pixels wide and 768 pixels tall.  To make an image this size in Blender, change the SizeX to 1024 and the SizeY to 768.

If this does not come out correctly, then you should right-click your desktop and click Properties, then go to Appearance. The highlighted numbers are X by Y.

==Output formats==
Blender has the ability to save in a wide variety of formats.  To change the format, click the drop-down box ( [[Image:Format_settings_drop-down_box.png]] ) halfway down the format tab.  Currently, Blender can save files in the following formats:
* TIFF
* OpenEXR
* DPX
* Cineon
* Radiance HDR
* Iris:
* Iris + Zbuffer:
* HamX: extremely compact but only for the &quot;Play&quot; option
* Jpeg: default format. Lossy compression.
* BMP:  uncompressed.
* PNG: open, lossless compression, alpha channel.
* Targa Raw: uncompressed Targa.
* Targa: Compressed Targa.

'''Single rendered images are not automatically saved to disk.  Once Blender finishes rendering a scene (this can take some time), press F3 and the save dialogue will be opened where you can specify a filename and location for the output.  You can retrieve the last picture rendered by pressing ''F11''.'''

When working with moving images, you need to remember that you are often looking at file size (such as on the net) and compatibility with media players. Videos consists out of 2 elements: the file format and the codec. An example of this would be that you have a MOV file (the file format) with a H.264 codec. In other words, the codec is the way that the files are interpreted (compressed-decompressed = codec) by the media player. Youtube currently uses the FLV format with an H.264 codec. The VLC player should play almost any format available.

Video:
* AVI Codec: saves an AVI with a compression codec. Once selected a pop-up menu will appear giving options as to what codec you want.
* AVI Jpeg: saves an AVI as Jpeg images. Compressed but lossy.
* AVI Raw: saves an AVI with uncompressed frames.
* QuickTime: saves a QuickTime MOV file. Once selected, a pop-up menu will appear giving various video codecs to choose from. Can also remain uncompressed.
* FFMpeg: Implemented in a Google Summer of Code event, this codec is composed of multiple software libraries, so you can choose which codec to use under the video tab. The audio tab lets you choose from several different audio codecs to use and also has a bitrate setting. The Multiplex Audio button will render your animation with sound (if you have any), a nice feature. 

For more information, see 
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating animated GIFs using Blender and Gimp]]
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Ogg-Theora movies using Blender]]

==Cropping==
You can see [[Image:Format_settings_crop_button.png]] button next to drop-down box. If you activate it, image automatically gets cropped after rendering.

== Palette ==
[[Image:Format_settings_palette_selection.png]]

You can select three different palettes in Blender:
* '''BW''' - images are saved with BW (greyscale) data
* '''RGB''' - images are saved with RGB (color) data
* '''RGBA''' - images are saved with RGB and Alpha data (if supported)

==Pre-sets Just For You==
[[Image:Format_settings_pre-sets.png]]

The render settings in blender are customizable for unique results, 
but blender includes 9 pre-sets for common render outputs. One can use
the pre-set as is or can use it as a starting point at which the settings 
are then modified.

'''[[w:PAL|PAL]]''' and '''[[w:NTSC|NTSC]]''' are systems used in analogue Television. 
If someone were making an animation for TV or DVD, that individual may use one of these depending on which is used in their country. Both the PAL and NTSC pre-sets in Blender
only affect the dimensions and pixel aspect ratio of the render and doesn't turn on anti-aliasing [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/OSA|(OSA)]]
or affect any other variable in the render. '''Pal 16:9''' is a newer an improved version of PAL which is 
also known as [[w:PALplus|PALplus]].
 

The Default pre-set uses the dimensions and an pixel aspect ratio as PAL but also includes [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/OSA|OSA]] and shadows.

The '''Preview''' pre-set generates a low quality setting for a fast render that usually is not used as a final output. 

* '''PANO''' is short for Panorama. This setting allows for a full 360 degree panoramic render. 
* '''FULL''' produces a render that fits your monitors full screen.
* '''HD''' is for High Definition.

The horn has a very wide variety of music written specifically for it. Its relatively great range and dynamic contrast has allowed composers to write music of many styles for it.

The Horn WikiBook, due to copyright law, cannot include actual music for each and every piece of music listed.

Using Makfile we can acturally create a CPAM system easily. Following is an example 
=== TWW   ===
== non-homogeneous approach == 
=== openpkg  ===
=== Portage  ===
=== OpenSolaris IPS ===

= Package building automation =
= Distributed package building  =

== General Tools for distributed build ==
=== gmake  ===
=== SGE : qmake  ===
=== Distcc  ===
Because distcc can only work with gcc, so it only can compile TWW's package source that utilize gcc compiler.  This means we can use distcc to build pacakges for Redhat Linux.

==== How to use distcc to compile TWW's RH packages source ====
* We will use distcc and newly released lsdistcc to compare the performance gain of compiling RH EL kernel and crosstool on using rhel3-distcc* machines are available in a subnet.

* lsdistcc is a distcc server autodiscovery program. It relies on distcc servers being in DNS with distinctive names ending in numbers 1 through N. It is originally from http://kegel.com/distcc and will probably be included in a future release of distcc. With this helpful small lsditcc program we can dynamically assign the content of DISTCC_HOSTS to use as many available distcc hosts as possible. 

* For each OS platform you want to configure as a distcc execution node, do 
  &lt;pre&gt;
  pkg-inst distcc
  /etc/init.d/TWWdistcc212 start
  &lt;/pre&gt;
* add distcc nodes into your name server;increase the serial number;&quot;ndc reload&quot;. After following aliases are edited in your forward zone file
* also make sure you have a good naming for your distcc execution hosts. ${OS}-distcc%d is the good naming scheme. 
 &lt;pre&gt;
root@t2000&gt; grep distcc test.zone
rhel3-distcc1         IN CNAME   t4001.test.com.
rhel3-distcc2         IN CNAME   t4408.test.com.
rhel3-distcc3         IN CNAME   t4500.test.com.
rhel3-distcc4         IN CNAME   t4000.test.com.
rhel3-distcc5         IN CNAME   t4001.test.com.
rhel3-distcc6         IN CNAME   t4002.test.com.
root@t2000&gt;
 &lt;/pre&gt;
* &quot;cc -o lsdistcc lsdistcc.c&quot;, and run a test to find out the current available RHEL3 have distcc enabled.
&lt;pre&gt;
# lsdistcc rhel3-distcc%d
rhel3-distcc1
rhel3-distcc2
rhel3-distcc3
rhel3-distcc4
rhel3-distcc5
rhel3-distcc6
#

&lt;/pre&gt;
* put &quot;DISTCC-HOSTS := `lsdistcc rhel3-distcc%d`&quot;in your makefile or build script.

'''Mushy Peas''' is a popular and characteristic British dish that has helped to give British cooking its well-deserved reputation. Mushy peas are often served with [[Cookbook:Fish and Chips|fish and chips]].

==Ingredients==
*Dried [[Cookbook:Marrowfat peas|marrowfat peas]]
*Water to soak and simmer
*2 [[Cookbook:tsp|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|Baking soda]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]] (optional, to taste)

==Procedure==
#Place the peas in two or three times their volume of water, along with the baking soda, which speeds the soaking process.
#Leave to soak overnight.
#The next day, drain the peas, and place in a saucepan with enough water to just cover them.
#Add the sugar.
#Bring to the boil and simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to help break up the peas.
#Add water or reduce to the desired consistency.
#Season to taste with salt and pepper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tablets, sometimes called pills, are commonly used to dispense medicines. Not all pills are the same. Some are time release, gelatine, or medically coated. 

Tablets usually contain the active drug ingredient, plus excipients. 

Excipients are inactive ingredients, such as a dye for the drug to look more appealing, flavor to add taste to the drug (most drugs don't naturally taste very good). 

Time release tablets should NOT be chewed or crushed, since this will produce an overdose of the drug. These tablets are made to be taken only once or twice a day, and are designed so that the drug is slowly released into the body. They are very useful, and decrease the amount of times you need to take medication each day. However, taking a crushed Extended - Released tablet can be very harmful. 

The other tablets, which are not time - release or extended - release,  generally can be chewed, as they are not designed to slowly release the medicine.

Please ask your pharmacist about your specific medication to guide you on how to take it safely.

If I were to live my life 
in catfish forms 
in scaffolds of skin and whiskers 
at the bottom of the pond 
and you were to come by 
    one evening 
when the moon was shining 
down into my dark home 
and stand there at the edge 
    of my affection 
and think, &quot;It's beautiful 
here by this pond. I wish 
    somebody loved me,&quot; 
I'd love you and be your catfish 
friend and drive such lonely 
thoughts from your mind 
and suddenly you would be 
    at peace, 
and ask yourself, &quot;I wonder 
if there are any catfish 
in this pond? It seems like 
a perfect place for them.&quot;
-Richard Brautigan

Hi Everyone, I'm Moly. I'm working on a Ph.D. in math. My Bachelor's was in Creative Writing and Literature. Math is an art form to me. Math is my passion , and I'm following my passion. I believe that mathematics is a divine language, the LOGOS that forms the universe, and I feel that my perspective is under-represented in this culture.

I went to a very old, conservative, traditional single-sex boarding school for high school. I went to college four times before someone was sane enough to give me a degree, during which time I changed my major five times. I intimidate the worst kind of educators, especially bureaucratic ones. I'm largely self-taught, despite my many hours stuck in a classroom. I have studied with geniuses and morons, and have found I've become the Marriage of Genius and Moron as a result.


I have set foot on every continent except Antarctica. I have had the good fortune to meet many of my greatest living heroes. I am a black belt in aikido. I wear a cowboy hat and carry a guitar wherever I go.  I ate breakfast once in a cowboy-boot shop in Nashville with my cousin Pete and we ate ham and eggs and grits while two grizzled old honky-tonkers played Country standards and tourists bought gaudy cowboy boots. I have heard lions roar on the African savannah at sunset and had to drink a stiff drink to keep from trembling. I have sat on Galactic Councils as Earth's representative, and met creatures from fourteen different galactic civilization. I believe that The Basement Tapes , by Bob Dylan and the Band, John Coltrane's Meditations , Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow , and Euler's formula:


                                                        eiø  = cos ø + i sin ø


are examples that our species are capable of art.


I know I am a great person if only because the greatest people I've ever met have befriended me throughout my life. I know for a fact that God adores me with an emotion so strong that I would drop dead were I ever to feel that much emotion. I tend to worry about mediocre people and the way they misunderstand me. I blend obviousness with subtlety, and I find it the case that most people latch onto the obvious and give up trying to see the subtlety. I take great pleasure in being obvious, but I also take great pleasure in being subtle.


I still grieve every day over the death of my friends, Bobby Sheehan and Terence McKenna, as well as for the death of Lenny Bruce, of Hank Williams, of Elvis Presley, of Buddy Holly, of Jimi Hendrix, of Jerry Garcia, of Janis Joplin, of Richard Manuel, of Rick Danko, of Frank Zappa, of Oscar Wilde, of Charles Baudelaire, of Alan Turing, of countless millions of my people in the Holocaust. And, like the old blues song says, on a good day I have the blues.


And yet, I see heaven in a little flower, the world in a grain of sand, and eternity in an hour. The stupidest things give me great joy. I love bad sci-fi movies where the monster suits have visible zippers, the villain gives an incoherent, but misanthropic speech, and the director cuts in way too much military stock footage. I love to drink whiskey and sing bluegrass music and pick at my guitar. I would do math even if it were a jailable offense to study math. I walk around stoned on the pleasures life affords me. </text>

'''YafRay''' ('''Y'''et '''A'''nother '''F'''ree '''Ray'''tracer) is an open-source alternative rendering engine supported by Blender. 

'''Reader note: in the new version of Blender (2.46) internal renderer of Blender got a lot of upgrades and is now about two times faster than YafRay, so this article may be considered obsolete.'''

Yafaray 0.1.1 provides 5 different material types independent of Blender. It is also able to show objects behind transparent materials unlike Blender 2.49b.

[[Image:Yafaray0.1.1.jpg]]

'''Further note: the Yafray project has been superseded by [http://yafaray.org Yafaray]. Yafray support was removed from Blender apparently around version 2.44. Use Yafaray instead.'''
As of May, 2011, in MS Windows, it only works with 32-bit Blender 2.49b compiled with Python, with Python 2.6.6 32-bit version installed.

The YafRay render settings are normally hidden.  To show them, switch from the Blender Internal rendering engine to the Yafray rendering engine.

*Go to the Scene Panel (Press F10)
*Click the Render Buttons button
*In the render tab, under the big Render button, click the Blender Internal button and select YafRay.

Now the YafRay and YafRay GI tabs appear.

==Getting Started with Yafray==



First, I would like to state that Yafray renders 2-3 times faster and nicer (includes Global Illumination, Caustics and...) than the normal internal built-in renderer in Blender{{fact}}. So it would just be worth it to download and install it.

On Windows, just download the .zip file and unzip it. You get the .exe file. Run it and follow default instructions. Latest version is 0.1.0 as of October 2008. Now change the Environment variable by adding C:\Program Files\YafRay to your PATH or whichever folder you installed yafray.exe, users Windows 95/98/ME will need to restart where as WinXP users won't. Remember Yafray doesnt have a GUI and is a commmand line tool. Anyway you never need a GUI to run yafray as it runs nicely inside Blender as it is integrated into it. Go to the Command line and type yafray and press return. Now you have two paths

'''''Reader''': Can someone make this a little bit clearer? What is the Command line?''&lt;br&gt;
'''''Answer''': The command line interface (CLI) is an interpreter for the operating system that provides a way of getting around by accepting commands from the keyboard instead of using the mouse to click on icons.  It was the primary method of using the computer in MS-DOS, the predecessor to Windows. There are no buttons like in programs such as Blender. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line]''

You can access the command line in Windows by pressing Win-R then typing CMD and pressing the enter button. The command line can also be accessed by clicking on the Start menu, going down to &quot;All Programs&quot;, over to the &quot;Accessories&quot; tab, and then clicking on the Command Prompt option. To change the environment variable, enter &quot;path C:\Program Files\YafRay;%PATH%&quot;, without the quotes.

1) If there was an error regarding MSVCR71.dll, then download this file from the Web and place it in the c:\windows\system32 directory.

'''''Reader''': I have been using Blender for a while now, but due to my school's administrative limitations I am only able to use it on certain computers in school. For example, the computers that have already had 3d programs installed on them (like the ones in the Drafting and Design room) allow me to use Blender. Other computers give me an error message concerning MSVCR71.dll when I try to use it (specifically the ones in my Study Hall). Could you give me an alternate method of installing the .dll (maybe I can put it on a flash drive or in the My Documents folder)?''
'''''Answer''': Unfortunately, without administrative rights you will not be able to install a DLL.''
'''''Answer 2''': My school has the same type of administrative blocks, however I placed everything from my blender folder at home onto a flash drive, and now it works perfectly on all computers. Maybe try that?''

2) Switch from the Blender Internal rendering engine to the Yafray rendering engine as explained and press F12 to Render. Wow, You should have noticed the lightning speed of Yafray.

== YafRay tab ==
*'''XML button''': If pressed blender will export an xml file that describes the scene and will pass it to YafRay. If not pressed blender will render with the YafRay plugin. When using the plugin interface, the render in progress will update continuously in Blender's render window. This gives much faster feedback. It even shows the distribution of the samples taken by the path light when rendering with cached pathlight. YafRay divides the image into blocks and renders them in a random sequence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nouns in Sanskrit have three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and one of three genders(masculine, feminine and neuter).

They also have eight cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, and locative.

__NOTOC__
{{Mergeto|Java Programming/Remote Method Invocation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

RMI-IIOP (RMI over IIOP) is provided with the Java SDK. It combines Remote Method Invocation (RMI) technology with the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) to provide CORBA to the Java platform. Java developers do not have to provide IDL in order to provide CORBA capabilities.
===The Remote Interface===
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 7.1: HowdyInterface.java'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import java.rmi.Remote;

public interface HowdyInterface extends java.rmi.Remote {
  public void sayHowdy() throws RemoteException;
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

The above code defines a remote interface called HowdyInterface that will define what the remote client may call on the server. All of the operations must throw a RemoteException. The interface must extend java.rmi.Remote.

== The Implementation Class ==
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 7.2: HowdyImpl.java'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject;
import javax.rmi.RemoteException;

public class HowdyImpl implements HowdyInterface {
  public HelloImpl() throws java.rmi.RemoteException {
    PortableRemoteObject.exportObject(this);     // Initializes the remote object
  }

  public void sayHowdy() throws RemoteException {
    System.out.println(&quot;Weeee doggies! Howdy!!&quot;);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

The implementation class allows for the object to be ORB-initialized. It also implements the remote operation to be called. The implementation could have extended &lt;code&gt;PortableRemoteObject&lt;/code&gt;, in which case the &lt;code&gt;exportObject&lt;/code&gt; call in the constructor would be removed. The better approach would seem to be as coded above.

== The Server Class ==
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 7.3: HowdyServer.java'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;
import javax.naming.Context;
import javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject ;
import com.sun.corba.se.internal.POA.POAORB;
import org.omg.PortableServer.*;
import java.util.*;
import org.omg.CORBA.*;
import javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub;
import javax.rmi.CORBA.Util;

public class HowdyServer {
  public HowdyServer(String[] args) {
    try {
      Properties p = System.getProperties();
      // add runtime properties here
      p.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass&quot;,
          &quot;com.sun.corba.se.internal.POA.POAORB&quot;);
      p.put(&quot;org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass&quot;,
          &quot;com.sun.corba.se.internal.corba.ORBSingleton&quot;);

      ORB orb = ORB.init( args, p );

      POA rootPOA = (POA)orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;RootPOA&quot;);

      Policy[] tpolicy = new Policy[3];
      tpolicy[0] = rootPOA.create_lifespan_policy(
        LifespanPolicyValue.TRANSIENT );
      tpolicy[1] = rootPOA.create_request_processing_policy(
        RequestProcessingPolicyValue.USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY );
      tpolicy[2] = rootPOA.create_servant_retention_policy(
        ServantRetentionPolicyValue.RETAIN);
      POA tPOA = rootPOA.create_POA(&quot;MyTransientPOA&quot;, null, tpolicy);
          
      tPOA.the_POAManager().activate();

      HowdyImpl howdyImpl = new HowdyImpl();
      _HowdyImpl_Tie tie = (_HowdyImpl_Tie)Util.getTie( howdyImpl );
      String howdyId = &quot;howdy&quot;;
      byte[] id = howdyId.getBytes();
      tPOA.activate_object_with_id( id, tie );


      Context initialNamingContext = new InitialContext();
      initialNamingContext.rebind(&quot;HowdyService&quot;,
        tPOA.create_reference_with_id(id,
          tie._all_interfaces(tPOA,id)[0]) );
      System.out.println(&quot;Howdy Server: Ready...&quot;);
      
      orb.run();
    }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Error running HowdyServer: &quot; + e);
        e.printStackTrace();
      }
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    new HowdyServer( args );
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

== The Client Class ==
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 7.4: HelloClient.java'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.rmi.NotBoundException;
import javax.rmi.*;
import java.util.Vector;
import javax.naming.NamingException;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;
import javax.naming.Context;

public class HelloClient {

  public static void  main( String args[] ) {
    Context ic;
    Object objref;
    HelloInterface hi;

    try {
      ic = new InitialContext();
    } catch (NamingException e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;failed to obtain context&quot; + e);
        e.printStackTrace();
        return;
    }
        
    try {
      objref = ic.lookup(&quot;HowdyService&quot;);
      System.out.println(&quot;Client: Obtained a reference to Howdy server.&quot;);
    } catch (NamingException e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;failed to lookup object reference&quot;);
        e.printStackTrace();
        return;
    }

    try {
      hi = (HowdyInterface) PortableRemoteObject.narrow(
        objref, HowdyInterface.class);
      hi.sayHowdy();
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        System.out.println(&quot;narrow failed&quot;);
        e.printStackTrace();
        return;
      } catch( Exception e ) {
            System.err.println( &quot;Exception &quot; + e + &quot;Caught&quot; );
            e.printStackTrace( );
            return;
        }
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

The client code uses the name service to look up the server and make the remote invocation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two views for the definition of technology. Traditionalists view it as the systematic application of science to practical problems. A more contemporary view is that technology is the application of knowledge so that it can be built from one generation to the next (Braudel in Seels &amp; Richey, p. 7). The second view is not synonymous with integration, although it certainly does have implications for integration, but in a systematic way. As such, technology includes tools, processes, applications, skills and  organization. Technology in education or instruction is more than the technical application of tools, machines, computers, products and communication systems (such as multimedia, computerized instruction, games, simulations or interactive video). It also encompasses the &quot;application of the principles of science in order to solve learning problems...&quot; (Seels &amp; Richey, p.6).

Historically, Instructional Technology (IT) grew out of audiovisual communications and according to Seels &amp; Richey (1994) Jim Finn is credited with initiating the development of the field of Instructional Technology in response to his desire to make audiovisual communications a profession. 

IT meets most or all of the six characteristics of a profession as described by James Finn (1969):

*An intellectual technique
*An application of that technique
*A long period of training
*An association of members
*Enforced standards and a statement of ethics
*A body of intellectual theory (p. 232)

At the time of Finn's writing (1927), he noted that of the six defining characteristics of a profession, IT only possessed two. Finn believed that IT would become more credible and professional as more members of the field participated in activities that supported the aforementioned characteristics.  


The field of Instructional Technology is not synonymous with the use of technology in education; instead, it is a discipline, a field of study, a craft, and an art. 

In 1994, the [http://www.aect.org/ Association for Education Communications and Technology (AECT)] defined Instructional Technology as &quot;the theory and practice of design, development, utilization, management and evaluation of processes and resources for learning&quot; (Seels &amp; Richey, p. 1). This definition emphasized the need for balance between the field's theory base and practical use.  Additionally, it outlined the domains IT seeks to influence while also establishing that these domains do not exist in a linear relationship to each other. The domains are conceived as independent of each other but connected. 

As reflected in the list of topics below, the interests of IT are broad and varied, encompassing a wide range of topics related to practice, application and theory. This book is a collaborative effort between graduate students in the Instructional Technology program at Wayne State University to provide an introduction to the field of Instructional Technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In front of you is a balance. Your task is to devise a system, using 4 weights, so that any whole number of kilograms can be weighed up to ''n'' kg, where ''n'' should be the largest possible.

'''Example:'''
Suppose you use these weights: 1 kg, 2 kg, 4 kg, 8 kg. This way you can weigh any weight up to ''n''=15 kg by combining these weights.

1 kg = 1 kg&lt;br /&gt;
2 kg = 2 kg&lt;br /&gt;
3 kg = 2 kg + 1 kg&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
14 kg = 8 kg + 4kg + 2 kg&lt;br /&gt;
15 kg = 8 kg + 4 kg + 2 kg + 1 kg

Solutions: [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Scales and Weights/Solution 1|Up to 40 kg]] |

----

Weights are: 1, 3, 9, 27

== Explanation ==
You can put the weights on the other side of the balance, therefore subtracting some of the weight from the other side. Using this system the objects can be weighed thus:

1kg = 1kg

2kg = 3kg - 1kg

3kg = 3kg

...

39kg = 27kg + 9kg + 3kg

40kg = 27kg + 9kg + 3kg + 1kg

[[Organic Chemistry/Dienes|&lt;&lt; Dienes]] | Aromatics | [[Organic Chemistry/Aromatic reactions|Aromatic reactions&gt;&gt;]] 
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

After understanding the usefulness of unsaturated compound, or conjugated system, we hope to explore the unique structure of [[Organic Chemistry/Aromatics in history|aromatic]] compounds, including why benzene should not be called 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene because it is more stable than a typical triene, and seemingly unreactive. Called &quot;aromatic&quot; initially because of its fragrance, aromaticity now refers to the stability of compounds that are considered aromatic, not only benzene. Any cyclic compound with 4n+2 pi electrons in the system is aromatic. The stability of aromatic compounds arises because all bonding orbitals are filled and low in energy.
=History of Aromatics=
Early in the 19th century, advances in equipment, technique and communications resulted in chemists discovering and experimenting with novel chemical compounds.  In the course of their investigations they stumbled across a different kind of stable compound with the molecular formula of C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.  Unable to visualize what such a compound might look like, the scientists invented all sorts of models for carbon-to-carbon bonding -- many of which were not entirely stable -- in order to fit what they had observed to what they expected the C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compound to look like.

Benzene (which is the name that was given to the aromatic compound C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is probably the most common and industrially important aromatic compound in wide use today.  It was discovered in 1825 by Michael Faraday, and its commercial production from coal tar (and, later on, other natural sources) began in earnest about twenty-five years later. The structure of benzene emerged during the  1860s, the result of contributions from several chemists,  most famously that of  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kekulé Kekulé].

Scientists of the time did not have the benefit of understanding that electrons are capable of delocalization, so that all carbon atoms could share the same &amp;pi;-bond electron configuration equally.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Huckel Huckel] was the first to apply the new theory of quantum mechanics  to clearly separating &amp;sigma;  and  &amp;pi; electrons. He went on to develop a theory of  &amp;pi; electron bonding for benzene, which was the first to explain the electronic origins of aromaticity.

=Benzene Structure=
Benzene is a hexagonal ring of six carbon atoms connected to each other through one p-orbital per carbon. Its chemical formula is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and its structure is a hexagonal ring of carbons sharing symmetrical bonds, with all six hydrogen atoms protruding outwards from the carbon ring, but in the same plane as the ring. The p-orbital system contains 6 electrons, and one way to distribute the electrons yields the following structure:

:[[File:Benzol.svg|45px]] 

However, another resonance form of benzene is possible, where the single bonds of the first structure are replaced with double bonds, and the double bonds with single bonds. These two resonance forms are co-dominant in benzene. (Other forms, such as a structure with a π bond connecting opposite carbons, are possible but negligible.) Thus, each bond in benzene has been experimentally shown to be of equal length and strength, and each is accounted as approximately a &quot;1.5&quot; bond instead of either a single or double bond alone.

Electron density is shared between carbons, in effect yielding neither a single nor a double bond, but a sort of one-and-a-half bond between each of the six carbons. Benzene has a density of negative charge both above and below the plane formed by the ring structure.  Although benzene is very stable and does not tend to react energetically with most substances, electrophilic compounds may be attracted to this localized electron density and such substances may form a bond with the aromatic benzene ring.

An electron delocalisation ring can be used to show in a single picture both dominant resonance forms of benzene:

==Benzene Properties==

Benzene is a colorless, flammable liquid with a sweet aroma and carcinogenic effects. The aromatic properties of benzene make it far different from other alkenes in many ways.

===Benzene Reactions===

:''Main article:'' [[Organic Chemistry/Aromatic reactions|Aromatic reactions]]

Unlike alkenes, aromatic compounds such as benzene undergo substitution reactions instead of addition reactions. The most common reaction for benzene to undergo is electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), although in a few special cases, substituted benzenes can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

==Benzene Health Effects==
In the body, benzene is metabolized, and benzene exposure may have quite serious health effects. Breathing in very high levels of benzene can result in death, while somewhat lower (but still high) levels can cause drowsiness, dizziness, rapid heart rate, headaches, tremors, confusion, and unconsciousness. Eating or drinking foods containing high levels of benzene can cause vomiting, irritation of the stomach, dizziness, sleepiness, convulsions, rapid heart rate, and even death.


The major effect of benzene from chronic (long-term) exposure is to the blood. Benzene damages the bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia. It can also cause excessive bleeding and depress the immune system, increasing the chance of infection.  Some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries. It is not known whether benzene exposure affects the developing fetus in pregnant women or fertility in men, however animal studies have shown low birth weights, delayed bone formation, and bone marrow damage when pregnant animals breathed benzene.


The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) also classifies benzene as a human carcinogen. Long-term exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause leukemia, a potentially fatal cancer of the blood-forming organs. In particular, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) may be caused by benzene.

=Aromaticity=
Aromaticity in organic chemistry does not refer to whether or not a molecule triggers a sensory response from olfactory organs (whether it &quot;smells&quot;), but rather refers to the arrangement of electron bonds in a cyclic molecule.  Many molecules that have a strong odor (such as diatomic chlorine Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are not aromatic in structure -- odor has little to do with chemical aromaticity.  It was the case, however, that many of the earliest-known examples of aromatic compounds had distinctively pleasant smells. This property led to the term &quot;aromatic&quot; for this class of compounds, and hence the property of having enhanced stability due to delocalized electrons came to be called &quot;aromaticity&quot;.


==Definition==
Aromaticity is a chemical property in which a conjugated ring of unsaturated bonds, lone pairs, or empty orbitals exhibit a stabilization stronger than would be expected by the stabilization of conjugation alone. It can also be considered a manifestation of cyclic delocalization and of resonance.


This is usually considered to be because electrons are free to cycle around circular arrangements of atoms, which are alternately single- and double-bonded to one another. These bonds may be seen as a hybrid of a single bond and a double bond, each bond in the ring identical to every other. This commonly-seen model of aromatic rings was developed by Kekulé. The model for benzene consists of two resonance forms, which corresponds to the double and single bonds' switching positions. Benzene is a more stable molecule than would be expected of cyclohexatriene, which is a theoretical molecule.


==Theory==
By convention, the double-headed arrow indicates that two structures are simply hypothetical, since neither can be said to be an accurate representation of the actual compound. The actual molecule is best represented by a hybrid (average) of most likely structures, called resonance forms. A carbon-carbon double bond is shorter in length than a carbon-carbon single bond, but aromatic compounds are perfectly geometrical (that is, not lop-sided) because all the carbon-carbon bonds have the same length.  The actual distance between atoms inside an aromatic molecule is intermediate between that of a single and that of a double bond.


A better representation than Lewis drawings of double and single bonds is that of the circular &amp;pi; bond (Armstrong's inner cycle), in which the electron density is evenly distributed through a &amp;pi; bond above and below the ring. This model more correctly represents the location of electron density within the aromatic molecule's overall structure.  The single bonds are sigma (&amp;sigma;) bonds formed with electrons positioned &quot;in line&quot; between the carbon atoms' nuclei. Double bonds consist of one &quot;in line&quot; &amp;sigma; bond and another non-linearly arranged bond -- a &amp;pi;-bond. The &amp;pi;-bonds are formed from the overlap of atomic p-orbitals simultaneously above and below the plane of the ring formed by the &quot;in line&quot; &amp;sigma;-bonds.


Since they are out of the plane of the atoms, &amp;pi; orbitals can interact with each other freely, and thereby they become delocalized. This means that, instead of being tied to one particular atom of carbon, each electron can be shared by all the carbon atoms in an aromatic ring. Thus, there are not enough electrons to form double bonds on all the carbon atoms, but the &quot;extra&quot; electrons strengthen all of the bonds of the ring equally.


==Characteristics==
An aromatic compound contains a set of covalently-bound atoms with specific characteristics:
#The molecule has to be cyclic
#A delocalized conjugated pi system, most commonly an arrangement of alternating single and double bonds (can sometimes include triple bonds if the geometry of the molecule permits)
#Coplanar structure, with all the contributing atoms in the same plane 
#A number of pi delocalized electrons that is even, but not a multiple of 4. (This is known as Hückel's (4n+2)Π rule, where,n= 0,1,2,3 and so on. Permissible numbers of &amp;pi; electrons include 2, 6, 10, 14, and so on)
#Special reactivity in organic reactions such as electrophilic aromatic substitution and nucleophilic aromatic substitution 


Whereas benzene is aromatic (6 electrons, from 3 double bonds), cyclobutadiene is not, since the number of &amp;pi; delocalized electrons is 4, which is not satisfied by any n integer value. The cyclobutadienide (2−) ion, however, is aromatic (6 electrons). An atom in an aromatic system can have other electrons that are not part of the system, and are therefore ignored for the 4n + 2 rule. In furan, the oxygen atom is sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized. One lone pair is in the &amp;pi; system and the other in the plane of the ring (analogous to C-H bond on the other positions). There are 6 &amp;pi; electrons, so furan is aromatic.


Aromatic molecules typically display enhanced chemical stability, compared to similar non-aromatic molecules. The circulating (that is, delocalized) &amp;pi; electrons in an aromatic molecule generate significant local magnetic fields that can be detected by NMR techniques. NMR experiments show that protons on the aromatic ring are shifted substantially further down-field than those on aliphatic carbons. Planar monocyclic molecules containing 4n &amp;pi; electrons are called anti-aromatic and are, in general, destabilized. Molecules that could be anti-aromatic will tend to alter their electronic or conformational structure to avoid this situation, thereby becoming merely non-aromatic.


Aromatic molecules are able to interact with each other in so-called &amp;pi;-&amp;pi; stacking: the &amp;pi; systems form two parallel rings overlap in a &quot;face-to-face&quot; orientation. Aromatic molecules are also able to interact with each other in an &quot;edge-to-face&quot; orientation: the slight positive charge of the substituents on the ring atoms of one molecule are attracted to the slight negative charge of the aromatic system on another molecule.

=Monosubstituted Benzenes=
Benzene is a very important basic structure which is useful for analysis and synthesis in most aspects of organic chemistry.  The benzene ring itself is not the most interesting or useful feature of the molecule; which substitutents and where they are placed on the ring can be considered the most critical aspect of benzene chemistry in general.



==Effects of Different Substituents==
Depending on the type of substituent, atoms or groups of atoms may serve to make the benzene ring either more reactive or less reactive.  If the atom or group makes the ring more reactive, it is called '''activating''', and if less, then it is called '''deactivating'''.  

Generally, the terms activating and deactivating are in terms of the reactions that fall into the category of Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS). These are the most common forms of reactions with aromatic rings. Aromatic rings can undergo other types of reactions, however, and in the case of Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution, the activating and deactivating nature of substituents on the rings is reversed. In EAS, a hydroxyl groups is strongly activating, but in Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution, a hydroxyl group is strongly deactivating. But since EAS is the most common reaction with aromatic rings, when discussing activation and deactivation, it's normally done in terms of the EAS. 

In addition to activating or deactivating, all groups and/or substituent atoms on a benzene ring are '''directing'''.  An atom or group may encourage additional atoms or groups to add or not to add to certain other carbons in relation to the carbon connected to the directing group. This concept will be further discussed in the next chapter, but when memorizing the groups below it is helpful to also memorize whether it is O (ortho), M (meta) or P (para)-directing.

Another factor that heavily influences direction, however, is steric hindrance. If, for example, you have a tert-butyl substituent on the ring, despite the fact that it is ortho/para directing, the ortho positions will be largely blocked by the tert-butyl group and thus nearly all the product would be para.

==Activating Substituents==
Activating substituents make benzene either slightly more reactive or very much more reactive, depending on the group or atom in question.  In general, if one of the major heteroatoms (nitrogen or oxygen) is ''directly'' attached to the carbon ring then the result is probably activation.  This is merely a rule of thumb, and many exceptions exist, so it is best to memorize the groups listed below instead of counting on a quick and dirty rule of thumb.

&lt;center&gt;

| -C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
| very weak
| ortho/para
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Deactivating Substituents==
A deactivating group is a functional group attached to a benzene molecule that removes electron density from the benzene ring, making electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions slower and more difficult than they would be on benzene alone. As discussed above for activating groups, deactivating groups may also determine the positions (relative to themselves) on the benzene ring where substitutions take place, so each deactivating group is listed below along with its directing characteristic.

&lt;/center&gt;

==Activation vs. Deactivation and ortho/para vs. meta directing ==

So why are some substituents activating or deactivating? Why are some meta directing and others ortho/para directing? From the above tables, it seems pretty clear there's a relationship.

There are primarily two effects that substituents impart on the ring that affect these features:

# Resonance effects
# Inductive effects


===Resonance Effects===
Let's first look at resonance effects. Resonance effects are the ability or inability of a substituent to provide electrons to the ring and enhance its resonance stability. To see this, we must first get a basic understanding of the mechanism of Electrophilic Aromatic Subsitution. We'll discuss EAS in more detail in the next section, but some basics are called for here.

[[Image:EAS-mechanism.png|center|Basic Mechanism of Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution]]

As you can see in the image above, the electrophile is attacked by pi electrons in the ring. The same carbon is now bonded to both the hydrogen that was bonded to it and the electrophile. This in turn creates a carbocation on the adjacent carbon, making the ring non-aromatic. But aromatic rings like to remain aromatic. The nucleophile which was previously bonded to the electrophile now attacks the hydrogen, abstracting it from the ring and allowing the pi-bond to re-form and returning the ring to its aromatic nature.

As we've seen before in some other reactions, when a carbocation is created as an intermediate, stability of that carbocation is crucial to the reaction. This is the case in Electrophilic Aromatic Subsitution as well.

So what is the effect of substituents on the ring?

[[Image:EAS-ortho-para-meta.png|center|Resonance Stability of ortho, para, and meta attacks.]]

Let's look at the situation above. In this case we have Phenol, a benzene ring with an -OH (hydroxyl) group attached. When we nitrate the ring with nitric acid in sulfuric acid (a reaction we'll discuss in the next section), a nitro group is attached to the benzene ring.

There are 3 possible places for the nitro group to attach: An ortho, meta, or para position. To understand the stability of the carbocation, we need to look at the resonance structures for a given attack and see what the results are.

The first resonance structure of the ortho attack results in a positive charge on the carbon with the hydroxyl group. This happens to be the most stable of the 3 resonance structures for an ortho attack because the two negative electron pairs in the oxygen act to stabilize the positive charge on the carbon. The other two resonance forms leave a carbon with a hydrogen attached, to hold the positive charge. Hydrogen can do nothing to stabilize the charge and thus, these are less stable forms.

In the para attack situation, notice that the second resonance form also puts a positive charge on the carbon with the hydroxyl group. This provides for stability just as it does in the case of an ortho attack and thus, the middle resonance form is very stable.

Finally, in the meta attack situation, all of the resonance forms result in a positive charge on a carbon with only a hydrogen attached. None of these is stable, and thus, meta attack with a hydroxyl group attached, is a very small percentage of the product.

So the electron pairs in the oxygen act to stabilize the ortho and para attacks.

===Inductive Effects===
Now let's look at the inductive effects of deactivating substituents. Let's imagine that, instead of a hydroxyl group, we instead have a carbonyl group attached to the ring in its place. When a carbonyl is attached, the ring is bonded to a carbon which in turn, is double-bonded to an oxygen, the double-bonded oxygen is withdrawing electrons and this inductive effect is felt on the ring, strongly deactivating its pi-bond nature and putting a positive dipole on the carbon. Looking at the resonance structures, this carbon, which already has some positive nature is now given the added resonance of a positive charge, in the case of ortho and para attacks. Positive plus positive equals more positive and thus, less stable. There's no negative charge or negative electron pair to stabilize this positive charge.

So in this case, not only is the entire ring less activated, but the ortho and para attacks result in much more unstable carbocation resonance forms. Hence, meta is the preferred position, but the overall reaction is less active than plain benzene.

===Halides as the Exception===
Notice that in the list of activating vs. deactivating substituents, the activating ones are all ortho/para directing. In the deactivating substituents, all but the halides, are meta directing. Why are halides an exception?

Because halides are more electronegative than carbon, they induce a positive dipole on the attached carbon and a negative dipole on their own atom(inductive effect), and in accordance to the previous logic of activating/deactivating substituents, deactivate the ring. However, halides also possess lone pair electrons in their outer shell to share with the ring, allowing the resonance structures with favored ortho/para attacks versus meta attacks due to their poor resonance forms. In essence, although halides do deactivate the ring to some extent, they provide major resonance contributors due to the availability of their lone pairs. Resonance structures usually trump the inductive effect.

==Detailed Effects of Substituents==

We've discussed some generalities about the effects of substituents and even some specifics about certain ones, but let's look more closely at the substituents and try to understand the details of what makes them activating vs. deactivating.

-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, -NHR, and -NRR are all very strongly activating. Though nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon, its ability to share a pair of electrons greatly outweighs its electron withdrawing effect.

-OH and -O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is similar in that it is even more electronegative than nitrogen, but it has two pairs of electrons to share, which also greatly outweighs its electon withdrawing effect.

-NHCOCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and -NHCOR are also strongly activating, but the inductive effect of the double-bonded oxygen acts to make the nitrogen more electron withdrawing, so they're not quite as activating as the other -N subsituents above.

-OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and -OR are also still strongly activating, but less so, because the electron density is shared on both sides of the oxygen.

-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and -R in general provide some electron density sharing, but not nearly as much as a pair of electrons. Thus their effect is only weakly felt.

For deactivating groups we have:

-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or nitro and -NR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The nitro group is very strongly deactivating because of its resonance structure. The nitro group has two resonance forms: O=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=O. Both of these forms leave a full positive charge on the nitrogen making it completely unable to help stabilize the positive carbocation intermediate. The same applies to -NR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and -CCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; both have an inductive electronegative effect of 3 halides, but with no electrons to share with the ring, leaving them also very strongly deactivating.

-CN has a triple bond between the carbon and nitrogen with a resonance form of a double bond between the carbon and nitrogen and a positive charge on the carbon, meaning that between the electronegativity of the nitrogen and positively charged carbon in the resonance form, it destabilizes the carbocation and offer no electrons to the ring.

-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, -COR, -CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R - all of these have electronegative oxygens giving the carbon a positive partial charge and providing no electrons for stability on the ring.

-F, -Cl, -Br, all have a similar effect. They are electronegative and deactivate the ring, but have electrons to share that, to some degree, makes up for it, allowing the ortho/para direction. But to understand their effects better, you need to look at them in terms of their placement on the periodic chart. Florine is the most electronegative element and it's very small and thus very close to the carbon it's bonded to. This gives its electromagnetic influence a stronger deactivating character. Chlorine is less electronegative, but it's also larger and thus further away from the carbon, making it harder for it to share its electrons. And so on.

=Polysubstituted Benzenes=
Unsubstituted benzene is seldom encountered in nature or in the laboratory, and you will find in your studies that most often benzene rings are found as parts of other, more complicated molecules.  In order for benzene to react in most situations, it gains or loses some functionality dependent on which functional groups are attached.  Although the simplest case is to work with benzene that has only one functional group, it is also essential to understand the interactions and competitions between multiple functional groups attached to the same benzene ring.

When there is more than one substituent present on a benzene ring the spatial relationship betwen groups becomes important, which is why the arene substitution patterns '''ortho''', '''meta''' and '''para''' were devised. For example three isomers exist for the molecule cresol because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed either next to each other (''ortho''), one position removed from each other (''meta'') or two positions removed from each other (''para'').  Where each group attaches is most often a function of which order they were attached in, due to the activating/deactivating and directing activities of previously attached groups.

[[Image:Cresol isomers.PNG]]

==Competition Between Functional Groups==

When a ring has more than one functional group, the effects of the groups are combined and their total effect must be taken into account. In general, effects are summed. For example, toluene (methylbenzene) is weakly activated. But p-nitrotoluene has both a methyl group and a nitro group. The methyl group is weakly activating and the nitro is pretty strongly deactivating, so overall, the group is very deactivated. In terms of direction, however, both substitutents agree on the direction. The methyl group is ortho/para directing. The nitro group occupies the para position, so the methyl will now want just ortho direction. The nitro group is meta directing. The positions meta to the nitro are also ortho to the methyl, so this works out and further substituents will be almost entirely in the positions ortho to the methyl group.

If two functional groups disagree on direction, the more activating group is the one that controls direction. That is, if you had m-nitrotoluene, most of your product would tend to be ortho/para to the toluene and not meta to the nitro, despite the nitro having a stronger influence on overall activation.


==Naming Conventions==
When a benzene ring has more than one substituent group attached, the location of all of the groups not directly attached to carbon number one must be explicitly declared.  This is done by listing the number of the carbon atom where the group is attached, followed by a hyphen and the group's name.  The carbon atoms of the benzene ring should be numbered in order of previously established precedence, i.e., a bromine would take precedence over a nitro group, which itself would take precedence over an alcohol or alkane group.  The names of the groups should be listed in alphabetical order, i.e. &quot;2-methyl-5-nitrobenzaldehyde.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although the right to choose religious circumcision for one's self is non-controversial, the right of a caregiver to consent on behalf of a child for non-therapeutic surgery is more contested.

Generally there are two types of argument:  '''Supporters''' and '''Opponents'''.

==Religious freedom==
'''Supporters:''' Caregivers have a fundamental right to make religious decisions on behalf of children under their care.  The state has no right to limit this in any way.

'''Opponents:''' Circumcision is sexual assault and is therefore beyond the caregiver's rights of action against another person.  Religious freedom must be limited when health decisions are made on behalf of a minor.

:I agree with you, but you can no doubt imagine how difficult it is to find any kind of honest comparison.  I don't have statistics on hand, but after an initial upsurge in marijuana use after the Netherlands legalized it, usage rates went down to below previous amounts (and below rates for the US) and usage of hard drugs went down too.  Of course, none of this adequately addresses the use/abuse distinction you make.

'''Mangos''' are similar to peaches. They should be very sweet and juicy. Low-quality (but not rotten or unripe) mangos are fibrous and have a turpentine smell.

Mangos do not keep well. Non-rotten fresh ripe mangos are very rare. Many mangos start rotting right on the tree. The sliced mango in the picture has in fact just started to rot, as you can see by the dark-appearing translucent area. This mango would have a bit of a funny smell, vaguely like plastic or some sort of cleaning fluid. The translucent area is starting to liquefy. An unripe mango is crunchy, pale yellow on the inside, and not very sweet. Mangos should not have dark spots on the side; these indicate that the mango has started to rot. Mangos generally rot from the non-stem end, from the seed or pit, and from any dark spots on the outside. Black fibers indicate a different sort of rot, also bad.

When purchasing a mango, obviously avoid any signs of rot. A mango should feel solid, but not really hard. A mango should have a noticeable good smell. The small elongated variety with a pointy end will generally be of better quality than the larger and more rounded type.

There are many ingenious ways to open a mango, most failing to let you examine the mango for bad spots. (you can take off the sides and then flip them inside out for example) The more-or-less obvious method is best. Slice off the stem end with a sharp knife. Next, use the knife to help you peel the mango. Dig the knife in a bit at the stem-end cut, creating a pull tab. Peel away from this tab. Repeat all the way around the stem end, then elsewhere as needed. Be gentle in holding the fruit as you do this. Next, notice the symmetry. A mango contains a large flat seed that divides the fruit into two halves. Slide the knife along each side of the seed, cutting the fruit into three pieces. Cut away and discard any translucent areas. If you had to discard anything, rinse the remaining part to get rid of juices from the rotten part. Chop up the fruit as desired. The middle section may give you trouble; if it is good then you might just gnaw it from the seed.

Cooked mangos lose the characteristic mango smell and flavor. This can be desirable if you want a mush that tastes like [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potatoes]]. You could serve cooked mangos with meat.

Green mangos are sometimes used in cooking. The whole mango may be chopped or thinly sliced, including the skin and seed.

Many people are allergic to mango sap. Drops of sap may be found near the stem end of a mango.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[Cookbook:Sponge_Cake]] and [[Cookbook:Impossible Sponge_Cake]]==

The recipe for sponge cake is indeed incorrectly weighted.

I understand that the recipe is intended to be scalable. Besides being complicated and probably not needed, the procedure doesn't work.

First of all, the [[Cookbook:Baking Soda]] or [[Cookbook:Baking Powder]] '''(Very different! Which one?)''' is not scaled. If scaling is so important, this is a problem.

:On second thought, it doesn't matter. This ingredient is unused. Perhaps the original recipe used normal flour?

The second is the matter of the eggs. If the eggs have lost weight and you do not add water to restore them, you will be using eggs that are thicker than normal. Your instructions handle eggs that have lost content via a leak, not via evaporation.

You say that the recipe is 140+ years old. This might be older than the stanardization of egg weights. The ''USDA Large'' egg is about the same size as an ''EU size M'' egg. I presume this is what you mean. Since these are the default sizes AFAIK, it would have been better to leave the size unspecified. Relying on standard weights will let you be accurate to plus-or-minus 6% or so, which is good enough for every recipe I've ever used.

Regarding kitchen scales, you are clearly unaware of world-wide cooking issues. I have never heard of a US household having such an item. The normal US household has only a crude bathroom scale for measuring human weight. I would not be able to purchase a kitchen scale at any normal place (supermarket) for buying kitchen items. I'd have to drive a long way to a specialty cooking store. I'd probably have to pay $30. Nobody normal would ever do that. Most people in the US are unfamiliar with weighing anything not measured in whole pounds, which would make for a truly huge cake.

Fortunately, the recipe can be fixed based on normal density of the various ingredients.</text>

__NOTOC__
Sponge cake is the most commonly recognised variety of [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] confectionery in Britain. It has a sweet taste, often flavoured with [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]], [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] or other additions. It can be cut and displayed in a very large number of different ways.

A [[Cookbook:Impossible Sponge Cake|more difficult version of this recipe]] is available
for those having a kitchen scale and wanting to use it.

==Ingredients==
===For the cake===
* 2 eggs
* 1 Cup minus 2 Tablespoon Self-Rising Flour
* 1/2 cup superfine sugar
* 1/2 cup butter
* 2 mounded Tablespoon baking soda (unused, but you supposedly need it)

If your eggs seem kind of big, you might want to increase the amounts of some ingredients. Add an extra teaspoon each of sugar and butter, and two extra teaspoons of flour. Also, note the adjustments below based on usage of optional ingredients.

====Extras (Optional)====
* [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract (1-2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]])
* food coloring (according to looks)
* [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] (according to taste. Use 3 parts less flour for every 4 parts added.)

===For the filling===
Choose one of these to spread between two cakes if making a cake with more than two eggs.
* 2 to 4 T jelly (softened with pallette knife or similar) or
* Buttercream (cream together 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] superfine sugar and 1/2 c butter)
===For dredging===
* 1/3 cup sugar, any type

==Procedure==
#Preheat an oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|400°F]].
#Cream together the sugar and butter in the mixing bowl. They should achieve a creamy texture with quite a thick consistency. The longer, harder and faster the butter and sugar are creamed the lighter the cake will be when cooked.
#Add both eggs and mix well.
#Add all the flour and mix well.
#Add any food coloring, flavoring etc. at this point. If you add liquid ingredients, add the same volume again of sugar-and-flour mix to compensate. If adding dry ingredients, ensure to use 3 parts less flour for every 4 parts of extra ingredient added.
#Beat with wooden spoon in a circular motion, trying to incorporate as much air as possible.
#Grease one or two cake pan(s) with butter. You may wish to use a [[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springform pan]] for this recipe.
#Spoon, then scrape, as much cake mixture as possible into the pan(s). If using two pans, try to ensure that both tins have an equal amount of cake mixture in them and that both are not more than 3/4 filled.
#Put the cake tins into the oven and leave them for approximately 10 minutes before checking them. The cooking time should eventually reach around 15 minutes: keep checking them regularly after about 8 minutes since ovens vary.
#Turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool.
#If doing two layers, turn one of them upside down and spread your filling onto its base, then stick the other cake (top up) onto the upside-down cake.
#Dredge the cake with sugar using a spoon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Simply put, kitchen scales are not found in the USA. So it isn't just a problem of using metric stuff. Conversion requires calculations involving density. So, here goes.

Would it not be easier to only put 2 lists of ingredients on the other page? Not 2 recipies.



What sort of fail spongecake is this?! Nothing about separating the eggs, beating until extremely light and airy, and then gentle folding in. Looks to me like someone's grandma wrote 'sponge' on top of a poundcake recipe and it was copied into here verbatim.

With lessons learnt from C and C++, Java emerged as a language of choice for the Internet programmer in it's early days circa 1995. Many a programmers adopted this ''easy-to-use'' language almost instantly after its launch and why wouldn't they when it offered all the goodies in one bag: Automatic Garbage Collection, Graphics, Animation, Graphical User Interfaces, Platform Independence, Networking, Internationalisation and Documentation.

__TOC__

== All that hype: Rise and fall of Java ==
The year 1996 saw Java develop a massive following as Usenet groups flooded with vast amounts of news and information about the language. The Java beta and 1.0 might have caused a huge noise in the development community, but it was the version 1.1 launch in March 1997 that led people into thinking &quot;Can Java replace Windows?&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[[Javafied/Preface#References|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

People began measuring Java up against systems like Microsoft Windows and no matter how impressive Java seemed, people began scratching up tidbits against the language. Some said it was slow, some simply disliked it because the &lt;code&gt;drawLine(...)&lt;/code&gt; method in the &lt;code&gt;Graphics&lt;/code&gt; class drew a line that was of &lt;code&gt;1px&lt;/code&gt; width. And soon technical papers began appearing on websites benchmarking Java speeds and issues related to performance hits and glitches in Java programs. Java faded out.

== The resurrection ==
With Java out of the scene, software vendors like Microsoft adopted almost all of the functionalities of Java (the Virtual Machine Bytecode, Garbage collection and Multithreading), plastered it over their existing products namely Visual C++ and Visual Basic to come out with a new language, C# and a brand new platform, .Net. Java was long forgotten. C# was now the language of choice for a programmer, a language with the same functionality as that of Java and the speed of C/C++. C# ruled over Java in all aspects.

Java started losing developers, heck, I was one of them. But then the minor version incremented. The &lt;code&gt;1.3&lt;/code&gt; was now &lt;code&gt;1.4&lt;/code&gt;. Hope appeared at the horizon of neglect as streaks of bright red at sunrise would. The Java language was not dead yet! Still in beta it clambered, resurrected but to vain. C# development had juiced out half of developers once devoted Javaholics. A few months later Java incremented to &lt;code&gt;1.5&lt;/code&gt;, but this time Java had some major changes introduced into the language syntax to match some constructs like &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loop equivalent common to C#. Java attracted a few more developers but it had yet to convince the end-users. Can it?

We'll be exploring how Java can be useful for developers and users both on the Windows platform in this book and will travel deep into the world of Java to learn what's new in Java.

== Support ==
It doesn't just end with this book. We will try to provide ongoing support to readers of this book and keep on improving the text of the book through the '''discussion''' link on the top of each and every page of this book.

We would also be:
*providing a ''download section'' where the source-code (if any) could be downloaded.
*publishing FAQs on using this guide to overcome most of your problems.

== Talkback ==
What makes an author more merrier than response? We welcome comments to the manuscript and would like to hear from all the readers of the book. If you'd like to talk to any of the authors of the book, go ahead and do so using the '''discussion''' link on top of the page.

Please let us know if there are any errors in this book, lest correct them yourself and provide us with your suggestions fro future editions.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called SPUI. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name SPUI~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Introduction: what is a DOS? ==
'''DOS''', which stands for '''Disk Operating System''', is an OS that initially loads itself from disk.  The boot PROM contains a trivial OS and a BIOS (basic input/output system) that is sufficient only to achieve that initial load.  (Earlier OSs loaded from paper tape, punched card or magnetic tape.  The first personal computers, such as the Altair did not have an operating system of any kind although they could be added later to use devices.)

In common with most other OSs, Disk Operating Systems consist of four primary modules:
* The extended input/output system which reads and writes to disk and tape, reads from keyboard and writes to screen and/or printer. (Hence the term &quot;read-out&quot; is a Hollywood nonsense neologism for &quot;display&quot;).  Most DOSs are at least minimally open, so that third party developers can write hardware &quot;drivers&quot; (extensions to the I/O system) to support their hardware.  Mac OSs are the most restrictive, Linux the least (fully open). Older Apple DOSs were actually fairly open.
** The Network connection.  (This is just a special case of I/O but occasionally it is useful to treat it separately.)  No early OSs had networking (ignoring the trivial case of attached terminals), but it was added during the 1970 to 1990 period.
* The task scheduler.  Its function is to determine which process should run next and for how long.  In early OSs, this was fairly rudimentary - one task had complete control and if an application crashed, the machine crashed.  '''Interrupts''' were used to give control back to the OS and a different process  takes over.  A &quot;grown up&quot; OS needs '''pre-emptive multi-tasking''', which came to the mainframe world with Exec 8 on Univac hardware in about 1970 and to the personal computer world in 1985 with [[w:AmigaOS|AmigaOS]]. 
* The file (and directory) system
* The User Interface - in early OSs, this is just a  command-line environment.
  
All modern OSs are disk operating systems, but the term &quot;DOS&quot; has stuck to the first generation personal computers that used it.

==Early proprietary DOSs==
Well known DOSs include PC-DOS/MS-DOS (Microsoft), DR-DOS (Digital Research), and FreeDOS. These are all designed to be compatible with MS-DOS. In fact to the average computer user MS-DOS IS DOS. The rest of this section discusses MS-DOS.
The name that Apple gave to DOS for the Apple II was originally DOS 3.1, which went to 3.3, and was then comletely redone for ProDOS.

'''Benefits'''

Today, DOS is commonly used in embedded systems for low royalties, low memory usage, and ease of direct hardware access. DOS remains popular among nostalgists, hobbyists, and in corporate/educational environments where a legacy runtime is needed.  Quite simply, DOS offers compatibility with DOS programs that need total control of the machine.

'''Limitations'''

Foremost, there is no built-in graphical interface for DOS, making it intimidating to beginners. Since DOS is without a default GUI interface, the user must rely on first-party interfaces (Microsoft's DOSSHELL and versions of Windows from 1.03 to 3.12) a non-standard 3rd-party interface or memorize how to type commands to control DOS. It is widely accepted that the command-line environment that DOS provides is inferior to the one provided by UNIX-like systems. DOS systems lack a sophisticated scripting environment, cannot manage memory and CPU usage for multiple processes simultaneously (multitasking), and do not natively support hardware invented since about 1995 - 1998.

== FreeDOS ==
As the name suggests, FreeDOS is a free implementation of the MS-DOS operating system.  The project was started in 1994 when Jim Hall, a student at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls, was discouraged to hear that Microsoft would be moving away from their DOS operating system with the release of Windows 95.

              the Hebrew VERB
               by: Dodi Richter ביד- דודי  ריכטר  

The normal Hebrew verb has a 3-consonant Shoresh שרש, or &quot;root&quot;, which has a vague meaning. Between and around the shoresh are added vowels and other consonants in certain patterns to create new verbs, nouns, and adjectives related to the root in a way determined by the pattern. For example, the root כתב, meaning to write, is added to the pattern פּוֹעֵל, meaning one who does an action, to get כּוֹתֵב, a writer, or one who writes. The root פעל p-'-l &quot;to create, do&quot; is used to indicate the pattern, and the first &quot;פ&quot;, second &quot;ע&quot;, and third &quot;ל&quot; letters of this root are used to symbolize respectively the first, second, and third letters of roots in general.

From the shoresh there can be formed 7 patterns of verb forms, called Binyanim בִּנְיָנִים (Singular: Binyan בִּנְיָן), literally meaning constructions. There are other, rare forms not used in Modern Hebrew.

#Pa'al פָּעַל. This Binyan is the simplest, and is most often called the Kal קל which means &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;light&quot;.
#*Example: &quot;broke&quot; in the sentence: &quot;I broke the window.&quot; &quot;שָׁבַרְתִּי אֵת הַחַלּוֹן&quot;
#Nifal נִפְעַל. This is the passive form of the Pa'al.
#*Example: &quot;is broken&quot; in the sentence &quot;The window is broken.&quot; &quot;הַחַלּוֹן נִשְׁבַּר&quot;
#Pi'el פִּעֵל. This is the more intense form of the verb, indicated by the dagesh in the second letter of the root which shows that it should be pronounced twice as long, &quot;פִע-עֵל&quot;, though this is usually ignored in Modern Hebrew. Sometimes the Pi'el shows a causative.
#*Example: &quot;shattered&quot; in the sentence: &quot;I shattered the window&quot; &quot;שִׁבַּרְתִּי אֶת הַחַלּוֹן&quot;
#*Example of causative: &quot;He learnt&quot; &quot;לָמַד&quot; (Qal) vs. &quot;he taught&quot; &quot;לִמֵּד&quot;.
#Pu'al פֻּעַל. This is the passive form of the Pi'el, also with a dagesh in the second letter of the root.
#*Example: &quot;was shattered&quot; in the sentence: &quot;The window was shattered.&quot; &quot;הַחַלּוֹן שֻׁבַּר&quot;
#*Example of causative: &quot;He was taught&quot; &quot;לֻמַּד&quot;.
#Hif'il הִפְעִיל. This is the causative form of the verb.
#*Example: &quot;reminded&quot; in the sentence: &quot;I reminded him (I caused him to remember).&quot; &quot;הִזְכַּרְתִּי אוֹתוֹ&quot; (The Pa'al of the verb, &quot;זָכוֹר&quot;, means &quot;to remember&quot; or &quot;זָכַר&quot; &quot;he remembered.&quot;)
#Hof'al הָפְעַל or Huf'al הֻפְעַל. This is the passive of the Hif'il.
#*Example: &quot;was reminded&quot; in the sentence: &quot;He was reminded.&quot; &quot;הֻזְכַּר&quot;
#Hitpa'el הִתְפַעֵל. This is the reflexive form of the verb, in which the subject acts on itself.
#*Example: &quot;strolled&quot; in the sentence: &quot;He strolled.&quot; (The Pa'al of the verb, &quot;הָלוֹך&quot;, means &quot;to walk&quot;, &quot;הָלַך&quot; &quot;he walked&quot;; therefore the Hitpa'el has the sense of &quot;he walked himself&quot;, or &quot;he strolled&quot;.)

The consonants of the Shoresh determines the &quot;type&quot; of verb it is, of which there are three principal ones in Hebrew: Strong, Weak and Hollow.

Usually, a verb should be of the Strong type and conform to the general rules of adding and changing vowels and consonants according to Binyan, tense, person, number, and gender. However, some letters can cause a verb not to be Strong, because these rules cannot be applied to these letters, or because these letters can sometimes be dropped.

Weak verbs have such letters as the first or third letter of the Shoresh. There are seven letters that make a verb Weak. These are as follows: א  'alef, ע 'ayin, ה heh, ח chet, י yod, ו vav and נ nun.  

Hollow verbs are verbs in which the SECOND root letter is a ו vav or a י yod.  These disappear in conjugation. The Shoresh  for &quot;to habitate&quot; (temporarily) is גור, and when conjugated becomes (in the Pa'al Binyan, present tense, גר (masculine singular), גרה (feminine sing.), גרים (masc. plural), גרות (fem. plur.). The ו is dropped.

The Hebrew verb also has a Gizarh, or Sound Class.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 4. The Biological Communities&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----

A '''''community''''' or '''''biocoenosis''''' is ''an assemblage of organisms (species populations) whose composition and aspect is determined by the properties of the environment and by the relations of the organisms to each other'' (modified from Braatne, 2005). Möbius proposed the term ''biocoenosis'' in 1877 in his study of oyster reefs in the North Sea, recognizing that interactions between species in a structurally complex system brought with it a higher level of functional complexity. Shelford defined a community as an &quot;assemblage with unity of taxonomic composition and a relatively uniform appearance (Odum, 1959).&quot; The ''biotic community'', along with the physical or abiotic elements of the environment together constitute the '''''ecosystem'''''- how a community of organisms interact with their environment of Tansley (1935).

Like an &quot;ecosystem&quot;, the size or area occupied by a community can vary considerably. Bounded by the distribution of the component species populations where these overlap,communities produce a uniform species composition.  Some species might as well be members of other surrounding (or distant) communities. Like the ecosystem concept discussed in [[../Ecosystems|Chapter 5]], the ''community'' concept is broadly defined as one of nested units: conceptually small units potentially being part of containing larger units. This fact is recognized when ecologists define '''major communities''' as those of sufficient size and completeness of organization to be relatively independent of adjoining communities, and '''minor communities''' as those more or less dependent on neighboring (or surrounding) assemblages.

Communities show both functional and structural (taxonomic) unity, although some species may be replaceable over time and space so that functionally similar communities can have different species compositions.  The community concept emphasizes the idea that organisms live together in an orderly manner; that species distributions are more than simply individuals responding in a similar way to a particular set of physical factors. And, of course, a community has properties or characteristics that are more than the sum of its species populations and unique attributes.

==Communities and Biomes==

[[Image:Tree With Moss2.jpg|thumb|350px|left|A single tree could be considered a community]]While the definition of a community can depend on a large number of factors, it can be broken down for easier understanding. In simplest terms, a community is an assemblage of populations living in the same place at the same time, interacting with each other and their environment. According to this definition, there are also various spatial scales that are recognized when describing different types of communities. Spatial scale refers to the size of the organisms that make up the community and can range from very small (i.e., bacteria) to very large (i.e., animals). There are three approaches to spatial ecology: '''Theoretical Ecology''', '''Metapopulation Ecology''', and '''Landscape Ecology''' (Hanski 1998). Every community affects another adjacent community, i.e. communities intergrade continuously. Read [[Wikipedia:en:Metapopulation|Metapopulation]].

Examples of different spatial scales in communities:
* 1. A forest - made up of trees, plants, and animals
* 2. A single tree - made up of a community of insects and flora
* 3. A termite gut - made up of a community of protozoa, bacteria, and archaea

Emergent properties of communities include stability, response and resilience to invasion and  drought, and bioremediation. (Read [[Wikipedia:en:Bioremediation|Bioremediation]])

===Terrestrial Biomes===

The earth contains many different geographical areas that contain similar climatic conditions. As a result of natural selection, many comparable ecosystems, &quot;biomes&quot;, have developed in these areas. A '''biome''' is a community on a global scale, and is usually defined by temperature, precipitation, and by the types of plants and animals that inhabit it. Generally, biome classification is determined by the climate and geography of an area. Each biome consists of communities that have adapted to the different climate and environment inside the biome. Specifically, there are special vegetation adaptations as well as physical and behavioral adaptions made by animals in order to accommodate the environment.
[[Image:Vegas desert.jpg|thumb|left|A desert biome near Las Vegas, Nevada]]
Several biomes have been identified and include '''tropical forest''', '''temperate forest''', '''taiga''', '''grassland''', '''chaparral''', '''desert''', '''tundra''', and '''aquatic''' environments. '''Tropical forests''' are characterized by high precipitation (around 75-200 cm of rainfall a year) and high temperatures. In contrast, the coniferous forests of the '''taigas''' get just 30-84 cm of precipitation per year and are exposed to average temperatures of -60 Celsius degrees in the winter. '''Chaparrals''' also play host to extreme temperatures and low precipitation (15-40 cm of per year) while '''grasslands''' average 25-70 cm of rain per year and have temperatures similar to those of temperate forest and deserts. '''Deserts''' and '''tundras''' are both very dry biomes (less than 30 cm of precipitation per year), but differ widely in their average temperature ranges. While there are clearly a wide variety of biomes on Earth, they are not all equally represented in terms of land mass.[[image:Taiga_of_Far_East_near_Imeni_Poliny_Osipenko_village,_Khabarovsk_Krai.jpg|thumb|right|A photo from the Siberian taiga north of Khabarovsk.]]

'''Taigas''' are the largest terrestrial biome covering the Earth's surface. Located in the Northern Hemisphere, just below the tundras, they cover 11% of the land mass in the Northern Hemisphere and make up 27% of the Earth's total forest. In fact, the biggest forest in the world is the Siberian taiga.

Conifers that make up '''taigas''' exhibit needles rather than leaves as a specialized adaptation for the taiga biome. The needles have less surface area for better water retention and a wax covering with sunken stomata to help reduce water loss and to protect the conifers from freezing weather. The dark green color of the conifer needles helps absorb energy from the sun to induce photosynthesis for survival. Conifers also display an inverted funnel shape to help shed the enormous amounts of snow load. The long cold winters and the short summers make it hard for plants and animals to survive and the '''taiga''' biome is consequently less diverse than others. The acidic soil of the '''taiga''' regions also affects the vegetation and the animals that feed on those plants.[[image:Taiga.png|thumb|350px|left|Taiga land surface coverage]]

The survival and land mass coverage of the '''taigas''' is threatened by many factors. Since the woody bark of conifer trees is easily burned, fires, natural or man-made, pose a major threat to the '''taigas'''. Also, logging and clear cutting for pasture land diminishes the size of the '''taigas''' in certain areas. The province of Manitoba has signed away 40% of its productive taiga for cutting; an area equal to the size of North Dakota. In addition, Alberta, Canada is allowing massive deforestation in the next sixty years. The loss of a considerable portion of the '''taiga''' is major concern, not only because of the subsequent loss of biodiversity and oxygen production, but also because of the '''&quot;greenhouse effect&quot;'''.  The grasslands are also effected by disturbances. Belcher et al. 1989{{ref|1989}} studied 25 km2 of mixed-grass prairie in Manitoba Canada. The study showed that native prairie was effected by disturbances such as roads, trails, and plowed fireguards. These disturbances expose mineral soil allowing for infestations of leafy spurge which significantly declines the abundance of the dominant native grass species. Leafy spurge poses a threat to potention rangeland, and the conservation of native vegetation.

===Aquatic Communities===

There are three types of aquatic communities that occur in nature: '''marine''', '''freshwater''', and '''estuaries'''.

Marine communities are supported by water of relatively high salinity and are composed of organisms that are able to survive such high-salt conditions. The '''tropical coral reef''' is an example of a marine community that is usually found in shallow, tropical marine waters in latitudes ranging from 30°N to 30°S. On average, the growth of these communities is limited to depths of less than 100 feet and water temperatures greater than 72°F (22°C). These growth limiting factors facilitate the formation of limestone, the major structural component of the reefs. The limestone is secreted by living organisms, including Cnidarians, coralline algae, mollusks, echinoderms, and some annelid worms. Cnidarians are the chief contributor to the limestone formation as they secrete an exoskeleton of calcium carbonate.[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefs#Geologic_reef_definition]] [[Image:Giant_clam_or_Tridacna_gigas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A giant clam that is part of the Great Barrier Reef]]


There are three basic types of coral reefs: '''Fringing Reef''', '''Barrier Reef''', and '''Atoll'''. '''Fringing Reef''' is continuous with the shore line and is usually exposed during low tide. '''Barrier Reef''' is further away from shore and is usually separated from the shore by a lagoon with an island. The '''Great Barrier Reef''', located off the cost of Australia, is the largest known coral reef. Its width varies between 10 and 90 miles along its 120 mile length. '''Atoll''' is a type of reef that allows some passage out to sea and  surrounds a lagoon that does not have an island.
 
The reefs accommodate organisms of both mobile and non-mobile species. Lobsters, crabs, squid, reef sharks, and many different types of fish and sea cucumbers feed off of the reefs. Different types of algae also inhabit the reefs and serve as a food source for predators.

While the coral reef is an important marine community, many factors are negatively affecting its survival. In fact, as Jackson (1997) points out, coral reef communities have most likely been degraded long before the study of ecology was made relevant in the 1920s. {{note|Jackson}}Today, the hulls and anchors of ships associated with the fishing industry are causing damage to the reefs and high demand from the jewelry industry is decreasing the size of the reefs considerably. Coastal development, water pollution and tourism also pose a threat to the success of the coral reef communities. Jackson proposes the need for large scale reef protection efforts with &quot;extreme&quot; political, economic, and social implications if there is to be any hope of reef conservation.{{note|Jackson}}

[[Image:Barker Dam Lake Reflection.jpg|thumb|left|Barker Dam Lake in California is an example of a freshwater community]]
In contrast to marine communities, freshwater communities are supported by water of relatively low salt concentration and are composed of organisms that would most likely not survive in high salinity conditions. Freshwater communities include rivers, lakes, streams, and ponds.

An [[Wikipedia:en:estuary|estuary]] represents a community that is supported by freshwater and saltwater. Estuaries occupy a coastal location, with an open connection to the sea and some type of freshwater flow (i.e., rivers and streams). Therefore, they are affected by the constraints of both types of environments, creating many small biological niches and accommodating high diversity. [[Image:Moore River Estuary.JPG|thumb|right|An estuary of the Moore River in western Australia]]

Due to the variable nature of the salinity in estuaries, there are many factors that must be taken into account during estuary classification. Circulation patterns, tidal range, freshwater input, dominant habitat types, etc., are all examples of potentials for estuary variation.  Therefore, estuaries are typically classified by regions (i.e. northeastern United States, southeastern United States).  However, as Roman ''et al.'' point out, each estuary is capable of exhibiting unique characteristics due to the complex nature of the geomorphology of a specific area. {{note|roman}}  Even though regional classifications are generally acceptable, it is important to remember that there are always exceptions to the rule. 

==Aquatic Ecosystems==
[[Wikipedia:en:Aquatic_ecosystem|Aquatic ecosystems]] are comprised of two main types: [[Wikipedia:en:Freshwater_biology|freshwater ecosystems]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Marine_ecosystem|marine ecosystems]]. The main driving force of life in these ecosystems is plant growth, from which food chains begin. Plants require four components to grow. They are water, energy in the form of solar radiation (sunlight), inorganic carbon (either carbon dioxide or bicarbonate ions), and minerals/nutrients. Something that we may take for granted is that many of these ecosystems are downstream from humans. However, this fact has not gone unnoticed in the ecosystems. Frissell points out that a number of well monitored species have been detrimentally effected from being downstream of humans. Frissell argues this is due to the fact that we need to view changes to aquatic ecosystems differently than terrestrial ecosystems. Events such as fire and windstorms dramatically effect terrestrial ecosystems, while they have little effect on aquatic systems. At the same time things such as flooding and accelerated erosion are limited in terrestrial ecosystems, but very important in aquatic systems. This is the context in which aquatic ecosystems should be viewed. {{ref|Frissell1996}}

===Freshwater Ecosystems===

The study of freshwater ecosystems is termed [[Wikipedia:en:Limnology|limnology]]. They can be divided into two broad categories: [[Wikipedia:en:Lentic|lentic ecosystems]], which are contained in basins, and [[Wikipedia:en:Lotic_system_ecology|lotic ecosystems]], which are flowing water systems. Glaciers are one cause of lentic environments, where retreating glaciers leave behind basins. The flowing water of lotic systems is responsible for about 6 to 30 times the productivity in [[Wikipedia:en:Primary_producers|primary producers]] compared to primary producers in standing water (Nelson and Scott 1962).

===Saltwater Ecosystems===

Saltwater ecosystem structures are dictated by temperature, salinity, currents, waves, and tides. The most productive areas of the sea are coral reefs and coastal waters. Freshwater rivers eventually empty into the ocean and terrestrial ecosystems meet the edge of the sea. In certain areas, specifically Australia, there have been increases in salinity in freshwater regions. This has been shown to be a major factor driving natrual selection in this region; only the most tolerant organisms are able to survive and reproduce. Unfortunately, it appears that the salinity of these regions will continue to increase. However, the effects of the salinity changes on the ecosystem are unknown and remain to be seen in those areas.{{ref|Nielsen2003}}

== Limnology ==
'''Limnology''' (from Greek: Λίμνη limne, &quot;lake&quot;; and λόγος, logos, &quot;knowledge&quot;) is the study of inland waters (both fresh and saline) and their biological, physical, chemical, geological, and hydrological aspects. This includes the study of natural and man-made lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, wetlands, and groundwaters.  When studying the dynamics of an ecosystem, limnology involves variables such as pH, temperature, depth, and dissolved oxygen profiles of the body of water. Productivity of the system is tested using a transparency test with a Secchi disk, or by analyzing species diversity and abundance.

François-Alphonse Forel (1841-1912) established the field with his studies of Lake Geneva, the largest freshwater lake in Europe. Limnology is closely related to [[Hydrobiology]],the science of underwater life, which applies the principles and methods of physics, chemistry, geology, and geography to ecological problems. Much of modern hydrobiology can be viewed as a sub-discipline of ecology, but the sphere of hydrobiology includes taxonomy, economic biology, industrial biology, morphology, physiology, etc. The study of life in inland waters can be divided into '''lotic''' system ecology (flowing waters) and '''lentic''' system ecology (still waters).

One area of current research is '''eutrophication''', which focuses on biotic interactions in plankton assemblage.  This branch of hydrobiology involves microbial loops, water blooms, phosphorus load, and lake turnover. Another concern of limnology is the acidification of mountain lakes. Long-term studies are being carried out to monitor changes in the ionic composition of river, lake, and reservoir water as a result of acid rain and fertilization. Another goal of current research is the elucidation of the basic environmental functions of the ecosystem in reservoirs, which are important for water quality management and water supply.

[[Image:Lambholm quarry.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fish hatcheries breed fish in a safe environment before releasing them into a lake or river to supplement endangered species or support recreational fishing]]

Many populations of fish are declining in certain habitats due to environmental changes and recreational fishing.  In response, fish hatcheries breed fish in a predator-free, unlimited resource environment before releasing them into a natural habitat, also known as stocking.  A study by Power (1994){{note|pow}}investigated predation by sauger and walleye on paddlefish that were being stocked in Lake Sakakawea.  Predators at three different sites along the lake were sacrificed, and 73% had ingested at least one paddlefish.  All of the ingested paddlefish still intact were only 36-52% of adult size.  These findings suggest that paddlefish are being stocked in the lake before they are large enough to avoid such predation. Another issue with stocking is that the progeny are sometimes genetically inferior to those that are born in a natural habitat.  The downfall to raising fish in such an environment is that there is no competition and no &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot;

Microorganisms have a huge influence on limnology.  They are largely responsible for nitrogen balance in lakes, decomposition of water humus in bogs, annual cycling of iron, and oxidation of sulfur.  Kuznetsov (1968){{note|kuz}}studied this complex cycling by incubating reservoirs and using radioactive isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, iron, and sulfur to monitor what form they were in and at what rate turnover occurred.  Microorganisms establish an elaborate cycle to maintain chemical stability that allows a variety of aquatic life to flourish.

== Succession ==
The concept of '''succession''' was first clearly put forth by Clements (1916). The classical use of the term involves three fundamental concepts (after Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986):
# vegetation occurs in recognizable '''communities''';
# community change through time results from the biota present modifying the environment (changes are '''autogenic''');
# changes are linear and directed towards a '''climax''' ecosystem (Odum, 1971).

Succession is the predictable and orderly changes in the composition or structure of an ecological community.  It's a colonization of a disturbed area that eventually leads to an increase in species diversity.  Succession is divided into two stages- (1) Primary Succession and (2) Secondary Succession.
[[Image:Secondary succesion cm01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Trees are growing on meadows and fields that are not cultivated anymore]]


'''Primary succession''' deals with the recolonization of bare ground.  The primary succession has '''r-selected organisms'''- species that can survive at high disturbance areas and are fast growing organisms.  There are several factors that can cause disturbance- (1) people, (2) diseases, (3) fire, (4) precipitation/floods, (5) wind/hurricanes/tornadoes, (6) temperature extremes (like freezing or extreme heat), and (7) volcanoes.  In other words, the communities that are in early succession will be dominated by fast-growing, well-dispersed species.  The other stage of succession (as succession moves forward) will be replaced by more competitive species [[Wikipedia:en:Ecological succession/Succession]]. A good example of primary succession is the ecological response to the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980. Bishop et al. 2005{{ref|Bishop2005}} describes that a primary succession landscape like Mount St. Helens may teach us fundamental mechanisms that describe the formation and function of ecological communities. The use and understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the restoration of devastated landscapes. 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Seral community]]

The other stage of succession is '''secondary succession''' which is the recolonization of partially cleared areas (this occurs after primary succession).  Eventually, secondary succession/colonization leads to mature communities called climax communities which are stable communities.  The secondary succession communities have '''k-selected organisms'''-organisms that use the limiting resource the best and therefore can out-compete other individuals  The secondary succession may include a '''seral community'''- an intermediate stage found in ecological succession in an ecosystem that advances towards its climax community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I made this recipe, and the mixture seemed awfully thin (I've made pancakes from a mix before). The first one turned out more like a crepe than a pancake; that was probably because I had the heat too low. The next few turned out as pancakes, but very thin and with soft and spongy interiors. About halfway I added more flour to the mixture. The pancakes after that were a nice thickness, but still a bit spongy and tasted a bit off (probably from too much flour).

Any comments? Suggestions? Is the recipe supposed to produce thin pancakes, and what proportions of solid should I add (or liquid should I take out) to make it thicker while still tasting the same? Thanks for any help. --[[User:SPUI|SPUI]] 18:42, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Oh, just the opposite. This recipe produces very thick pancakes. They often come out about 1/4&quot;, 1 cm, or 3/8&quot; thick. If you do not spread the pancake out well, it can even be 1/2&quot; thick in the middle. Did you use whole wheat flour? (&quot;whole meal&quot; flour in the UK) The batter can thin out if you let it sit for a long time. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:28, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::I used standard white flour - I didn't realize that made much of a difference. Any suggestions for how much white flour to use (and any other adjustments)? --[[User:SPUI|SPUI]] 21:42, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: In that case, reduce the liquid a bit. Try 3/4 cup. You might start with even less at first, adding more later as needed.

:::Still, &quot;crepe&quot; sounds awfully thin. Might you have used [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] instead of [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]? They are seriously different; if you wish to use baking soda you'd need to add some [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] in place of some (1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] maybe) of the milk, or add some powdered acid ([[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]] or [[Cookbook:Citric Acid|citric acid]] perhaps). Baking soda won't do anything without acid in the recipe. The pancakes won't puff up right without a leavening agent.

:::If your baking powder is getting a bit old, you could try adding a bit more than called for. This might be the problem if you store your baking powder in a hot and humid place, such as next to the stove.

:::I suggest using the whole wheat. You need more [[Cookbook:Fiber|fiber]] in your diet. The fiber will help prevent colon cancer. Besides, the whole wheat actually tastes better. Don't worry, it won't be like eating saw dust.

:::[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:32, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::Another idea: maybe you overmixed the pancakes. I've adjusted the instructions to note this. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:24, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I just made it with white flour and 1/2 cup milk. I think it came out well; my brother said it was a bit dry but he usually has syrup. --[[User:SPUI|SPUI]] 13:46, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Thickness depends on elevation.  At sea level, this recipe will produce very thin pancakes; at 10,000 feet, the pancakes will be almost an inch thick. --[[User:67.185.172.158|67.185.172.158]] 05:33, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

== Ingredients ==

This recipe is close to the one I already had (pancakes aren't that complicated, after all), with a couple changes. First, I usually use honey instead of oil (butter and syrup are other alternatives, though untried by me). Also, I add a half-teaspoon of vanilla, and use(d) half the baking powder.

The sugar was a nice addition. I used this recipe's amount (of brown sugar) yesterday morning, then made another batch with 50% more, which I preferred. I often eat these as snacks, and syrup can be messy, so it's nice for the sweetness to be a little less subtle.

You can also sprinkle nuts on the pancakes just after pouring them, but this almost always causes an air bubble under the middle of the pancake when it's flipped, and that in turn makes even cooking more difficult.

All of this may make me sound like a cook, but I'm not. Pancakes are all I do. =)

[[User:Elembis|Elembis]] 01:32, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

I don't make pancakes too often, but cheese is a nice thing to add to pancakes. so I added it in the variety section.

== Grams ==

I suggest put the ingredients in grams. Thanks.--[[User:Lagoset|Lagoset]] ([[User talk:Lagoset|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lagoset|contribs]]) 16:39, 27 May 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In my opinion, it's a good idea not to jump into discussion of what the main categories of political systems are. What I'd personally advocate is starting with a classical theorist or two, like Plato, and looking at the roots of modern political thought, then maybe Hobbes/Locke, Rousseau, Marx, etc. Go through them in a sort of sequence so we can see how the theories developed, and then when it comes to describing them, the reader will have a knowledge both of intellectual history and of the modes of thought used to arrive at the conclusions that form today's forms of government.

-My own objections: first of all, this page is redundant -- for a less developed page http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Politicaltheory
-Second of all, a political theory book should not start with &quot;a classical theorist or two&quot;, rather theres a whole rich history of political theory, and most political Theory textbooks that I have read focus on the history, not on modern ideologies. If you want to write a book on Political Ideology, perhaps you should title it that. I might be wrong, this is my own experience. In short, the &quot;Introduction&quot; part of your textbook outline should be the most substantial part, most Political Theory courses focus on these canonical authors. I also would recommend inclusion of Old Testament, New Testament, and Middle Age political theorists such as Machiavelli, St Augustine (analog to Plato), and Thomas Aquinas to name a few. There are others that are necessary to cover as well such as the post-Aristotle Hellenic political philosophers (they can be covered briefly though). If you want to broaden this beyond western theory you can tackle Confucius among others, though I would vote against this. There can be another textbook called Eastern Political Theory. This is just touching on Ancient political theory. I am not even going to begin naming other &quot;classic&quot; authors that fill the modern period.
-I'm against putting emphasis on modern political ideologies. The above should illustrate why--there is not enough room to accomodate that without starving the historical theories. Make a political ideology textbook for that. Though I'm willing to hear arguments if you have convincing ones.

Possible objections:

1) It's too canonical. I actually agree with this: everyone at my university who studies politics goes through the usual Plato, Locke, Rousseau, Marx sequence. But at the same time, these thinkers are canon for a reason: they have been extremely influential and a lot of people - important people - have taken their thought to heart. If this sounds like an argument from authority or popularity, that's because it sort of is. But at the same time, we assume anyone doing a &quot;University&quot; course - particularly an open one such as this - will be of the questioning persuasion. After they have learned the basics, students will not be scared of questioning thought. Additionally, we can balance out any description of these thinkers with objections and dissenters from both their contemporary and our present-day sources.

2) It marginalises other thinkers, even those who stated the same conclusions but arrived at them differently. I suppose this is a bit of a restatement of the original question, and as such the solutions are the same. Balance out the &quot;canon&quot; with a heretical tradition. Show that the the tradition of political thought is

3) It's ethnocentric. It's white, it's European, it's Anglo. Fair enough objection here: but I don't think I'm wrong in saying that most &quot;politics&quot; DOES stem from those civilisations influenced by Greco-Roman tradition. Once again, we can offer alternative explanations and objections to what is taught (e.g. modern-day Islamic objections to individualist politics; Singaporean objections to liberal democracy; when discussing Locke, cite present day objections not only to his theory of consent, but also his limits of political action to a few, thus invalidating the idea of universal consent.)

''Note that this page covers Visual Effects and not Special Effects.  SFX are things like pyrotechnics, rain and snow. Visual Effects (VFX) are the optical tricks that are used, including projection, green-screen, miniatures, etc...''

Visual Effects have always existed; they somewhat pre-existed Cinema.
Cinema itself, based on the illusion of movement, is an Effect. Every second of projection is an illusion of movement, a lie told by the director to the audience, a mandatory preface that brings us to the practical aspects of visual effects.
It is not possible to ignore the revolution in the field brought by the employment of digital software.
The digital tools today replace a lot of arts in the past based just on human skills.

== Visual Effects are at the core of the movie making process. ==

If you cannot get a special effect in the camera, then you must create the visual effect in post production.  With major motion pictures, each shot can cost thousands of dollars.  But for low budget film makers, there are cheaper alternatives.

Do you want to start doing amazing special effects with your small  DV Camcorder?  Then you have at least two options:  Matte Paintings and Budget Green Screen Shooting.

== Budget Green Screen Shooting ==

Green screen is one way of adding beautiful backgrounds to live action shots.  Probably the most extreme example of this is Robert Rodrigues' ''Shark Boy and Lava Girl''.  But even if you are shooting with only a DV camcorder, you can do inexpensive green screen shots.

One can cut the cost of the shot substantially by doing your green screen shooting outdoors using a thermonuclear device (the sun) which is free (on sunny days). This means that all you have to hire is the green screen itself - none of the finely calibrated even lighting that's normally so essential for the computer to get a good key on the other end. 

As an alternative to purchase or rental, one can manufacture a green screen. Commercial lighting supply houses sell paints specially manufactured for the purpose, but it is probably possible to get by with an ordinary house paint chosen carefully to be &quot;green enough&quot; for the computer to pull a key.

The most common difficulties with green-screen are:

* getting even lighting on the screen.
* getting the lighting on the foreground to match the lighting of the (separately shot) background. 

By shooting outside, with a diffusion frame hung over the shot you will get naturally even sun-light all over the screen and actor. This will also match the daylight conditions of the background that later replaces the green. If your intended background is not going to be normal daylight, or if you get a lot of cloud movement, this may not work for you.

Make sure your foreground actor is a good distance from the screen, so you don't get even a hint of green light reflected back onto him/her, as this will create problems later - but with your light source being the sun (overhead), you're less likely to get green spill than if the lights were hitting the screen from the front, as they probably would in a studio.

==Front Projection==

Front Projection (often abbreviated FP) is a technique which can achieve the same result as green screen, but &quot;in camera,&quot; that is to say, the composition of subject and background is complete as the combined image is acquired by the camera. 

The technique uses a beamsplitter located in front of the camera in such a way as to completely fill the camera's field of view, and oriented at a precise 45 degrees to the camera's shooting axis. (This rotation from the normal may be left-right or up-down.) The other components to the system are a transparency projector (still or motion picture), and a special retro-reflective lenticular screen positioned behind the action.

A beamsplitter acts as both mirror and window, reflecting a portion of the incident light, and reflecting another portion. Beamsplitters are chosen for a specific application based on the ratio of reflectance to transmission. Common types are 50R/50T (50% reflectance, 50% transmission) and 70R/30T. 

The beamsplitters used in Front Projection cinematography are of the plate type, simply a piece of plate glass with a special coating on one side designed to reduce the amount of light absorbed by the beamsplitter, and consequently neither reflected nor transmitted. The coated side faces the action, and is referred to as the &quot;front&quot; surface. The purpose of this coating is to reduce the loss of light due to absorption by the beamsplitter, which serves only to heat the glass.

A retroreflective screen is set behind the actors and other set pieces. This screen is not just a typical diffusive projection screen, which disperses light evenly so that a large audience composed of people sitting at many different angles to the screen sees a uniformly bright image. Instead, the retroreflective screen tends to send light right back where it came from.

The classic material for retroreflective FP screens is a made by 3M, and sold under the trademarked name of &quot;Scotchlite&quot;. Scotchlite is used in signmaking and conspicuity applications (night time motor vehicle safety visibility). It is available from commercial signmaking supply houses. 

Retroreflection in Scotchlite is achieved using millions of microscopic glass beads suspended in a transparent substrate bound to opaque vinyl sheeting. It is available in rolls of up to four feet in width.

While constructing the large (40 feet by 100 feet) screen of Scotchlite for the film &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, director Stanley Kubrick and special effects supervisor Tom Howard initially laid strips of Scotchlite side by side, but found that variations in manufacturing made the seams between adjacent strips glaringly obvious in the final product. Their solution involved tearing the Scotchlite into irregular overlapping pieces, minimizing the occurrence of variations of retroreflectivity large and regular enough to be discernible to the audience. Still, as Martin Hart has observed, careful examination of the FP scenes of &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt; reveal flaws introduced by variations in retroreflectivity between adjacent random patches. 

A more sophisticated solution was presented in an SMTPE paper: a review of this paper will be presented in a near future version of this article.

Having discussed the nature of the physical components used in Front Projection, we turn to the preparation and arrangement of these components in a working FP system.

A still or motion picture transparency projector containing the desired background image, or &quot;plate,&quot; is placed so that the projection axis is perpendicular to the camera's shooting axis, meeting at the place where the camera's shooting axis touches the front surface of the beamsplitter. (Thus the beamsplitter's orientation is 45 degrees to both camera and projector.)

When the projector is operating, the background plate is projected onto the front surface of the beamsplitter. A portion of the image is transmitted through the beamsplitter. In ordinary applications, the transmitted part of the image is absorbed by a black surface on the side of the beamsplitter opposite the projector, to avoid stray reflections.

The portion of the image which is not transmitted or absorbed by the beamsplitter is reflected through an angle of 90 degrees, and consequently projected over the action along the camera's shooting axis, falling onto both foreground actors and objects as well as the retroreflective screen behind them. 

Retroreflective materials tend to reflect light back along the path of incidence. In FP work, the background plate image is retroreflected, back toward the beamsplitter. Part of the retroreflected background image is again lost, as it is either absorbed by the beamsplitter or reflected back into the projection lens. The remainder enters the camera where it is photographed along with the action. 

The only portion of the image not accounted for in the foregoing discussion is that part of the projected background matte which falls on the actors or other foreground subjects. Foreground lighting, combined with the extreme deficit in retroreflectivity of the foreground subjects in comparison to the special screen, mean that the part of the projected image which falls on the actors is so dim as to not be detectable in-camera.

Precise alignment of system components is required to make sure that foreground objects perfectly cover their own shadows, cast by the projector on the screen. This rules panning and tilting, except in the special case where the camera is mounted so that either panning, tilting, or both occurs around the rear nodal point of the camera lens: so called &quot;nodal pans&quot; and &quot;nodal tilts.&quot; In addition, the beamsplitter must be large enough, and the camera close enough, so that the camera does not take the edge of the beamsplitter into view.

Examples of nodal pan-and-tilt camera work in the context of FP can be seen in the &quot;Dawn of Man&quot; sequence in the film &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; (1968), particularly the watering hole scenes. (The front projection effects on &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt; were executed by Stanley Kubrick with assistance from Tom Howard.)

A change of focal length (zoom) does not present the same difficulty as do panning or tilting. The camera can zoom in or out as long as the edges of the beamsplitter (or of the projected matte image) are not in view at the widest point of the zoom. In &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt;, Kubrick also used large set pieces at either end of some FP shots in such a way as to hide the edges of his already-gigantic retroreflective screen.

In fact, a special and inventive application of zooming was used by Zoran Perisic, who worked as a rostrum or animation stand cameraman on &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt;, to enhance the FP process for the film &lt;em&gt;Superman: The Movie&lt;/em&gt; (1978). Electronically controlled motorized zoom lenses are placed on both camera and projector, and synchronized with one another so that both lenses zoom together and at the same focal length at all times. This means that the background image will not change its apparent size when the camera zooms in, as the projector simultaneously projects a reduced image. In Persic's phrase, the projector zooms and the camera zooms to &quot;embrace&quot; the smaller image. However, the zoom causes foreground objects to appear to rush toward or away from the camera. The combination of the &quot;static&quot; background and the &quot;moving&quot; foreground enabled the visually effective flying scenes which helped to make the film a success.

To enhance this effect still further, the use of FP in &lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt; introduced two other innovations: use of travelling mattes (using a motion picture projector instead of a still transparency projector, in order to project a moving background); and the mounting of the entire front projection rig (camera, projector, and beamsplitter) on a large motion-controlled robotic-arm with six degrees of freedom, and using a massive curved screen.

In rear projection process photography the projector's shutter must be synchronized with the camera's using mechanical or electronic means, in order to avoid background flicker.

The motion-controlled front-projection mount was a masterpiece of engineering for 1978, and used an early microprocessor for control. Every aspect of the rig's operation and motion could be recorded to computer tape for later automatic playback, causing the rig to move and operate exactly as trained.

==Matte Paintings==

The oldest and probably the most underrated visual effect is matte paintings.  We see these all the time but because they look so natural, we don't notice. 

Originally, matte paintings was done on glass that stood directly in front of the camera.  To do matte painting, a partial set is created which is only as big as the actors and only extends to where the actors will perform.  The rest of the movie set is empty space (or something that you don't want to be seen in the movie.)  Except for a tiny spot of the glass which is clear, the rest of the movie set is painting on the glass.  This allows you to add more scenery buildings as paintings.  As long as the actors can be seen through the clear space of the glass, you cannot tell that the actors are not apart of the painted movie set.

Today, matte paintings are done with both paint and with CG (computer generated visual effects).  Rather than filmed through glass, the actors are filmed normally and later composited into the matte painting.  Therefore, now the distinction between matte paintings and computer generated visual effects is blurred.   If the actors are filmed on a partial movie set (without any green screen, etc.) then the effect is a matte painting... even if you use computer generated effects to get the effect.

=3D Animation for Visual Effects=

When you start looking at the possibility of using 3D computer generated effects, you need understand the different types of 3D animation.

;1.  General Purpose Animation
:Programs such as Blender, LightWave, Maya, and 3D Studio Max are general purpose animation programs.  They are very powerful, expensive (except Blender, free), have steep learning curves and are used on most high end effects movies.

;2.  Special Purpose Animation Programs
:Program such as Vue, Bryce, Poser, and DAZ Studio are designed for a specific purpose.  Vue and Bryce are designed to create realistic scenery from nature.  Poser and DAZ Studio are designed to work with special computer models called '''Poser''' figures or '''Digital Puppets'''.  Some of these programs are even '''free''' such as DAZ Studio, Blender and Bryce.

;3.  Special software Plug-ins
:Software modules such as Character Studio work inside of a general purpose animation program to create a special kind of animation similar to a Special Purpose Animation Program.   LightWave, Maya, and 3D Studio Max can be greatly expanded through the use of plug-in modules.

;4. Support Programs
:Programs that add in the animation but do not actually do any rendering can be extremely useful when you have a general purpose animation program which would be more awkward to use for a special task.  These expand the power of  LightWave, Maya, and 3D Studio Max without making these programs too cumbersome.

==3D Modeling==

All elements in 3D animation must be modeled.  Programs such as  LightWave, Maya, XSI and 3D Studio Max come with a modeler module built in.  Programs such as Vue, Bryce, Poser, and DAZ Studio do not but in the case of Poser and DAZ Studio, you can buy hundreds of figures designed for these programs.
Pixologic Zbrush, and Autodesk Mudbox are especially good at modeling organic objects such as humans and creatures.

==3D Animation==

Animation is done in three parts, the modeling, the actual animation and the rendering.  The actual animation can be:

;1. Keyframe animation
:Each movement is entered into the computer system by noting the position of objects at specific frames or points in time.  The movement between these key points is then calculated by the animation program based on rules set up by the animator (straight line, curved, etc.)

;2. Programmed animation
:For a flock of birds, rather than record the position and movement of each bird, a computer program calculates where all the birds go and how they move.

=Compositing=

Compositing is the process of combining various elements, such as 3D imagery, live action film footage and still imagery, to create a finished shot.  All visual effects that include live actors will require compositing.  As mentioned above, matte paintings are no longer painted onto glass.  Rather the live action is composited with matte paintings using a compositing program such as Adobe After Effects or Apple's Shake.

'''Software Compositing Applications'''
*Apple Shake (Discontinued)
*Adobe After Effects
*Autodesk Combustion
*Blender
*The Foundry Nuke
*Eyeon Digital Fusion
*Jahshaka
*sony vegas pro
'''Software &amp; Hardware Compositing Systems'''
*Autodesk Inferno
*Autodesk Flame
*Autodesk Flint
*sony vegas pro
All compositing applications provide the same basic tools and there is no hard and fast rule regarding which applications are for film and which applications are for commercials.  For example, while After Effects has been used on such films as &quot;The Aviator&quot; it is also very widely used for broadcast and title design.  Some applications do, however, come with specific tools which may prove advantageous depending on the task at hand.

The primary difference between software based compositing applications and the combined software and hardware solutions is that the large Autodesk systems are significantly more expensive but provide near real-time performance at film or HD resolutions.

Compositing applications typically follow two different working paradigms.
*Layer Based
*Node Based

Layer based compositing applications may seem more easily approachable to the novice or beginner compositor especially those who have worked with still footage in Photoshop or The Gimp.  While layer based applications can provide the same results as node based applications, node based applications are far easier to composite with when dealing with numerous elements and multiple 3D render passes.  While daunting at first, node based systems may provide the compositor with greater control over the shot and easier problem solving.  Even a beginning artist may benefit from learning a node based package in that she will gain a deep understanding of the exact operations which are taking place in order to create the effect.

== 8-Bit Graphics ==
Every pixel of an image used in a composite is composed of four color channels: Red, Green, Blue and Alpha. Each channel has an 8-Bit color depth resulting in a 32-Bit image. Higher color depths include 16-Bit per channel and 32-Bit per channel (float).  These higher color depths allow for smoother display of color variation, for example, in gradients.

== Rotoscoping ==
Rotoscoping, or masking, is the basis of compositing. It is the process of drawing a mask around an element in a frame or sequence of frames.  The resulting image is a combination of the Red, Green and Blue color channels in addition  to an Alpha channel which defines transparency.it works on frame to frame, you can not ignore a single frame which is not perfectly mask.

== Tracking ==
Tracking is the process of matching a foreground-element's motion to that of the background. Basically you pick a decent (i.e. defined, unique, contrasty) point on your background and tell the computer to follow that point. What you get is the motion-path of your point, which you can then apply to your foreground.&lt;p&gt;
Tracking is divided into two categories:&lt;br&gt;
'''2D Tracking:'''&lt;br&gt;
Described above... (most times referred to only as &quot;tracking&quot;, almost all compositing applications support it)&lt;br&gt;
'''3D Tracking:'''&lt;br&gt;
3D Tracking attempts to &quot;solve&quot; or derive spatial relationships between points you tracked in 2D space and approximate the distance and parallax between these points in 3D space through the use of complex photogrammetry algorithms. The end result is an approximation of the motion of the camera used to film the scene that can be exported to a 3D application or 2D application to aid in the process of matchmoving.  Shots which track most effectively tend to be those with a constant camera path and a significant amount of parallax.&lt;br&gt;
Many compositing applications can handle 3D tracking data with varying degrees of proficiency.

'''Anise''' is both a [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] and a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]].

As a spice, the dried seeds are ground for use. Anise smells somewhat like [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]], [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] and [[Cookbook:Liquorice|liquorice]]. Anise is a strong spice, so use it sparingly. A few seeds, perhaps 10 at most, will improve the flavor of [[Cookbook:Pizza Sauce|pizza sauce]].

As a vegetable, the stalks are used. A typical use would be [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]].

The finely divided leaves can also be used to flavor a dish.

==Introduction==

===What is Bash?===

'''[[w:Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]''' is a &quot;Unix shell&quot;: a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. It is widely available, being the default shell on many GNU/Linux distributions and on Mac OS X; and ports exist for many other systems. It was created in the late 1980s by a programmer named Brian Fox, working for the Free Software Foundation. It was intended as a free-software alternative to the Bourne shell (in fact, its name is an acronym for &quot;Bourne-again shell&quot;), and it incorporates all features of that shell, as well as new features such as integer arithmetic and in-process [[Regular Expressions]](&lt;tt&gt;man re_format&lt;/tt&gt;).

===What is shell scripting?===

In addition to the interactive mode, where the user types one command at a time, with immediate execution and feedback, Bash (like many other shells) also has the ability to run an entire script of commands, known as a &quot;Bash shell script&quot; (or &quot;Bash script&quot; or &quot;shell script&quot; or just &quot;script&quot;). A script might contain just a very simple list of commands — or even just a single command — or it might contain functions, loops, conditional constructs, and all the other hallmarks of imperative programming. In effect, a Bash shell script is a computer program written in the Bash programming language.

Shell scripting is the art of creating and maintaining such scripts.

Shell scripts can be called from the interactive command-line described above; or, they can be called from other parts of the system. One script might be set to run when the system boots up; another might be set to run every weekday at 2:30 AM; another might run whenever a user logs into the system.

Shell scripts are commonly used for many system administration tasks, such as performing disk backups, evaluating system logs, and so on. They are also commonly used as installation scripts for complex programs. They are particularly suited to all of these because they ''allow'' complexity without ''requiring'' it: if a script just needs to run two external programs, then it can be a two-line script, and if it needs all the power and decision-making ability of a Turing-complete imperative programming language, then it can have that as well.

===How to read this book===

'''(1) It's ideal to practice BASH while reading '''

You will probably find this book most useful if you have a Bash command-line open in another window as you are going through it. You may want to try out some of the examples; but more important is to try things out that ''aren't'' just copied from the book. If you think something probably works a certain way, test out your expectations! Except where noted otherwise, the examples in this book do not require any special privileges or permissions, and do not require any software aside from Bash itself and very common utilities that are generally found on any system where Bash is. (If you are on a Windows system, and don't have SSH access to a GNU/Linux or Unix system, you will probably find it easiest to make use of this book if you are using something like Cygwin, which has not only Bash but also many other common utilities, than if you are using a Bash port for Windows that includes ''only'' Bash. If you have Cygwin, just make sure that the directory containing those utilities — likely something like &lt;tt&gt;C:\Cygwin\bin&lt;/tt&gt; — is listed in your Windows path.)

'''(2) Try consulting documentation for unknown commands'''

When you are experimenting, you will likely find it helpful to consult the documentation for various commands. For commands that are built into Bash, you can use the built-in &lt;tt&gt;help&lt;/tt&gt; command; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;help echo&lt;/source&gt; will &quot;print&quot; (that is, display) information about the built-in &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; command. For external programs, it is likely that their manual pages are installed on your system, in which case you can view them via the &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;manual&quot;) command; for example, for information about the &lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;copy&quot;) command, you can type &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;man cp&lt;/source&gt;. Additionally, most programs, when run with the argument &lt;tt&gt;--help&lt;/tt&gt;, will print some help information; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;cp --help&lt;/source&gt; gives almost as much information as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;man cp&lt;/source&gt;. (With many programs, however, the &lt;tt&gt;--help&lt;/tt&gt; approach does not give anywhere near as much information as the &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; approach.)

'''(3) Warning against blindly entering commands'''

A word of caution: this book is part of a wiki, which means that anyone may have edited it. It is possible — unlikely, but possible — that someone has added an &quot;example&quot; that is actually malicious code, or inserted malicious code into an existing example. Trust your instincts; if an example seems suspicious to you, if the surrounding text doesn't adequately explain what it does, if it doesn't seem to match the description in the surrounding text, then ''don't run it''. And even if it's clear that an example is non-malicious, it's a good idea to run all of your experiments using an account that has no special privileges or permissions on the system, so you don't (say) accidentally delete something important. Bash is a very powerful systems administration tool, which sometimes means it's a powerful way to accidentally cripple your system!

If you are completely new to Bash, or if you have some experience with the Bash command-line but are completely new to programming, you will probably find this book most useful if you begin at the beginning, and work your way through in linear order. If the topic of any section is completely familiar to you, you might want to skim it quickly for possible surprises, rather than skipping it completely; after all, you may not know what you may not know.

If you already have some Bash experience and some programming experience, you can probably skim the entire first half of the book, focusing only on examples that show Bash syntax you aren't already familiar with. That done, you should be in a good position to get the most out of the second half of the book.

If you already have a lot of Bash shell-scripting experience, this may not be the book for you; you will probably learn some things, but not as much as you would learn from the Bash Reference Manual on the Free Software Foundation's web-site, or simply from reading the entirety of &lt;tt&gt;man bash&lt;/tt&gt;. (But this being a wiki, you are invited to share the fruits of your experience!) This book is not a comprehensive reference manual; it focuses on techniques that are either widely used or widely useful, and mostly assumes a typical setup rather than exhaustively documenting all the unusual features that can affect the behavior of a command.

===A few notes on terminology===

The language of Bash commands is a Turing-complete programming language, meaning that if it is even theoretically possible for a given computation to be performed, then it is theoretically possible to perform it in Bash. Furthermore, from a practical standpoint, it is possible to do some very sophisticated things in Bash, and people often do. Nonetheless, it is usually described as a &quot;shell-scripting language&quot; (or similar) rather than a &quot;programming language&quot;, and the programs written in it are usually referred to as &quot;Bash shell scripts&quot; (or similar) rather than &quot;Bash programs&quot;. We will follow that convention here, preferring '''script''' for a Bash script and '''program''' only when referring to external programs that might be invoked from a Bash script.

We will also often use the term '''utility'''. This term is somewhat subjective, and usage varies, but it typically describes an external program that requires no human interaction and is intended to work well with other programs. All utilities are programs, so we will use the terms somewhat interchangeably. The extreme opposite of a &quot;utility&quot; is an '''application'''; that term is also subjective, with variable usage, but it typically describes an external program that has a relatively complex graphical user interface (GUI) and is not intended to work well with other programs. Since applications, by their nature, are not generally called from Bash scripts, we will have less occasion to use that term. Many programs are neither &quot;utilities&quot; nor &quot;applications&quot;, and some programs have elements both of utilities and of applications.

Of the various elements of a Bash script, some are typically called '''commands''', while others are typically called '''statements'''. We will observe this distinction here, but you need not overly concern yourself with it. Normally &quot;command&quot; is used in reference to invocations of external programs, of Bash built-ins such as &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; that resemble external programs, of shell functions (which we will see below), and so on. Normally &quot;statement&quot; is used in reference to instances of Bash programming constructs such as &lt;tt&gt;if … then … else … fi&lt;/tt&gt; or variable assignment (which we will see shortly). Perhaps confusingly, '''command''' is also used in reference to any Bash built-in, even if a use of that built-in would result in a &quot;statement&quot; rather than a &quot;command&quot;; for example, &quot;an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement&quot; is a statement that uses &quot;the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; command&quot;. If this distinction seems too fine, do not worry; in context, it should always be sufficiently clear what is meant by one term or the other.

===Some notes on your shell===
====Shell version====
This textbook provides information for those commonly-available versions of Bash, as of July 2014, this should be Bash version 4. Using an earlier version of bash will make you fail to try some of the features out.

The bash, version 3.2, included in OS X is quite important to mention. A really noticeable change for some users may be the missing &lt;tt&gt;-e&lt;/tt&gt; option which enables interpretation of backslash escapes, an important feature for color printing. Although this can be done using a workaround (e.g. using &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; instead), this can be quite inconvenient.

Consider getting the source from http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/ and compile one.

* Bash 4.3.18 for OS X 10.8+, built by [[User:Arthur200000|Arthur200000]]: [http://pan.baidu.com/s/1c0xlkFu Baidu Download Link]. Read ''KNOWN_ISSUES'' before you download. Just look for '下载', it means 'Download'.
====bashrc====
The &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; file determines the behavior of interactive shells, and having it properly configured can make life easier.

Most GNU/Linux distros has the &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; file. Use your favourite text editor to explore it.

In most cases, there is also a global &lt;tt&gt;bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; file, usually located at &lt;tt&gt;/etc/bashrc&lt;/tt&gt;. Try changing it, if you are root.
If you don't know what to do, take a look at those &lt;tt&gt;bashrc&lt;/tt&gt;s:
* [http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html Advanced Bash Scripting:Sample Bashrc]
* [https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/BASH_PS1_MISC A Modified version of The BLFS /etc/bashrc]
==Some introductory examples==

Let's start with a simple &quot;hello world&quot; program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
echo 'Hello, world!'
&lt;/source&gt;

We can either type this directly at the Bash prompt, or else save this as a file (say, &lt;tt&gt;hello_world.sh&lt;/tt&gt;) and run it by typing &lt;tt&gt;bash hello_world.sh&lt;/tt&gt; at the Bash prompt. (Later we will see some more sophisticated ways to create and run a Bash script file.) In either case, it will print &lt;tt&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/tt&gt;:

 $ &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;echo 'Hello, world!'&lt;/source&gt;
 Hello, world!

Here we have used the &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; symbol to indicate the Bash prompt: after &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;, the rest of the line shows the command that we typed, and the following line shows the output of the command.

Here is a slightly more complex script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
if [[ -e readme.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'The file &quot;readme.txt&quot; exists.'
else
  echo 'The file &quot;readme.txt&quot; does not exist.'
fi
&lt;/source&gt;

This script tests whether there exists a file named &lt;tt&gt;readme.txt&lt;/tt&gt; in the current directory, and uses an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement to control, based on that test, which commands are run. It, too, could be typed directly at the prompt — any script can — but in this case that is not likely to be useful.

Both of the above are entirely &quot;within Bash&quot;, in that they do not require Bash to run any external programs. (The commands &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;if … then … else … fi&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; -e … ]]&lt;/tt&gt; are all built-in commands, implemented by Bash itself.) But, being a shell-scripting language, a large part of Bash's purpose is to run external programs. The following script demonstrates this ability:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
if [[ -e config.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'The file &quot;config.txt&quot; already exists. Comparing with default . . .'
  diff -u config-default.txt config.txt &gt; config-diff.txt
  echo 'A diff has been written to &quot;config-diff.txt&quot;.'
else
  echo 'The file &quot;config.txt&quot; does not exist. Copying default . . .'
  cp config-default.txt config.txt
  echo '. . . done.'
fi
&lt;/source&gt;

Here &lt;tt&gt;diff&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;/tt&gt; are two common utility programs that, while not part of Bash, are found on most systems that have Bash. The above script assumes the presence of a default configuration file named &lt;tt&gt;config-default.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and checks for the presence of a configuration file named &lt;tt&gt;config.txt&lt;/tt&gt;. If &lt;tt&gt;config.txt&lt;/tt&gt; exists, then the script uses the external program &lt;tt&gt;diff&lt;/tt&gt; to produce a &quot;diff&quot; (a report of the differences between, in this case, two files), so that the user can see what non-default configurations are in place. If &lt;tt&gt;config.txt&lt;/tt&gt; does not exist, then the script uses the external program &lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;copy&quot;) to copy the default configuration file to &lt;tt&gt;config.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.

As you can see, the external programs are run using the same sort of syntax as the built-in commands; they're both just &quot;commands&quot;.

The above version of this script is very &quot;verbose&quot;, in that it generates a great deal of output. A more typical script would likely not include the &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; commands, since users are unlikely to need this level of information. In that case, we might use the &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; notation to include comments that are completely ignored by Bash, and do not appear to the user. Such comments are simply informative notes for someone reading the script itself:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
if [[ -e config.txt ]] ; then
  # if config.txt exists:
  diff -u config-default.txt config.txt &gt; config-diff.txt # see what's changed
else
  # if config.txt does not exist:
  cp config-default.txt config.txt # take the default
fi
&lt;/source&gt;

But the above is simply for demonstration's sake. In reality, a script this simple does not require any comments at all.

==Simple commands==

A ''simple command'' consists of a sequence of ''words'' separated by spaces or tabs. The first word is taken to be the name of a command, and the remaining words are passed as ''arguments'' to the command. We have already seen a number of examples of simple commands; here are some more:

* &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;cd ..&lt;/source&gt;
** This command uses &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;change directory&quot;; a built-in command for navigating through the filesystem) to navigate &quot;up&quot; one directory.
** The notation &lt;tt&gt;..&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;parent directory&quot;. For example, &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/../baz.txt&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;/foo/baz.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.
* &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt&lt;/source&gt;
** Assuming the program &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;remove&quot;) is installed, this command deletes the files &lt;tt&gt;foo.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bar.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;baz.txt&lt;/tt&gt; in the current directory.
** Bash finds the program &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; by searching through a configurable list of directories for a file named &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; that is executable (as determined by its file-permissions).
* &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;/foo/bar/baz bip.txt&lt;/source&gt;
** This command runs the program located at &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt;, passing &lt;tt&gt;bip.txt&lt;/tt&gt; as the sole argument.
** &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt; must be executable (as determined by its file-permissions).
** '''Warning: Please ensure that there is NO SPACE between the forward slash and any files following it.''' e.g. assuming the &quot;foo&quot; folder exists in the &quot;root&quot; directory, then executing the following command: rm / foo will destroy your computer if performed with &quot;sudo&quot; access. You have been warned. If you don't understand the preceding, don't worry about it for the moment.
** If &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt; is a text-file rather than a binary program, and its first line begins with &lt;tt&gt;#!&lt;/tt&gt;, then the remainder of that line determines the ''interpreter'' to use to run the file. For example, if the first line of &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/tt&gt;, then the above command is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;/bin/bash /foo/bar/baz bip.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.

That example with &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar/baz&lt;/tt&gt; bears special note, since it illustrates how you can create a Bash-script that can be run like an ordinary program: just include &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/tt&gt; as the first line of the script (assuming that that is where Bash is located on your system; if not, adjust as needed), and make sure the script has the right file-permissions to be readable and executable. For the remainder of this book, all examples of complete shell scripts will begin with the line &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Quoting===

We saw above that the command &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm foo.txt bar.txt baz.txt&lt;/source&gt; removes three separate files: &lt;tt&gt;foo.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bar.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;baz.txt&lt;/tt&gt;. This happens because Bash splits the command into four separate words based on whitespace, and three of those words become arguments to the program &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt;. But what if we need to delete a file whose name contains a space?

{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|In Unix and GNU/Linux distributions, file names can contain spaces, tabs, newlines, and even control characters.}}

Bash offers several ''quoting mechanisms'' that are useful for this case; the most commonly used are single-quotes &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; and double-quotes &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Either of these commands will delete a file named &lt;tt&gt;this file.txt&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm 'this file.txt'&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm &quot;this file.txt&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

Within the quotation marks, the space character loses its special meaning as a word-separator. Normally we wrap an entire word in quotation marks, as above, but in fact, only the space itself actually needs to be enclosed; &lt;tt&gt;this' 'file.txt&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;this&quot; &quot;file.txt&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;'this file.txt'&lt;/tt&gt;.

Another commonly-used quoting mechanism is the backslash &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt;, but it works slightly differently; it quotes (or &quot;escapes&quot;) just one character. This command, therefore, is equivalent to the above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm this\ file.txt&lt;/source&gt;

In all of these cases, the quoting characters themselves are not passed in to the program. (This is called ''quote removal''.) As a result, &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; has no way of knowing whether it was invoked — for example — as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm foo.txt&lt;/source&gt; or as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm 'foo.txt'&lt;/source&gt;.

===Filename expansion and tilde expansion===

Bash supports a number of special notations, known as ''expansions'', for passing commonly-used types of arguments to programs.

One of these is ''filename expansion'', where a ''pattern'' such as &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt; is replaced with the names of all files matching that pattern. For example, if the current directory contains the files &lt;tt&gt;foo.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bar.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;this file.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;something.else&lt;/tt&gt;, then this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo *.txt&lt;/source&gt;

is equivalent to this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo 'bar.txt' 'foo.txt' 'this file.txt'&lt;/source&gt;

Here the asterisk &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;zero or more characters&quot;; there are a few other special pattern characters (such as the question mark &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;, which means &quot;exactly one character&quot;), and some other pattern-matching rules, but this use of &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; is by far the most common use of patterns.

Filename expansion is not necessarily limited to files in the current directory. For example, if we want to list all files matching &lt;tt&gt;t*.sh&lt;/tt&gt; inside the directory &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/tt&gt;, we can write this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo /usr/bin/t*.sh&lt;/source&gt;

which may expand to something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo /usr/bin/test.sh /usr/bin/time.sh&lt;/source&gt;

If no files match a specified pattern, then no substitution happens; for example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo asfasefasef*avzxv&lt;/source&gt;

will most likely just print &lt;tt&gt;asfasefasef*avzxv&lt;/tt&gt;.

{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|1=If any filenames begin with a hyphen &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;, then filename-expansion can sometimes have surprising consequences. For example, if a directory contains two files, named &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;tmp.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;cat *&lt;/tt&gt; expands to &lt;tt&gt;cat -n tmp.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; will interpret &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt; as an option rather than a filename; instead, it is better to write &lt;tt&gt;cat ./*&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;cat -- *&lt;/tt&gt;, which expands to &lt;tt&gt;cat ./-n ./tmp.txt&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;cat -- -n tmp.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, removing this problem.}}

What happens if we have an actual file named &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt; that we want to refer to? (Yes, filenames can contain asterisks!) Then we can use either of the quoting styles we saw above. Either of these:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat '*.txt'&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat &quot;*.txt&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

will print the actual file &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, rather than printing all files whose names end in &lt;tt&gt;.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.

Another, similar expansion is ''tilde expansion''. Tilde expansion has a lot of features, but the main one is this: in a word that consists solely of a tilde &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt;, or in a word that begins with &lt;tt&gt;~/&lt;/tt&gt; (tilde-slash), the tilde is replaced with the full path to the current user's home directory. For example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo ~/*.txt&lt;/source&gt;

will print out the names of all files named &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt; in the current user's home directory.

===Brace expansion===

Similar to filename expansion is ''brace expansion'', which is a compact way of representing multiple similar arguments. The following four commands are equivalent:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{1,2,3,4,5}.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{1..5..1}.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{1..5}.txt&lt;/source&gt;

The first command lists each argument explicitly. The other three commands all use brace expansion to express the arguments more tersely: in the second command, all the possibilities &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; through &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; are given, separated by commas; in the third command, a numeric sequence is given (&quot;from 1 to 5, incrementing by 1&quot;); and the fourth command is the same as the third, but leaves the &lt;tt&gt;..1&lt;/tt&gt; implicit.

We can also list the files in the opposite order:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file5.txt file4.txt file3.txt file2.txt file1.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{5,4,3,2,1}.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{5..1..-1}.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file{5..1}.txt&lt;/source&gt;

with the default increment size being &lt;tt&gt;-1&lt;/tt&gt; when the endpoint of the sequence is less than the starting-point.

Since in Bash, the first word of a command is the program that is run, we could also write the command this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;{ls,file{1..5}.txt}&lt;/source&gt;

but obviously that is not conducive to readability. (The same sort of thing, incidentally, can be done with filename expansion.)

Brace expansion, like filename expansion, can be disabled by any of the quoting mechanisms; &lt;tt&gt;'{'&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;{&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;\{&lt;/tt&gt; produces an actual literal curly-brace.

===Redirecting output===

Bash allows a command's standard output (file-descriptor 1) to be sent to a file, rather than to the console. For example, the common utility program &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; writes out a file to standard output; if we redirect its standard output to a file, then we have the effect of copying the contents of one file into another file.

If we want to overwrite the destination file with the command's output, we use this notation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &gt; output.txt&lt;/source&gt;

If we want to keep the existing contents of the destination file as they are, and merely append the command's output to the end, we use this notation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &gt;&gt; output.txt&lt;/source&gt;

However, not everything that a program writes to the console goes through standard output. Many programs use standard error (file-descriptor 2) for error-messages and some types of &quot;logging&quot; or &quot;side-channel&quot; messages. If we wish for standard error to be combined with standard output, we can use either of these notations:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &amp;&gt;&gt; output.txt&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &gt;&gt; output.txt 2&gt;&amp;1&lt;/source&gt;

If we wish for standard error to be appended to a different file from standard output, we use this notation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt &gt;&gt; output.txt 2&gt;&gt; error.txt&lt;/source&gt;

In fact, we can redirect ''only'' standard error, while leaving standard output alone:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt 2&gt;&gt; error.txt&lt;/source&gt;

In all of the above examples, we can replace &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; if we want to overwrite the redirect-target rather than append to it.

Later we will see some more advanced things that we can do with output redirection.

===Redirecting input===

Just as Bash allows a program's output to be sent into a file, it also allows a program's input to be taken from a file. For example, the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; copies its input to its output, such that this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat &lt; input.txt&lt;/source&gt;

will write out the contents of &lt;tt&gt;input.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to the console.

As we have already seen, this trick is not needed in this case, since &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; can instead be instructed to copy a specified file to its output; the above command is simply equivalent to this one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt&lt;/source&gt;

This is the rule rather than the exception; most common Unix utilities that can take input from the console also have the built-in functionality to take their input from a file instead. In fact, many, including &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt;, can take input from multiple files, making them even more flexible than the above. The following command prints out &lt;tt&gt;input1.txt&lt;/tt&gt; followed by &lt;tt&gt;input2.txt&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input1.txt input2.txt&lt;/source&gt;

Nonetheless, input redirection has its uses, some of which we will see later on.

===A preview of pipelines===

Although they are outside the scope of this chapter, we now have the background needed for a first look at pipelines. A ''pipeline'' is a series of commands separated by the pipe character &lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;. Each command is run at the same time, and the output of each command is used as the input to the next command.

For example, consider this pipeline:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat input.txt | grep foo | grep -v bar&lt;/source&gt;

We have already seen the &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; utility; &lt;tt&gt;cat input.txt&lt;/tt&gt; simply writes the file &lt;tt&gt;input.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to its standard output. The program &lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;/tt&gt; is a common Unix utility that filters (&quot;greps&quot;, in Unix parlance) based on a pattern; for example, the command &lt;tt&gt;grep foo&lt;/tt&gt; will print to its standard output any lines of input that contain the string &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt;. The command &lt;tt&gt;grep -v bar&lt;/tt&gt; uses the &lt;tt&gt;-v&lt;/tt&gt; option to invert the pattern; the command prints any lines of input that ''don't'' contain the string &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;. Since the input to each command is the output of the previous command, the net result is that the pipeline prints any lines of &lt;tt&gt;input.txt&lt;/tt&gt; that ''do'' contain &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt; and do ''not'' contain &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Variables==

In a Bash script, there are a few different kinds of ''parameters'' that can hold ''values''. One major kind of parameter is ''variables'': named parameters. If you are familiar with almost any other imperative programming language (such as C, BASIC, Fortran, or Pascal), then you are already familiar with variables. The following simple script uses the variable &lt;tt&gt;location&lt;/tt&gt; to hold the value &lt;tt&gt;world&lt;/tt&gt;, and prints out a &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
location=world               # store &quot;world&quot; in the variable &quot;location&quot;
echo &quot;Hello, ${location}!&quot;   # print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, the string &lt;tt&gt;${location}&lt;/tt&gt; in the second line was replaced by &lt;tt&gt;world&lt;/tt&gt; before that command was run. This substitution is known as ''variable expansion'', and it's more flexible than you might suspect. For example, it can even hold the name of the command to run:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
cmd_to_run=echo                   # store &quot;echo&quot; in the variable &quot;cmd_to_run&quot;
&quot;${cmd_to_run}&quot; 'Hello, world!'   # print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

In both of the above examples, we have used the notation &lt;tt&gt;${&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt; to perform the variable expansion. The briefer notation &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; − without curly brackets − would have the same effect in these cases. Sometimes the curly brackets are necessary (for example, &lt;tt&gt;${foo}bar&lt;/tt&gt; cannot be written as &lt;tt&gt;$foobar&lt;/tt&gt;, because the latter would be interpreted as &lt;tt&gt;${foobar}&lt;/tt&gt;), but they can usually be omitted, and real-world scripts usually omit them.

Of course, needless to say, the above are not very realistic examples; they demonstrate only ''how'' to use variables, not ''why'' or ''when'' to use them. If you are familiar with other imperative programming languages, then it is probably already obvious to you why and when you would use variables; if not, then this should become clear as you read through this book and see examples that use them more realistically.

You may have noticed that we have used double-quotes &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, rather than single-quotes &lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt;, for character-strings that include variable expansions. This is because single-quotes prevent variable expansion; a command such as &lt;tt&gt;echo '${location}'&lt;/tt&gt; will print the actual string &lt;tt&gt;${location}&lt;/tt&gt;, rather than printing the value of a variable named &lt;tt&gt;location&lt;/tt&gt;.

It is generally a good idea to wrap variable expansions in double-quotes, because otherwise the results of variable expansion will undergo filename expansion, as well as ''word splitting'' (whereby white-space is used to separate the words that make up a command). For example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
foo='a  b*'    # store &quot;a  b*&quot; in the variable &quot;foo&quot;
echo $foo
&lt;/source&gt;

is liable to print something like &lt;tt&gt;a ba.txt bd.sh&lt;/tt&gt;, which is probably not what we want. Real-world scripts frequently do not include double-quotes except when they are clearly necessary, but this practice sometimes leads to confusing bugs.

{{Bash Shell Scripting/tip|It is generally a good idea to wrap variable expansions in double-quotes; for example, use &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$var&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;$var&lt;/tt&gt;.}}

A number of variables have special significance. For example, the variable &lt;tt&gt;PATH&lt;/tt&gt; determines the list of directories that Bash should search in when trying to run an external program; if it is set to &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin:/bin&lt;/tt&gt;, then the command &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;cp src.txt dst.txt&lt;/source&gt; will look to run either &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin/cp&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;/bin/cp&lt;/tt&gt;. The variable &lt;tt&gt;HOME&lt;/tt&gt; is pre-initialized to the current user's home directory, and it determines the behavior of tilde-expansion. For example, if a script sets &lt;tt&gt;HOME=/foo&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;echo ~/bar&lt;/source&gt; will print &lt;tt&gt;/foo/bar&lt;/tt&gt;. (This will not actually change the user's home directory, however.)

==Positional parameters==

In most of the above commands — both those that run a built-in command, and those than use an external program — we have supplied one or more ''arguments'', that indicate what the command should operate on. For example, when we invoke the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;mkdir&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;make directory&quot;) to create a new directory, we invoke it with a command like this one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;mkdir tmp&lt;/source&gt;

where &lt;tt&gt;tmp&lt;/tt&gt; is the name of the new directory to create.

And as we have seen, Bash scripts are themselves programs that can be run. So it goes without saying that they, too, can take arguments. These arguments are available to the program as its ''positional parameters''. Earlier, we saw that variables are one kind of parameter. Positional parameters are very similar, but are identified by numbers rather than by names. For example, &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;${1}&lt;/tt&gt;) expands to the script's first argument. So, suppose we want to create a simple script called &lt;tt&gt;mkfile.sh&lt;/tt&gt; that takes two arguments — a filename, and a line of text — and creates the specified file with the specified text. We can write it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash         
echo &quot;$2&quot; &gt; &quot;$1&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

(Notice the line &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; at the very beginning of the file; we covered that line at [[Bash Shell Scripting#Simple commands|Basic commands]]. When you run this code, that line wil guarantee that it will be interpreted by the Bash shell, even if you are running from another program or your computer has a non-standard configuration.)

and (after making it executable by running &lt;tt&gt;chmod +x mkfile.sh&lt;/tt&gt;) we can run it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./mkfile.sh file-to-create.txt 'line to put in file'&lt;/source&gt;

We can also refer to all of the arguments at once by using &lt;tt&gt;$@&lt;/tt&gt;, which expands to ''all'' of the positional parameters, in order. When wrapped in double-quotes, as &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$@&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, each argument becomes a separate word. (Note: the alternative &lt;tt&gt;$*&lt;/tt&gt; is perhaps more common, but &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$*&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; becomes a single word, with spaces in between the original parameters. &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$@&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is almost always preferable to either &lt;tt&gt;$@&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;$*&lt;/tt&gt;, which allow an argument to become split into multiple words if it contains whitespace, and to &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$*&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, which combines multiple arguments into a single word.) This is often useful in concert with the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;shift&lt;/tt&gt;, which removes the first positional parameter, such that &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt; becomes &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$3&lt;/tt&gt; becomes &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt;, and so on. For example, if we change &lt;tt&gt;mkfile.sh&lt;/tt&gt; as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
file=&quot;$1&quot; # save the first argument as &quot;$file&quot;
shift # drop the first argument from &quot;$@&quot;
echo &quot;$@&quot; &gt; &quot;$file&quot; # write the remaining arguments to &quot;$file&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

then we can run it as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;./mkfile.sh file-to-create.txt line to put in file&lt;/source&gt;

and all of the arguments, except the filename, will be written to the file.

The number of positional parameters is available as &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt;; for example, if &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;, then the positional parameters are &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;$3&lt;/tt&gt;.

Note that positional parameters beyond &lt;tt&gt;$9&lt;/tt&gt; require the curly braces; should you need to refer to the tenth argument, for example, you must write &lt;tt&gt;${10}&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;$10&lt;/tt&gt;. (The latter would be interpreted as &lt;tt&gt;${1}0&lt;/tt&gt;.) That said, it is not usually a good idea to have so many arguments with specific meanings, since it is hard for users to keep track of them. If you find yourself specifically referring to your script's tenth argument, it may be worth re-evaluating your approach.

If you have some experience with Bash, or with Unix utilities, you've most likely noticed that many commands can take various &quot;options&quot;, indicated with a leading hyphen &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;, in addition to their regular arguments. For example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm &quot;$filename&quot;&lt;/source&gt; deletes an individual file, while &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm -r &quot;$dirname&quot;&lt;/source&gt; deletes an entire directory with all of its contents. (The &lt;tt&gt;-r&lt;/tt&gt; is short for &quot;recursive&quot;: the command &quot;recursively&quot; deletes an entire tree of directories.) These options are actually just arguments. In &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm &quot;$filename&quot;&lt;/source&gt;, there is just one argument (&lt;tt&gt;&quot;$filename&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;), while in &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm -r &quot;$dirname&quot;&lt;/source&gt; there are two (&lt;tt&gt;-r&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$dirname&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;). In a sense, there is nothing inherently special about these arguments, but this notation for options is so widespread as to be considered standard; many or most of the Bash built-in commands can accept various options, and later we will see various techniques for supporting options as arguments to our Bash scripts.

==Exit status==

When a process completes, it returns a small non-negative integer value, called its ''exit status'' or its ''return status'', to the operating system. By convention, it returns zero if it completed successfully, and a positive number if it failed with an error. (This approach allows multiple different errors to be distinguished by using different positive numbers.) A Bash script can obey this convention by using the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt;. The following command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;exit 4&lt;/source&gt;

terminates the shell script, returning an exit status of four, indicating some sort of error. When no exit status is specified (either because &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; is run with no argument, or because the script ends without calling &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt;), the script returns the exit status of the last command it ran.

One way that exit statuses are used is with the Bash operators &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;and&quot;) and &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;or&quot;). If two commands are separated by &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt;, then the command on the left is run first, and the command on the right is only run if the first command succeeds. Conversely, if they are separated by &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt;, then the command on the right is only run if the command on the left fails.

For example, suppose we want to delete the file &lt;tt&gt;file.txt&lt;/tt&gt; and recreate it as a blank file. We can delete it using the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;remove&quot;), and recreate it using the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;touch&lt;/tt&gt;; so, we might write this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm file.txt
touch file.txt&lt;/source&gt;

But really, if &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; fails, we don't want to run &lt;tt&gt;touch&lt;/tt&gt;: we don't want to recreate the file if we failed to delete it to begin with. So, we can write this instead:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rm file.txt &amp;&amp; touch file.txt&lt;/source&gt;

This is the same as before, except that it won't try to run &lt;tt&gt;touch&lt;/tt&gt; unless &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; has succeeded.

A third Boolean-like operator, &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;not&quot;), inverts the exit status of a command. For example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;! rm file.txt&lt;/source&gt;

is equivalent to &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;rm file.txt&lt;/source&gt;, except that it will indicate success if &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; indicates failure, and vice versa. (This is not usually useful when exit statuses are used as actual exit statuses, indicating success or failure, but we will soon see some extended uses of exit statuses where a &quot;not&quot; operation is more useful.)

The exit status of a command is (briefly) available as &lt;tt&gt;$?&lt;/tt&gt;. This can be useful when it is necessary to distinguish between multiple different failure statuses; for example, the &lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;/tt&gt; command (which searches for lines in a file that match a specified pattern) returns 0 if it finds a match, 1 if it finds no matches, and 2 if a genuine error occurs.

==Conditional expressions and &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements==

Very often, we want to run a certain command only if a certain condition is met. For example, we might want to run the command &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;cp source.txt destination.txt&lt;/source&gt; (&quot;copy the file &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to location &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;) if, and only if, &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; exists. We can do that like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source.txt ]] ; then
  cp source.txt destination.txt
fi&lt;/source&gt;

The above uses two built-in commands:

* The construction &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; ''condition'' ]]&lt;/tt&gt; returns an exit status of zero (success) if &lt;tt&gt;''condition''&lt;/tt&gt; is true, and a nonzero exit status (failure) if &lt;tt&gt;''condition''&lt;/tt&gt; is false. In our case, &lt;tt&gt;''condition''&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;-e source.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, which is true if and only if there exists a file named &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.
* The construction &lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;tt&gt;if ''command1'' ; then&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''command2''&lt;br/&gt;fi&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; first runs &lt;tt&gt;''command1''&lt;/tt&gt;; if that completes successfully (that is, if its exit status is zero), then it goes on to run &lt;tt&gt;''command2''&lt;/tt&gt;.

In other words, the above is equivalent to this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

[[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; cp source.txt destination.txt&lt;/source&gt;

except that it is more clear (and more flexible, in ways that we will see shortly).

In general, Bash treats a successful exit status (zero) as meaning &quot;true&quot; and a failed exit status (nonzero) as meaning &quot;false&quot;, and vice versa. For example, the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; always &quot;succeeds&quot; (returns zero), and the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt; always &quot;fails&quot; (returns one).

{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|In many commonly-used programming languages, zero is considered &quot;false&quot; and nonzero values are considered &quot;true&quot;. Even in Bash, this is true within arithmetic expressions (which we'll see later on). But at the level of commands, the reverse is true: an exit status of zero means &quot;successful&quot; or &quot;true&quot; and a nonzero exit status means &quot;failure&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.}}
{{-}}
{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|Be sure to include spaces before and after &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#x5B;&amp;#x5B;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#x5D;&amp;#x5D;&lt;/tt&gt; so that Bash recognizes them as separate words. Something like &lt;tt&gt;if&amp;#x5B;&amp;#x5B;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#x5B;&amp;#x5B;-e&lt;/tt&gt; will not work properly.}}

===&lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements===

&lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements are more flexible than we saw above; we can actually specify ''multiple'' commands to run if the test-command succeeds, and in addition, we can use an &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; clause to specify one or more commands to run instead if the test-command ''fails'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'source.txt exists; copying to destination.txt.'
  cp source.txt destination.txt
else
  echo 'source.txt does not exist; exiting.'
  exit 1 # terminate the script with a nonzero exit status (failure)
fi&lt;/source&gt;

The commands can even include other &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements; that is, one &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement can be &quot;nested&quot; inside another. In this example, an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement is nested inside another &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement's &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; clause:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source1.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'source1.txt exists; copying to destination.txt.'
  cp source1.txt destination.txt
else
  if [[ -e source2.txt ]] ; then
    echo 'source1.txt does not exist, but source2.txt does.'
    echo 'Copying source2.txt to destination.txt.'
    cp source2.txt destination.txt
  else
    echo 'Neither source1.txt nor source2.txt exists; exiting.'
    exit 1 # terminate the script with a nonzero exit status (failure)
  fi
fi&lt;/source&gt;

This particular pattern — an &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; clause that contains exactly one &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement, representing a fallback-test — is so common that Bash provides a convenient shorthand notation for it, using &lt;tt&gt;elif&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;else-if&quot;) clauses. The above example can be written this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source1.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'source1.txt exists; copying to destination.txt.'
  cp source1.txt destination.txt
elif [[ -e source2.txt ]] ; then
  echo 'source1.txt does not exist, but source2.txt does.'
  echo 'Copying source2.txt to destination.txt.'
  cp source2.txt destination.txt
else
  echo 'Neither source1.txt nor source2.txt exists; exiting.'
  exit 1 # terminate the script with a nonzero exit status (failure)
fi&lt;/source&gt;

A single &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement can have any number of &lt;tt&gt;elif&lt;/tt&gt; clauses, representing any number of fallback conditions.

Lastly, sometimes we want to run a command if a condition is false, without there being any corresponding command to run if the condition is true. For this we can use the built-in &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; operator, which precedes a command; when the command returns zero (success or &quot;true&quot;), the &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; operator changes returns a nonzero value (failure or &quot;false&quot;), and vice versa. For example, the following statement will copy &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt; unless &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt; already exists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if ! [[ -e destination.txt ]] ; then
  cp source.txt destination.txt
fi&lt;/source&gt;

All those examples above are examples using the &lt;tt&gt;test&lt;/tt&gt; expressions. Actually &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; just runs everything in &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt; when the command in the statement returns 0:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# First build a function that simply returns the code given
returns() { return $*; }
# Then use read to prompt user to try it out, read `help read' if you have forgotten this.
read -p &quot;Exit code:&quot; exit
if (returns $exit)
  then echo &quot;true, $?&quot;
  else echo &quot;false, $?&quot;
fi
&lt;/source&gt;
So the behavior of &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; is quite like the logical 'and' &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; and 'or' &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt; in some ways:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# Let's reuse the returns function.
returns() { return $*; }
read -p &quot;Exit code:&quot; exit

# if (        and                 ) else            fi
returns $exit &amp;&amp; echo &quot;true, $?&quot; || echo &quot;false, $?&quot;

# The REAL equivalent, false is like `returns 1'
# Of course you can use the returns $exit instead of false.
# (returns $exit ||(echo &quot;false, $?&quot;; false)) &amp;&amp; echo &quot;true, $?&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Always notice that misuse of those logical operands may lead to errors. In the case above, everything was fine because plain &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; is almost always successful.

===Conditional expressions===

In addition to the &lt;tt&gt;-e ''file''&lt;/tt&gt; condition used above, which is true if &lt;tt&gt;''file''&lt;/tt&gt; exists, there are quite a few kinds of conditions supported by Bash's &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; … ]]&lt;/tt&gt; notation. Five of the most commonly used are:

; &lt;tt&gt;-d ''file''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''file''&lt;/tt&gt; exists and is a directory.
; &lt;tt&gt;-f ''file''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''file''&lt;/tt&gt; exists and is a regular file.
; &lt;tt&gt;''string1'' = ''string2''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''string1''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;''string2''&lt;/tt&gt; are equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;''string'' == ''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''string''&lt;/tt&gt; matches &lt;tt&gt;''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt;. (&lt;tt&gt;''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt; has the same form as a pattern in filename expansion; for example, unquoted &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;zero or more characters&quot;.)
; &lt;tt&gt;''string'' != ''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt; : True if &lt;tt&gt;''string''&lt;/tt&gt; does ''not'' match &lt;tt&gt;''pattern''&lt;/tt&gt;.

In the last three types of tests, the value on the left is usually a variable expansion; for example, &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; &quot;$var&quot; = 'value' ]]&lt;/tt&gt; returns a successful exit status if the variable named &lt;tt&gt;var&lt;/tt&gt; contains the value &lt;tt&gt;value&lt;/tt&gt;.

The above conditions just scratch the surface; there are many more conditions that examine files, a few more conditions that examine strings, several conditions for examining integer values, and a few other conditions that don't belong to any of these groups.

One common use for equality tests is to see if the first argument to a script (&lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;) is a special option. For example, consider our &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement above that tries to copy &lt;tt&gt;source1.txt&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;source2.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt;. The above version is very &quot;verbose&quot;: it generates a lot of output. Usually we don't want a script to generate quite so much output; but we may want users to be able to request the output, for example by passing in &lt;tt&gt;--verbose&lt;/tt&gt; as the first argument. The following script is equivalent to the above &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements, but it only prints output if the first argument is &lt;tt&gt;--verbose&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ &quot;$1&quot; == --verbose ]] ; then
  verbose_mode=TRUE
  shift # remove the option from $@
else
  verbose_mode=FALSE
fi

if [[ -e source1.txt ]] ; then
  if [[ &quot;$verbose_mode&quot; == TRUE ]] ; then
    echo 'source1.txt exists; copying to destination.txt.'
  fi
  cp source1.txt destination.txt
elif [[ -e source2.txt ]] ; then
  if [[ &quot;$verbose_mode&quot; == TRUE ]] ; then
    echo 'source1.txt does not exist, but source2.txt does.'
    echo 'Copying source2.txt to destination.txt.'
  fi
  cp source2.txt destination.txt
else
  if [[ &quot;$verbose_mode&quot; == TRUE ]] ; then
    echo 'Neither source1.txt nor source2.txt exists; exiting.'
  fi
  exit 1 # terminate the script with a nonzero exit status (failure)
fi&lt;/source&gt;

Later, when we learn about shell functions, we will find a more compact way to express this. (In fact, even with what we already know, there is a more compact way to express this: rather than setting &lt;tt&gt;$verbose_mode&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;TRUE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;FALSE&lt;/tt&gt;, we can set &lt;tt&gt;$echo_if_verbose_mode&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;, where the colon &lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt; is a Bash built-in command that does nothing. We can then replace all uses of &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$echo_if_verbose_mode&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. A command such as &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$echo_if_verbose_mode&quot; ''message''&lt;/tt&gt; would then become &lt;tt&gt;echo ''message''&lt;/tt&gt;, printing &lt;tt&gt;''message''&lt;/tt&gt;, if verbose-mode is turned on, but would become &lt;tt&gt;: ''message''&lt;/tt&gt;, doing nothing, if verbose-mode is turned off. However, that approach might be more confusing than is really worthwhile for such a simple purpose.)

===Combining conditions===

To combine multiple conditions with &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot;, or to invert a condition with &quot;not&quot;, we can use the general Bash notations we've already seen. Consider this example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -e destination.txt ]] ; then
  # source.txt exists, destination.txt does not exist; perform the copy:
  cp source.txt destination.txt
fi&lt;/source&gt;

The test-command &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; uses the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; operators that we saw above that work based on exit status. &lt;tt&gt;[[&lt;nowiki/&gt; ''condition'' ]]&lt;/tt&gt; is &quot;successful&quot; if &lt;tt&gt;''condition''&lt;/tt&gt; is true, which means that &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; will only run &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; if &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; exists. Furthermore, &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; inverts the exit status of &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt;, so that &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; is &quot;successful&quot; if and only if &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt; ''doesn't'' exist. The end result is that &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ -e source.txt ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -e destination.txt ]]&lt;/source&gt; is &quot;successful&quot; — &quot;true&quot; — if and only if &lt;tt&gt;source.txt&lt;/tt&gt; ''does'' exist and &lt;tt&gt;destination.txt&lt;/tt&gt; does ''not'' exist.

The construction &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ … ]]&lt;/source&gt; actually has built-in internal support for these operators, such that we can also write the above this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

if [[ -e source.txt &amp;&amp; ! -e destination.txt ]] ; then
  # source.txt exists, destination.txt does not exist; perform the copy:
  cp source.txt destination.txt
fi&lt;/source&gt;

but the general-purpose notations are often more clear; and of course, they can be used with any test-command, not just the &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;[[ … ]]&lt;/source&gt; construction.

===Notes on readability===

The &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements in the above examples are formatted to make them easy for humans to read and understand. This is important, not only for examples in a book, but also for scripts in the real world. Specifically, the above examples follow these conventions:

* The commands within an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement are indented by a consistent amount (by two spaces, as it happens). This indentation is irrelevant to Bash — it ignores whitespace at the beginning of a line — but is very important to human programmers. Without it, it is hard to see where an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement begins and ends, or even to see that there is an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement. Consistent indentation becomes even more important when there are &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements nested within &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements (or other control structures, of various kinds that we will see).
* The semicolon character &lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt; is used before &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt;. This is a special operator for separating commands; it is mostly equivalent to a line-break, though there are some differences (for example, a comment always runs from &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; to the end of a line, never from &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt;). We could write &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt; at the beginning of a new line, and that is perfectly fine, but it's good for a single script to be consistent one way or the other; using a single, consistent appearance for ordinary constructs makes it easier to notice unusual constructs. In the real world, programmers usually put &lt;tt&gt;; then&lt;/tt&gt; at the end of the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;elif&lt;/tt&gt; line, so we have followed that convention here.
* A newline is used after &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt; and after &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt;. These newlines are optional — they need not be (and cannot be) replaced with semicolons — but they promote readability by visually accentuating the structure of the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
* Regular commands are separated by newlines, never semicolons. This is a general convention, not specific to &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statements. Putting each command on its own line makes it easier for someone to &quot;skim&quot; the script and see roughly what it is doing.

These exact conventions are not particularly important, but it is good to follow consistent and readable conventions for formatting your code. When a fellow programmer looks at your code — or when you look at your code two months after writing it — inconsistent or illogical formatting can make it very difficult to understand what is going on.

==Loops==

Often we want to run the same sequence of commands, over and over again, with slight differences. For example, suppose that we want to take all files named &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt; and rename them to &lt;tt&gt;*.txt.bak&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;backup&quot;). We can use file-expansion to get the list of files named &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt;, but how do we use that list? There's no obvious command containing, say, &lt;tt&gt;'foo.txt' 'bar.txt' 'baz.txt'&lt;/tt&gt;, that would perform the three moves we need. What we need is a &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;for file in *.txt ; do
  mv &quot;$file&quot; &quot;$file.bak&quot;
done&lt;/source&gt;

The above takes the variable &lt;tt&gt;file&lt;/tt&gt;, and assigns it in turn to each word in the expansion of &lt;tt&gt;*.txt&lt;/tt&gt;. Each time, it runs the body of the loop. In other words, it is equivalent to the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;file='foo.txt'
mv &quot;$file&quot; &quot;$file.bak&quot;
file='bar.txt'
mv &quot;$file&quot; &quot;$file.bak&quot;
file='baz.txt'
mv &quot;$file&quot; &quot;$file.bak&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

There is nothing special here about filename expansion; we can use the same approach to iterate over any other argument-list, such as the integers 1 through 20 (using brace expansion):

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;for i in {1..20} ; do
  echo &quot;$i&quot;
done&lt;/source&gt;

or the positional parameters &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$@&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;for arg in &quot;$@&quot; ; do
  echo &quot;$arg&quot;
done&lt;/source&gt;

In fact, that specific case is so common that Bash provides the equivalent shorthand &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;for arg ; do&lt;/source&gt;, with &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;in &quot;$@&quot;&lt;/source&gt; being implied. (But it's probably better to use the explicit form anyway.)

Another kind of loop is the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop. It is similar to an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement, except that it loops repeatedly as long as its test-command continues to be successful. For example, suppose that we need to wait until the file &lt;tt&gt;wait.txt&lt;/tt&gt; is deleted. One approach is to &quot;sleep&quot; for a few seconds, then &quot;wake up&quot; and see if it still exists. We can loop repeatedly in this fashion:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;while [[ -e wait.txt ]] ; do
  sleep 3 # &quot;sleep&quot; for three seconds
done&lt;/source&gt;

Conversely, we can use an &lt;tt&gt;until&lt;/tt&gt; loop to loop ''until'' a given command is successful; for example, the reverse of the above might be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;until [[ -e proceed.txt ]] ; do
  sleep 3 # &quot;sleep&quot; for three seconds
done&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, this is the same as combining &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;, but in some cases it may be more readable.
* Just like &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; judges &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt; in the same way. Try it out yourself.

==Shell functions==

A ''shell function'' is a special type of variable that is essentially a script-within-a-script. This feature allows us to group a sequence of commands into a single named command, which is particularly useful if the sequence of commands needs to be run from many places within the script. A shell function can even consist of just a single command; this may be useful if the command is particularly complicated, or if its significance would not immediately be obvious to a reader. (That is, shell functions can serve two purposes: they can save typing, and they can allow for more readable code by creating intuitively-named commands.) Consider the following script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
# Usage:     get_password VARNAME
# Asks the user for a password; saves it as $VARNAME.
# Returns a non-zero exit status if standard input is not a terminal, or if the
# &quot;read&quot; command returns a non-zero exit status.
get_password() {
  if [[ -t 0 ]] ; then
    read -r -p 'Password:' -s &quot;$1&quot; &amp;&amp; echo
  else
    return 1
  fi
}

get_password PASSWORD &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$PASSWORD&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The above script creates a shell function called &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; that asks the user to type a password, and stores the result in a specified variable. It then runs &lt;tt&gt;get_password PASSWORD&lt;/tt&gt; to store the password as &lt;tt&gt;$PASSWORD&lt;/tt&gt;; and lastly, if the call to &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; succeeded (as determined by its exit status), the retrieved password is printed to standard output (which is obviously not a realistic use; the goal here is simply to demonstrate the behavior of &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt;).

The function &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't do anything that couldn't be done without a shell function, but the result is much more readable. The function invokes the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;read&lt;/tt&gt; (which reads a line of user input and saves it in one or more variables) with several options that most Bash programmers will not be familiar with. (The &lt;tt&gt;-r&lt;/tt&gt; option disables a special meaning for the backslash character; the &lt;tt&gt;-p&lt;/tt&gt; option causes a specified prompt, in this case &lt;tt&gt;Password:&lt;/tt&gt;, to be displayed at the head of the line; and the &lt;tt&gt;-s&lt;/tt&gt; option prevents the password from being displayed as the user types it in. Since the &lt;tt&gt;-s&lt;/tt&gt; option also prevents the user's newline from being displayed, the &lt;tt&gt;echo&lt;/tt&gt; command supplies a newline.) Additionally, the function uses the conditional expression &lt;tt&gt;-t 0&lt;/tt&gt; to make sure that the script's input is coming from a terminal (a console), and not from a file or from another program that wouldn't know that a password is being requested. (This last feature is debatable; depending on the general functionality of the script, it may be better to accept a password from standard input regardless of its source, under the assumption that the source was designed with the script in mind.) The overall point is that giving sequence of commands a name — &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; — makes it much easier for a programmer to know what it does.

Within a shell function, the positional parameters (&lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$2&lt;/tt&gt;, and so on, as well as &lt;tt&gt;$@&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$*&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt;) refer to the arguments that the function was called with, ''not'' the arguments of the script that contains the function. If the latter are needed, then they need to be passed in explicitly to the function, using &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$@&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. (Even then, &lt;tt&gt;shift&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt; will only affect the positional parameters within the function, not those of the caller.)

A function call returns an exit status, just like a script (or almost any command). To explicitly specify an exit status, use the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; command, which terminates the function call and returns the specified exit status. (The &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; command cannot be used for this, because it would terminate the entire script, just as if it were called from outside a function.) If no exit status is specified, either because no argument is given to the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; command or because the end of the function is reached without having run a &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; command, then the function returns the exit status of the last command that was run.

Incidentally, either &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;( )&lt;/tt&gt; may be omitted from a function declaration, but at least one must be present. Instead of &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;function get_password ( )&lt;/source&gt;, many programmers write &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;get_password()&lt;/source&gt;. Similarly, the &lt;tt&gt;{ &amp;hellip; }&lt;/tt&gt; notation is not exactly required, and is not specific to functions; it is simply a notation for grouping a sequence of commands into a single compound command. The body of a function must be a compound command, such as a &lt;tt&gt;{ &amp;hellip; }&lt;/tt&gt; block or an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement; &lt;tt&gt;{ &amp;hellip; }&lt;/tt&gt; is the conventional choice, even when all it contains is a single compound command and so could theoretically be dispensed with.

==Subshells, environment variables, and scope==

{{Bash Shell Scripting/caution|Take your time with this section. These concepts are relatively straightforward once you understand them, but they are different in important ways from analogous concepts in other programming languages. Many programmers and systems administrators, including some who are experienced in Bash, find them counter-intuitive at first.}}

===Subshells===

In Bash, one or more commands can be wrapped in parentheses, causing those commands to be executed in a &quot;subshell&quot;. (There are also a few ways that subshells can be created implicitly; we will see those later.) A subshell receives a copy of the surrounding context's &quot;execution environment&quot;, which includes any variables, among other things; but any changes that the subshell makes to the execution environment are ''not'' copied back when the subshell completes. So, for example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

foo=bar
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'bar'

# subshell:
(
  echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'bar' - the subshell inherits its parents' variables
  baz=bip
  echo &quot;$baz&quot; # prints 'bip' - the subshell can create its own variables
  foo=foo
  echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'foo' - the subshell can modify inherited variables
)

echo &quot;$baz&quot; # prints nothing (just a newline) - the subshell's new variables are lost
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'bar' - the subshell's changes to old variables are lost
&lt;/source&gt;

prints this: &lt;pre&gt;bar&amp;#xA;bar&amp;#xA;bip&amp;#xA;foo&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;bar&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Bash Shell Scripting/tip|If you need to call a function that modifies one or more variables, but you don't actually want those variables to be modified, you can wrap the function call in parentheses, so it takes place in a subshell. This will &quot;isolate&quot; the modifications and prevent them from affecting the surrounding execution environment. (That said: when possible, it's better to write functions in such a way that this problem doesn't arise to begin with. As we'll see soon, the &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; keyword can help with this.)}}

The same is true of function definitions; just like a regular variable, a function defined within a subshell is not visible outside the subshell.

A subshell also delimits changes to other aspects of the execution environment; in particular, the &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;change directory&quot;) command only affects the subshell. So, for example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

cd /
pwd # prints '/'

# subshell:
(
  pwd # prints '/' - the subshell inherits the working directory
  cd home
  pwd # prints '/home' - the subshell can change the working directory
) # end of subshell

pwd # prints '/' - the subshell's changes to the working directory are lost
&lt;/source&gt;

prints this: &lt;pre&gt;/&amp;#xA;/&amp;#xA;/home&amp;#xA;/&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Bash Shell Scripting/tip|If your script needs to change the working directory before running a given command, it's a good idea to use a subshell if possible. Otherwise it can become hard to keep track of the working directory when reading a script. (Alternatively, the &lt;tt&gt;pushd&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;popd&lt;/tt&gt; built-in commands can be used to similar effect.)}}

An &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; statement within a subshell terminates only that subshell. For example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
( exit 0 ) &amp;&amp; echo 'subshell succeeded'
( exit 1 ) || echo 'subshell failed'
&lt;/source&gt;

prints this: &lt;pre&gt;subshell succeeded&amp;#xA;subshell failed&lt;/pre&gt;

Like in a script as a whole, &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; defaults to returning the exit status of the last-run command, and a subshell that does not have an explicit &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; statement will return the exit status of the last-run command.

===Environment variables===

We have already seen that, when a program is called, it receives a list of arguments that are explicitly listed on the command line. What we haven't mentioned is that it also receives a list of name-value pairs called &quot;environment variables&quot;. Different programming languages offer different ways for a program to access an environment variable; C programs can use &lt;tt&gt;getenv(&quot;&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt; (and/or accept them as a third argument to &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt;), Perl programs can use &lt;tt&gt;$ENV{'&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;'}&lt;/tt&gt;, Java programs can use &lt;tt&gt;System.getenv().get(&quot;&lt;var&gt;variable_name&lt;/var&gt;&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;, and so forth.

In Bash, environment variables are simply made into regular Bash variables. So, for example, the following script prints out the value of the &lt;tt&gt;HOME&lt;/tt&gt; environment variable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
echo &quot;$HOME&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

The reverse, however, is not true: regular Bash variables are not automatically made into environment variables. So, for example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
foo=bar
bash -c 'echo $foo'&lt;/source&gt;

will not print &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;, because the variable &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt; is not passed into the &lt;tt&gt;bash&lt;/tt&gt; command as an environment variable. (&lt;tt&gt;bash -c &lt;var&gt;script&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;arguments&amp;hellip;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; runs the one-line Bash script &lt;tt&gt;&lt;var&gt;script&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.)

To turn a regular Bash variable into an environment variable, we have to &quot;export&quot; it into the environment. The following script ''does'' print &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
export foo=bar
bash -c 'echo $foo'&lt;/source&gt;

Note that &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't just create an environment variable; it actually marks the Bash variable as an exported variable, and later assignments to the Bash variable will affect the environment variable as well. That effect is illustrated by this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
foo=bar
bash -c 'echo $foo' # prints nothing
export foo
bash -c 'echo $foo' # prints 'bar'
foo=baz
bash -c 'echo $foo' # prints 'baz'
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt; command can also be used to remove a variable from an environment, by including the &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt; option; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;export -n foo&lt;/source&gt; undoes the effect of &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;export foo&lt;/source&gt;. And multiple variables can be exported or unexported in a single command, such as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;export foo bar&lt;/source&gt; or &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;export -n foo bar&lt;/source&gt;.

It's important to note that environment variables are only ever passed ''into'' a command; they are never received ''back'' from a command. In this respect, they are similar to regular Bash variables and subshells. So, for example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
export foo=bar
bash -c 'foo=baz' # has no effect
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # print 'bar'
&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;; the change to &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; inside the one-line script doesn't affect the process that invoked it. (However, it ''would'' affect any scripts that were called in turn ''by'' that script.)

If a given environment variable is desired for just one command, the syntax &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;var=value command&lt;/source&gt; may be used, with the syntax of a variable assignment (or multiple variable assignments) preceding a command on the same line. (Note that, despite using the syntax of a variable assignment, this is very different from a normal Bash variable assignment, in that the variable is automatically exported into the environment, and in that it only exists for the one command. If you want avoid the confusion of similar syntax doing dissimilar things, you can use the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;env&lt;/tt&gt; for the same effect. That utility also makes it possible to ''remove'' an environment variable for one command — or even to remove ''all'' environment variables for one command.) If &lt;tt&gt;$var&lt;/tt&gt; already exists, and it's desired to include its actual value in the environment for just one command, that can be written as &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;var=&quot;$var&quot; command&lt;/source&gt;.

An aside: sometimes it's useful to put variable definitions — or function definitions — in one Bash script (say, &lt;tt&gt;header.sh&lt;/tt&gt;) that can be called by another Bash script (say, &lt;tt&gt;main.sh&lt;/tt&gt;). We can see that simply invoking that other Bash script, as &lt;tt&gt;./header.sh&lt;/tt&gt; or as &lt;tt&gt;bash ./header.sh&lt;/tt&gt;, will not work: the variable definitions in &lt;tt&gt;header.sh&lt;/tt&gt; would not be seen by &lt;tt&gt;main.sh&lt;/tt&gt;, not even if we &quot;exported&quot; those definitions. (This is a common point of confusion: &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt; exports variables into the environment so that other processes can see them, but they're still only seen by ''child'' processes, not by ''parents''.) However, we can use the Bash built-in command &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;dot&quot;) or &lt;tt&gt;source&lt;/tt&gt;, which runs an external file almost as though it were a shell function. If &lt;tt&gt;header.sh&lt;/tt&gt; looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;foo=bar
function baz ()
{
  echo &quot;$@&quot;
}&lt;/source&gt;

then this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
. header.sh
baz &quot;$foo&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

will print &lt;tt&gt;'bar'&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Scope===

We have now seen some of the vagaries of variable scope in Bash. To summarize what we've seen so far:

* Regular Bash variables are scoped to the shell that contains them, including any subshells in that shell.
** They are not visible to any child processes (that is, to external programs).
** If they are created inside a subshell, they are not visible to the parent shell.
** If they are modified inside a subshell, those modifications are not visible to the parent shell.
** This is also true of functions, which in many ways are similar to regular Bash variables.
* Function-calls are not inherently run in subshells.
** A variable modification within a function ''is'' generally visible to the code that calls the function.
* Bash variables that are exported into the environment are scoped to the shell that contains them, including any subshells ''or child processes'' in that shell.
** The &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command can be used to export a variable into the environment. (There are other ways as well, but this is the most common way.)
** They differ from non-exported variables only in that they are visible to child processes. In particular, they are still not visible to parent shells or parent processes.
* External Bash scripts, like other external programs, are run in child processes. The &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;source&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command can be used to run such a script internally, in which case it's not inherently run in a subshell.

To this we now add:

* Bash variables that are localized to a function-call are scoped to the function that contains them, including any functions called by that function.
** The &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command can be used to localize one or more variables to a function-call, using the syntax &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;local var1 var2&lt;/source&gt; or &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;local var1=val1 var2=val2&lt;/source&gt;. (There are other ways as well — for example, the &lt;tt&gt;declare&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command has the same effect — but this is probably the most common way.)
** They differ from non-localized variables only in that they disappear when their function-call ends. In particular, they still ''are'' visible to subshells and child function-calls. Furthermore, like non-localized variables, they can be exported into the environment so as to be seen by child processes as well.

In effect, using &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; to localize a variable to a function-call is like putting the function-call in a subshell, except that it only affects the one variable; other variables can still be left non-&quot;local&quot;.

{{Bash Shell Scripting/tip|A variable that is set inside a function (either via assignment, or via a for-loop or other built-in command) should be marked as &quot;local&quot; using the built-in command &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt;, so as to avoid accidentally affecting code outside the function, unless it is specifically desired that the caller see the new value.}}

It's important to note that, although local variables in Bash are very useful, they are not quite ''as'' local as local variables in most other programming languages, in that they're seen by child function-calls. For example, this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

foo=bar

function f1 ()
{
  echo &quot;$foo&quot;
}

function f2 ()
{
  local foo=baz
  f1 # prints 'baz'
}

f2&lt;/source&gt;

will actually print &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;. This is because the original value of &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; is hidden until &lt;tt&gt;f2&lt;/tt&gt; returns. (In programming language theory, a variable like &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; is said to be &quot;dynamically scoped&quot; rather than &quot;lexically scoped&quot;.)

One difference between &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; and a subshell is that whereas a subshell initially takes its variables from its parent shell, a statement like &lt;tt&gt;local foo&lt;/tt&gt; immediately hides the previous value of &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt;; that is, &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; becomes locally unset. If it is desired to initialize the local &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt; to the value of the existing &lt;tt&gt;$foo&lt;/tt&gt;, we must explicitly specify that, by using a statement like &lt;tt&gt;local foo=&quot;$foo&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.

When a function exits, variables regain the values they had before their &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; declarations (or they simply become unset, if they had previously been unset). Interestingly, this means that a script such as this one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

function f ()
{
  foo=baz
  local foo=bip
}

foo=bar
f
echo &quot;$foo&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

will actually print &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt;: the &lt;tt&gt;foo=baz&lt;/tt&gt; statement in the function takes effect before the variable is localized, so the value &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt; is what is restored when the function returns.

And since &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; is simply an executable command, a function can decide at execution-time whether to localize a given variable, so this script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

function f ()
{
  if [[ &quot;$1&quot; == 'yes' ]] ; then
    local foo
  fi
  foo=baz
}

foo=bar
f yes # modifies a localized $foo, so has no effect
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'bar'
f # modifies the non-localized $foo, setting it to 'baz'
echo &quot;$foo&quot; # prints 'baz'&lt;/source&gt;

will actually print &lt;pre&gt;bar&amp;#xA;baz&lt;/pre&gt;

==Pipelines and command substitution==

As we have seen, a command's return value, taken strictly, is just a small non-negative integer intended to indicate success or failure. Its real output is what it writes to the standard output stream. By default, text written to the standard output stream is printed to the terminal, but there are a few ways that it can be &quot;captured&quot; and used as the command's true return value.

===Pipelines===

When a sequence of commands are linked together in a pipeline, the output of each command is passed as input to the next. This is a very powerful technique, since it lets us combine a number of small utility programs to create something complex.

===Command substitution===

Command substitution is a bit like variable expansion, but it runs a command and captures its output, rather than simply retrieving the value of a variable. For example, consider our &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; example above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
 
function get_password ( )
# Usage:     get_password VARNAME
# Asks the user for a password; saves it as $VARNAME.
# Returns a non-zero exit status if standard input is not a terminal, or if the
# &quot;read&quot; command returns a non-zero exit status.
{
  if [[ -t 0 ]] ; then
    read -r -p 'Password:' -s &quot;$1&quot; &amp;&amp; echo
  else
    return 1
  fi
}
 
get_password PASSWORD &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$PASSWORD&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

There is really no reason that the caller should have to save the password in a variable. If &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; simply printed the password to its standard output, then the caller could use command substitution, and use it directly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
 
function get_password ( )
# Usage:     get_password
# Asks the user for a password; prints it for capture by calling code.
# Returns a non-zero exit status if standard input is not a terminal, or if
# standard output *is* a terminal, or if the &quot;read&quot; command returns a non-zero
# exit status.
{
  if [[ -t 0 ]] &amp;&amp; ! [[ -t 1 ]] ; then
    local PASSWORD
    read -r -p 'Password:' -s PASSWORD &amp;&amp; echo &gt;&amp;2
    echo &quot;$PASSWORD&quot;
  else
    return 1
  fi
}
 
echo &quot;$(get_password)&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

To evaluate &lt;tt&gt;&quot;$(get_password)&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, Bash runs the command &lt;tt&gt;get_password&lt;/tt&gt; in a subshell, capturing its standard output, and replaces &lt;tt&gt;$(get_password)&lt;/tt&gt; with the captured output.

In addition to the notation &lt;tt&gt;$(…)&lt;/tt&gt;, an older notation &lt;tt&gt;`…`&lt;/tt&gt; (using backquotes) is also supported, and still quite commonly found. The two notations have the same effect, but the syntax of &lt;tt&gt;`…`&lt;/tt&gt; is more restrictive, and in complex cases it can be trickier to get right.

Command substitution allows nesting; something like &lt;tt&gt;a &quot;$(b &quot;$(c)&quot;)&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is allowed. (It runs the command &lt;tt&gt;c&lt;/tt&gt;, using its output as an argument to &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt;, and using the output of ''that'' as an argument to &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;.)

A command substitution can actually contain a sequence of commands, rather than just one command. The output of all of these commands is captured. As we've seen previously, semicolons can be used instead of newlines to separate commands; that is particularly commonly done in command substitution. A command substitution can even contain variable assignments and function definitions (though, since the substituted commands run within a subshell, variable assignments and function definitions inside the command will not be seen outside it; they are only useful if they are used inside the substituted commands).

==Shell arithmetic==

Arithmetic expressions in Bash are closely modeled on those in C, so they are very similar to those in other C-derived languages, such as C++, Java, Perl, JavaScript, C#, and PHP. One major difference is that Bash only supports integer arithmetic (whole numbers), not floating-point arithmetic (decimals and fractions); something like &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;3 + 4&lt;/tt&gt; means what you'd expect (7), but something like &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;3.4 + 4.5&lt;/tt&gt; is a syntax error. Something like &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;13 / 5&lt;/tt&gt; is fine, but performs integer division, so evaluates to 2 rather than to 2.6.

===Arithmetic expansion===

Perhaps the most common way to use arithmetic expressions is in ''arithmetic expansion'', where the result of an arithmetic expression is used as an argument to a command. Arithmetic expansion is denoted &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;$(( … ))&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo $(( 3 + 4 * (5 - 1) ))&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;19&lt;/tt&gt;.

===expr (deprecated)===

Another way to use arithmetic expressions is using the Unix program &quot;expr&quot;, which was popular before Bash supported math.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sal.ksu.edu/faculty/tim/unix_sg/bash/math.html&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Arithmetic expansion, this command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo `expr 3 + 4 \* \( 5 - 1 \)`&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;19&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that using &quot;expr&quot; requires an escape character &quot;\&quot; before the multiplication operator &quot;*&quot; and parentheses. Further note the spaces between each operator symbol, including the parentheses.

===Numeric operators===

In addition to the familiar notations &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; (addition) and &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; (subtraction), arithmetic expressions also support &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; (multiplication), &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; (integer division, described above), &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; (the &quot;remainder&quot; operation; for example, 11 divided by 5 is 2 remainder 1, so &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;11 % 5&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;), and &lt;tt&gt;**&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;exponentiation&quot;, i.e. involution; for example, 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;16, so &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;2 ** 4&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;16&lt;/tt&gt;).

The operators &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;, in addition to their &quot;binary&quot; (two-operand) senses of &quot;addition&quot; and &quot;subtraction&quot;, have &quot;unary&quot; (one-operand) senses of &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot;. Unary &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; has basically no effect; unary &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; inverts the sign of its operand. For example, &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;-(3*4)&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates to &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;-12&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;-(-(3*4))&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Referring to variables===

Inside an arithmetic expression, shell variables can be referred to directly, without using variable expansion (that is, without the dollar sign &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;). For example, this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;i=2+3
echo $(( 7 * i ))&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;35&lt;/tt&gt;. (Note that &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; is evaluated first, producing 5, and then it's multiplied by 7. If we had written &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, mere string substitution would have been performed; &lt;tt&gt;7 * 2+3&lt;/tt&gt; equals 14 + 3, that is, 17 — probably not what we want.) 

The previous example shown using &quot;expr&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;i=`expr 2 + 3`
echo `expr 7 \* $i`&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;35&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Assigning to variables===

Shell variables can also be assigned to within an arithmetic expression. The notation for this is similar to that of regular variable assignment, but is ''much'' more flexible. For example, the previous example could be rewritten like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo $(( 7 * (i = 2 + 3) ))&lt;/source&gt;

except that this sets &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; rather than to &lt;tt&gt;2+3&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that, although arithmetic expansion looks a bit like command substitution, it is ''not'' executed in a subshell; this command actually sets &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;, and later commands can use the new value. (The parentheses inside the arithmetic expression are just the normal mathematical use of parentheses to control the order of operations.)

In addition to the simple assignment operator &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, Bash also supports compound operators such as &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;-=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;%=&lt;/tt&gt;, which perform an operation followed by an assignment. For example, &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( i *= 2 + 3 ))&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( i = i * (2 + 3) ))&lt;/tt&gt;. In each case, the expression as a whole evaluates to the new value of the variable; for example, if &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( j = i *= 3 ))&lt;/tt&gt; sets both &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt;.

Lastly, Bash supports increment and decrement operators. The increment operator &lt;tt&gt;++&lt;/tt&gt; increases a variable's value by 1; if it ''precedes'' the variable-name (as the &quot;pre-increment&quot; operator), then the expression evaluates to the variable's ''new'' value, and if it ''follows'' the variable-name (as the &quot;post-increment&quot; operator), then the expression evaluates to the variable's ''old'' value. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( j = ++i ))&lt;/tt&gt; sets both &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;, while &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( j = i++ ))&lt;/tt&gt; sets &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;. The decrement operator &lt;tt&gt;--&lt;/tt&gt; is exactly the same, except that it decreases the variable's value by 1. Pre-decrement and post-decrement are completely analogous to pre-increment and post-increment.

===Arithmetic expressions as their own commands===

A command can consist entirely of an arithmetic expression, using either of the following syntaxes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;(( i = 2 + 3 ))&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;let 'i = 2 + 3'&lt;/source&gt;

Either of these commands will set &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;. Both styles of command return an exit status of zero (&quot;successful&quot; or &quot;true&quot;) if the expression evaluates to a non-zero value, and an exit status of one (&quot;failure&quot; or &quot;false&quot;) if the expression evaluates to zero. For example, this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;(( 0 )) || echo zero
(( 1 )) &amp;&amp; echo non-zero&lt;/source&gt;

will print this:

 zero
 non-zero

The reason for this counterintuitive behavior is that in C, zero means &quot;false&quot; and non-zero values (especially one) mean &quot;true&quot;. Bash maintains that legacy inside arithmetic expressions, then translates it into the usual Bash convention at the end.

===The comma operator===

Arithmetic expressions can contain multiple sub-expressions separated by commas &lt;tt&gt;,&lt;/tt&gt;. The result of the last sub-expression becomes the overall value of the full expression. For example, this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo $(( i = 2 , j = 2 + i , i * j ))&lt;/source&gt;

sets &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;, sets &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;, and prints &lt;tt&gt;8&lt;/tt&gt;.

The &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt; built-in actually supports multiple expressions directly without needing a comma; therefore, the following three commands are equivalent:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;(( i = 2 , j = 2 + i , i * j ))&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;let 'i = 2 , j = 2 + i , i * j'&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;let 'i = 2' 'j = 2 + i' 'i * j'&lt;/source&gt;

===Comparison, Boolean, and conditional operators===

Arithmetic expressions support the integer comparison operators &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt; (meaning ≤), &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; (meaning ≥), &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; (meaning =)&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;!=&lt;/tt&gt; (meaning ≠). Each evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; for &quot;true&quot; or &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; for &quot;false&quot;.

They also support the Boolean operators &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;and&quot;), which evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; if either of its operands is zero, and to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise; &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;or&quot;), which evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; if either of its operands is nonzero, and to &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise; and &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;not&quot;), which evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; if its operand is zero, and to &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; otherwise. Aside from their use of zero to mean &quot;false&quot; and nonzero values to mean &quot;true&quot;, these are just like the operators &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; that we've seen outside arithmetic expressions. Like those operators, these are &quot;short-cutting&quot; operators that do not evaluate their second argument if their first argument is enough to determine a result. For example, &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;(( ( i = 0 ) &amp;&amp; ( j = 2 ) ))&lt;/tt&gt; will not evaluate the &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;( j = 2 )&lt;/tt&gt; part, and therefore will not set &lt;tt&gt;$j&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;, because the left operand of &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; is zero (&quot;false&quot;).

And they support the conditional operator &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;''b'' ? ''e1'' : ''e2''&lt;/tt&gt;. This operator evaluates &lt;tt&gt;''e1''&lt;/tt&gt;, and returns its result, if &lt;tt&gt;''b''&lt;/tt&gt; is nonzero; otherwise, it evaluates &lt;tt&gt;''e2''&lt;/tt&gt; and returns its result.

These operators can be combined in complex ways:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;(( i = ( ( a &gt; b &amp;&amp; c &lt; d + e || f == g + h ) ? j : k ) ))&lt;/source&gt;

===Arithmetic for-loops===

Above, we saw one style of for-loop, that looked like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print all integers 1 through 20:
for i in {1..20} ; do
  echo $i
done
&lt;/source&gt;

Bash also supports another style, modeled on the for-loops of C and related languages, using shell arithmetic:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print all integers 1 through 20:
for (( i = 1 ; i &lt;= 20 ; ++i )) ; do
  echo $i
done
&lt;/source&gt;

This for-loop uses three separate arithmetic expressions, separated by semicolons &lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt; (and not commas &lt;tt&gt;,&lt;/tt&gt; — these are completely separate expressions, not just sub-expressions). The first is an initialization expression, run before the loop begins. The second is a test expression; it is evaluated before every potential loop iteration (including the first), and if it evaluates to zero (&quot;false&quot;), then the loop exits. The third is a counting expression; it is evaluated at the end of each loop iteration. In other words, this for-loop is exactly equivalent to this while-loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print all integers 1 through 20:
(( i = 1 ))
while (( i &lt;= 20 )) ; do
  echo $i
  (( ++i ))
done
&lt;/source&gt;

but, once you get used to the syntax, it makes it more clear what is going on.

===Bitwise operators===

In addition to regular arithmetic and Boolean operators, Bash also offers &quot;bitwise&quot; operators, meaning operators that operate on integers ''qua'' bit-strings rather than ''qua'' integers. If you are not already familiar with this concept, you can safely ignore these.

Just as in C, the bitwise operators are &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise &quot;and&quot;), &lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise &quot;or&quot;), &lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise &quot;exclusive or&quot;), &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise &quot;not&quot;), &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise left-shift), and &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (bitwise right-shift), as well as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;=&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;|=&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;^=&lt;/tt&gt; (which include assignment, just like &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt;).

===Integer literals===

An integer constant is expressed as an ''integer literal''. We have already seen many of these; &lt;tt&gt;34&lt;/tt&gt;, for example, is an integer literal denoting the number 34. All of our examples have been ''decimal'' (base ten) integer literals, which is the default; but in fact, literals may be expressed in any base in the range 2&amp;ndash;64, using the notation &lt;tt&gt;&lt;var&gt;base&lt;/var&gt;#&lt;var&gt;value&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (with the base itself being expressed in base-ten). For example, this:

 '''echo''' $'''((''' 12 '''))'''        # use the default of base ten (decimal)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 10#12 '''))'''     # explicitly specify base ten (decimal)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 2#1100 '''))'''    # base two (binary)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 8#14 '''))'''      # base eight (octal)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 16#C '''))'''      # base sixteen (hexadecimal)
 '''echo''' $'''((''' 8 + 2#100 '''))''' # eight in base ten (decimal), plus four in base two (binary)

will print &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt; six times. (Note that this notation only affects how an integer literal is interpreted. The result of the arithmetic expansion is still expressed in base ten, regardless.)

For bases 11 through 36, the English letters A through Z are used for digit-values 10 through 35. This is not case-sensitive. For bases 37 through 64, however, it is specifically the lowercase English letters that are used for digit-values 10 through 35, with the uppercase letters being used for digit-values 36 through 61, the at-sign &lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt; being used for digit-value 62, and the underscore &lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt; being used for digit-value 63. For example, &lt;tt&gt;64#@A3&lt;/tt&gt; denotes 256259 (&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;62 × 64&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 36 × 64 + 3&lt;/span&gt;).

There are also two special notations: prefixing a literal with &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; indicates base-eight (octal), and prefixing it with &lt;tt&gt;0x&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;0X&lt;/tt&gt; indicates base-sixteen (hexadecimal). For example, &lt;tt&gt;030&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;8#30&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;0x6F&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;16#6F&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Integer variables===

A variable may be declared as an integer variable — that is, its &quot;integer attribute&quot; may be &quot;set&quot; — by using this syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;declare -i n&lt;/source&gt;

After running the above command, any subsequent assignments to &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; will automatically cause the right-hand side to be interpreted as an arithmetic expression. For example, this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
declare -i n
n='2 + 3 &gt; 4'
&lt;/source&gt;

is more or less equivalent to this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;n=$((2 + 3 &gt; 4))&lt;/source&gt;

except that the first version's &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;declare -i n&lt;/source&gt; will continue to affect later assignments as well.

In the first version, note the use of quotes around the right-hand side of the assignment. Had we written &lt;tt style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;n=2 + 3 &gt; 4&lt;/tt&gt;, it would have meant &quot;run the command &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; with the argument &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;, passing in the environment variable &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; set to &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;, and redirecting standard output into the file &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;; which is to say, setting a variable's integer attribute doesn't affect the overall parsing of assignment statements, but merely controls the interpretation of the value that is finally assigned to the variable.

We can &quot;unset&quot; a variable's integer attribute, turning off this behavior, by using the opposite command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;declare +i n&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;declare&lt;/tt&gt; built-in command has a number of other uses as well: there are a few other attributes a variable can have, and &lt;tt&gt;declare&lt;/tt&gt; has a few other features besides turning attributes on and off. In addition, a few of its properties bear note:

* As with &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt;, the argument can be a variable assignment; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;declare -i n=2+3&lt;/source&gt; sets &lt;tt&gt;$n&lt;/tt&gt;'s integer attribute and sets it to &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;.
* As with &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;export&lt;/tt&gt;, multiple variables (and/or assignments) can be specified at once; for example, &lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot; enclose=&quot;none&quot;&gt;declare -i m n&lt;/source&gt; sets both &lt;tt&gt;$m&lt;/tt&gt;'s integer attribute and &lt;tt&gt;$n&lt;/tt&gt;'s.
* When used inside a function, &lt;tt&gt;declare&lt;/tt&gt; implicitly localizes the variable (unless the variable is already local), which also has the effect of locally unsetting it (unless the assignment syntax is used).

===Non-integer arithmetic===

As mentioned above, Bash shell arithmetic only supports integer arithmetic. However, external programs can often be used to obtain similar functionality for non-integer values. In particular, the common Unix utility &lt;tt&gt;bc&lt;/tt&gt; is often used for this. The following command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo &quot;$(echo '3.4 + 2.2' | bc)&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

prints &lt;tt&gt;5.6&lt;/tt&gt;. Needless to say, since &lt;tt&gt;bc&lt;/tt&gt; is not so tightly integrated with Bash as shell arithmetic is, it is not as convenient; for example, something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print the powers of two, from 1 to 512:
for (( i = 1 ; i &lt; 1000 ; i *= 2 )) ; do
  echo $i
done
&lt;/source&gt;

would, to support non-integers, become something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# print the powers of one-half, from 1 to 1/512:
i=1
while [ $( echo &quot;$i &gt; 0.001&quot; | bc ) = 1 ] ; do
  echo $i
  i=$( echo &quot;scale = scale($i) + 1 ; $i / 2&quot; | bc )
done
&lt;/source&gt;

Part of this is because we can no longer use an arithmetic for-loop; part of it is because referring to variables and assigning to variables is trickier now (since &lt;tt&gt;bc&lt;/tt&gt; is not aware of the shell's variables, only its own, unrelated ones); and part of it is because &lt;tt&gt;bc&lt;/tt&gt; communicates with the shell only via input and output.

==External Programs==
Bash, as a shell, is actually a 'glue' language. It helps programs to cooperate with each other, and benefits from it. Always [[w:STFW|Search The Internet]] for what you want -- there are lots of command line utilities available.
===Using whiptail===
Whiptail is a program that allows shell scripts to display [[w:Dialog box|dialog boxes]] to the user for informational purposes, or to get input from the user in a friendly way. Whiptail is included by default on [[w:Debian|Debian]] and various other GNU/Linux distributions.
:From the [http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Dictionary/html/w.html GNU/Linux Dictionary]: whiptail is a &quot;dialog&quot; replacement using newt instead of ncurses.
:From its README: whiptail is designed to be drop-in compatible with dialog(1), but has less features: some dialog boxes are not implemented, such as tailbox, timebox, calendarbox, etc.

See [[Bash Shell Scripting/Whiptail]].

===Using [[AWK]]===
See [[AWK]] and &lt;tt&gt;man awk&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;man gawk&lt;/tt&gt;).
===Using [[sed]]===
See [[sed]] and &lt;tt&gt;man sed&lt;/tt&gt;.
===Using [[grep]]===
See [[grep]] and &lt;tt&gt;man grep&lt;/tt&gt;.
===Using man, info and help===
These three programs are where you can find help or reference from. &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; displays [[w:roff|roff]] manual pages, &lt;tt&gt;info&lt;/tt&gt; displays texinfo documentations, while &lt;tt&gt;help&lt;/tt&gt; displays builtin helps.

Appending &lt;tt&gt;--long-help&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;--help&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;--usage&lt;/tt&gt; to a command-line program may also gives you the usage information. Possible synonyms include &lt;tt&gt;-H&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;-h&lt;/tt&gt;.

Just try these out:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
man --help
man man

info --help
man info
info info

help help
&lt;/source&gt;
Pressing &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;info&lt;/tt&gt;'s interfaces can also give you some direction.

==Input/Output==
===The read built-in===
From &lt;tt&gt;help read&lt;/tt&gt;:

 read: read [-ers] [-a array] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]&lt;br /&gt;
     Read a line from the standard input and split it into fields.

read is great for both user inputs and reading standard inputs/piping.

An example of user input:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
# 'readline'  prompt          default    variable name
read -e -p &quot;Do this:&quot; -i &quot;destroy the ship&quot; command

echo &quot;$command&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
Or even simpler:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;pause() { read -n 1 -p &quot;Press any key to continue...&quot;; }&lt;/source&gt;

Hello-world level example of stdout operation:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;echo 'Hello, world!' | { read hello
echo $hello }&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;!-- Needs lots of imagination! --&gt;

Just be creative. For example, in many ways read can replace whiptail. Here is an example, extracted from [[User:Arthur200000|Arthur200000]]'s shell script:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
# USAGE
#   yes_or_no &quot;title&quot; &quot;text&quot; height width [&quot;yes text&quot;] [&quot;no text&quot;]
# INPUTS
#   $LINE = (y/n)          - If we should use line-based input style(read)
#   $_DEFAULT = (optional) - The default value for read
yes_or_no() {
  if [ &quot;$LINE&quot; == &quot;y&quot; ]; then
    echo -e &quot;\e[1m$1\e[0m&quot;
    echo '$2' | fold -w $4 -s
    while (read -e -n 1 -i &quot;$_DEFAULT&quot; -p &quot;Y for ${5:-Yes}, N for ${6:-No}[Y/N]&quot; _yesno); do
      case $_yesno in
        [yY]|1)
          return 0
          ;;
        [nN]|0)
          return 1
          ;;
        *)
          echo -e &quot;\e[1;31mINVALID INPUT\x21\e[0m&quot;
       esac
  else whiptail --title &quot;${1:-Huh?}&quot; --yesno &quot;${2:-Are you sure?}&quot; ${3:-10} ${4:-80}\
         --yes-button &quot;${5:-Yes}&quot; --no-button &quot;$6{:-No}&quot;; return $?
  fi
}

# USAGE
#   user_input var_name [&quot;title&quot;] [&quot;prompt&quot;] [height] [width]
# INPUTS
#   $LINE = (y/n)          - If we should use line-based input style(read)
#   $_DEFAULT = (optional) - The default value for read; defaults to nothing.
user_input(){
  if [ &quot;$LINE&quot; == &quot;y&quot; ]; then
    echo -e &quot;\e[1m${2:-Please Enter:}\e[0m&quot; | fold -w ${4:-80} -s
    read -e -i &quot;${_DEFAULT}&quot; -p &quot;${3:-&gt;}&quot; $1
  else eval &quot;$1&quot;=$(whiptail --title &quot;$2&quot; --inputbox &quot;$3&quot; 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3)
  fi
}
&lt;/source&gt;
===Shell redirection===
In shells, redirection is used for file I/O. The most common usage of is to redirect standard streams (stdin, stdout and stderr) to accept input from another program via piping, to save program output as a file, and to suppress program output by redirecting a stream to &lt;tt&gt;/dev/null&lt;/tt&gt;.


&lt;!-- Need powerful but easy to understand examples of this. --&gt;

===Piping===

==Index of symbols==

&lt;!-- TODO: Use wiki-text format. --&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Symbol&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Explanation&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logically negates the exit status of a pipeline. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;grep YES votes.txt&lt;/tt&gt; returns &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;! grep YES votes.txt&lt;/tt&gt; returns &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;, but is otherwise equivalent.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Also supported by the &lt;tt&gt;[ ... ]&lt;/tt&gt; builtin, and inside conditional expressions. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;[&amp;#x5B; -e file.txt &amp;#x5D;]&lt;/tt&gt; is true, then &lt;tt&gt;[&amp;#x5B; ! -e file.txt &amp;#x5D;]&lt;/tt&gt; is false.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Also supported in arithmetic expressions. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;$i&lt;/tt&gt; is nonzero, then &lt;tt&gt;$(( ! i ))&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;See also &lt;tt&gt;#!&lt;/tt&gt; below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&quot;&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quotes an argument (or part of an argument) so that it is not split by whitespace into multiple arguments, but without preventing parameter expansion and command substitution internally.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;See also &lt;tt&gt;$&quot;&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; below.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduces a comment (which continues to the end of the line). For example, the command &lt;tt&gt;foo bar baz # bip&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to the command &lt;tt&gt;foo bar baz&lt;/tt&gt;, because the comment &lt;tt&gt;# bip&lt;/tt&gt; is removed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Inside an arithmetic expression, an integer literal of the form &lt;tt&gt;&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;#&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is interpreted in base &lt;tt&gt;&lt;var&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, &lt;tt&gt;2#110110&lt;/tt&gt; is binary 110110, i.e. fifty-four.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;See also &lt;tt&gt;#!&lt;/tt&gt; below.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;See also &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt; below.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;#!&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Typically &quot;[[:w:en:Shebang (Unix)|shebang]]&quot; when read aloud.) Used at the very beginning of an executable script to specify the interpreter that should be used to run it. For example, if the first line of &lt;tt&gt;script.pl&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;script.pl&lt;/tt&gt; has executable permissions, then &lt;tt&gt;./script.pl&lt;/tt&gt; is roughly equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin/perl ./script.pl&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The first line of a Bash script is generally either &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/tt&gt;. (The former is generally considered preferable.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduces various types of expansions, notably parameter expansion (as in &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;var&gt;var&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;${&lt;var&gt;var&lt;/var&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt;), command substitution (as in &lt;tt&gt;$(&lt;var&gt;command&lt;/var&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;), and arithmetic expansion (as in &lt;tt&gt;$((&lt;var&gt;expression&lt;/var&gt;))&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$&quot;&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A variant of &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&amp;hellip;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; (see above) that supports locale-specific translation. (Unless you're writing scripts for use in multiple languages, e.g. both English and French, you don't need to worry about this.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of positional parameters (arguments to a script or function). For example, if a script is invoked as &lt;tt&gt;script.sh a b c&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt; will be &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;. Builtins that modify positional parameters, such as &lt;tt&gt;shift&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt;, affect &lt;tt&gt;$#&lt;/tt&gt; as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;The modulus operator. Returns the remainder resulting from integer division. E.g. 5%2 = 1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Ampersand. Commonly used to start a command in the background. E.g. firefox &amp;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;'&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Single quote. Used to quote text literally.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Open parenthesis. Used to denote the beginning of a subshell, among other things.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Closing parenthesis. Used to denote the &quot;EOF&quot; of a subshell.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Asterisk. Denotes multiplication. E.g. 5*2 = 10&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Plus. Denotes addition. E.g. 5+2 = 7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;,&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Comma. Used for separation. E.g. ls file{1,2,3}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hyphen. Denotes subtraction. E.g. 5-2 = 3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Full Stop.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Forward slash. Denotes integer division (e.g. 5/2=2) or part of a path (e.g. /home/user)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Colon.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Semicolon. Separates lines if no newline/EOL exists. E.g. echo hello; echo world&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Open angle bracket. Used for input redirection&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Equality sign. Used to assign variables and check equality&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Closing angle bracket. Used for output redirection.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Question Mark.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;At sign. Typically used as a variable containing all arguments passed to the environment as $@&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Open square bracket. Used as a more visually appealing alternative to test. E.g. if [ condition ] ; then etc&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Backslash. Most commonly used for escaping. E.g. rm file\ with\ a\ bunch\ of\ spaces.txt&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Closing square bracket. Closes test enclosures&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Caret.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Underscore.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;`&amp;hellip;`&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Triggers command substitution; equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;$(&amp;hellip;)&lt;/tt&gt;, but is somewhat more error-prone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;{&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Open curly brace. Used for specific variable expansion. E.g. (where var = &quot;hello &quot;) echo &quot;${var}world&quot; will print &quot;hello world&quot;, echo &quot;$varworld&quot; will generate an error, expecting a variable called varworld.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Pipe. Used for redirecting input to output. Specifically, it takes the output of the command on the left hand side, runs the program on the right side, and then passes the contents of the first command's output to the second, as if it were being typed from a keyboard. 'ls -l | grep Desk' is equivalent to running &quot;grep Desk&quot;, and then manually typing what ls -l would have output.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you've gotten the hang of 3D modeling, it's important to get some community feedback on your progress.  Don't be an idiot and skip this part, or you'll regret it later.  Basically this will help you track your progress and give you something that you'll be working on over a long term and something you'll be proud of.

* First, you need to come up with a project idea.  You can choose your own modeling project, or choose one from the list below.

* Second, you need to create a model of your idea.  Spend a couple of hours on it, and give it some details.

* Third, once you believe you've come far enough with the model, post it in the [http://blenderartists.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?s=b6a3696a3b803274bb7c1b49df9a22a2&amp;f=16 Works In Progress] forum on BlenderArtists.org(formerly elysiun.com) (you will have to create an account if you haven't already).  Post several screenshots of your model from within the Blender (note: creating screenshots is outside the scope of this wikibook, though see note lower down the page).  You can post whatever subject and message with your posting that you would like, or you can use this suggested subject and message:

:Subject: Beginning Modeling Final Project - &lt;project name&gt;

:: Please assist me with any feedback on my model, keeping in mind that I am an absolute beginner still.  I appreciate your help.

* Wait for feedback.  It usually comes very quickly.  If you have any questions about feedback that you are given, don't be afraid to ask your questions in the forum.

* When you and others that have viewed your work feel that you are ready, save your model in some place you can get back to easily.  You will continue working on this project once you've learned some new skills.

* Move on to the next page.

(BTW. in Windows and/or maybe other OS, to take a screenshot press 'PrtScn' (PrintScreen). It will copy the screen to clipboard for you to paste in your favourite graphics application. This may not work in other OSs but try anyway. You can also create Blender screenshot directly from Blender using menu '''File&gt;Dump 3DView...''' or '''File&gt;Dump Screen...''' )

(In linux under the KDE I use ksnapshot, check under the graphics tab and see if you have it.  If not it should be just a google search away :) gl and happy blendering)

(On Mac OS X, press Command (Apple) + Shift + 3 to do a full screen capture)

*List of ideas:
*A Computer and keyboard
*A fishing rod
*A train engine
*A skyscraper
*A robot
*A Tank (real or made up)
*An airplane
*A truck or car
*Household appliances
*A Weapon

:Hi, Ashl, nice to meet you on Wikibooks.
:Thank you for pointing out that ''I'm feeling lucky'' is in fact ''always'' the first site that Google finds, and is not always a random function, like I first thought it was. (Having used Google for five years and more, I should know better[!]). I suppose clicking it over and over is like banging your head against the brick wall - it's so ''obvious''! :-)
:I'm sure the new users will appreciate that; if they haven't discovered/explored for themselves, like this book ([[Windows XP for Beginners]]) encourages them to do.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ashl. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ashl~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

= Flow of ''Charge'' =

While the normal motion of &quot;free&quot; electrons in a conductor is random, with no particular direction or speed, electrons can be influenced to move in
a coordinated fashion through a conductive material. This motion of electrons is what we call ''electricity'', or 
''electric current''. This is in contrast to ''static'' electricity, which is an unmoving accumulation of electric charge.
Just like water flowing through the emptiness of a pipe, electrons are able to move between the atoms of a
conductor. The conductor may appear to be solid to our eyes, but any material composed of atoms is mostly empty space! The liquid-flow
analogy is so fitting that the motion of electrons through a conductor is often referred to as a &quot;flow.&quot; 

As each electron moves uniformly through a conductor, it pushes on the one ahead of it, such
that all the electrons move together as a group. The starting and stopping of electron flow through the length of a conductor is
virtually instantaneous from one end of a conductor to the other, even though the motion of each electron may be very slow. As an analogy
consider a tube filled end-to-end with marbles: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity1.png|fhsst_electricity1.png]]

The tube is full of marbles, just as a conductor is full of free electrons. If a single marble is suddenly inserted into this full tube on the left-hand side,
another marble will immediately try to exit the tube on the right. Even though each marble only traveled a short distance, the transfer
of motion through the tube is virtually instantaneous from the left end to the right end, no matter how long the tube is. With
electricity, the overall effect from one end of a conductor to the other effectively instantaneous. Each individual electron, though,
travels through the conductor at a ''much'' slower pace. 

If we want electrons to flow in a certain direction to a certain place, we must provide the proper path for them to move, just as a
plumber must install piping to get water to flow where he or she wants it to flow. ''Wires'' made of highly
conductive metals such as copper or aluminum are used to form this path.

This means that there can be electric current ''only'' where there exists a continuous path of conductive material (wire) providing a path for
electrons. In the marble analogy, marbles can flow into the left-hand side of the tube (and, consequently, through the
tube) only if the tube is open on the right-hand side for marbles to flow out. If the tube is blocked on the right-hand side,
the marbles will just &quot;pile up&quot; inside the tube, and marble &quot;flow&quot; will not occur. The same holds true for electric current: the
continuous flow of electrons requires there be an unbroken path. Let's look at a diagram to illustrate how this works: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity2.png|fhsst_electricity2.png]]

A thin, solid line (as shown above) is the conventional symbol for a continuous piece of wire. Since the wire is made of a conductive
material, such as copper, its constituent atoms have many free electrons which can easily move through the wire. However, there will
never be a continuous or uniform flow of electrons within this wire unless they have a place to come from and a place to go. Let's add an
hypothetical electron &quot;Source&quot; and &quot;Destination:&quot;  

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity3.png|fhsst_electricity3.png]]

Now, with the Electron Source pushing new electrons into the wire on the left-hand side, electron flow through the wire can occur (as
indicated by the arrows pointing from left to right). However, the flow will be interrupted if the conductive path formed by the wire is
broken: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity4.png|fhsst_electricity4.png]]

Air is an insulator, and an air gap separates the two pieces of wire, the path has now been broken, and
electrons cannot flow from Source to Destination. This is like cutting a water pipe in two and capping off the broken ends of the
pipe: water can't flow if there's no exit out of the pipe.  

If we were to take another piece of wire leading to the Destination and simply make physical contact with the wire leading to the Source,
we would once again have a continuous path for electrons to flow. The two dots in the diagram indicate physical (metal-to-metal) contact
between the wire pieces: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity5.png|fhsst_electricity5.png]]

Now, we have continuity from the Source, to the newly-made connection, down, to the right, and up to the Destination. Please take
note that the broken segment of wire on the right hand side has no electrons flowing through it, because it is no longer part of a
complete path from Source to Destination. 

It is interesting to note that no &quot;wear&quot; occurs within wires due to this electric current, unlike water-carrying pipes which are
eventually corroded and worn by prolonged flows. Electrons do encounter some degree of friction as they move and this
friction can generate heat in a conductor. This is a topic we'll discuss later.</text>

= Circuits =

In order for the Source-and-Destination scheme to work, both would have to have a huge reservoir of electrons in order to sustain a continuous flow! Using the marble-and-tube analogy, the marble source and marble destination buckets would have to be large reservoirs to contain enough marble capacity for a &quot;flow&quot; of marbles to be sustained. 

The answer to this paradox is found in the concept of a ''circuit'': a never-ending looped pathway for electrons. If we
take a wire, or many wires joined end-to-end, and loop it around so that it forms a continuous pathway ( a circle), we have the means to support a uniform flow of electrons without having to resort to huge reservoirs. 

Each electron advancing clockwise in this circuit pushes on the one in front of it, which pushes on the one in front of it, and so on, and so on, just like a hula-hoop filled with marbles. Now, we have the capability of supporting a continuous flow of electrons indefinitely without the need for reservoirs. All we need to maintain this flow is a continuous means of motivation for those electrons, which we'll address in the next section of this chapter. 

It must be realized that continuity is just as important in a circuit as it is in a straight piece of wire. Just as in the example with the straight piece of wire between the electron Source and Destination, any break in this circuit will prevent electrons from flowing through it

An important principle to realize here is that ''it doesn't matter where the break occurs''. Any discontinuity in the circuit
will prevent electron flow throughout the entire circuit.

A combination of batteries and conductors with other components is called an electric circuit or circuit. The word circuit implies that you return to your starting point and this is an important property of electric circuits. They must contain a closed loop before charge can flow.

The simplest possible circuit is a battery with a single conductor. Now how do we form a closed loop with these two
components? The battery has two terminals (connection points). One is called the positive terminal and one the negative. When we describe charge flowing we consider charges moving from the positive terminal of the battery around the conductor and back
into the battery at the negative terminal. As much charge flows out of the positive terminal as flows into the negative terminal so there is no build up of charge in the battery. The battery does work on the charges causing them to move round the circuit.

Now I keep talking about batteries and circuits but we need to draw these things to help keep the ideas clear in our minds. To do this we need to agree on how to draw things so that other people can understand what we are doing. We need a convention.

= Voltage and current =

As was previously mentioned, we need more than just a continuous path (circuit) before a continuous flow of electrons will occur: we also
need some means to push these electrons around the circuit. Just like marbles in a tube or water in a pipe, it takes some kind of
influencing force to initiate flow. With electrons, this force is the same force at work in static electricity: the force produced by an
imbalance of electric charge. 

The electric charge difference serves to store a certain amount of energy. This energy is 
not unlike the energy stored in a high reservoir of water that has been pumped from a lower-level pond: 

The influence of gravity on the water in the reservoir creates a force that attempts to move the water down to the lower level again. If a
suitable pipe is run from the reservoir back to the pond, water will flow under the influence of gravity down from the reservoir, through
the pipe: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity10.png|fhsst_electricity10.png]]

It takes energy to pump that water from the low-level pond to the high-level reservoir, and the movement of water through the piping
back down to its original level constitutes a releasing of energy stored from previous pumping. 

If the water is pumped to an even higher level, it will take even more energy to do so, thus more energy will be stored, and more energy
released if the water is allowed to flow through a pipe back down again: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity11.png|fhsst_electricity11.png]]

Electrons are not much different. If we &quot;pump&quot; electrons away from their normal &quot;levels,&quot; creating a condition where a force exists
as the electrons seek  to re-establish their former positions. The force attracting electrons back to their 
original positions is analogous to the force gravity exerts on water in the reservoir, trying to draw it down to its former level. 

Just as the pumping of water to a higher level results in energy being stored, &quot;pumping&quot; electrons to create an electric charge imbalance
results in a certain amount of energy being stored in that imbalance. And, just as providing a way for water to flow back down from the
heights of the reservoir results in a release of that stored energy, providing a way for electrons to flow back to their original &quot;levels&quot;
results in a release of stored energy. 

When the electrons are poised in that static condition (just like water sitting still, high in a reservoir), the energy stored there is
called ''potential energy'', because it has the possibility (potential) of release that has not been fully realized yet. 

This potential energy, stored in the form of an electric charge imbalance and capable of provoking electrons to flow through a
conductor, can be expressed as a term called ''voltage'', which technically is a measure of potential energy per unit charge of
electrons, or something a physicist would call ''specific potential energy''. Defined in the context of static electricity,
voltage is the measure of work required to move a unit charge from one location to another, against the force which tries to keep electric
charges balanced. In the context of electrical power sources, voltage is the amount of potential energy available (work to be done) per unit
charge, to move electrons through a conductor. 

Because voltage is an expression of potential energy, representing the possibility or potential for energy release as the electrons move from
one &quot;level&quot; to another, it is always referenced between two points. Consider the water reservoir analogy: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity12.png|fhsst_electricity12.png]]

Because of the difference in the height of the drop, there's potential for much more energy to be released from the reservoir through the
piping to location 2 than to location 1. The principle can be intuitively understood in dropping a rock: which results in a more
violent impact, a rock dropped from a height of one foot, or the same rock dropped from a height of one kilometre? Obviously, the drop of
greater height results in greater energy released (a more violent impact). We cannot assess the amount of stored energy in a water
reservoir simply by measuring the volume of water any more than we can predict the severity of a falling rock's impact simply from knowing
the weight of the rock: in both cases we must also consider how ''far'' these masses will drop from their initial height. The
amount of energy released by allowing a mass to drop is relative to the distance ''between'' its starting and ending points.
Likewise, the potential energy available for moving electrons from one point to another is relative to those two points. Therefore, voltage
is always expressed as a quantity ''between'' two points. Interestingly enough, the analogy of a mass potentially &quot;dropping&quot;
from one height to another is such an apt model that voltage between two points is sometimes called a ''voltage drop''. 

Voltage can be generated by means other than rubbing certain types of materials against each other. Chemical reactions, radiant energy, and
the influence of magnetism on conductors are a few ways in which voltage may be produced. Respective examples of these three sources
of voltage are batteries, solar cells, and generators (such as the &quot;alternator&quot; unit under the hood of your automobile). For now, we
won't go into detail as to how each of these voltage sources works - more important is that we understand how voltage sources can be
applied to create electron flow in a circuit. 

Let's take the symbol for a chemical battery and build a circuit step by step:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity13.png|fhsst_electricity13.png]]

Any source of voltage, including batteries, have two points for electrical contact. In this case, we have point 1 and point 2 in the
above diagram. The horizontal lines of varying length indicate that this is a battery, and they further indicate the direction which this
battery's voltage will try to push electrons through a circuit. The fact that the horizontal lines in the battery symbol appear separated
(and thus unable to serve as a path for electrons to move) is no cause for concern: in real life, those horizontal lines represent metallic
plates immersed in a liquid or semi-solid material that not only conducts electrons, but also generates the voltage to push them along
by interacting with the plates. 

Notice the little &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs to the immediate left of the battery symbol. The negative (-) end of the battery is always the end
with the shortest dash, and the positive (+) end of the battery is always the end with the longest dash. Since we have decided to call
electrons &quot;negatively&quot; charged (thanks, Ben!), the negative end of a battery is that end which tries to push electrons out of it.
Likewise, the positive end is that end which tries to attract electrons. 

With the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; ends of the battery not connected to anything, there will be voltage between those two points, but there will be no
flow of electrons through the battery, because there is no continuous path for the electrons to move. 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity14.png|fhsst_electricity14.png]]

The same principle holds true for the water reservoir and pump analogy: without a return pipe back to the pond, stored energy in the
reservoir cannot be released in the form of water flow. Once the reservoir is completely filled up, no flow can occur, no matter how
much pressure the pump may generate. There needs to be a complete path (circuit) for water to flow from the pond, to the reservoir, and
back to the pond in order for continuous flow to occur. 

We can provide such a path for the battery by connecting a piece of wire from one end of the battery to the other. Forming a circuit with
a loop of wire, we will initiate a continuous flow of electrons in a clockwise direction: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity15.png|fhsst_electricity15.png]]

So long as the battery continues to produce voltage and the continuity of the electrical path isn't broken, electrons will continue to flow
in the circuit. Following the metaphor of water moving through a pipe, this continuous, uniform flow of electrons through the circuit
is called a ''current''. So long as the voltage source keeps &quot;pushing&quot; in the same direction, the electron flow will continue to
move in the same direction in the circuit. This single-direction flow of electrons is called a ''Direct Current'', or DC. 

Because electric current is composed of individual electrons flowing in unison through a conductor by moving along and pushing on the
electrons ahead, just like marbles through a tube or water through a pipe, the amount of flow throughout a single circuit will be the same
at any point. If we were to monitor a cross-section of the wire in a single circuit, counting the electrons flowing by, we would notice the
exact same quantity per unit of time as in any other part of the circuit, regardless of conductor length or conductor diameter. 

If we break the circuit's continuity ''at any point'', the electric current will cease in the entire loop, and the full voltage
produced by the battery will be manifested across the break, between the wire ends that used to be connected: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity16.png|fhsst_electricity16.png]]

Notice the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs drawn at the ends of the break in the circuit, and how they correspond to the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs next to the
battery's terminals. These markers indicate the direction that the voltage attempts to push electron flow. Remember that voltage is
always relative between two points. Whether a point in a circuit gets labeled with a &quot;+&quot; or a &quot;-&quot; depends 
on the other point to which it is referenced. Take a look at the following circuit, where each corner of the loop is marked with a
number for reference: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity17.png|fhsst_electricity17.png]]

With the circuit's continuity broken between points 2 and 3, voltage dropped between points 2 and 3 is &quot;-&quot; for 
point 2 and &quot;+&quot; for point 3. 

Now let's see what happens if we connect points 2 and 3 back together again, but place a break in the circuit between points 3 and 4: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity18.png|fhsst_electricity18.png]]

With the break between 3 and 4, the voltage drop between those two points is &quot;+&quot; for 4 and &quot;-&quot; for 3. Take special
note of the fact that point 3's &quot;sign&quot; is opposite of that in the first example, where the break was between points 2 and 3 (where point
3 was labeled &quot;+&quot;). It is impossible for us to say that point 3 in this circuit will always be either &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;, because the sign is not
specific to a single point, but is always relative between two points!</text>

= Resistance =

The circuit in the previous section is not a very practical one. In fact, it can be quite dangerous to build (directly connecting the
poles of a voltage source together with a single piece of wire). The reason it is dangerous is because the magnitude of electric current
may be very large in such a ''short circuit'', and the release of energy very dramatic (usually in the form of heat). Usually, electric
circuits are constructed in such a way as to make practical use of that released energy, in as safe a manner as possible. 

One practical and popular use of electric current is for the operation of electric lighting. The simplest form of electric lamp is a tiny
metal &quot;filament&quot; inside of a clear glass bulb, which glows white-hot (&quot;incandesces&quot;) with heat energy when sufficient electric current
passes through it. Like the battery, it has two conductive connection points, one for electrons to enter and the other for electrons to
exit. 

As the electrons work their way through the thin metal filament of the lamp, they encounter more opposition to motion than they typically
would in a thick piece of wire. This opposition to electric current depends on the type of material, its cross-sectional area, and its
temperature. It is technically known as ''resistance''. (It can be said that conductors have low resistance and insulators have very
high resistance.) This resistance serves to limit the amount of current through the circuit with a given amount of voltage supplied by
the battery, as compared with the &quot;short circuit&quot; where we had nothing but a wire joining one end of the voltage source (battery) to the
other. 

When electrons move against the opposition of resistance, &quot;friction&quot; is generated. Just like mechanical friction, the friction produced by
electrons flowing against a resistance manifests itself in the form of heat. The concentrated resistance of a lamp's filament results in a
relatively large amount of heat energy dissipated at that filament. This heat energy is enough to cause the filament to glow white-hot,
producing light, whereas the wires connecting the lamp to the battery (which have much lower resistance) hardly even get warm while
conducting the same amount of current. 

As in the case of the short circuit, if the continuity of the circuit is broken at any point, electron flow stops throughout the entire
circuit. With a lamp in place, this means that it will stop glowing.

As before, with no flow of electrons, the entire potential (voltage) of the battery is available across the break, waiting for the
opportunity of a connection to bridge across that break and permit electron flow again. This condition is known as an ''open
circuit'', where a break in the continuity of the circuit prevents current throughout. All it takes is a single break in continuity to
&quot;open&quot; a circuit. Once any breaks have been connected once again and the continuity of the circuit re-established, it is known as a
''closed circuit''. 

What we see here is the basis for switching lamps on and off by remote switches. Because any break in a circuit's continuity results in
current stopping throughout the entire circuit, we can use a device designed to intentionally break that continuity (called a
''switch''), mounted at any convenient location that we can run wires to, to control the flow of electrons in the circuit.



This is how a switch mounted on the wall of a house can control a lamp that is mounted down a long hallway, or even in another room, far away
from the switch. The switch itself is constructed of a pair of conductive contacts (usually made of some kind of metal) forced
together by a mechanical lever actuator or pushbutton. When the contacts touch each other, electrons are able to flow from one to the
other and the circuit's continuity is established  when the contacts are separated, electron flow from one to the other is prevented by the
insulation of the air between, and the circuit's continuity is broken. 

In keeping with the &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; terminology of circuits, a switch that is making contact from one connection terminal to the
other provides continuity for electrons to flow through, and is called a ''closed'' switch. Conversely, a switch that is breaking
continuity won't allow electrons to pass through and is called an ''open'' switch. This terminology is often confusing to the new
student of electronics, because the words &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; are commonly understood in the context of a door, where &quot;open&quot; is equated
with free passage and &quot;closed&quot; with blockage. With electrical switches, these terms have opposite meaning: &quot;open&quot; means no flow
while &quot;closed&quot; means free passage of electrons.</text>

= Voltage and current in a practical circuit =

Because it takes energy to force electrons to flow against the opposition of a resistance, there will be voltage manifested (or
&quot;dropped&quot;) between any points in a circuit with resistance between them. It is important to note that although the amount of current
(the quantity of electrons moving past a given point every second) is uniform in a simple circuit, the amount of voltage (potential energy
per unit charge) between different sets of points in a single circuit may vary considerably: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity22.png|Fhsst_electricity22.png]]

Take this circuit as an example. If we label four points in this circuit with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, we will find that the amount
of current conducted through the wire between points 1 and 2 is exactly the same as the amount of current conducted through the lamp
(between points 2 and 3). This same quantity of current passes through the wire between points 3 and 4, and through the battery
(between points 1 and 4). 

However, we will find the voltage appearing between any two of these points to be directly proportional to the resistance within the
conductive path between those two points, given that the amount of current along any part of the circuit's path is the same (which, for
this simple circuit, it is). In a normal lamp circuit, the resistance of a lamp will be much greater than the resistance of the connecting
wires, so we should expect to see a substantial amount of voltage between points 2 and 3, with very little between points 1 and 2, or
between 3 and 4. The voltage between points 1 and 4, of course, will be the full amount of &quot;force&quot; offered by the battery, which will be
only slightly greater than the voltage across the lamp (between points 2 and 3). 

This, again, is analogous to the water reservoir system:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity23.png|Fhsst_electricity23.png]]

Between points 2 and 3, where the falling water is releasing energy at the water-wheel, there is a difference of pressure between the two
points, reflecting the opposition to the flow of water through the water-wheel. From point 1 to point 2, or from point 3 to point 4,
where water is flowing freely through reservoirs with little opposition, there is little or no difference of pressure (no potential
energy). However, the rate of water flow in this continuous system is the same everywhere (assuming the water levels in both pond and
reservoir are unchanging): through the pump, through the water-wheel, and through all the pipes. So it is with simple electric circuits:
the rate of electron flow is the same at every point in the circuit, although voltages may differ between different sets of points. 

When Benjamin Franklin made his conjecture regarding the direction of charge flow (from the smooth wax to the rough wool), he set a
precedent for electrical notation that exists to this day, despite the fact that we know electrons are the constituent units of charge, and
that they are displaced from the wool to the wax - not from the wax to the wool - when those two substances are rubbed together. This is
why electrons are said to have a ''negative'' charge: because Franklin assumed electric charge moved in the opposite direction that
it actually does, and so objects he called &quot;negative&quot; (representing a deficiency of charge) actually have a surplus of electrons. 

By the time the true direction of electron flow was discovered, the nomenclature of &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; had already been so well
established in the scientific community that no effort was made to change it, although calling electrons &quot;positive&quot; would make more sense
in referring to &quot;excess&quot; charge. You see, the terms &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; are human inventions, and as such have no absolute meaning
beyond our own conventions of language and scientific description. Franklin could have just as easily referred to a surplus of charge as
&quot;black&quot; and a deficiency as &quot;white,&quot; in which case scientists would speak of electrons having a &quot;white&quot; charge (assuming the same
incorrect conjecture of charge position between wax and wool).  

However, because we tend to associate the word &quot;positive&quot; with &quot;surplus&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; with &quot;deficiency,&quot; the standard label for
electron charge does seem backward. Because of this, many engineers decided to retain the old concept of electricity with &quot;positive&quot;
referring to a surplus of charge, and label charge flow (current) accordingly. This became known as ''conventional flow''
notation: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity24.png|Fhsst_electricity24.png]]

Others chose to designate charge flow according to the actual motion of electrons in a circuit. This form of symbology became known as
''electron flow'' notation: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity25.png|Fhsst_electricity25.png]]

In conventional flow notation, we show the motion of charge according to the (technically incorrect) labels of + and -. This way the labels
make sense, but the direction of charge flow is incorrect. Does it matter, really, how we designate charge flow in a circuit? Not really, so
long as we're consistent in the use of our symbols. You may follow an imagined direction of current (conventional flow) or the actual
(electron flow) with equal success insofar as circuit analysis is concerned. Concepts of voltage, current, resistance, continuity, and
even mathematical treatments such as Ohm's Law (chapter 2) and Kirchhoff's Laws (chapter 6) remain just as valid with either style of
notation.</text>

= How voltage, current, and resistance relate =

First lets recap some of the ideas we have learned so far. We will need these to understand how voltage, current and resistance relate.

An electric circuit is formed when a conductive path is created to allow free electrons to continuously move. This continuous movement
of free electrons through the conductors of a circuit is called a ''current'', and it is often referred to in terms of &quot;flow,&quot; just
like the flow of a liquid through a hollow pipe.  

The force motivating electrons to &quot;flow&quot; in a circuit is called ''voltage''. Voltage is a specific measure of potential energy
that is always relative between two points. When we speak of a certain amount of voltage being present in a circuit, we are referring
to the measurement of how much ''potential'' energy exists to move electrons from one particular point in that circuit to another
particular point. Without reference to ''two'' particular points, the term &quot;voltage&quot; has no meaning. 

Free electrons tend to move through conductors with some degree of friction, or opposition to motion. This opposition to motion is more
properly called ''resistance''. The amount of current in a circuit depends on the amount of voltage available to motivate the
electrons, and also the amount of resistance in the circuit to oppose electron flow. Just like voltage, resistance is a quantity relative
between two points. For this reason, the quantities of voltage and resistance are often stated as being &quot;between&quot; or &quot;across&quot; two points
in a circuit. 

To be able to make meaningful statements about these quantities in circuits, we need to be able to describe their quantities in the same
way that we might quantify mass, temperature, volume, length, or any other kind of physical quantity. For mass we might use the units of
&quot;pound&quot; or &quot;gram.&quot; For temperature we might use degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius. Here are the standard units of measurement for
electrical current, voltage, and resistance:  

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity26.png|Fhsst_electricity26.png]]

The &quot;symbol&quot; given for each quantity is the standard alphabetical letter used to represent that quantity in an algebraic equation.
Standardized letters like these are common in the disciplines of physics and engineering, and are internationally recognized. The
&quot;unit abbreviation&quot; for each quantity represents the alphabetical symbol used as a shorthand notation for its particular unit of
measurement. And, yes, that strange-looking &quot;horseshoe&quot; symbol is the capital Greek letter &lt;font class=&quot;MATH&quot;&gt;[img1.png [IMAGE png]]'', just a character in a ''foreign''
alphabet (apologies to any Greek readers here). 

Each unit of measurement is named after a famous experimenter in electricity: The ''ampere'' after the Frenchman Andre M. Ampere, the ''volt'' after the Italian Alessandro Volta, and the ''ohm'' after the German Georg Simon Ohm. 

The mathematical symbol for each quantity is meaningful as well. The ''R'' for resistance and the ''V'' for voltage are both self-explanatory,
whereas ''I'' for current seems a bit weird. The ''I'' is thought to have been meant to represent &quot;Intensity&quot; (of electron flow), and the other
symbol for voltage, ''E,'' stands for &quot;Electromotive force.&quot; From what research I've been able to do, there seems to be some dispute over the
meaning of ''I.'' The symbols ''E'' and ''V'' are interchangeable for the most part, although some texts reserve ''E'' to represent voltage across
a source (such as a battery or generator) and ''V'' to represent voltage across anything else. 

One foundational unit of electrical measurement, often taught in the beginnings of electronics courses but used infrequently afterwards, is
the unit of the ''coulomb'', which is a measure of electric charge proportional to the number of electrons in an imbalanced state.
One coulomb of charge is equal to 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons. The symbol for electric charge quantity is the capital letter ''Q,''
with the unit of coulombs abbreviated by the capital letter &quot;C.&quot; It so happens that the unit for electron flow, the ampere, is equal to 1
coulomb of electrons passing by a given point in a circuit in 1 second of time. Cast in these terms, current is the ''rate of electric
charge motion'' through a conductor. 

As stated before, voltage is the measure of ''potential energy per unit charge'' available to motivate electrons from one point to
another. Before we can precisely define what a &quot;volt&quot; is, we must understand how to measure this quantity we call &quot;potential energy.&quot;
The general metric unit for energy of any kind is the ''joule'', equal to the amount of work performed by a force of 1 newton exerted
through a motion of 1 meter (in the same direction).Defined in these scientific terms, 1 volt is equal to 1 joule 
of electric potential energy per (divided by) 1 coulomb of charge. Thus, a 9 volt battery releases 9 joules of energy for every coulomb
of electrons moved through a circuit. 

These units and symbols for electrical quantities will become very important to know as we begin to explore the relationships between
them in circuits. The first, and perhaps most important, relationship between current, voltage, and resistance is called Ohm's Law,
discovered by Georg Simon Ohm and published in his 1827 paper, ''The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically''. Ohm's
principal discovery was that the amount of electric current through a metal conductor in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage
impressed across it, for any given temperature. Ohm expressed his discovery in the form of a simple equation, describing how voltage,
current, and resistance interrelate: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity27.png|Fhsst_electricity27.png]]

In this algebraic expression, voltage (''E'') is equal to current (''I'') multiplied by resistance (''R''). Using algebra techniques, we can
manipulate this equation into two variations, solving for ''I'' and for ''R'', respectively: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity28.png|Fhsst_electricity28.png]]

Let's see how these equations might work to help us analyze simple circuits:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity29.png|Fhsst_electricity29.png]]

In the above circuit, there is only one source of voltage (the battery, on the left) and only one source of resistance to current
(the lamp, on the right). This makes it very easy to apply Ohm's Law. If we know the values of any two of the three quantities (voltage,
current, and resistance) in this circuit, we can use Ohm's Law to determine the third. 

In this first example, we will calculate the amount of current (''I'') in a circuit, given values of voltage (''E'') and resistance (''R''): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity30.png|Fhsst_electricity30.png]]

What is the amount of current (''I'') in this circuit?

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity31.png|Fhsst_electricity31.png]]

In this second example, we will calculate the amount of resistance (''R'') in a circuit, given values of voltage (''E'') and current (''I''): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity32.png|Fhsst_electricity32.png]]

What is the amount of resistance (''R'') offered by the lamp?

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity33.png|Fhsst_electricity33.png]]

In the last example, we will calculate the amount of voltage supplied by a battery, given values of current (''I'') and resistance (''R''): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity34.png|Fhsst_electricity34.png]]

What is the amount of voltage provided by the battery?

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity35.png|Fhsst_electricity35.png]]

Ohm's Law is a very simple and useful tool for analyzing electric circuits. It is used so often in the study of electricity and
electronics that it needs to be committed to memory by the serious student. For those who are not yet comfortable with algebra, there's
a trick to remembering how to solve for any one quantity, given the other two. First, arrange the letters ''E'', ''I'', and ''R'' in a triangle like
this: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity36.png|Fhsst_electricity36.png]]

If you know ''E'' and ''I'', and wish to determine ''R'', just eliminate ''R'' from the picture and see what's left: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity37.png|Fhsst_electricity37.png]]

If you know E and R, and wish to determine I, eliminate I and see what's left:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity38.png|Fhsst_electricity38.png]]

Lastly, if you know ''I'' and ''R'', and wish to determine ''E'', eliminate ''E'' and see what's left: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity39.png|Fhsst_electricity39.png]]

Eventually, you'll have to be familiar with algebra to seriously study electricity and electronics, but this tip can make your first
calculations a little easier to remember. If you are comfortable with algebra, all you need to do is commit ''E'' = ''IR'' to memory and derive the
other two formulae from that when you need them!</text>

Ohm's Law also make intuitive sense if you apply it to the water-and-pipe analogy. If we have a water pump that exerts pressure
(voltage) to push water around a &quot;circuit&quot; (current) through a restriction (resistance), we can model how the three variables
interrelate. If the resistance to water flow stays the same and the pump pressure increases, the flow rate must also increase. 

If the pressure stays the same and the resistance increases (making it more difficult for the water to flow), then the flow rate must
decrease.

If the flow rate were to stay the same while the resistance to flow decreased, the required pressure from the pump would necessarily
decrease.

As odd as it may seem, the actual mathematical relationship between pressure, flow, and resistance is actually more complex for fluids
like water than it is for electrons. If you pursue further studies in physics, you will discover this for yourself. Thankfully for the
electronics student, the mathematics of Ohm's Law is very straightforward and simple.

= Power in electric circuits =

In addition to voltage and current, there is another measure of free electron activity in a circuit: ''power''. First, we need to
understand just what power is before we analyze it in any circuits. 

Power is a measure of how much work can be performed in a given amount of time. ''Work'' is generally defined in terms of the lifting
of a weight against the pull of gravity. The heavier the weight and/or the higher it is lifted, the more work has been done.
''Power'' is a measure of how rapidly a standard amount of work is done. 

In electric circuits, power is a function of both voltage and current. 

&lt;math&gt;P=I E&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, however, power (P) is exactly equal to current (I) multiplied by voltage (E), rather than merely being proportional to
IE. When using this formula, the unit of measurement for power is the ''watt'', abbreviated with the letter &quot;W.&quot; 

It must be understood that neither voltage nor current by themselves constitute power. Rather, power is the combination of both voltage
''and'' current in a circuit. Remember that voltage is the specific work (or potential energy) per unit charge, while current is
the rate at which electric charges move through a conductor. Voltage (specific work) is analogous to the work done in lifting a weight
against the pull of gravity. Current (rate) is analogous to the speed at which that weight is lifted. Together as a product
(multiplication), voltage (work) and current (rate) constitute power. 

A circuit with high voltage and low current may be dissipating the same amount of power as a circuit with low voltage and high
current. Neither the amount of voltage alone nor the amount of current alone indicates the amount of power in an electric circuit. 

In an open circuit, where voltage is present between the terminals of the source and there is zero current, there is ''zero'' power
dissipated, no matter how great that voltage may be. Since &lt;math&gt;P=I E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I=0&lt;/math&gt; and anything multiplied by zero is zero, the power dissipated in any open circuit must be zero.

== Heat as a by-product ==
Usually heat is produced as a &quot;side-effect&quot; of using an electrical appliance such as a TV set or a computer. Heat is one of the forms of power and there must be a way to get rid of that heat or else the temperature may keep increasing, possibly leading to a breakdown of the apparatus concerned, or even, in an extreme case, to a fire. Make sure there is always enough circulation of air, for examples, in a TV set or a computer; never block the special openings provided in the case of the TV set, or of the computer, etc.; these openings are there on purpose to get rid of the heat.

Often the &quot;rating&quot; of an electrical or electronic item depends on its maximum permitted temperature. A resistor is rated at one watt, for example. Then it will get hot, but not too hot, if its voltage times its current equal no more than one Watt; but that is only true if enough air can get to it to cool it down. Some people will, for example, never &quot;load&quot; a resistor that is rated at a given amount of Watts with more than half that rated power.

The name plate at the rear of the TV set or computer, for example, usually indicates the total amount of Watts that is used, including the part that is converted into heat.</text>

= Calculating electric power =

We've seen the formula for determining the power in an electric circuit: by multiplying the voltage in &quot;volts&quot; by the current in
&quot;amps&quot; we arrive at an answer in &quot;watts.&quot; Let's apply this to a circuit example: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity43.png|Fhsst_electricity43.png]]

In the above circuit, we know we have a battery voltage of 18 volts and a lamp resistance of 3 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Using Ohm's Law to determine
current, we get: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{E}{R} = \frac {18V}{3\Omega} = 6 A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now that we know the current, we can take that value and multiply it by the voltage to determine power: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P = I \ E = (6A) (18V) = 108W &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Answer: the lamp is dissipating (releasing) 108 watts of power, most likely in the form of both light and heat. 

Let's try taking that same circuit and increasing the battery voltage to see what happens. Intuition should tell us that the circuit
current will increase as the voltage increases and the lamp resistance stays the same. Likewise, the power will increase as well: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity44.png|Fhsst_electricity44.png]]

Now, the battery voltage is 36 volts instead of 18 volts. The lamp is still providing 3 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of electrical resistance to the flow of
electrons. The current is now: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{E}{R} = \frac {36V}{3\Omega} = 12 A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This stands to reason: if &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and we double E while R stays the same, the current should double. Indeed, it has: we now have 12 amps
of current instead of 6. Now, what about power? 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P = I \ E = (12A) (36V) = 432W &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Notice that the power has increased just as we might have suspected, but it increased quite a bit more than the current. Why is this?
Because power is a function of voltage multiplied by current, and ''both'' voltage and current doubled from their previous values,
the power will increase by a factor of 2 x 2, or 4. You can check this by dividing 432 watts by 108 watts and seeing that the ratio
between them is indeed 4. 

Using algebra again to manipulate the formulae, we can take our original power formula and modify it for applications where we don't
know both voltage and resistance: 

If we only know voltage (E) and resistance (R):


{| 
|''If''
|class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

|class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{E^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

If we only know current (I) and resistance (R):

and is properly known as Joule's Law. However, these power equations are so commonly associated with the  Ohm's Law equations relating voltage, current, and resistance (&lt;math&gt;E=IR&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I=\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R=\frac{E}{I}&lt;/math&gt;) that they are frequently credited to Ohm.

= Resistors =

Because the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in any circuit is so regular, we can reliably control any variable in a
circuit simply by controlling the other two. Perhaps the easiest variable in any circuit to control is its resistance. This can be
done by changing the material, size, and shape of its conductive components (remember how the thin metal filament of a lamp created
more electrical resistance than a thick wire?). 

Special components called ''resistors'' are made for the express purpose of creating a precise quantity of resistance for insertion
into a circuit. They are typically constructed of metal wire or carbon, and engineered to maintain a stable resistance value over a
wide range of environmental conditions. Unlike lamps, they do not produce light, but they do produce heat as electric power is
dissipated by them in a working circuit. Typically, though, the purpose of a resistor is not to produce usable heat, but simply to
provide a precise quantity of electrical resistance.  

The most common schematic symbol for a resistor is a zigzag line:


Resistor values in ohms are usually shown as an adjacent number, and if several resistors are present in a circuit, they will be labeled
with a unique identifier number such as &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;, etc. As you can see, resistor symbols can be shown either
horizontally or vertically: 


In keeping more with their physical appearance, an alternative schematic symbol for a resistor looks like a small, rectangular box: 


Resistors can also be shown to have varying rather than fixed resistances. This might be for the purpose of describing an actual
physical device designed for the purpose of providing an adjustable resistance, or it could be to show some component that just happens to
have an unstable resistance: 

In fact, any time you see a component symbol drawn with a diagonal arrow through it, that component has a variable rather than a fixed
value. This symbol &quot;modifier&quot; (the diagonal arrow) is standard electronic symbol convention. 

Because resistors dissipate heat energy as the electric currents through them overcome the &quot;friction&quot; of their resistance, resistors
are also rated in terms of how much heat energy they can dissipate without overheating and sustaining damage. Naturally, this power
rating is specified in the physical unit of &quot;watts.&quot; Most resistors found in small electronic devices such as portable radios are rated at
1/4 (0.25) watt or less. The power rating of any resistor is roughly proportional to its physical size. Also note how
resistances (in ohms) have nothing to do with size!</text>

''&quot;Advances are made by answering questions. Discoveries are made by questioning answers.&quot;''

''Bernhard Haisch, Astrophysicist''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ohm's Law is a simple and powerful mathematical tool for helping us analyze electric circuits, but it has limitations, and we must
understand these limitations in order to properly apply it to real circuits. For most conductors, resistance is a rather stable
property, largely unaffected by voltage or current. For this reason, we can regard the resistance of most circuit components as a constant,
with voltage and current being inversely related to each other. 

For instance, our previous circuit example with the 3 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; lamp, we calculated current through the circuit by dividing voltage by resistance (''I'' = ''E''/''R''). With an 18 volt battery, our circuit current was 6 amperes. Doubling the battery voltage to 36 volts resulted in a
doubled current of 12 amperes. All of this makes sense, of course, so long as the lamp continues to provide exactly the same amount of friction (resistance) to the flow of electrons through it: 3 &amp;Omega;.

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity50.png|Fhsst_electricity50.png]]

However, reality is not always this simple. One of the phenomena we need to mention is of conductor resistance
''changing'' with temperature. In an incandescent lamp (the kind employing the principle of electric current heating a thin filament of wire to the point that it glows white-hot), the resistance of the filament wire will increase dramatically as it warms from room temperature to operating temperature. If we were to increase the supply voltage in a real lamp circuit, the resulting increase in current would cause the filament to increase temperature, which would in turn increase its resistance, thus preventing further increases in current without further increases in battery voltage. Consequently, voltage and current do not follow the simple equation &lt;math&gt;I=\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt; (with ''R''
assumed to be equal to 3 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) because an incandescent lamp's filament resistance does not remain stable for different currents. 

The phenomenon of resistance changing with variations in temperature is one shared by almost all metals, of which most wires are made. For
most applications, these changes in resistance are small enough to be ignored. In the application of metal lamp filaments, the change
happens to be quite large. 

A more realistic analysis of a lamp circuit, however, over several different values of battery voltage would generate a plot of this
shape: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity51.png|Fhsst_electricity51.png]]

The plot is no longer a straight line. It rises sharply on the left, as voltage increases from zero to a low level. As it progresses to
the right we see the line flattening out, the circuit requiring greater and greater increases in voltage to achieve equal increases in
current. 

If we try to apply Ohm's Law to find the resistance of this lamp circuit with the voltage and current values plotted above, we arrive
at several different values. We could say that the resistance here is ''nonlinear'', increasing with increasing current and voltage.
The nonlinearity is caused by the effects of high temperature on the metal wire of the lamp filament.</text>

= Circuit wiring =

So far, we've been analyzing single-battery, single-resistor circuits with no regard for the connecting wires between the components, so
long as a complete circuit is formed. Does the wire length or circuit &quot;shape&quot; matter to our calculations? Let's look at a couple of circuit
configurations and find out: 

When we draw wires connecting points in a circuit, we usually assume those wires have negligible resistance. As such, they contribute no
appreciable effect to the overall resistance of the circuit, and so the only resistance we have to contend with is the resistance in the
components. In the above circuits, the only resistance comes from the 5 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistors, so that is all we will consider in our
calculations. In real life, metal wires actually ''do'' have resistance (and so do power sources!), but those resistances are
generally so much smaller than the resistance present in the other circuit components that they can be safely ignored. 

If connecting wire resistance is very little or none, we can regard the connected points in a circuit as being ''electrically
common''. That is, points 1 and 2 in the above circuits may be physically joined close together or far apart, and it doesn't matter
for any voltage or resistance measurements relative to those points. The same goes for points 3 and 4. It is as if the ends of the
resistor were attached directly across the terminals of the battery, so far as our Ohm's Law calculations and voltage measurements are
concerned. This is useful to know, because it means you can re-draw a circuit diagram or re-wire a circuit, shortening or lengthening the
wires as desired without appreciably impacting the circuit's function. All that matters is that the components attach to each other in the
same sequence. 

It also means that voltage measurements between sets of &quot;electrically common&quot; points will be the same. That is, the voltage between points
1 and 4 (directly across the battery) will be the same as the voltage between points 2 and 3 (directly across the resistor). Take a close
look at the following circuit, and try to determine which points are common to each other: 


Here, we only have 2 components excluding the wires: the battery and the resistor. Though the connecting wires take a convoluted path in
forming a complete circuit, there are several electrically common points in the electrons' path. Points 1, 2, and 3 are all common to
each other, because they're directly connected together by wire. The same goes for points 4, 5, and 6. 

The voltage between points 1 and 6 is 10 volts, coming straight from the battery. However, since points 5 and 4 are common to 6, and
points 2 and 3 common to 1, that same 10 volts also exists between these other pairs of points: 




&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 4 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 and 4 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 and 4 = 10 volts (directly across the resistor) &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 5 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 and 5 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 and 5 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 6 = 10 volts (directly across the battery) &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 and 6 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 and 6 = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;



Since electrically common points are connected together by (zero resistance) wire, there is no significant voltage drop between them
regardless of the amount of current conducted from one to the next through that connecting wire. Thus, if we were to read voltages
between common points, we should show (practically) zero:  



&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 2 = 0 volts         Points 1, 2, and 3 are &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 and 3 = 0 volts         electrically common &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 and 3 = 0 volts &lt;/tt&gt;


&lt;tt&gt;Between points 4 and 5 = 0 volts         Points 4, 5, and 6 are &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 5 and 6 = 0 volts         electrically common &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 4 and 6 = 0 volts &lt;/tt&gt;


This makes sense mathematically, too. With a 10 volt battery and a 5 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistor, the circuit current will be 2 amperes. With wire
resistance being zero, the voltage drop across any continuous stretch of wire can be determined through Ohm's Law as such: 

It should be obvious that the calculated voltage drop across any uninterrupted length of wire in a circuit where wire is assumed to
have zero resistance will always be zero, no matter what the magnitude of current, since zero multiplied by anything equals zero. 

Because common points in a circuit will exhibit the same relative voltage and resistance measurements, wires connecting common points
are often labeled with the same designation. This is not to say that the ''terminal'' connection points are labeled the same, just the
connecting wires. Take this circuit as an example: 

Points 1, 2, and 3 are all common to each other, so the wire connecting point 1 to 2 is labeled the same (wire 2) as the wire
connecting point 2 to 3 (wire 2). In a real circuit, the wire stretching from point 1 to 2 may not even be the same color or size as
the wire connecting point 2 to 3, but they should bear the exact same label. The same goes for the wires connecting points 6, 5, and 4. 

Knowing that electrically common points have zero voltage drop between them is a valuable troubleshooting principle. If I measure for
voltage between points in a circuit that are supposed to be common to each other, I should read zero. If, however, I read substantial
voltage between those two points, then I know with certainty that they cannot be directly connected together. If those points are
''supposed'' to be electrically common but they register otherwise, then I know that there is an &quot;open failure&quot; between those points. 

One final note: for most practical purposes, wire conductors can be assumed to possess zero resistance from end to end. In reality,
however, there will always be some small amount of resistance encountered along the length of a wire, unless it's a superconducting
wire. Knowing this, we need to bear in mind that the principles learned here about electrically common points are all valid to a large
degree, but not to an ''absolute'' degree. That is, the rule that electrically common points are guaranteed to have zero voltage
between them is more accurately stated as such: electrically common points will have ''very little'' voltage dropped between them.
That small, virtually unavoidable trace of resistance found in any piece of connecting wire is bound to create a small voltage across the
length of it as current is conducted through. So long as you understand that these rules are based upon ''ideal'' conditions,
you won't be perplexed when you come across some condition appearing to be an exception to the rule.</text>

= Polarity of voltage drops =

We can trace the direction that electrons will flow in the same circuit by starting at the negative (-) terminal and following through
to the positive (+) terminal of the battery, the only source of voltage in the circuit. From this we can see that the electrons are
moving counter-clockwise, from point 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 6 again. 

As the current encounters the 5 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistance, voltage is dropped across the resistor's ends. The signs of this voltage drop
is negative (-) at point 4 with respect to positive (+) at point 3. We can mark the polarity of the resistor's voltage drop with these
negative and positive symbols, in accordance with the direction of current (whichever end of the resistor the current is
''entering'' is negative with respect to the end of the resistor it is ''exiting'': 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity56.png|Fhsst_electricity00052.png]]

We could make our table of voltages a little more complete by marking the polarity of the voltage for each pair of points in this circuit: 


&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 (+) and 4 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 (+) and 4 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 (+) and 4 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 (+) and 5 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 (+) and 5 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 (+) and 5 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 1 (+) and 6 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 2 (+) and 6 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Between points 3 (+) and 6 (-) = 10 volts &lt;/tt&gt;


While it might seem a little silly to document polarity of voltage drop in this circuit, it is an important concept to master. It will
be critically important in the analysis of more complex circuits involving multiple resistors and/or batteries. 

It should be understood that polarity has nothing to do with Ohm's Law: there will never be negative voltages, currents, or resistance
entered into any Ohm's Law equations! There are other mathematical principles of electricity that do take polarity into account through
the use of signs (+ or -), but not Ohm's Law.</text>

= What are &quot;series&quot; and &quot;parallel&quot; circuits? =

Circuits consisting of just one battery and one load resistance are very simple to analyze, but they are not often found in practical
applications. Usually, we find circuits where more than two components are connected together. 

There are two basic ways in which to connect more than two circuit components: ''series'' and ''parallel''. First, an example
of a series circuit: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity57.png|Fhsst_electricity57.png]]

Here, we have three resistors (labeled &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;), connected in a long chain from one terminal of the battery to the
other. (It should be noted that the subscript labeling - those little numbers to the lower-right of the letter &quot;R&quot; - are unrelated
to the resistor values in ohms. They serve only to identify one resistor from another.) The defining characteristic of a series
circuit is that there is only one path for electrons to flow. In this circuit the electrons flow in a counter-clockwise direction, from
point 4 to point 3 to point 2 to point 1 and back around to 4. 

Now, let's look at the other type of circuit, a parallel configuration:

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity58.png|Fhsst_electricity58.png]]

Again, we have three resistors, but this time they form more than one continuous path for electrons to flow. There's one path from 8 to 7
to 2 to 1 and back to 8 again. There's another from 8 to 7 to 6 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 8 again. And then there's a third path from 8
to 7 to 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 8 again. Each individual path (through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;) is called a
''branch''. 

The defining characteristic of a parallel circuit is that all components are connected between the same set of electrically common
points. Looking at the schematic diagram, we see that points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all electrically common. So are points 8, 7, 6, and 5.
Note that all resistors as well as the battery are connected between these two sets of points. 

And, of course, the complexity doesn't stop at simple series and parallel either! We can have circuits that are a combination of
series and parallel, too: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity59.png|Fhsst_electricity59.png]]

In this circuit, we have two loops for electrons to flow through: one from 6 to 5 to 2 to 1 and back to 6 again, and another from 6 to 5 to
4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 6 again. Notice how both current paths go through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; (from point 2 to point 1). In this configuration,
we'd say that &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; are in parallel with each other, while &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; is in series with the parallel combination of &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;. 

This is just a preview of things to come. Don't worry! We'll explore all these circuit configurations in detail, one at a time! 

The basic idea of a &quot;series&quot; connection is that components are connected end-to-end in a line to form a single path for electrons to
flow: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity60.png|Fhsst_electricity60.png]]

The basic idea of a &quot;parallel&quot; connection, on the other hand, is that all components are connected across each other's leads. In a purely
parallel circuit, there are never more than two sets of electrically common points, no matter how many components are connected. There are
many paths for electrons to flow, but only one voltage across all components: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity61.png|Fhsst_electricity61.png]]

Series and parallel resistor configurations have very different electrical properties. We'll explore the properties of each
configuration in the sections to come.</text>

= Simple series circuits =

Let's start with a series circuit consisting of three resistors and a single battery: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity62.png|Fhsst_electricity62.png]]

The first principle to understand about series circuits is that the amount of current is the same through any component in the circuit.
This is because there is only one path for electrons to flow in a series circuit, and because free electrons flow through conductors
like marbles in a tube, the rate of flow (marble speed) at any point in the circuit (tube) at any specific point in time must be equal. 

From the way that the 9 volt battery is arranged, we can tell that the electrons in this circuit will flow in a counter-clockwise direction,
from point 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 4. However, we have one source of voltage and three resistances. How do we use Ohm's Law here? 

An important caveat to Ohm's Law is that all quantities (voltage, current, resistance, and power) must relate to each other in terms of
the same two points in a circuit. For instance, with a single-battery, single-resistor circuit, we could easily calculate any
quantity because they all applied to the same two points in the circuit: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity63.png|Fhsst_electricity63.png]]

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity64.png|Fhsst_electricity64.png]]

Since points 1 and 2 are connected together with wire of negligible resistance, as are points 3 and 4, we can say that point 1 is
electrically common to point 2, and that point 3 is electrically common to point 4. Since we know we have 9 volts of electromotive
force between points 1 and 4 (directly across the battery), and since point 2 is common to point 1 and point 3 common to point 4, we must
also have 9 volts between points 2 and 3 (directly across the resistor). Therefore, we can apply Ohm's Law (&lt;math&gt;I =\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt;) to the current
through the resistor, because we know the voltage (E) across the resistor and the resistance (R) of that resistor. All terms (E, I, R)
apply to the same two points in the circuit, to that same resistor, so we can use the Ohm's Law formula with no reservation. 

However, in circuits containing more than one resistor, we must be careful in how we apply Ohm's Law. In the three-resistor example
circuit below, we know that we have 9 volts between points 1 and 4, which is the amount of electromotive force trying to push electrons
through the series combination of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;. However, we cannot take the value of 9 volts and divide it by 3k, 10k
or 5k &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; to try to find a current value, because we don't know how much voltage is across any one of those resistors, individually. 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity65.png|Fhsst_electricity65.png]]

The figure of 9 volts is a ''total'' quantity for the whole circuit, whereas the figures of 3k, 10k, and 5k &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; are
''individual'' quantities for individual resistors. If we were to plug a figure for total voltage into an Ohm's Law equation with a
figure for individual resistance, the result would not relate accurately to any quantity in the real circuit. 

For &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, Ohm's Law will relate the amount of voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; with the current through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, given &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'s resistance,
3k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity66.png|Fhsst_electricity66.png]]

But, since we don't know the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; (only the total voltage supplied by the battery across the three-resistor series
combination) and we don't know the current through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, we can't do any calculations with either formula. The same goes for &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;: we can apply the Ohm's Law equations if and only if all terms are representative of their respective quantities between the
same two points in the circuit. 

So what can we do? We know the voltage of the source (9 volts) applied across the series combination of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;, and we know the resistances of each resistor, but since those quantities aren't in the same context, we can't use Ohm's Law to
determine the circuit current. If only we knew what the ''total'' resistance was for the circuit: then we could calculate ''total'' current with our figure for ''total'' voltage
(&lt;math&gt;I =\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt;). 

This brings us to the second principle of series circuits: the total resistance of any series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual
resistances. This should make intuitive sense: the more resistors in series that the electrons must flow through, the more difficult it
will be for those electrons to flow. In the example problem, we had a 3 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, 10 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and 5 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; resistor in series, giving
us a total resistance of 18 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity67.png|Fhsst_electricity67.png]]

In essence, we've calculated the equivalent resistance of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; combined. Knowing this, we could re-draw the
circuit with a single equivalent resistor representing the series combination of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity68.png|Fhsst_electricity68.png]]

Now we have all the necessary information to calculate circuit current, because we have the voltage between points 1 and 4 (9 volts)
and the resistance between points 1 and 4 (18 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity69.png|Fhsst_electricity69.png]]

Knowing that current is equal through all components of a series circuit (and we just determined the current through the battery), we
can go back to our original circuit schematic and note the current through each component: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity70.png|Fhsst_electricity70.png]]

Now that we know the amount of current through each resistor, we can use Ohm's Law to determine the voltage drop across each one (applying
Ohm's Law in its proper context): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity71.png|Fhsst_electricity71.png]]

Notice the voltage drops across each resistor, and how the sum of the voltage drops (1.5 + 5 + 2.5) is equal to the battery (supply)
voltage: 9 volts. This is the third principle of series circuits: that the supply voltage is equal to the sum of the individual voltage
drops. 

However, the method we just used to analyze this simple series circuit can be streamlined for better understanding. By using a table to list
all voltages, currents, and resistances in the circuit, it becomes very easy to see which of those quantities can be properly related in
any Ohm's Law equation: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity72.png|Fhsst_electricity72.png]]

The rule with such a table is to apply Ohm's Law only to the values within each vertical column. For instance, &lt;math&gt;E_R1&lt;/math&gt; only with
&lt;math&gt;I_R1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;E_R2&lt;/math&gt; only with &lt;math&gt;I_R2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;  etc.
You begin your analysis by filling in those elements of the table that are given to you from the beginning: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity73.png|Fhsst_electricity73.png]]

As you can see from the arrangement of the data, we can't apply the 9 volts of &lt;math&gt;E_T&lt;/math&gt; (total voltage) to any of the resistances (&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;) in any Ohm's Law formula because they're in different columns. The 9 volts of battery voltage is ''not''
applied directly across &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;. However, we can use our &quot;rules&quot; of series circuits to fill in blank spots on a
horizontal row. In this case, we can use the series rule of resistances to determine a total resistance from the ''sum'' of
individual resistances: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity74.png|Fhsst_electricity74.png]]

Now, with a value for total resistance inserted into the rightmost (&quot;Total&quot;) column, we can apply Ohm's Law of &lt;math&gt;I=\frac{E}{R}&lt;/math&gt; to total voltage and total resistance to arrive at a total current of 500 ''A'': 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity75.png|Fhsst_electricity75.png]]

Then, knowing that the current is shared equally by all components of a series circuit (another &quot;rule&quot; of series circuits), we can fill in
the currents for each resistor from the current figure just calculated: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity76.png|Fhsst_electricity76.png]]

Finally, we can use Ohm's Law to determine the voltage drop across each resistor, one column at a time:

= Simple parallel circuits =

Let's start with a parallel circuit consisting of three resistors and a single battery: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity78.png|Fhsst_electricity78.png]]

The first principle to understand about parallel circuits is that the voltage is equal across all components in the circuit. This is
because there are only two sets of electrically common points in a parallel circuit, and voltage measured between sets of common points
must always be the same at any given time. Therefore, in the above circuit, the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the voltage across
&lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; which is equal to the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; which is equal to the voltage across the battery. This equality of voltages can be
represented in another table for our starting values: 


[[Image:Fhsst_electricity79.png|Fhsst_electricity79.png]]

Just as in the case of series circuits, the same caveat for Ohm's Law applies: values for voltage, current, and resistance must be in the
same context in order for the calculations to work correctly. However, in the above example circuit, we can immediately apply Ohm's
Law to each resistor to find its current because we know the voltage across each resistor (9 volts) and the resistance of each resistor: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity80.png|Fhsst_electricity80.png]]

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity81.png|Fhsst_electricity81.png]]

At this point we still don't know what the total current or total resistance for this parallel circuit is, so we can't apply Ohm's Law
to the rightmost (&quot;Total&quot;) column. However, if we think carefully about what is happening it should become apparent that the total
current must equal the sum of all individual resistor (&quot;branch&quot;) currents: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity82.png|Fhsst_electricity82.png]]

As the total current exits the negative (-) battery terminal at point 8 and travels through the circuit, some of the flow splits off at
point 7 to go up through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, some more splits off at point 6 to go up through &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the remainder goes up through &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;.
Like a river branching into several smaller streams, the combined flow rates of all streams must equal the flow rate of the whole river. The
same thing is encountered where the currents through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; join to flow back to the positive terminal of the battery
(+) toward point 1: the flow of electrons from point 2 to point 1 must equal the sum of the (branch) currents through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt;. 

This is the second principle of parallel circuits: the total circuit current is equal to the sum of the individual branch currents. Using
this principle, we can fill in the &lt;math&gt;I_T&lt;/math&gt; spot on our table with the sum of &lt;math&gt;I_{R1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_{R2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I_{R3}&lt;/math&gt;: 


[[Image:Fhsst_electricity83.png|Fhsst_electricity83.png]]

Finally, applying Ohm's Law to the rightmost (&quot;Total&quot;) column, we can calculate the total circuit resistance: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity84.png|Fhsst_electricity84.png]]

Please note something very important here. The total circuit resistance is only 625 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;: ''less'' than any one of the
individual resistors. In the series circuit, where the total resistance was the sum of the individual resistances, the total was
bound to be ''greater'' than any one of the resistors individually. Here in the parallel circuit, however, the opposite is
true: we say that the individual resistances ''diminish'' rather than ''add'' to make the total. This principle completes our
triad of &quot;rules&quot; for parallel circuits, just as series circuits were found to have three rules for voltage, current, and resistance.
Mathematically, the relationship between total resistance and individual resistances in a parallel circuit looks like this: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity85.png|Fhsst_electricity85.png]]

The same basic form of equation works for ''any'' number of resistors connected together in parallel, just add as many ''1/R'' terms
on the denominator of the fraction as needed to accommodate all parallel resistors in the circuit.</text>

= Power calculations =

When calculating the power dissipation of resistive components, use any one of the three power equations to derive and answer from values
of voltage, current, and/or resistance pertaining to each component: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity86.png|Fhsst_electricity86.png]]

This is easily managed by adding another row to our familiar table of voltages, currents, and resistances: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity87.png|Fhsst_electricity87.png]]

Power for any particular table column can be found by the appropriate Ohm's Law equation (''appropriate'' based on what figures are
present for ''E'', ''I'', and ''R'' in that column). 

An interesting rule for total power versus individual power is that it is additive for ''any'' configuration of circuit: series,
parallel, series/parallel, or otherwise. Power is a measure of rate of work, and since power dissipated ''must'' equal the total
power applied by the source(s) (as per the Law of Conservation of Energy in physics), circuit configuration has no effect on the mathematics.</text>

= Correct use of Ohm's Law =

One of the most common mistakes made by beginning electronics students in their application of Ohm's Laws is mixing the contexts of voltage,
current, and resistance. In other words, a student might mistakenly use a value for I through one resistor and the value for ''E'' across a
set of interconnected resistors, thinking that they'll arrive at the resistance of that one resistor. Not so! Remember this important
rule: The variables used in Ohm's Law equations must be ''common'' to the same two points in the circuit under
consideration. I cannot overemphasize this rule. This is especially important in series-parallel combination circuits where nearby
components may have different values for both voltage drop ''and'' current. 

When using Ohm's Law to calculate a variable pertaining to a single component, be sure the voltage you're referencing is solely across
that single component and the current you're referencing is solely through that single component and the resistance you're referencing is
solely for that single component. Likewise, when calculating a variable pertaining to a set of components in a circuit, be sure that
the voltage, current, and resistance values are specific to that complete set of components only! A good way to remember this is to
pay close attention to the ''two points'' terminating the component or set of components being analyzed, making sure that the
voltage in question is across those two points, that the current in question is the electron flow from one of those points all the way to
the other point, that the resistance in question is the equivalent of a single resistor between those two points, and that the power in
question is the total power dissipated by all components between those two points. 

The &quot;table&quot; method presented for both series and parallel circuits in this chapter is a good way to keep the context of Ohm's Law
correct for any kind of circuit configuration. In a table like the one shown below, you are only allowed to apply an Ohm's Law equation
for the values of a single ''vertical'' column at a time:  

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity88.png|Fhsst_electricity88.png]]

Deriving values ''horizontally'' across columns is allowable as per the principles of series and parallel circuits: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electricity89.png|Fhsst_electricity89.png]]


[[Image:Fhsst_electricity90.png|Fhsst_electricity90.png]]

Not only does the &quot;table&quot; method simplify the management of all relevant quantities, it also facilitates cross-checking of answers by
making it easy to solve for the original unknown variables through other methods, or by working backwards to solve for the initially
given values from your solutions. For example, if you have just solved for all unknown voltages, currents, and resistances in a
circuit, you can check your work by adding a row at the bottom for power calculations on each resistor, seeing whether or not all the
individual power values add up to the total power. If not, then you must have made a mistake somewhere! While this technique of
&quot;cross-checking&quot; your work is nothing new, using the table to arrange all the data for the cross-check(s) results in a minimum of
confusion.</text>

= Conductor Size =

It should be common-sense knowledge that liquids flow through large-diameter pipes easier than they do through small-diameter pipes
(if you would like a practical illustration, try drinking a liquid through straws of different diameters). The same general principle
holds for the flow of electrons through conductors: the broader the cross-sectional area (thickness) of the conductor, the more room for
electrons to flow, and consequently, the easier it is for flow to occur (less resistance). 

Electrical wire is usually round in cross-section (although there are some unique exceptions to this rule), and comes in two basic
varieties: solid and stranded. Solid copper wire is just as it sounds: a single, solid strand of copper the whole length of the wire.
Stranded wire is composed of smaller strands of solid copper wire twisted together to form a single, larger conductor. The greatest
benefit of stranded wire is its mechanical flexibility, being able to withstand repeated bending and twisting much better than solid copper
(which tends to fatigue and break after time).</text>

= Fuses =

Normally, the ampacity rating of a conductor is a circuit design limit never to be intentionally exceeded, but there is an application where
ampacity exceedence is expected: in the case of ''fuses''.  

A fuse is nothing more than a short length of wire designed to melt and separate in the event of excessive current. Fuses are always
connected in series with the component(s) to be protected from overcurrent, so that when the fuse ''blows'' (opens) it will open
the entire circuit and stop current through the component(s). A fuse connected in one branch of a parallel circuit, of course, would not
affect current through any of the other branches. 

Normally, the thin piece of fuse wire is contained within a safety sheath to minimize hazards of arc blast if the wire burns open with
violent force, as can happen in the case of severe overcurrents. In the case of small automotive fuses, the sheath is transparent so that
the fusible element can be visually inspected. Residential wiring used to commonly employ screw-in fuses with glass bodies and a thin,
narrow metal foil strip in the middle.</text>

* ''REVIEW:''
* A ''circuit'' is an unbroken loop of conductive material that allows electrons to flow through continuously without beginning or end.
* If a circuit is &quot;broken,&quot; that means it's conductive elements no longer form a complete path, and continuous electron flow cannot occur in it.
* The location of a break in a circuit is irrelevant to its inability to sustain continuous electron flow. ''Any'' break, ''anywhere'' in a circuit prevents electron flow throughout the circuit.

* ''REVIEW:''
* Electrons can be motivated to flow through a conductor by the same force manifested in static electricity.
* ''Voltage'' is the measure of specific potential energy (potential energy per unit charge) between two locations. In layman's terms, it is the measure of &quot;push&quot; available to motivate electrons.
* Voltage, as an expression of potential energy, is always relative between two locations, or points. Sometimes it is called a voltage &quot;drop.&quot;
* When a voltage source is connected to a circuit, the voltage will cause a uniform flow of electrons through that circuit called a ''current''.
* In a single (one loop) circuit, the amount of current at any point is the same as the amount of current at any other point.
* If a circuit containing a voltage source is broken, the full voltage of that source will appear across the points of the break.
* The +/- orientation a voltage drop is called the ''polarity''. It is also relative between two points.

* ''REVIEW:''
* ''Resistance'' is the measure of opposition to electric current.
* A ''short circuit'' is an electric circuit offering little or no resistance to the flow of electrons. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released.
* An ''open circuit'' is one where the continuity has been broken by an interruption in the path for electrons to flow.
* A ''closed circuit'' is one that is complete, with good continuity throughout.
* A device designed to open or close a circuit under controlled conditions is called a ''switch''.
* The terms ''&quot;open&quot;'' and ''&quot;closed&quot;'' refer to switches as well as entire circuits. An open switch is one without continuity: electrons cannot flow through it. A closed switch is one that provides a direct (low resistance) path for electrons to flow through.

* ''REVIEW:''
* Connecting wires in a circuit are assumed to have zero resistance unless otherwise stated.
* Wires in a circuit can be shortened or lengthened without impacting the circuit's function - all that matters is that the components are attached to one another in the same sequence.
* Points directly connected together in a circuit by zero resistance (wire) are considered to be ''electrically common''.
* Electrically common points, with zero resistance between them, will have zero voltage dropped between them, regardless of the magnitude of current (ideally).
* The voltage or resistance readings referenced between sets of electrically common points will be the same.
* These rules apply to ''ideal'' conditions, where connecting wires are assumed to possess absolutely zero resistance. In real life this will probably not be the case, but wire resistances should be low enough so that the general principles stated here still hold.

* ''REVIEW:''
* Power is additive in ''any'' configuration of resistive circuit: &lt;math&gt;P_{Total} = P_1 + P_2 + . . . P_n&lt;/math&gt;

* ''REVIEW:''
* When electrons flow through a conductor, a magnetic field will be produced around that conductor.
* The left-hand rule states that the magnetic flux lines produced by a current-carrying wire will be oriented the same direction as the curled fingers of a person's left hand (in the &quot;hitchhiking&quot; position), with the thumb pointing in the direction of electron flow.
* The magnetic field force produced by a current-carrying wire can be greatly increased by shaping the wire into a coil instead of a straight line. If wound in a coil shape, the magnetic field will be oriented along the axis of the coil's length.
* The magnetic field force produced by an electromagnet (called the ''magnetomotive force'', or mmf), is proportional to the product (multiplication) of the current through the electromagnet and the number of complete coil &quot;turns&quot; formed by the wire.</text>

= Permanent magnets =

Magnetism has been known to mankind for many thousands of years. ''Lodestone'', a magnetized form of the iron oxide mineral
''magnetite'' which has the property of attracting iron objects, is referred to in old European and Asian historical
records, around 800 BC in Europe and earlier in the East, around 2600 BC. The root of the English word magnet is the Greek word
magnes, thought to be derived from Magnesia in Asia Minor, once an important source of lodestone.

Lodestone was used as a navigational compass as it was found to orient itself in a north-south direction if left free to rotate by
suspension on a string or on a float in water. 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
A compass is a navigational instrument for finding directions.  It consists of a magnetised pointer free to align itself
accurately with Earth's magnetic field. A compass provides a  known reference direction which is of great assistance in
navigation. The cardinal points are north, south, east and west.  A compass can be used in conjunction with a clock and a sextant
to provide a very accurate navigation capability. This device  greatly improved maritime trade by making travel safer and more
efficient.  A compass can be any magnetic device using a needle to indicate  the direction of the magnetic north of a planet's magnetosphere.
Any instrument with a magnetized bar or needle turning freely  upon a pivot and pointing in a northerly and southerly direction
can be considered a compass.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1269, Frenchmen Peter Peregrinus and Pierre de Maricourt, using a compass and a lodestone, found that the magnetic force of the
lodestone at the opposite ends, which they defined to be the poles of the magnet. They found that like poles repel one another whilst
unlike poles attract. It was also discovered that poles always occur in pairs, it is impossible to isolate a single pole, a
monopole. Breaking a piece of lodestone in half would result in two pieces, each with its own pair of poles.

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag1.png|Fhsst_electromag1.png]]

In 1600 the English physician William Gilbert concluded that the Earth itself is a magnet and that the Earth's magnetic poles are
approximately aligned along the Earth's axis of rotation. 

The British scientist, John Michell, discovered in 1750 that the magnitude of forces between the poles of magnets follows an
inverse square law  i.e. it varies inversely as the square of the distance of separation.

Magnetic forces are a result of magnetic fields. The magnetic field is an entity produced by moving electric charges that exerts
a force on other moving charges. In permanent ferromagnets the magnetic field is produced by the spin of electrons within the
material being in the same direction.

By placing a magnet underneath a piece of paper and sprinkling iron filings on top one can map the magnetic field. The filings
align themselves parallel to the field. Magnetic fields can be represented by magnetic field lines which are parallel to the
magnetic field and whose spacing represents the relative strength of the magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field is
referred to as the magnetic flux. Magnetic field lines form closed loops. In a bar magnet magnetic field lines emerge at one pole and
then curve around to the other pole with the rest of the loop being inside the magnet.

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag2.png|Fhsst_electromag2.png]]  

Opposite poles of a magnet attract each other and bringing them together results in their magnetic field lines converging.

Like poles of a magnet repel each other and bringing them together results in their magnetic field lines diverging.

Ferromagnetism is a phenomenon exhibited by materials like iron, nickel or cobalt. They become magnetized in an external magnetic
field by aligning their electron spins with the external field. Ferromagnetic materials retain their magnetism even when the field
is removed as the electron spins retain their orientation. At high enough temperatures ferromagnets lose their orientation as the
heat causes the orientations of electron orbits within iron to become randomized.

Iron always magnetizes so as to be attracted to a magnet, regardless of which magnetic pole is brought toward the
unmagnetized iron:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag3.png|Fhsst_electromag3.png]]

The ability of a ferromagnetic material tends to retain its magnetization after an external field is removed is called it's
''retentivity''.

Paramagnetic materials are materials like aluminum or platinum which become magnetized in an external magnetic field in a similar
way to ferromagnetic materials but lose their magnetism when the external magnetic field is removed.

Diamagnetism is exhibited by materials like copper or bismuth which become magnetized in a magnetic field with a polarity
opposite to the external magnetic field. Unlike iron, they are slightly repelled by a magnet

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag4.png|Fhsst_electromag4.png]]

The cause of Earth's magnetic field is not known for certain, but is possibly explained by the dynamo theory. The magnetic field
extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space. The field is approximately a magnetic dipole, with one pole near the
geographic north pole and the other near the geographic south pole. An imaginary line joining the magnetic poles would be
inclined by approximately 11.3 from the planet's axis of rotation. The location of the magnetic poles is not static but wanders as
much as several kilometers a year. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not at exact opposite
positions on the globe. Currently the south magnetic pole is further from the geographic south pole than than north magnetic
pole is from the north geographic pole.

The strength of the field at the Earth's surface at this time ranges from less than 30 microteslas (0.3 gauss) in an area
including most of South America and South Africa to over 60 microteslas (0.6 gauss) around the magnetic poles in northern
Canada and south of Australia, and in part of Siberia. The field is similar to that of a bar magnet, but this similarity is
superficial. The magnetic field of a bar magnet, or any other type of permanent magnet, is created by the coordinated motions of
electrons (negatively charged particles) within iron atoms. The Earth's core, however, is hotter than 1043 K, the temperature at
which the orientations of electron orbits within iron become randomized. Therefore the Earth's magnetic field is not caused by
magnetised iron deposits, but mostly by electric currents (known as telluric currents). Another feature that distinguishes the
Earth magnetically from a bar magnet is its magnetosphere.

A magnetosphere is the region around an astronomical object, in which phenomena are dominated by its magnetic field. Earth is
surrounded by a magnetosphere, as are the magnetized planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Mercury is magnetized, but
too weakly to trap plasma. Mars has patchy surface magnetization.

The distant field of Earth is greatly modified by the solar wind, a hot outflow from the sun, consisting of solar ions (mainly
hydrogen) moving at about 400 km/s . Earth's magnetic field forms an obstacle to the solar wind.

The Earth's magnetic field reverses at intervals, ranging from tens of thousands to many millions of years, with an average
interval ofnbsp; 250,000 years. It is believed that this last occurred some 780,000 years ago. The mechanism responsible for geomagnetic
reversals is not well understood. When the North reappears in the opposite direction, we would interpret this as a reversal, whereas
turning off and returning in the same direction is called a geomagnetic excursion. At present, the overall geomagnetic field
is becoming weaker at a rate which would, if it continues, cause the field to disappear, albeit temporarily, by about around
3000-4000 AD. The deterioration began roughly 150 years ago and has accelerated in the past several years. So far the strength of
the Earth's field has decreased by 10 to 15 percent.</text>

= Electromagnetism =

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
The discovery of the relationship between magnetism and electricity was, like so many other scientific discoveries, stumbled upon almost
by accident. The Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted was lecturing one day in 1820 on the ''possibility'' of electricity
and magnetism being related to one another, and in the process demonstrated it conclusively by experiment in front of his whole
class! By passing an electric current through a metal wire suspended above a magnetic compass, Oersted was able to produce a definite
motion of the compass needle in response to the current. What began as conjecture at the start of the class session was confirmed as fact
at the end. Needless to say, Oersted had to revise his lecture notes for future classes! His serendipitous discovery paved the way for a
whole new branch of science: electromagnetics.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Detailed experiments showed that the magnetic field produced by an electric current is always oriented perpendicular to the direction of
flow. A simple method of showing this relationship is called the ''left-hand rule''. Simply stated, the left-hand rule says that
the magnetic flux lines produced by a current-carrying wire will be oriented the same direction as the curled fingers of a person's left
hand (in the &quot;hitchhiking&quot; position), with the thumb pointing in the direction of electron flow:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag5.png|Fhsst_electromag5.png]]

The magnetic field encircles this straight piece of current-carrying wire, the magnetic flux lines having no definite &quot;north&quot; or &quot;south'
poles.

'''Note: Need to add wires attracting or wires repelling''' 

While the magnetic field surrounding a current-carrying wire is indeed interesting, it is quite weak for common amounts of current, able to
deflect a compass needle and not much more. To create a stronger magnetic field force (and consequently, more field flux) with the same
amount of electric current, we can wrap the wire into a coil shape, where the circling magnetic fields around the wire will join to create
a larger field with a definite magnetic (north and south) polarity: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag6.png|Fhsst_electromag6.png]]

The amount of magnetic field force generated by a coiled wire is proportional to the current through the wire multiplied by the number
of &quot;turns&quot; or &quot;wraps&quot; of wire in the coil. This field force is called ''magnetomotive force'' (mmf), and is very much analogous to
electromotive force (E) in an electric circuit.

An ''electromagnet'' is a piece of wire intended to generate a magnetic field with the passage of electric current through it.
Though all current-carrying conductors produce magnetic fields, an electromagnet is usually constructed in such a way as to maximize the
strength of the magnetic field it produces for a special purpose. Electromagnets find frequent application in research, industry,
medical, and consumer products.

As an electrically-controllable magnet, electromagnets find application in a wide variety of &quot;electromechanical&quot; devices: machines
that effect mechanical force or motion through electrical power. Perhaps the most obvious example of such a machine is the
''electric motor''.


[[Image:Fhsst_electromag7.png|Fhsst_electromag7.png]]

Relays can be constructed to actuate multiple switch contacts, or operate them in &quot;reverse&quot; (energizing the coil will ''open'' the
switch contact, and unpowering the coil will allow it to spring closed again).

= Magnetic units of measurement =

If the burden of two systems of measurement for common quantities (English vs. metric) throws your mind into confusion, this is not the
place for you! Due to an early lack of standardization in the science of magnetism, we have been plagued with no less than three complete
systems of measurement for magnetic quantities. 

First, we need to become acquainted with the various quantities associated with magnetism. There are quite a few more quantities to
be dealt with in magnetic systems than for electrical systems. With electricity, the basic quantities are Voltage (E), Current (I),
Resistance (R), and Power (P). The first three are related to one another by Ohm's Law (''E=IR'' ; ''I=E/R'';  ''R=E/I''), while Power is related to
voltage, current, and resistance by Joule's Law (''P=IE''; &lt;math&gt;P=I^{2}R&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;P=\frac{E^{2}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;).

With magnetism, we have the following quantities to deal with:


'''Magnetomotive Force''' - The quantity of magnetic field force, or &quot;push.&quot; Analogous to electric voltage (electromotive force).


'''Field Flux''' - The quantity of total field effect, or &quot;substance&quot; of the field. Analogous to electric current.


'''Field Intensity''' - The amount of field force (mmf) distributed over the length of the electromagnet. Sometimes referred to as ''Magnetizing Force''.


'''Flux Density''' - The amount of magnetic field flux concentrated in a given area.


'''Reluctance''' - The opposition to magnetic field flux through a given volume of space or material. Analogous to electrical resistance.


'''Permeability''' - The specific measure of a material's acceptance of magnetic flux, analogous to the specific resistance of a conductive material (&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;), except inverse (greater permeability means easier passage of magnetic flux, whereas greater specific resistance means more difficult passage of electric current). 



But wait . . . the fun is just beginning! Not only do we have more quantities to keep track of with magnetism than with electricity, but
we have several different systems of unit measurement for each of these quantities. As with common quantities of length, weight,
volume, and temperature, we have both English and metric systems. However, there is actually more than one metric system of units, and
multiple metric systems are used in magnetic field measurements! One is called the ''cgs'', which stands for
'''C'''entimeter-'''G'''ram-'''S'''econd, denoting the root measures upon which the whole system is based. The other was
originally known as the ''mks'' system, which stood for '''M'''eter-'''K'''ilogram-'''S'''econd, which was later
revised into another system, called ''rmks'', standing for '''R'''ationalized '''M'''eter-'''K'''ilogram-'''S'''econd. 
This ended up being adopted as an international standard and renamed ''SI'' ('''S'''ysteme '''I'''nternational).

'''RIAAN Note: NEED TO INSERT TABLE HERE'''

And yes, the &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; symbol is really the same as the metric prefix &quot;micro.&quot; I find this especially confusing, using the exact same
alphabetical character to symbolize both a specific quantity and a general metric prefix!

As you might have guessed already, the relationship between field force, field flux, and reluctance is much the same as that between the
electrical quantities of electromotive force (E), current (I), and resistance (R). This provides something akin to an Ohm's Law for
magnetic circuits:

{| 
|A comparison of &quot;Ohm's Law&quot; for electric and magnetic circuits:
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;E=I\ R&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;mmf=\Phi \Re&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | '''Electrical'''
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | '''Magnetic'''
|}

And, given that permeability is inversely analogous to specific resistance, the equation for finding the reluctance of a magnetic
material is very similar to that for finding the resistance of a conductor:

{| 
|A comparison of electrical and magnetic opposition:
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;R=\rho \frac{1}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | '''Electrical'''
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | '''Magnetic'''
|}

In either case, a longer piece of material provides a greater opposition, all other factors being equal. Also, a larger
cross-sectional area makes for less opposition, all other factors being equal.</text>

= Electromagnetic induction =
While Oersted's surprising discovery of electromagnetism paved the way for more practical ''applications'' of electricity, it was
Michael Faraday who gave us the key to the practical ''generation'' of electricity: electromagnetic induction.
Faraday discovered that a voltage would be generated across a length of wire if that wire was exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field
flux of changing intensity.

An easy way to create a magnetic field of changing intensity is to move a permanent magnet next to a wire or coil of wire. Remember: the
magnetic field must increase or decrease in intensity ''perpendicular'' to the wire (so that the lines of flux &quot;cut
across&quot; the conductor), or else no voltage will be induced:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag9.png|Fhsst_electromag9.png]]

Faraday was able to mathematically relate the rate of change of the magnetic field flux with induced voltage (note the use of a lower-case
letter &quot;e&quot; for voltage. This refers to ''instantaneous'' voltage, or voltage at a specific point in time, rather than a steady,
stable voltage.):

{| 
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;e=N \frac{d\ \Phi}{d\ t}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''where'':
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''e'' = (Instantaneous) induced voltage in volts
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''N'' = Number of turns in wire coil (straight wire = 1) (N.B, there should be a -N for equation).
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; = Magnetic flux in webers
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''t'' = Time in seconds
|}


The &quot;d&quot; terms are standard calculus notation, representing rate-of-change of flux over time. ''&quot;N&quot;'' stands for the number of turns,
or wraps, in the wire coil (assuming that the wire is formed in the shape of a coil for maximum electromagnetic efficiency).

This phenomenon is put into obvious practical use in the construction of electrical generators, which use mechanical power to move a
magnetic field past coils of wire to generate voltage. However, this is by no means the only practical use for this principle.

If we recall that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire was always perpendicular to that wire, and that the flux
intensity of that magnetic field varied with the amount of current through it, we can see that a wire is capable of inducing a voltage
''along its own length'' simply due to a change in current through it. This effect is called ''self-induction:'' a changing
magnetic field produced by changes in current through a wire inducing voltage along the length of that same wire. If the magnetic field
flux is enhanced by bending the wire into the shape of a coil, and/or wrapping that coil around a material of high permeability, this effect
of self-induced voltage will be more intense. A device constructed to take advantage of this effect is called an ''inductor'', and will
be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter. 

A device specifically designed to produce the effect of mutual inductance between two or more coils is called a
''transformer''.

Because magnetically-induced voltage only happens when the magnetic field flux is ''changing'' in strength relative to the wire,
mutual inductance between two coils can only happen with alternating (changing - AC) voltage, and not with direct (steady - DC) voltage.
The only applications for mutual inductance in a DC system is where some means is available to switch power on and off to the coil (thus
creating a ''pulsing'' DC voltage), the induced voltage peaking at every pulse.

A very useful property of transformers is the ability to transform voltage and current levels according to a simple ratio, determined by
the ratio of input and output coil turns. If the energized coil of a transformer is energized by an AC voltage, the amount of AC voltage
induced in the unpowered coil will be equal to the input voltage multiplied by the ratio of output to input wire turns in the coils.
Conversely, the current through the windings of the output coil compared to the input coil will follow the opposite ratio: if the
voltage is increased from input coil to output coil, the current will be decreased by the same proportion. This action of the transformer
is analogous to that of mechanical gear, belt sheave, or chain sprocket ratios:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag10.png|Fhsst_electromag10.png]]

A transformer designed to output more voltage than it takes in across the input coil is called a &quot;step-up&quot; transformer, while one designed
to do the opposite is called a &quot;step-down,&quot; in reference to the transformation of voltage that takes place. The current through each
respective coil, of course, follows the exact opposite proportion.</text>

= Alternating Current =

Most students of electromagnetism begin their study with what is known as ''direct current'' (DC).
In a DC system, the current (the flow of charged particles) is in a constant direction.
In a DC system, the voltage across each part has a constant polarity.
DC is the kind of electric power made by a battery (with
definite positive and negative terminals), or the kind of charge generated by rubbing certain types of materials against each other.

As useful and as easy to understand as DC is, it is not the only &quot;kind&quot; of electric power in use. Certain sources of electric power (most
notably, rotary electro-mechanical generators) naturally produce voltages alternating in polarity, reversing positive and negative over
time. Either as a voltage switching polarity or as a current switching direction back and forth, this &quot;kind&quot; of electric power is
known as Alternating Current (AC): 

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag11.png|Fhsst_electromag11.png]]

Whereas the familiar battery symbol is used as a generic symbol for any DC voltage source, the circle with the wavy line inside is the
generic symbol for any AC voltage source. 

One might wonder why anyone would bother with such a thing as AC. It is true that in some cases AC holds no practical advantage over DC.
In applications where electricity is used to dissipate energy in the form of heat, the polarity or direction of current is irrelevant, so
long as there is enough voltage and current to the load to produce the desired heat (power dissipation). However, with AC it is possible to
build electric generators, motors and power distribution systems that are far more efficient than DC, and so we find AC used predominately
across the world in high power applications. To explain the details of why this is so, a bit of background knowledge about AC is
necessary.

If a machine is constructed to rotate a magnetic field around a set of stationary wire coils with the turning of a shaft, AC voltage will be
produced across the wire coils as that shaft is rotated, in accordance with Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. This is the basic
operating principle of an AC generator, also known as an ''alternator'':

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag12.png|Fhsst_electromag12.png]]

Notice how the polarity of the voltage across the wire coils reverses as the opposite poles of the rotating magnet pass by. Connected to a
load, this reversing voltage polarity will create a reversing current direction in the circuit. The faster the alternator's shaft is
turned, the faster the magnet will spin, resulting in an alternating voltage and current that switches directions more often in a given
amount of time.

While DC generators work on the same general principle of electromagnetic induction, their construction is not as simple as
their AC counterparts. With a DC generator, the coil of wire is mounted in the shaft where the magnet is on the AC alternator, and
electrical connections are made to this spinning coil via stationary carbon &quot;brushes&quot; contacting copper strips on the rotating shaft. All
this is necessary to switch the coil's changing output polarity to the external circuit so the external circuit sees a constant polarity:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag13.png|Fhsst_electromag13.png]]

The generator shown above will produce two pulses of voltage per revolution of the shaft, both pulses in the same direction (polarity).
In order for a DC generator to produce ''constant'' voltage, rather than brief pulses of voltage once every 1/2 revolution, there
are multiple sets of coils making intermittent contact with the brushes. The diagram shown above is a bit more simplified than what
you would see in real life.

The problems involved with making and breaking electrical contact with a moving coil should be obvious (sparking and heat), especially if the
shaft of the generator is revolving at high speed. If the atmosphere surrounding the machine contains flammable or explosive vapors, the
practical problems of spark-producing brush contacts are even greater. An AC generator (alternator) does not require brushes and commutators
to work, and so is immune to these problems experienced by DC generators.

The benefits of AC over DC with regard to generator design is also reflected in electric motors. While DC motors require the use of
brushes to make electrical contact with moving coils of wire, AC motors do not. In fact, AC and DC motor designs are very similar to
their generator counterparts (identical for the sake of this tutorial), the AC motor being dependent upon the reversing magnetic
field produced by alternating current through its stationary coils of wire to rotate the rotating magnet around on its shaft, and the DC
motor being dependent on the brush contacts making and breaking connections to reverse current through the rotating coil every 1/2
rotation (180 degrees). 

So we know that AC generators and AC motors tend to be simpler than DC generators and DC motors. This relative simplicity translates into
greater reliability and lower cost of manufacture. But what else is AC good for? Surely there must be more to it than design details of
generators and motors! Indeed there is. There is an effect of electromagnetism known as ''mutual induction'', whereby two or
more coils of wire placed so that the changing magnetic field created by one induces a voltage in the other. If we have two mutually
inductive coils and we energize one coil with AC, we will create an AC voltage in the other coil. When used as such, this device is known as
a ''transformer'':

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag14.png|Fhsst_electromag14.png]]

The fundamental significance of a transformer is its ability to step voltage up or down from the powered coil to the unpowered coil. The
AC voltage induced in the unpowered (&quot;secondary&quot;) coil is equal to the AC voltage across the powered (&quot;primary&quot;) coil multiplied by the ratio
of secondary coil turns to primary coil turns. If the secondary coil is powering a load, the current through the secondary coil is just the
opposite: primary coil current multiplied by the ratio of primary to secondary turns. This relationship has a very close mechanical
analogy, using torque and speed to represent voltage and current, respectively:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag15.png|Fhsst_electromag15.png]]

If the winding ratio is reversed so that the primary coil has less turns than the secondary coil, the transformer &quot;steps up&quot; the voltage
from the source level to a higher level at the load: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag16.png|Fhsst_electromag16.png]]

The transformer's ability to step AC voltage up or down with ease gives AC an advantage unmatched by DC in the realm of power
distribution. When transmitting electrical power over long distances, it is far more efficient to do so with stepped-up voltages and
stepped-down currents (smaller-diameter wire with less resistive power losses), then step the voltage back down and the current back up for
industry, business, or consumer use use.


[[Image:Fhsst_electromag17.png|Fhsst_electromag17.png]]

Transformer technology has made long-range electric power distribution practical. Without the ability to efficiently step voltage up and
down, it would be cost-prohibitive to construct power systems for anything but close-range (within a few miles at most) use.

As useful as transformers are, they only work with AC, not DC. Because the phenomenon of mutual inductance relies on
''changing'' magnetic fields, and direct current (DC) can only produce steady magnetic fields, transformers simply will not work with
direct current. Of course, direct current may be interrupted (pulsed) through the primary winding of a transformer to create a changing
magnetic field (as is done in automotive ignition systems to produce high-voltage spark plug power from a low-voltage DC battery), but
pulsed DC is not that different from AC. Perhaps more than any other reason, this is why AC finds such widespread application in power
systems.

If we were to follow the changing voltage produced by a coil in an alternator from any point on the sine wave graph to that point when
the wave shape begins to repeat itself, we would have marked exactly one ''cycle'' of that wave. This is most easily shown by
spanning the distance between identical peaks, but may be measured between any corresponding points on the graph. The degree marks on
the horizontal axis of the graph represent the domain of the trigonometric sine function, and also the angular position of our
simple two-pole alternator shaft as it rotates:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag18.png|Fhsst_electromag18.png]]

Since the horizontal axis of this graph can mark the passage of time as well as shaft position in degrees, the dimension marked for one
cycle is often measured in a unit of time, most often seconds or fractions of a second. When expressed as a measurement, this is often
called the ''period'' of a wave. The period of a wave in degrees is ''always'' 360, but the amount of time one period occupies
depends on the rate voltage oscillates back and forth. 

A more popular measure for describing the alternating rate of an AC voltage or current wave than ''period'' is the rate of that
back-and-forth oscillation. This is called ''frequency''. The modern unit for frequency is the hertz (abbreviated Hz), which
represents the number of wave cycles completed during one second of time. In the United States of America, the standard power-line
frequency is 60 Hz, meaning that the AC voltage oscillates at a rate of 60 complete back-and-forth cycles every second. In Europe, where
the power system frequency is 50 Hz, the AC voltage only completes 50 cycles every second. A radio station transmitter broadcasting at a
frequency of 100 MHz generates an AC voltage oscillating at a rate of 100 ''million'' cycles every second.

Period and frequency are mathematical reciprocals of one another. That is to say, if a wave has a period of 10 seconds, its frequency
will be 0.1 Hz, or 1/10 of a cycle per second: 

&lt;math&gt;\ Frequency\ in\ hertz = \frac{1}{Period\ in\ seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

An instrument called an ''oscilloscope'' is used to display a changing voltage over time on a graphical screen. You may be familiar
with the appearance of an ''ECG'' or ''EKG'' (electrocardiograph) machine, used by physicians to graph the
oscillations of a patient's heart over time. The ECG is a special-purpose oscilloscope expressly designed for medical use.
General-purpose oscilloscopes have the ability to display voltage from virtually any voltage source, plotted as a graph with time as the
independent variable. The relationship between period and frequency is very useful to know when displaying an AC voltage or current
waveform on an oscilloscope screen. By measuring the period of the wave (in seconds) on the horizontal axis of the oscilloscope screen and
reciprocating that time value, you can determine the frequency in hertz.

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag19.png|Fhsst_electromag19.png]]

Voltage and current are by no means the only physical variables subject to variation over time. Much more common to our everyday
experience is ''sound'', which is nothing more than the alternating compression and decompression (pressure waves) of air
molecules, interpreted by our ears as a physical sensation. Because alternating current is a wave phenomenon, it shares many of the
properties of other wave phenomena, like sound. For this reason, sound (especially structured music) provides an excellent analogy for
relating AC concepts.

In musical terms, frequency is equivalent to ''pitch''. Low-pitch notes such as those produced by a tuba or bassoon consist of
air molecule vibrations that are relatively slow (low frequency). High-pitch notes such as those produced by a flute or whistle consist
of the same type of vibrations in the air, only vibrating at a much faster rate (higher frequency). Here is a table showing the actual
frequencies for a range of common musical notes:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag20.png|Fhsst_electromag20.png]]

Astute observers will notice that all notes on the table bearing the same letter designation are related by a frequency ratio of 2:1. For
example, the first frequency shown (designated with the letter &quot;A&quot;) is 220 Hz. The next highest &quot;A&quot; note has a frequency of 440 Hz -
exactly twice as many sound wave cycles per second. The same 2:1 ratio holds true for the first A sharp (233.08 Hz) and the next A
sharp (466.16 Hz), and for all note pairs found in the table.

Audibly, two notes whose frequencies are exactly double each other sound remarkably similar. This similarity in sound is musically
recognized, the shortest span on a musical scale separating such note pairs being called an ''octave''. Following this rule, the next
highest &quot;A&quot; note (one octave above 440 Hz) will be 880 Hz, the next lowest &quot;A&quot; (one octave below 220 Hz) will be 110 Hz. A view of a
piano keyboard helps to put this scale into perspective:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag21.png|Fhsst_electromag21.png]]

As you can see, one octave is equal to ''eight'' white keys' worth of distance on a piano keyboard. The familiar musical mnemonic
(doe-ray-mee-fah-so-lah-tee-doe) - yes, the same pattern immortalized in the whimsical Rodgers and Hammerstein song sung in ''The
Sound of Music'' - covers one octave from C to C.

While electromechanical alternators and many other physical phenomena naturally produce sine waves, this is not the only kind of alternating
wave in existence. Other &quot;waveforms&quot; of AC are commonly produced within electronic circuitry. Here are but a few sample waveforms and
their common designations:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag22.png|Fhsst_electromag22.png]]

These waveforms are by no means the only kinds of waveforms in existence. They're simply a few that are common enough to have been
given distinct names. Even in circuits that are supposed to manifest &quot;pure&quot; sine, square, triangle, or sawtooth voltage/current waveforms,
the real-life result is often a distorted version of the intended waveshape. Some waveforms are so complex that they defy
classification as a particular &quot;type&quot; (including waveforms associated with many kinds of musical instruments). Generally speaking, any
waveshape bearing close resemblance to a perfect sine wave is termed ''sinusoidal'', anything different being labeled as
''non-sinusoidal''. Being that the waveform of an AC voltage or current is crucial to its impact in a circuit, we need to be aware of
the fact that AC waves come in a variety of shapes.</text>

= Measurements of AC magnitude =

So far we know that AC voltage alternates in polarity and AC current alternates in direction. We also know that AC can alternate in a
variety of different ways, and by tracing the alternation over time we can plot it as a &quot;waveform.&quot; We can measure the rate of alternation
by measuring the time it takes for a wave to evolve before it repeats itself (the &quot;period&quot;), and express this as cycles per unit time, or
&quot;frequency.&quot; In music, frequency is the same as ''pitch'', which is the essential property distinguishing one note from another.

However, we encounter a measurement problem if we try to express how large or small an AC quantity is. With DC, where quantities of
voltage and current are generally stable, we have little trouble expressing how much voltage or current we have in any part of a
circuit. But how do you grant a single measurement of magnitude to something that is constantly changing?

One way to express the intensity, or magnitude (also called the ''amplitude''), of an AC quantity is to measure its peak height
on a waveform graph. This is known as the ''peak'' or ''crest'' value of an AC waveform:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag23.png|Fhsst_electromag23.png]]

Another way is to measure the total height between opposite peaks. This is known as the ''peak-to-peak'' (P-P) value of an AC
waveform:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag24.png|Fhsst_electromag24.png]]

Unfortunately, either one of these expressions of waveform amplitude can be misleading when comparing two different types of waves. For
example, a square wave peaking at 10 volts is obviously a greater amount of voltage for a greater amount of time than a triangle wave
peaking at 10 volts. The effects of these two AC voltages powering a load would be quite different:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag25.png|Fhsst_electromag25.png]]

One way of expressing the amplitude of different waveshapes in a more equivalent fashion is to mathematically average the values of all the
points on a waveform's graph to a single, aggregate number. This amplitude measure is known simply as the ''average'' value of the
waveform. If we average all the points on the waveform algebraically (that is, to consider their ''sign'', either positive or
negative), the average value for most waveforms is technically zero, because all the positive points cancel out all the negative points
over a full cycle:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag26.png|Fhsst_electromag26.png]]

This, of course, will be true for any waveform having equal-area portions above and below the &quot;zero&quot; line of a plot. However, as a
''practical'' measure of a waveform's aggregate value, &quot;average&quot; is usually defined as the mathematical mean of all the points'
''absolute values'' over a cycle. In other words, we calculate the practical average value of the waveform by considering all points
on the wave as positive quantities, as if the waveform looked like this:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag27.png|Fhsst_electromag27.png]]

Polarity-insensitive mechanical meter movements (meters designed to respond equally to the positive and negative half-cycles of an
alternating voltage or current) register in proportion to the waveform's (practical) average value, because the inertia of the
pointer against the tension of the spring naturally averages the force produced by the varying voltage/current values over time. Conversely,
polarity-sensitive meter movements vibrate uselessly if exposed to AC voltage or current, their needles oscillating rapidly about the zero
mark, indicating the true (algebraic) average value of zero for a symmetrical waveform. When the &quot;average&quot; value of a waveform is
referenced in this text, it will be assumed that the &quot;practical&quot; definition of average is intended unless otherwise specified.

Another method of deriving an aggregate value for waveform amplitude is based on the waveform's ability to do useful work when applied to a
load resistance. Unfortunately, an AC measurement based on work performed by a waveform is not the same as that waveform's &quot;average&quot;
value, because the ''power'' dissipated by a given load (work performed per unit time) is not directly proportional to the magnitude
of either the voltage or current impressed upon it. Rather, power is proportional to the ''square'' of the voltage or current applied
to a resistance (P = E/R, and P = IR). Although the mathematics of such an amplitude measurement might not be straightforward, the utility of it is.

Consider a bandsaw and a jigsaw, two pieces of modern woodworking equipment. Both types of saws cut with a thin, toothed, motor-powered
metal blade to cut wood. But while the bandsaw uses a continuous motion of the blade to cut, the jigsaw uses a back-and-forth motion.
The comparison of alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) may be likened to the comparison of these two saw types:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag28.png|Fhsst_electromag28.png]]

The problem of trying to describe the changing quantities of AC voltage or current in a single, aggregate measurement is also present
in this saw analogy: how might we express the speed of a jigsaw blade? A bandsaw blade moves with a constant speed, similar to the way DC
voltage pushes or DC current moves with a constant magnitude. A jigsaw blade, on the other hand, moves back and forth, its blade speed
constantly changing. What is more, the back-and-forth motion of any two jigsaws may not be of the same type, depending on the mechanical
design of the saws. One jigsaw might move its blade with a sine-wave motion, while another with a triangle-wave motion. To rate a jigsaw
based on its ''peak'' blade speed would be quite misleading when comparing one jigsaw to another (or a jigsaw with a bandsaw!).
Despite the fact that these different saws move their blades in different manners, they are equal in one respect: they all cut wood,
and a quantitative comparison of this common function can serve as a common basis for which to rate blade speed.

Picture a jigsaw and bandsaw side-by-side, equipped with identical blades (same tooth pitch, angle, etc.), equally capable of cutting the
same thickness of the same type of wood at the same rate. We might say that the two saws were equivalent or equal in their cutting
capacity. Might this comparison be used to assign a &quot;bandsaw equivalent&quot; blade speed to the jigsaw's back-and-forth blade motion 
to relate the wood-cutting effectiveness of one to the other? This is the general idea used to assign a &quot;DC equivalent&quot; measurement to any
AC voltage or current: whatever magnitude of DC voltage or current would produce the same amount of heat energy dissipation through an
equal resistance:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag29.png|Fhsst_electromag29.png]]

Suppose we were to wrap a coil of insulated wire around a loop of ferromagnetic material and energize this coil with an AC voltage
source:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag30.png|Fhsst_electromag30.png]]

As an inductor, we would expect this iron-core coil to oppose the applied voltage with its inductive reactance, limiting current through
the coil as predicted by the equations &lt;math&gt;X_L= 2\pi\ fL&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I=E/X&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;I=E/Z&lt;/math&gt;). For the purposes of this example, though, we need to take
a more detailed look at the interactions of voltage, current, and magnetic flux in the device.

Kirchhoff's voltage law describes how the algebraic sum of all voltages in a loop must equal zero. In this example, we could apply
this fundamental law of electricity to describe the respective voltages of the source and of the inductor coil. Here, as in any
one-source, one-load circuit, the voltage dropped across the load must equal the voltage supplied by the source, assuming zero voltage
dropped along the resistance of any connecting wires. In other words, the load (inductor coil) must produce an opposing voltage equal in
magnitude to the source, in order that it may balance against the source voltage and produce an algebraic loop voltage sum of zero.
From where does this opposing voltage arise? If the load were a resistor, the opposing voltage would originate from the &quot;friction&quot; of
electrons flowing through the resistance of the resistor. With a perfect inductor (no resistance in the coil wire), the opposing
voltage comes from another mechanism: the ''reaction'' to a changing magnetic flux in the iron core.

Michael Faraday discovered the mathematical relationship between magnetic flux (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;)and induced voltage with this equation: 

{| 
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;E=N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''where'':
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''e'' = (Instantaneous) induced voltage in volts
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''N'' = Number of turns in wire coil (straight wire = 1)
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; = Magnetic flux in webers
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | ''t'' = Time in seconds
|}

The instantaneous voltage (voltage dropped at any instant in time) across a wire coil is equal to the number of turns of that coil around
the core (N) multiplied by the instantaneous rate-of-change in magnetic flux (d\Phi /dt) linking with the coil. Graphed, this shows 
itself as a set of sine waves (assuming a sinusoidal voltage source), the flux wave &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; lagging behind the voltage wave: 

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag31.png|Fhsst_electromag31.png]]

Magnetic flux through a ferromagnetic material is analogous to current through a conductor: it must be motivated by some force in order to
occur. In electric circuits, this motivating force is voltage (a.k.a. electromotive force, or EMF). In magnetic &quot;circuits,&quot; this
motivating force is ''magnetomotive force'', or ''mmf''. Magnetomotive force (mmf) and magnetic flux (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) are related to 
each other by a property of magnetic materials known as ''reluctance'' (the latter quantity symbolized by a strange-looking letter &quot;R&quot; (&lt;math&gt;\Re&lt;/math&gt;)):

{| 
|A comparison of &quot;Ohm's Law&quot; for electric and magnetic circuits:
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;E=I\ R&lt;/math&gt;
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;mmf=\Phi \Re&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | '''Electrical'''
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | '''Magnetic'''
|}


In our example, the mmf required to produce this changing magnetic flux (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) must be supplied by a changing current through the coil. 
Magnetomotive force generated by an electromagnet coil is equal to the amount of current through that coil (in amps) multiplied by the number
of turns of that coil around the core (the SI unit for mmf is the ''amp-turn''). Because the mathematical relationship between
magnetic flux and mmf is directly proportional, and because the mathematical relationship between mmf and current is also directly
proportional (no rates-of-change present in either equation), the current through the coil will be in-phase with the flux wave:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag32.png|Fhsst_electromag32.png]]

This is why alternating current through an inductor lags the applied voltage waveform by &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: because that is what is required to 
produce a changing magnetic flux whose rate-of-change produces an opposing voltage in-phase with the applied voltage. Due to its
function in providing magnetizing force (mmf) for the core, this current is sometimes referred to as the ''magnetizing current''.

It should be mentioned that the current through an iron-core inductor is not perfectly sinusoidal (sine-wave shaped), due to the nonlinear
B/H magnetization curve of iron. In fact, if the inductor is cheaply built, using as little iron as possible, the magnetic flux density
might reach high levels (approaching saturation), resulting in a magnetizing current waveform that looks something like this:

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag33.png|Fhsst_electromag33.png]]

When a ferromagnetic material approaches magnetic flux saturation, disproportionately greater levels of magnetic field force (mmf) are
required to deliver equal increases in magnetic field flux (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;). Because mmf is proportional to current through the magnetizing coil
(mmf = NI, where &quot;N&quot; is the number of turns of wire in the coil and &quot;I&quot; is the current through it), the large increases of mmf required to
supply the needed increases in flux results in large increases in coil current. Thus, coil current increases dramatically at the peaks in
order to maintain a flux waveform that isn't distorted, accounting for the bell-shaped half-cycles of the current waveform in the above plot.

The situation is further complicated by energy losses within the iron core. The effects of hysteresis and eddy currents conspire to further
distort and complicate the current waveform, making it even less sinusoidal and altering its phase to be lagging slightly less than
&lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; behind the applied voltage waveform. This coil current resulting from the sum total of all magnetic effects in the core
(d&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;/dt magnetization plus hysteresis losses, eddy current losses, etc.) is called the ''exciting current''. The distortion of an
iron-core inductor's exciting current may be minimized if it is designed for and operated at very low flux densities. Generally
speaking, this requires a core with large cross-sectional area, which tends to make the inductor bulky and expensive. For the sake of
simplicity, though, we'll assume that our example core is far from saturation and free from all losses, resulting in a perfectly
sinusoidal exciting current.

As we've seen already in the inductors chapter, having a current waveform &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; out of phase with the voltage waveform creates a 
condition where power is alternately absorbed and returned to the circuit by the inductor. If the inductor is perfect (no wire
resistance, no magnetic core losses, etc.), it will dissipate zero power.

Let us now consider the same inductor device, except this time with a second coil wrapped around the same iron core. The first coil will be
labeled the ''primary'' coil, while the second will be labeled the ''secondary'':

[[Image:Fhsst_electromag34.png|Fhsst_electromag34.png]]

If this secondary coil experiences the same magnetic flux change as the primary (which it should, assuming perfect containment of the
magnetic flux through the common core), and has the same number of turns around the core, a voltage of equal magnitude and phase to the
applied voltage will be induced along its length. In the following graph, the induced voltage waveform is drawn slightly smaller than the
source voltage waveform simply to distinguish one from the other:

Atoms are the building blocks of matter. They are the basis of all the structures and organisms in the universe. The
planets, the sun, grass and trees, the air we breathe, and people are all made up of atoms.

There are approximately 100 different types of atom, although many of these exist in very small quantities. Every chemical element is one type of atom, such as hydrogen (H), aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe).</text>

= Structure of the Atom =

Atoms are very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye nor can they be seen in microscopes using the eye.  One million atoms fit across the width of a strand of hair.

They consist of two main parts: the positively charged '''nucleus''' at the centre and the negatively charged elementary particles called '''electrons''' which surround the nucleus in their '''orbitals'''. (''Elementary'' particle means that the electron cannot be broken down to anything smaller and can be
thought of as a point particle.) The nucleus of an atom is made up of a collection of positively charged '''protons''' and neutral particles called '''neutrons'''.

Interesting fact: the neutrons and protons are ''not'' elementary particles. They are actually made up of even smaller particles called quarks. Both protons and neutrons are made of three quarks each. There are all sorts of other particles composed of quarks which nuclear physicists study using huge detectors - you can find out more about this by reading the essay in Chapter ??

&lt;br/&gt;
'''NOTE''' :Insert diagram of atomic structure - see lab posters

Atoms are electrically neutral which means that they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons. The number of
protons in an atom is called the '''atomic number''' which is sometimes also called '''Z'''. 

&lt;br/&gt;
'''NOTE''' :check A and Z 

The atomic number is what distinguishes the different chemical elements in the Periodic table from each other. In fact, the elements are
listed on the Periodic table in order of their atomic numbers. For example, the first element, hydrogen (H), has one proton whereas
the sixth element, carbon (C) has 6 protons. Atoms with the same number of protons (atomic number) share physical properties and
show similar chemical behaviour. The number of neutrons ''plus'' protons in the nucleus is called the '''atomic
mass''' of the atom.</text>

= Isotopes =

Two atoms are considered to be the same element if they have the same number of protons (atomic number). However, they do not have
to have the same number of neutrons or overall atomic mass. Atoms which have the same number of protons but different numbers of
neutrons are called '''isotopes'''. For example, the hydrogen atom has one proton and no neutrons. Therefore its atomic number
is Z=1 and atomic mass is A=1. If a neutron is added to the hydrogen nucleus, then a new atom is formed with atomic mass A=2
but atomic number is still Z=1. This atom is called deuterium and is an isotope of hydrogen.</text>

= Energy quantization and electron configuration =

The electrons which inhabit the space surrounding the nucleus are not able to have arbitrary energies.  In fact they are restricted to a discrete set of energies while they are trapped in an atom.  This discretization of energy values is known as &quot;quantization&quot;, meaning that the allowed energies are separated by discrete energy differences, known as &quot;quanta&quot;.

This startling behavior arises from the wavelike nature of electrons and the Schröedinger equation which governs them, both topics which should be addressed in a quantum physics course.  Suffice it to say that when particles are in free space (meaning there are no potentials present), the allowed energy values are continuous.  However, when they are within a potential, for instance in the potential generated by protons in the nucleus of an atom, their energy values become quantized.

The effects of this quantization are profound.  Essentially all of the other natural sciences - chemistry, biology, and other derived sciences rely primarily on the atomic behavior resulting from this quantization.

These energy levels are associated with distances from the nucleus (quantum physics introduces a caveat here).  That is, the higher the energy of an electron, the further it is from the nucleus.  For some time between Rutherford's discovery of the nucleus-electron system within the atom and the development of quantum physics, electrons were pictured around the nucleus as planets in a solar system.  In fact, an impressive body of correct predictions can be made using this classical orbit model, but eventually quantum mechanics must take over to provide the &quot;complete&quot; picture.  It turns out that electrons exist as &quot;wavefunctions&quot;.  They can only be described by a field of probabilities for finding them at some location.  These 3-D probability functions can be for visual purposes encapsulated by surfaces:

&lt;&lt;A nifty picture of 3-D electron orbitals would be great...anyone?  anyone?&gt;&gt;


When researchers were first beginning to understand the electrical structure of the atom, the primary tool was the spectrometer.</text>

= Successive ionization energies to provide evidence for arrangement of electrons into core and valence =

[Brink and Jones sections: de Broglie - matter shows particle and wave characteristics, proved by Davisson and Germer. Shroedinger
and Heisenberg developed this model into quantum mechanics] 

The nucleus (atomic nucleus) is the center of an atom. It is composed of one or more protons and usually some neutrons as well.
The number of protons in an atom's nucleus is called the atomic number, and determines which element the atom is (for example
hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, etc.).

Though the positively charged protons exert a repulsive electromagnetic force on each other, the distances between nuclear
particles are small enough that the strong interaction (which is stronger than the electromagnetic force but decreases more rapidly
with distance) predominates. (The gravitational attraction is negligible, being a factor 1036 weaker than this electromagnetic
repulsion.)

The discovery of the electron was the first indication that the atom had internal structure. This structure was initially imagined
according to the &quot;raisin cookie&quot; or &quot;plum pudding&quot; model, in which the small, negatively charged electrons were embedded in a large
sphere containing all the positive charge. Ernest Rutherford and Marsden, however, discovered in 1911 that alpha particles from a
radium source were sometimes scattered backwards from a gold foil, indicating that there must be a dense concentration of positive charge at the center of the atom.  This discovery led to the acceptance of a planetary model, 
in which the electrons orbited a tiny nucleus in the same way that the planets orbit the sun.

Interesting Fact: The word atom is derived from the Greek atomos, indivisible, from a-, not, and tomos, a cut.

An atom is the smallest portion into which a chemical element can be divided while still retaining its properties. Atoms are the
basic constituents of molecules and ordinary matter. Atoms are composed of subatomic particles.

Atoms are composed mostly of empty space, but also of smaller subatomic particles. At the center of the atom is a tiny positive
nucleus composed of nucleons (protons and neutrons). The rest of the atom contains only the fairly flexible electron shells.
Usually atoms are electrically neutral with as many electrons as protons.

Atoms are generally classified by their atomic number, which corresponds to the number of protons in the atom. For example,
carbon atoms are those atoms containing 6 protons. All atoms with the same atomic number share a wide variety of physical properties
and exhibit the same chemical behavior. The various kinds of atoms are listed in the Periodic table. Atoms having the same atomic
number, but different atomic masses (due to their different numbers of neutrons), are called isotopes.

The simplest atom is the hydrogen atom, having atomic number 1 and consisting of one proton and one electron. It has been the subject
of much interest in science, particularly in the early development of quantum theory.

The chemical behavior of atoms is largely due to interactions between the electrons. In particular the electrons in the
outermost shell, called the valence electrons, have the greatest influence on chemical behavior. Core electrons (those not in the
outer shell) play a role, but it is usually in terms of a secondary effect due to screening of the positive charge in the
atomic nucleus.

There is a strong tendency for atoms to completely fill (or empty) the outer electron shell, which in hydrogen and helium has space
for two electrons, and in all other atoms has space for eight. This is achieved either by sharing electrons with neighboring
atoms or by completely removing electrons from other atoms. When electrons are shared a covalent bond is formed between the two
atoms. Covalent bonds are the strongest type of atomic bond. 

When one or more electrons are completely removed from one atom by another, ions are formed. Ions are atoms that possess a net charge 
due to an imbalance in the number of protons and electrons. The ion that stole the electron(s) is called an anion and is
negatively charged. The atom that lost the electron(s) is called a cation and is positively charged. Cations and anions are attracted
to each other due to coulombic forces between the positive and negative charges. This attraction is called ionic bonding and is
weaker than covalent bonding.

As mentioned above covalent bonding implies a state in which electrons are shared equally between atoms, while ionic bonding
implies that the electrons are completely confined to the anion. Except for a limited number of extreme cases, neither of these
pictures is completely accurate. In most cases of covalent bonding, the electron is unequally shared, spending more time
around the more electronegative atom, resulting in the covalent bond having some ionic character. Similarly, in ionic bonding the
electrons often spend a small fraction of time around the more electropositive atom, resulting in some covalent character for the
ionic bond. 

Models of the atom

* Democritus' shaped-atom model (for want of a better name)
* The plum pudding model
* Cubical atom
* The Bohr model
* The quantum mechanical model

The Plum pudding model of the atom was made after the discovery of the electron but before the discovery of the proton or neutron. In
it, the atom is envisioned as electrons surrounded by a soup of positive charge, like plums surrounded by pudding. This model was
disproved by an experiment by Ernest Rutherford when he discovered the nucleus of the atom.

The Bohr Model is a physical model that depicts the atom as a small positively charged nucleus with electrons in orbit at
different levels, similar in structure to the solar system. Because of its simplicity, the Bohr model is still commonly used
and taught today.

In the early part of the 20th century, experiments by Ernest Rutherford and others had established that atoms consisted of a
small dense positively charged nucleus surrounded by orbiting negatively charged electrons.  However, theoretical predictions and experimental evidence quickly began to cast doubt on the classical orbital model. 

The simplest possible atom is hydrogen, which consists of a positively charged proton and a negatively charged orbiting electron.  According to the orbital model of the atom, since the nucleus (the proton) and the electron are oppositely charged they will attract one another by coulomb force, in the same way that the Sun
attracts the Earth with the gravitational force.  However, if the electron orbits the nucleus in a classical orbit, it is undergoing a central acceleration, and ought to emit
electromagnetic radiation (light) according to well established theories of electromagnetism.  If the orbiting electron radiates as it orbits, it must lose energy and therefore spiral into the nucleus in a very short time, which clearly does not occur.  

Also, it was well known at the time that atoms emit light only at certain frequencies - the frequencies at which an atom can radiate are known as the spectra of the atom.  It was clear that the emission of light by atoms was due to electrons radiating.  However, if the electrons are simply orbiting the nucleus classically like planets, there is no reason for the spectra - one would expect the electrons to emit radiation in a continuous frequency spectrum.  It soon became clear that something was very wrong with the orbital description of the atom.  

These difficulties were resolved in 1913 by Niels Bohr who proposed that:

* (1) The orbiting electrons existed in orbits that had discrete quantized energies. That is, not every orbit is possible but only certain specific ones. The exact energies of the allowed orbits depends on the atom in question.
* (2) The laws of classical mechanics do not apply when electrons make the jump from one allowed orbit to another.
* (3) When an electron makes a jump from one orbit to another the energy difference is carried off (or supplied) by a single quantum of light (called a photon) which has a frequency that directly depends on the energy difference between the two orbitals.

&lt;math&gt;f = E / h &lt;/math&gt;

where f is the frequency of the photon, E the energy difference, and h is a constant of proportionality known as Planck's constant. Defining we can write

where ?? is the angular frequency of the photon.

* (4) The allowed orbits depend on quantized (discrete) values of orbital angular momentum, L according to the equation

Where n = 1,2,3, and is called the angular momentum quantum number.

These assumptions explained many of the observations seen at the time, such as why spectra consist of discrete lines. Assumption 4)
states that the lowest value of n is 1. This corresponds to a smallest possible radius (for the mathematics see
Ohanian-principles of physics or any of the large, usually American, college introductory physics textbooks) of 0.0529 nm.
This is known as the Bohr radius, and explains why atoms are stable. Once an electron is in the lowest orbit, it can go no
further. It cannot emit any more light because it would need to go into a lower orbit, but it can't do that if it is already in the
lowest allowed orbit. 

The Bohr model is sometimes known as the semiclassical model because although it does include some ideas of quantum mechanics
it is not a full quantum mechanical description of the atom. Assumption 2) states that the laws of classical mechanics don't
apply during a quantum jump but doesn't state what laws should replace classical mechanics. Assumption 4) states that angular
momentum is quantised but does not explain why.

In order to fully describe an atom we need to use the full theory of quantum mechanics, which was worked out by a number of people
in the years following the Bohr model. This theory treats the electrons as waves, which create 3D standing wave patterns in the
atom. (This is why quantum mechanics is sometimes called wave mechanics.) This theory considers that idea of electrons as being
little billiard ball like particles that travel round in orbits as absurdly wrong  instead electrons form probability clouds. You
might find the electron here with a certain probability; you might find it over there with a different probability. However it is
interesting to note that if you work out the average radius of an electron in the lowest possible energy state it turns out to be
exactly equal to the Bohr radius (although it takes many more pages of mathematics to work it out).

The full quantum mechanics theory is a beautiful theory that has been experimentally tested and found to be incredibly accurate,
however it is mathematically much more advanced, and often using the much simpler Bohr model will get you the results with much
less hassle. The thing to remember is that it is only a model, an aid to understanding. Atoms are not really little solar systems.

= Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle =

Quantum mechanics is a physical theory that describes the behavior of physical systems at short distances. Quantum mechanics provides
a mathematical framework derived from a small set of basic principles capable of producing experimental predictions for three
types of phenomena that classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics cannot account for: quantization, wave-particle
duality, and quantum entanglement. The related terms quantum physics and quantum theory are sometimes used as synonyms of
quantum mechanics, but also to denote a superset of theories, including pre-quantum mechanics old quantum theory, or, when the
term quantum mechanics is used in a more restricted sense, to include theories like quantum field theory.

Quantum mechanics is the underlying theory of many fields of physics and chemistry, including condensed matter physics, quantum
chemistry, and particle physics.</text>

= Pauli exclusion principle =

The Pauli exclusion principle is a quantum mechanical principle which states that no two identical fermions may occupy the same
quantum state. Formulated by Wolfgang Pauli in 1925, it is also referred to as the &quot;exclusion principle&quot; or &quot;Pauli principle.&quot;

The Pauli principle only applies to fermions, particles which form antisymmetric quantum states and have half-integer spin. Fermions
include protons, neutrons, and electrons, the three types of elementary particles which constitute ordinary matter. The Pauli
exclusion principle governs many of the distinctive characteristics of matter. Particles like the photon and graviton
do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle, because they are bosons (i.e. they form symmetric quantum states and have integer spin)
rather than fermions.

The Pauli exclusion principle plays a role in a huge number of physical phenomena. One of the most important, and the one for
which it was originally formulated, is the electron shell structure of atoms. An electrically neutral atom contains bound
electrons equal in number to the protons in the nucleus. Since electrons are fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle forbids them
from occupying the same quantum state.
 
For example, consider a neutral helium atom, which has two bound electrons. Both of these electrons can occupy the lowest-energy
(1s) states by acquiring opposite spin. This does not violate the Pauli principle because spin is part of the quantum state of the
electron, so the two electrons are occupying different quantum states. However, the spin can take only two different values (or
eigenvalues.) In a lithium atom, which contains three bound electrons, the third electron cannot fit into a 1s state, and has
to occupy one of the higher-energy 2s states instead. Similarly, successive elements produce successively higher-energy shells. The
chemical properties of an element largely depends on the number of electrons in the outermost shell, which gives rise to the periodic
table of the elements.

The Pauli principle is also responsible for the large-scale stability of matter. Molecules cannot be pushed arbitrarily close
together, because the bound electrons in each molecule are forbidden from entering the same state as the electrons in the
other molecules - this is the reason for the repulsive r-12 term in the Lennard-Jones potential. The Pauli principle is the reason
you do not fall through the floor.

Astronomy provides the most spectacular demonstrations of this effect, in the form of white dwarf stars and neutron stars. In
both types of objects, the usual atomic structures are disrupted by large gravitational forces, leaving the constituents supported
only by a &quot;degeneracy pressure&quot; produced by the Pauli exclusion principle. This exotic form of matter is known as degenerate
matter. In white dwarfs, the atoms are held apart by the degeneracy pressure of the electrons. In neutron stars, which
exhibit even larger gravitational forces, the electrons have merged with the protons to form neutrons, which produce a larger
degeneracy pressure.

Another physical phenomenon for which the Pauli principle is responsible is ferromagnetic, in which the exclusion effect
implies an exchange energy that induces neighboring electron spins to align (whereas classically they would anti-align).</text>

==Capacity for bonding==

Covalent bonding is a form of chemical bonding characterized by the sharing of one or more pairs of electrons, by two atoms. In
order to produce a mutual attraction  atoms tend to share electrons, so as to fill their outer electron shells. Such bonds
are always stronger than the intermolecular hydrogen bond and similar in strength or stronger than the ionic bond. Commonly
covalent bond implies the sharing of just a single pair of electrons. The sharing of two pairs is called a double bond and
three pairs is called a triple bond. Aromatic rings of atoms and other resonant structures are held together by covalent bonds that
are intermediate between single and double. The triple bond is relatively rare in nature, and two atoms are not observed to bond
more than triply.

Covalent bonding most frequently occurs between atoms with similar electronegativities, where neither atom can provide sufficient
energy to completely remove an electron from the other atom. Covalent bonds are more common between non-metals, whereas ionic
bonding is more common between two metal atoms or a metal and a non-metal atom.

Covalent bonding tends to be stronger than other types of bonding, such as ionic bonding. In addition unlike ionic bonding, where
ions are held together by a non-directional coulombic attraction, covalent bonds are highly directional. As a result, covalently
bonded molecules tend to form in a relatively small number of characteristic shapes, exhibiting specific bonding angles.</text>

__TOC__

'''Ada 83''' is the first version of the [[Wikipedia:Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language]]. It was based in the so called [[Ada Programming/Ada 80|Ada 80]], a preliminary version of the language formally known as MIL-STD-1815 (published in December 1980). This standard was refined and standardized by the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|DoD]] and [[Wikipedia:American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] as '''ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A''' in February 1983 (note the additional 'A' at the end), which was later adopted by [[Wikipedia:International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization]] as ISO/IEC 8652:1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Personal computers (PC) have a large number of ports to which you could add you own hardware to control your robot. Some of these are very easy to use, while others are nearly impossible without special (expensive) ICs. Not all of these interfaces are available on all computers. This section gives an overview of some of the best known ports on a PC. These ports and their uses are well document all over the internet. 

===External Ports===
These are all the ports that are available on the outside of a PC. Most computer users are familiar with them (or at least know them by name and looks). 

====Serial Port====
The serial port is one of the two easiest to use ports on a PC. This port consist of 2 wires to transfer your data (one for each direction) and a number of signal wires. This port is reasonably sturdy, and if you know some digital electronics or use a microcontroller, is pretty easy to use too. It is limited on speed and can only connect two devices directly. By using special ICs you can connect the serial port to a [[Serial Programming/RS-485|RS-485 network]] and connect it to multiple devices.

* [[Serial Programming/RS-232]]
* [http://www.beyondlogic.org/ This site] contains a lot information on serial ports (among others).

====Parallel Port====
The parallel port is the second of the easiest to use ports on a PC. This port uses 8 lines to transfer data and has several signal lines. Modern parallel ports can send and receive data. This port is easier to use, but less sturdy than the serial port. Since it operates on TTL voltage levels  (0 and 5V) it can connect directly to microcontrollers and TTL logic.

[http://www.beyondlogic.org/ This page] covers parallel ports and the differend modes of operation.

====USB====
USB is the successor of the serial port. It's faster and allows connecting devices without turning off the PC. Some modern microcontrollers have built in USB support.

* [http://www.beyondlogic.org/ Everything] you'd need to know about USB.
* [[Serial Programming:USB Technical Manual]]
* [[Embedded_Systems/Particular_Microprocessors#USB_interface]]

==== IEEE 1394: Firewire, i.link, Lynx====
{{wikipediapar||FireWire}}

IEEE 1394 also known as FireWire, i.link or lynx is a (much) faster port, similar to the USB port. It reaches speeds up to 400Mbit/s.

* [http://www.hardwarebook.net/connector/bus/ieee1394.html The Connector]
* [http://www.commsdesign.com/main/multsupp/0002/0002fire.htm Article] about IEEE 1394.
* [http://wiki.linux1394.org/ Linux FireWire wiki]

====Keyboard Connector====
Keyboards use TTL level signals to transfer button presses and releases to the PC. A keyboard sends a code when a button is pressed and sends another one when the button is released. This port could be used for some purposes.

See [http://www.beyondlogic.org/ this site] for a in depth explanation and example of how to interface the keyboard. (menu: miscellaneous -&gt; interfacing the AT keyboard) Covers both how to replace the keyboard as how to use the keyboard for other purposes.

====Ethernet====
Ethernet can be used to connect other devices to a PC. Complete webserver-on-a-chip are available these days, and an ethernet network can be a way to connect multiple devices in a robot (and even hook it up to the internet and let people control the robot from all over the world).

===Internal Ports===
These are the connectors inside the PC, generally these are used with special PCBs (called cards). Although harder to use, they offer great speed.

====ISA====
ISA was the (8-, later 16-bit) bus where you plugged your video, sound, IDE and network card in the old days. You'll find these on PC up to (some) early Pentium II (the latter usualy has only 1 E-ISA socket, if any). 
This bus is pretty easy to use for your own projects and well documented on the internet. 

[http://www.hardwarebook.net/connector/bus/isa.html ISA bus connector]
[http://www.hardwarebook.net/connector/bus/isa_tech.html More indepth explaination of the ISA bus]

====PCI====
PCI is the successor of the ISA bus. It's a faster 32bit bus. Since it support plug and play, a PCI device needs a few registers which identify the component and manufacturer. 
[http://www.techfest.com/hardware/bus/pci.htm This page] covers most of the basics of the PCI bus.

====AGP====
The Accelerated Graphics Port is aimed at 3D graphic cards. It's a fast bus, but optimized for graphics.

====PCI Express====
PCI Express replaces both PCI and AGP. It's quite different from all the other busses, as it uses serial communication, rather than parallel. Its speed depend on the number of &quot;lanes&quot; (serial connections) used PCI Express support 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 lanes.

===Wireless===
These are &quot;ports&quot; too as they can be used to connect other devices to the PC. 

====IRDA====
IRDA is an infrared communication port. Modern versions reach speeds up to 4Mbits/s. IRDA may be a good alternative to wires for table top robots. Since it's an Infrared port it needs a line of sight to work reliable and its range is limited to 1m.  
Note that this port works at a much higher speed than remote controls and therefor standard remote control repeaters may not work reliable for IRDA.

[http://www.hw.cz/english/docs/irda/irda.html This] site covers the basics of IRDA.&lt;BR&gt;
[http://www.hardwarebook.net/connector/pc/mbirda.html Here] is a pinout of the mainboard IRDA connector.

====WiFi / WLAN / 802.11 / Wireless Ethernet====
All the names in the headline are synonyms for the same technology. WLANs are commonly used in PCs (especially laptops) as data networks. The bandwidth available is in the order of several megabits per second or more, far more than normally is necessary in any robotics project. A WLAN typically reaches about 100m, but with special directional antennas far more is possible (in a specific direction).

A WLAN is the obvious choice if your robot has an inbuilt PC or perhaps even PDA for control. Also, when you have ethernet connectivity in your controller (reasonably low cost but not a standard feature except in certain kits), there are low cost (~€50) WLAN bridges available, such as the D-Link DWL-810+ and DWL-G810. 

If you only have a serial port available, a ''wireless device server'' could be used. The cost of one of them is, however, over €100.

====Bluetooth====
Bluetooth is a low bandwidth protocol most commonly found in cellular phones. It is increasingly being deployed in laptops, and there are separate USB &quot;sticks&quot; available as well. Bluetooth can be used for making a serial connection wireless - there are Bluetooth serial ports available on the market, which can be used as converters. Total bandwidth in the system is about a megabit per second, with range up to about ten meters (standard Bluetooth, 2.5 mW), or about hundred meters (industrial Bluetooth, 100 mW). There are limitations on scaling with Bluetooth - it is mostly deployed in 1:1 links even though the standard includes networks with up to 8 active nodes (and even more passive ones). This means that if you plan on building large amounts of robots with a common communication network, Bluetooth might be less well suited.

*[http://www.telecomspace.com/wirelessnw-bluetooth.html Bluetooth resources]

====ZigBee====
ZigBee is a protocol stack based on the 802.15.4 wireless network communication standard. It is low-cost, low-power and all-in-all perfectly suited for low-bandwidth communication needs. The bandwidth is on the order of tens to hundreds kilobits per second, and the range is up to about a kilometer, depending on equipment.

Interesting solutions are [http://www.maxstream.net/products/ XBee from Maxstream], which basically provide a wireless serial link. There also is a list of other vendors at [[w:ZigBee]].

====UWB====

====Wireless USB====

====Cellular networks====
A possibility is to use standard cellular networks (mobile phones). It is only a viable solution for large-scale geostationary outdoor applications with low communication needs though, because of cost, latency and bandwidth limitations.

====Radio modems====
Radio modems are normally older proprietary solutions for wireless linking of serial ports. Proprietary solutions probably shouldn't be considered for new designs.


===Using a PC or laptop in a robot===

PCs have the benefit of abundance of memory, program space and processing power. Additionally they provide the best debug I/O (screen, keyboard and mouse) you could wish for. But they do have a few flaws that limit their usefulness in a mobile robot.

*First of all their size. Even the smallest PC, a laptop, is quite bulky and forces you to use a rather large frame.
*Secondly, except for a laptop, power consumption is large and provide AC-power on a mobile unit is bulky as you need heavy batteries and an inverter.
*Lastly Pcs are lousy when it comes to getting a reliable accurate timing from the outside world. 

The first two points basically shape most of your robot's frame and other than using a different controller not much you can do about it. Picking the best hardware you can find is pretty much all that can make these points a little less troublesome.

The last point is quite easy to get around. Most PCs have a serial port. Most microcontrollers have a serial port as well. Use a level converter to connect the TTL level serial port of the microcontroller with the RS232 level computer serial port and use a little program that handles the accurate timing in the microcontroller and transfers this information to the computer through the serial connection. This is a very powerful setup that combines the strengths of both the PC and the microcontroller.

See [http://www.tronisoft.com/cat_rs232ioboard.php this site] for example interfacing hardware for the serial port.
Covers an I/O module and RS232 to TTL level converter for use with robotics or microcontroller based projects.

Some microcontrollers provide USB or Ethernet ports, which can be used in pretty much the same way, although the software would be a bit harder to implement.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.7: Kleidung&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

==Hello from Berlin!==
In every Lesson from 7 - 15 there is going to be a featured German-Speaking city, which will be the theme of the lesson. For 7 - 8 it is Berlin. There will be famous locations in Berlin, for this lesson it's Kurfürstendamm and KaDeWe, the shopping area of Berlin. Also in each lesson there will be facts, so if you ever travel to a German-Speaking country, it'll be like you are a native!

===Facts===
====It's Time to Change Time====

Berlin's time is GMT+1.  That means that they are 6 hours ahead of E.S.T. If it's 2:00pm in New York City, it's 8:00pm (or 20:00) locally. Please note that Germany changes to and from daylight-saving time a few weeks before the U.S., so time differences still vary in March and October.

====Tip, Tip, and More Tip====

In contrast to many other countries where waiters sometime 'live on the tips' in German-speaking countries service personnel always receive a regular wage (usually per hour) and the tip is always an extra for good service. Not to give a tip will probably give the waiter the impression that either service or product were not that good and you are too polite to admit this, but not tipping is not considered 'rude'.
If you tip you usually round up, up to 50 Cents for coffee or up to the next 5 euros for lunch, e.g. 2,70 € becomes 3,00 € and 21 € become 25 €. Also, tipping is only expected when you get served, i.e. when the service personnel bring something to your table, so if you pay at a counter – like at McDonald's or StarBucks – you don't tip at all.
Only when having a large party, like celebrating your birthday in a restaurant, you do extra tipping. For a night you should pay 30 EUR to 80 EUR per waiter and give it separately to the manager (“für die Bedienung”).
In many restaurants it is normal the tip is shared with the kitchen personnel. Paying with credit card or debit card makes tipping difficult, because there is no line on the bill to fill in the tip. Always tip when paying, don't leave money on the table.

====Shopping Locations====

There are two major shopping locations. The '''''Kurfürstendamm''''' in the old west is lined with boutiques and department stores. It continues eastwards for about three hundred yards where you can visit '''''KaDeWe''''', the biggest department store in Europe. On the newly-developed '''''Friedrichstraße''''' in the old east, the famous French store Galleries Lafayette is to be found together with a maze of underground shopping malls. Shops are generally open 9am-8pm Monday through Saturday. In the outskirts most shops close at 4pm on Saturdays.

== Shopping ==
There is a lot to say about shopping, places to shop at, money and items to buy. In this lesson we will cover most of it. There are two big shopping locations in Berlin. They are Kurfürstendamm and KaDeWe.

===Kurfürstendamm===
*'''Kurfürstendamm'''

:''Tauentzienstraße''

:''Fasanenstraße''

The Kurfürstendamm has many boutiques, department stores, etc., which are on Tauentzienstraße and Fasanenstraße, two streets in Kurfürstendamm. Tauentzienstraße has a lot of the department stores, including KaDeWe, which we will get into greater detail later. Fasanenstraße has a lot of the boutiques. &lt;!-- &quot;Kurfürstendamm&quot; is a street, as Tauentzienstraße and Fasanenstraße, so these two couldn't be &quot;in&quot; Kurfürstendamm, they are close together. --&gt;

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|A Shopping Street in Berlin|Kurfürstendamm (Ku'damm)|0|2}}
!English||German
|- 
|Department Store||das Kaufhaus (old fashioned &quot;das Warenhaus&quot;)
|-
|Retail Store||das Einzelhandelsgeschäft
|-
|The Mall||das Einkaufszentrum
|-
|Boutique||die Boutique
|-
|Store||das Geschäft
|}

And some of the things you might say or ask while in a clothing store...

*''Können Sie mir helfen, meine Größe zu finden (für dieses ____)?''
:Can you help me find my size (for this ____)?

*''Wo ist die Umkleidekabine?''
:Where is the dressing room?

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Kurf.C3.BCrstendamm|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===KaDeWe===
Another shopping location is das KaDeWe, an upscale department store in Germany. It has six floors, and Is also called &quot;The department store of the west&quot; (Kaufhaus des Westens) because it is the largest and most magnificent department store on continental Europe.

{|{{German table|Vocabulary|A Department Store in Berlin|Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe)|0|2}}

|-

|-

|-

|-

|-

|-

|}
Since we already have most of the general shopping phrases and vocabulary down, we are going to get into more detail in the next few sections.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#KaDeWe|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

====Electronics====
First is electronics: it might seem a little sparse, but electronics and much other stuff will be featured in Lesson 12.

{|{{German table|Vocabulary|A Department Store in Berlin|Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe)|0|2}}
!English||German
|- 
|Electronics||die Elektronik
|-           
|Television||das Fernsehen/der Fernseher, die Fernseher (plural)
|-
|Digital Camera||die Digitalkamera, die Digitalkameras (plural)
|-
|Telephone||das Telefon, die Telefone (plural)
|-
|Cell phone||das Mobiltelefon/das Handy (pronounced &quot;Hendee&quot;), die Mobiltelefone/Handys (plural)
|-
|Computer||der Computer/der Rechner, die Computer/Rechner (plural)
|-
|Speaker, Speakers||der Lautsprecher, die Lautsprecher (plural)
|-
|DVDs||die DVDs (singular: die DVD)
|-
|CDs||die CDs (singular: die CD)
|-
|DVD Player||der DVD-Player
|-
|CD Player||der CD-Player
|}

''Spielt der DVD-Player auch CDs?''
:Does the DVD player also play CDs?

''Hat das Mobiltelefon/das Handy eine Digitalkamera?''
:Does the cell phone have a digital camera?

If you look at the word order of this sentence, you will see that you've already learned everything you need to make these sentences, and you, yourself can customize these sentences if you want.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Electronics|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

====Bedding====
The bedding section is also quite bare, but that is because it will be discussed further in Lesson 12. 

{|{{German table|Vocabulary|A Department Store in Berlin|Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe)|0|2}}
!English||German
|- 
|Bedding||die Bettwäsche
|-           
|Blanket||die Decke, die Decken
|-
|Pillow||das Kopfkissen/das/der Polster (Austrian German), die Kopfkissen/Polster
|-
|Pillow Case||der Kopfkissenbezug, die Kopfkissenbezüge
|-
|Sheet||das Betttuch, die Betttücher
|-
|Bed Skirt||der Bett-Rock
|}

And like always here are some of the things you might say that are related to bedding.

*''Passen die Kopfkissenbezüge auf das Kopfkissen?''
:Does the pillow case fit the pillow?

And with that question there are other variations of it you can ask, like... 

*''Passt die Decke auf das Bett?''
:Does the blanket fit the bed?

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Bedding|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Money==
Germany, Austria, Luxemburg, Belgium and Südtirol – in other words: all German speaking regions except Switzerland and Liechtenstein– have given up their former currencies and adopted the Euro as of 1999. Because they are not members of the European Union, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have kept the Swiss Francs. Currently 1 EUR is 1.34 USD.

Now if you were at a shopping center in German like Kurfürstendamm, and you were shopping at a boutique here is some vocabulary you might want to know.

*''Was macht das?''
''Was kostet das?''
:How much does it cost?

*''Das Hemd kostet 120 Euro.''
:The shirt costs 120 euros.

*''Das kostet 690 Euro.''
:That costs 690 euros (all together).

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Money|Geld|0|2}}
!English||German
|- 
|Price||der Preis
|-
|Note||der Schein
|-
|Coin||die Münze
|-
|1 Euro coin||das Eurostück, das Ein-Euro-Stück
|-
|2 Euro coin||das Zweieurostück
|-
|5 Euro note||der Fünfeuroschein
|-
|10 Euro note||der Zehneuroschein
|-
|100 Euro note||der Hunderteuroschein
|}

'''Note:''' The word coin (Münze) mostly turns to Stück when a word or number is put together with it.

Even though in the vocabulary we list the 1, 2, 5, 10, 100 Euro there are more Euro notes. The twenty, fifty, two hundred, and five hundred Euro notes are the ones we didn't list, also there are cent coins.

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Money|Geld|0|2}}
!English||German
|- 
|1 Cent Coin||das Centstück
|-
|2 Cent Coin||das Zweicentstück
|-
|5 Cent Coin||das Fünfcentstück
|-
|10 Cent Coin||das Zehncentstück
|-
|20 Cent Coin||das Zwanzigcentstück
|-
|50 Cent Coin||das Fünfzigcentstück
|}

===German Math===
In written German, a comma is used (e. g. in prices) where we would put a decimal point in English. Thus € 5,49 (or 5,49 €) means ''five euros and forty-nine cents''. When a price ends in a round number of euros, it is most commonly written as € 5,- etc. The reverse is also true. Where as English uses a comma to split up large numbers, German uses a dot. So &quot;€ 6.945&quot; means '''''sechs tausend neunhundertfünfundvierzig''''' (six thousand nine hundred and forty-five) euros - not ''six point nine four five euros.''

===Describing Clothes===

Here are some of the words you can use when you are describing clothes:

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Adjectives for Clothes|Adjektive für Kleidung|0|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|Cheap||günstig, billig
|-
|Expensive||teuer
|-
|Pretty||schön
|-
|Ugly||hässlich
|-
|Soft||weich
|-
|New||neu
|-
|Broad||breit
|-
|Wide||weit
|-
|Tight||eng
|-
|Comfortable||bequem
|-
|Uncomfortable||unbequem
|}

To say I like something or not, for clothing, it's... 

I like it!                            

''Er/Sie/Es gefällt mir!''

I don't like it!                      

''Er/Sie/Es gefällt mir nicht!''

Now if you try something on or you're looking for a soft shirt with a tight fit, you find it, feel it, try it on, but it's fairly expensive you might say this...

'''In English:'''
''The shirt looks great! The shirt feels soft, fits tight. The shirt is very comfortable. How much does it cost? Oh no! The shirt is expensive! 55 euros is a little too much for me.''                

'''In German:'''
''Das Hemd sieht prima aus! Das Hemd fühlt sich weich an, es sitzt eng. Das Hemd ist sehr bequem. Wieviel kostet es? Oh nein! Das Hemd ist teuer! 55 Euro sind mir ein bisschen zuviel.''

The phrases to describe the shirt were...

The shirt looks great.

''Das Hemd '''sieht''' prima '''aus.'''''

The shirt feels soft.

''Das Hemd '''fühlt''' sich weich '''an'''.''

The shirt fits tight.

''Das Hemd '''sitzt''' eng.''

Now, the bold words are verbs that are one part in describing how the shirt is. The other half of describing it is the adjectives like soft, tight, great, etc. And as you can see the verb &quot;looks&quot; is separable, but we will get into that later.

=== Clothing-Related Verbs ===
And now getting into verbs - here are some of the verbs, and also some of these are Separable-Prefix Verbs, like aussehen, anprobieren, and anhaben. But we will study those in more detail later. Also we will be learning about &quot;tragen&quot;.
 
{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Verbs Related to Clothes|Verben im Zusammenhang mit Kleidung|0|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|To look||aussehen
|-
|He looks||Er sieht aus
|-
|To try on||anprobieren
|-
|He tries on||Er probiert an
|-
|to put on||anziehen
|-
|He puts on||Er zieht an
|-
|To take||nehmen
|-
|To buy||kaufen
|-
|To have on/wear||anhaben, tragen
|-
|He has on/wears||Er hat an
|}

==Separable Prefix Verbs==

Many German verbs change their meaning by adding prefixs, which are often preposition such as '''ab-, an-, auf-, aus-, bei-, ein-, mit-, vor-,''' or '''zu-'''.The verbs ''anhaben'' (to wear) and ''aussehen'' (to look) are both verbs with '''separable''' ('''''trennbar''''') prefixes. That is, when used next to the subject pronoun, the prefix is separated from the verb and put at the end of the sentence or clause. Or, better put, In the present tense and imperative, the prefix is separated from the infinitive stem.   

Examples:

''&quot;Ich habe einen Mantel an.&quot;'' (&quot;I'm wearing a coat.&quot; Or, more literally translated, &quot;I have a coat on.&quot;)

''&quot;Was hast du an?&quot;'' (&quot;What are you wearing?&quot; or &quot;What do you have on?&quot;)

However, when the separable-prefix verb is put at the end of the sentence, such as when used with  a modal verb, the verb in question and its prefix are not separated.

Examples: 

''&quot;Du willst einen Mantel anhaben.&quot;'' (&quot;You want to wear a coat.&quot;)

''&quot;Willst du eine Bluse anhaben?&quot;'' (&quot;Do you want to wear a blouse?&quot;)

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Separable Prefix Verbs|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Tragen==

Instead of ''&quot;anhaben&quot;'' the verb ''&quot;tragen&quot;'' is often used. The sentences from above would then be:

''&quot;Ich trage einen Mantel.&quot;'' (&quot;I'm wearing a coat.&quot; )&lt;br&gt;
''&quot;Was trägst du?&quot;'' (&quot;What are you wearing?&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
''&quot;Du willst einen Mantel tragen.&quot;'' (&quot;You want to wear a coat.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
''&quot;Willst du eine Bluse tragen?&quot;'' (&quot;Do you want to wear a blouse?&quot;)

The verb ''&quot;tragen&quot;'' has two meanings: &quot;to wear&quot; and &quot;to carry&quot;. So if someone says ''&quot;Ich trage Schuhe&quot;'' only the context will tell you whether the person is carrying the shoes in his hands or actually wearing them. Tragen is a different kind of irregular verb -- one that not only changes at the end of the word, but also changes internally.  Notice that the vowel in tragen's second and third-person forms changes from an '''a''' into an '''ä'''.  Other verbs with similar conjugation patterns include '''fahren, graben, schaffen,''' and '''waschen.'''

&lt;td&gt;sie&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''tragen''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Colors ==
Color are also another great way to describe clothes like ''Das rote Hemd passt gut.''which means The red shirt fits well. 

Read the following paragraph, try to find the words described to have a color.

''Wir fahren in den Schwarzwald. Ich habe ein grünes Hemd getragen. Die Reise war lang. Es begann kälter zu werden und abzukühlen. Ich hörte Musik auf meinem braunen iPod. Ich bin schließlich eingeschlafen. Als ich aufwachte, sah ich den blauen Himmel und den weißen Schnee.'' 

If you found 5 words you are right.

'''Schwarz which means black (the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) is a wooded mountain range)'''

'''Grünes Hemd which is a green shirt.'''

'''Brauner iPod which is a brown iPod.'''

'''Blauer Himmel which is blue sky.'''

'''And weißer Schnee which is white snow.'''

And now for the actual colors...

 Red                &quot;Rot&quot;     
 Blue               &quot;Blau&quot;
 Green              &quot;Grün&quot;  
 Orange             &quot;Orange&quot;
 Violet             &quot;Violett&quot;
 Yellow             &quot;Gelb&quot;
 Brown              &quot;Braun&quot;
 Indigo             &quot;Indigo&quot;
 Gray               &quot;Grau&quot;
 Black              &quot;Schwarz&quot;

What else should i add in Lesson Four?--[[User:Andrewcool|Andrewcool]] 00:15, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

* Don't worry I got it covered :-D --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 17:14, 14 Jan 2006 (UTC)

== Lesson Part Finished ==

The lesson part is finished, but it is still open for correction, and minor additions. --[[User:German Men92|German Man92]] 16:35 Jan 16 2006 (UTC)

==passen = fit==

passen means to fit, and sitzen means to sit. but there is names that sitzen means to fit, but most time passen is fit. --[[User:German Men92|German Man92]] 16:49 Jan 16 2006 (UTC)

==Hegla = Helga==

&quot;Hegla&quot; is not a German name. The correct spelling is &quot;Helga&quot;.

==Tip Tip ...==

Actually, tipping is seen very differently. For many older Germans, 5% is quite a lot, and not giving any tip if not really satisfied is by no means considered rude by everybody. Younger ones often are more generous (maybe this is influenced by the American culture where the tip is part of the income of the waiters, or because they are more likely to know some fellow student working at a restaurant ;-) So while Tante Erna might tip the nice young lady who brought her her Kännchen Milchkaffee mit Schwarzwälder Kirsch for 7,30€ with 20 cents, the student Kevin might just leave 70 cents on the table because he'd find it cheap otherwise. Admittedly, those are rather extreme cases, and there certainly are young people who are cheap and many old ones who are very generous... [[User:Thamane|Thamane]] 21:31, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

:I actually live in Berlin, and I see most, if not all, people tip and very well, maybe I just see, or look for people who tip. I don't know, lol. --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 20:36, 10 April 2006 (UTC)


==Helga and Maria==
They call each other by there &quot;Vornamen&quot;, so they normaly won't say &quot;Sie&quot;, but &quot;Du&quot;.


==Propaganda?==
Hiya.  I'm actually using the beginnings of this book as a very rough foundation upon which to begin my studies of the German language.  I couldn't help but think that the exercise requiring the student to memorize what is on each floor of a specific department store a bit ridiculous.  Not only does memorizing this not seem important for the study of German or, realistically, for a trip in Germany, it also seems rather like pro-KaDeWe propaganda (imagine a wikibook on the English language having an exercise requiring students to recite the locations of all General Motors factories in the United States as a lesson in geography).  Just seems a bit silly.
:&quot;Propaganda&quot; is sort of harsh isn't it? Maybe it's just some self-promotion. Nevertheless, just skip it if you want. And I guess you can delete it if you are really REALLY bothered by it.[[User:Erebos12345|Erebos12345]] ([[User talk:Erebos12345|talk]]) 09:27, 6 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian_cuisine|Vegetarian cuisine]]

This article describes general preparation procedures for the popular Italian appetizer (or ''antipasto'') '''Bruschetta''' (plural ''bruschette''), slices of toasted or grilled bread rubbed with garlic, drizzled with olive oil, and seasoned with salt and pepper.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Carol |title=Italy in Small Bites |publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc. |location=New York, New York |date=1993 |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic preparation is frequently topped with combinations of flavorful seasonal ingredients. It is a dish coming from the Southern Italian culinary tradition, though variants exist throughout Italy. It is commonly mispronounced in America as &quot;bru-shetta&quot;, but should be pronounced with a hard K sound, &quot;bru-sketta.&quot;

There are many types of ''bruschetta'', some involving special roasted and/or hard bread which may require a different preparation than the one below. 

The recipe below is a meeting point between Northern and Southern Italy, using an Italian or French baguette-style loaf.

You can adapt this recipe to as many servings as you need. As a guideline, you can serve 1 or 2 ''bruschette'' per person.



==Ingredients==
* 1 loaf of Italian or French [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], sliced 1/2 inch (c. 1cm) thick on the bias
* 1/2 head [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* Kosher salt or sea [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and freshly ground black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* Extra-virgin [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
* Toppings of your choice (see examples below)

==Procedure==
#Toast the bread slices in a toaster oven, under a broiler, or on a grill, until they turn golden.
#Immediately rub the bread with the cut side of the garlic. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper and drizzle generously with extra-virgin olive oil. 
#Serve warm topped with whatever combinations of seasonal ingredients you choose - ''e.g.'', chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] with arugula or [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], cooked white beans (topped, if you like, with sautéed kale), sautéed mushrooms (preferably wild varieties), minced anchovies flavored with wine vinegar and herbs, thinly-sliced pancetta crisped under the broiler, or a Pugliese-style chopped mixture of summer vegetables (red onion, cucumber, tomatoes, oregano, flat-leaf parsley, basil, and red pepper flakes).&lt;ref name=Field&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Working with Metals==

===Measuring and Marking===
*Do: Measure twice, cut once. Putting it back on is MUCH more difficult than taking it off.
*Do Not: Measure with a micrometer, mark with chalk, cut with a torch. Accuracy is important in moving parts.

===Cutting and Sawing===
*Sawing sheet metal requires a saw with a fine-tooth blade. As a  general rule of thumb at least three teeth should touch the material being cut.
*The teeth should be aimed away from the handle.
*Only apply pressure when pushing the saw away from you, not when pulling back.
*A miter box can be very handy to make straight or 45° cuts. Use a metal box as wooden boxes wear out very fast.

===Drilling===
*Use a punch to make a small indentation where you want to drill the hole.
*Use a slower speed to drill the hole than you would use for wood.
*Use clamps when working with sheet metal. Don't hold it with your hands as metal is very sharp when cut.
*Large holes can be made by drilling a hole and using a file thread or small metal saw to cut the hole. Finish with a half round file.
*A groove can be cut by drilling two holes at the outer edges and using file thread or small saw to connect both holes.

===Filing===
*Files exist in different shapes and different roughness.
*Filing straight: Hold the file diagonal on the surface, apply pressure and move the file upwards while moving from left to right.

===Bending===
Place the sheet metal between 2 wooden boards in a vice. Let the line where you want the material to bend match up with the border of the boards. Use a hammer to bend the metal.

==Working with Plastics==

===Cutting===
Thin plastics can be cut with a sharp utility knife, thicker material can be sawed. When sawing plastic, care must be taken to not melt it.

===Drilling===
Drilling plastic requires a slow speed drill. Special drills for plastics are much better as metal drill can cause the material to crack.

Large holes and grooves can be made the same way as in metal.

===Filing===

===Bending===
Use a heat gun (paint stripper) to heat up the plastic, bend it and let it cool down. Bending can be done by hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cookbook:Spicy Chilly Chicken==
[[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|Tomato sauce]] is ambiguous. Please be more specific.
(Which of the 3 types do you mean?)

Are you sure the name should have &quot;Chilly&quot;, not &quot;Chilli&quot; or &quot;Chili&quot;?
To me, &quot;Chilly&quot; means that the chicken is cold or even frozen.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Badjoby. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Badjoby~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ever take a good look at a swarm of flying insects? If you did you'd have seen very complicated patterns as if they coordinate their flight with precision. Yet each of these individual insect follow only 2 simple rules:
*Get to the center of the swarm (the safest place)
*Keep your distance from the other insects.

Because of the large number of creatures in such a swarm you get complicated behaviour even from such very simple rules. The same principle applies to ants. Although none of the ants are civil engineers they do succeed in building very complicated habitats.

This same principle can be applied to robots. A large number of small (and cheap) robots can cooperate to tackle a large problem. These swarms of robots are another challenge for robot designers as their behaviour isn't as simple to program as a single robot.

We talk more about &quot;simple&quot; swarming in [[Robotics/Computer Control/Control Architectures/Swarm Robotics]]
and more complicated coordination in [[Robotics/Exotic Robots/Modular and fractal robots]].

The Blender Game Engine is an interesting feature of Blender.  It is basically a 3D environment in which 3D objects move around and react to each other upon contact. One common application is to recreate 3D architectural tours.


In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of object collision within the Blender Game Engine (BGE). From Blender games to use in animations, the bullet physics engine offers a massive number of possibilities. The tutorials found within this wikibook on the subject of the BGE are generally focused on game creation, but the concepts taught within can be applied to a multitude of situations.


As a start, we will teach you to make a ball roll realistically down the hill using Blender's game engine.

== Adding the Hill ==

First, make a plane, then switch to Edit mode ('''TAB'''), and multi-subdivide it with 2 cuts ('''WKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Subdivide Multi'' &amp;rarr; 2).  Next, enter face select mode ('''CTRL+TAB''' &amp;rarr; ''Faces'') to drag the center face up, in order to form a rough outline of a hill.  Add a subsurf modifier (in the edit buttons) to about 3, then apply.  You should now have a serviceable, but small, hill.  Scale the hill up ('''SKEY''') by about 10 times, and we're ready to add the ball.

'''Noob note:''' 
# You can also use a 3*3 grid.
# Delete the original cube first. 
# The subsurf modifier is not essential.

== Creating the Ball ==

Now, add an icosphere ('''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Add'' &amp;rarr; ''Icosphere'') and relocate it to be just above the hilltop ('''GKEY''' or use the translate widget by pressing '''CTR+ALT+G''').  Let's change the color of the sphere so we can differentiate it from the plane.  Go to the material buttons (with the sphere selected) and click on the white panel beside the COL value. In the color selection wiget that appears, change its color to a bright red.

Next we need to make the Physics engine iterate over it.  With the sphere selected, go to the logic buttons (the little purple Pacman-icon). '''NOTE: In Blender 2.5 and above the Logic Buttons are gone. In order to have the 'Actor' button, click on the button showing 'Blender Render', and select 'Blender Game' Engine. Then go to the physics tab in the buttons menu. There you will see the 'Actor' Button.''' You will see a button in the top left that says ''Actor''. Press it. Now select from the selection box beside of the &quot;Actor&quot; button ''Rigid Body''. This makes the ball roll, instead of staying completely upright the entire time.  You will see a bunch of settings available now. Change ''Radius'' to 2. This changes size the physics engine ''thinks'' the ball is. You notice a dotted circle around the object; this is the boundary.  Now change the ''Radius'' back to 1.  You now have your first Blender game ready to go.

'''Noob Note:''' 
# Make sure you are in object mode first before you add any object.
# '''F4KEY''' is the shortcut to the logic panel.

== Testing your game ==

Now the time has come for the first test of our game.  

# Add a light source well above the hill ('''SHIFT+AKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Lamp'' &amp;rarr; ''Lamp''). Align in front view ('''NUM1''')
# Press '''NUM5''' to switch to Perspective mode, which gives a realistic view, rather than a view in which objects stay the same size with distance (be sure to switch back to Orthographic view when you are editing again using '''NUM5''')
# Enter textured mode ('''ALT+ZKEY''' -- press '''ZKEY''' to switch back to solid view mode)
# Switch into side view ('''NUM3''') and press '''NUM8''' several times to get a good perspective on the ball.
# Press '''PKEY''' to play the game (Make sure you are in Object mode ('''TAB''')
# Press '''P''' to start testing the game. You should see the red ball drop onto the hill.
# Press '''ESC''' to quit testing the game

== Video capturing your game ==

When you press the PKEY or click ''game, start play'', Blender will play it using the 3D view. Many rendering features are not shown in this 3D Window and it does not render the view in order to get good pictures with textures and lighting. You must capture your object that keep on changing(the actor) so that it can be animated.

''View'' -&gt; click View button
,        -&gt; next step
/        -&gt; alternative step
RMB      -&gt; right mouse button
IKEY      -&gt; press the I key on keyboard

Split window, ''IPO Curve Editor'' View, ''Game, Record Game Physics to IPO'',

''object mode'', RMB(select actor), IKEY/''select key frame'', ''Loc''(location of actor object only),

PKEY( play game), ESCKEY(stop game)

''scene''(F10), ''output'', f:\animation\ball (your file name),'' stamp, time, date, draw stamp, format,''(choose your output format)

''anim'', ''end''(ending frame), 270, ''step'', 10(for testing), ''ANIM/Render, Render Animation''/CTRL F12

== Conclusion ==

With the knowledge acquired in this tutorial, there are many things you could accomplish within the Blender Game Engine, although the majority of them would require more knowledge.  So read on, and work your way through the multitudinous seas of tutorials (That is, two).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Its not clear to me.  Is it the case that all consumers are irrational, or merely those consumers who prefer to avoid maufactured glutamates in unbound processed forms.  In what sense are we using the term consumer?  Do we mean consumers in the biologic sense or the more ambiguous economic sense?  Perhaps it would be more accurate to refer to them as eaters, or people, or even human beings.  

I'm not sure it is appropriate to include ad hominem in an ingredient entry in the Wiki Cookbook.  Maybe the word &quot;irrational&quot; should be deleted, and the various positions on MSG should be included.

For example, it is fairly clear that glutamates found in naturally occurring substances are bound to proteins.  In bound form, the human body can regulate the release of glutamates and the amount of stimulation of glutamate neurotransmiter receptors.  In unbound form, glutamates freely enter the bloodstream and can overstimulate glutamate neurotransmiter receptors (as is the case with many isolates chemicals human beings ingest).

[[User:4.244.150.169]]

:The percent values are for unbound glutamate only. The numbers for bound glutamate are much higher. Anything much beyond a half percent is more than a person would purposely add; several foods qualify. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:31, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:If you think MSG is bad, you'd better learn about [[w:dihydrogen monoxide|dihydrogen monoxide]]. It's a common food additive that has caused many deaths. Just as with MSG, the government claims that dihydrogen monoxide is safe! [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:25, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::You may think that it is junk science, but other might not. Wikimedia projects are supposed to be NPOV. Some people might be sensitive to MSG, it is unknown. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 04:29, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What do you mean &quot;Irrational MSG Sales Promotion&quot;?

There's been a lot of crap pseudo-science by quacks trying to
blame MSG for every ailment. It's like some kind of patent medicine
in reverse.

The simple fact is that MSG is common in lots of foods you eat.
It's there in doses much higher than one would normally add.
Look at Parmesan, which has so much MSG that your taste buds are
maxed out. Nobody would add that amount.

Commercial MSG is indistinguishable in every way from any other
MSG. If you have trouble with this concept, study chemistry.

As for selling things... many of the anti-MSG sites you'll find on
the web are doing just that. They sell &quot;herbal supplements&quot; of
dubious value for exhorbant prices.

==Invention by Dr.Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843)==

Hahnemann was educated in medicine, science and linguistics.  He wrote a book on his research, &quot;The Organon of the Medical Art&quot;, and received 6 editions over his life.

That book explains what he thought was the nature of disease, the way homeopathic remedies may work and how to apply them. That is the core book for homeopaths when studying.

Homeopathy is very widely used now and homeopaths operate in many countries regardless of how affluent or poor the country is.  There are now over 3000 remedies &quot;proven&quot; and available for treating all types of disease.

We will later look more at homeopathic theory on a basic level, the principles of homeopathy and more importantly how homeopathy is supposed to be used with the intent of restoring health.  You can purchase homeopathy kits to have at home or when travelling cheaply and they are effective in acute diseases or minor accidents.  For longer term diseases, deeper rooted emotional, mental and/or physical problems, you need to visit a professional homeopath and attend a number of times. 

Finally, a word on science - it should be noted that no truly scientific study has shown that homeopathy works at all.But one point should be noted here that Homeopathic medicines are very much minute in its dosage that's why it is a fact that Experiments used in conventional medicines can not be used as it is in Homeopathy.

Homeopaths claim that their remedies are useful for a wide range of minor ailments, from cuts and bruises to coughs and colds. Patients often come to homeopaths with long-term problems which have not responded to conventional medicine, and homeopaths prescribe remedies to people with these conditions. Some of the common ailments for which patients seek homeopathic care are [[eczema]],[[Acne]],[[Chloasma]],[[Psoriasis]],[[Vitiligo]],[[Gastric Ulcers]],[[Complaints during pregnancy]],[[Cystic growths]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[asthma]], [[migraine]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]],[[ allergic disorders]], [[arthritis]], [[fibromyalgia]], [[hypertension]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[premenstrual syndrome]], [[rhinitis]], [[anxiety]] and [[depression]]. They also treat patients with the most serious diseases, including [[multiple sclerosis]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[cancer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=251 Cancer Research UK]&lt;/ref&gt; and AIDS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishhospital.com/aids.htm Amish Hospital and Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;. For [[gangrene]], for example, homeopathic remedies are prescribed to strengthen a person's own defenses and to initiate healing; a very different approach from medical therapy. Some homeopathic remedies for gangrene include Arsenicum Album, Secale (from [[rye/ergot]]), and Carbo vegetabilis (from charcoal), amongst many others&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpathy.com/diseases/gangrene-symptoms-treatment-cure.asp Homeopathy for everyone]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Homeopaths claim that there is objective evidence that some of their treatments are beneficial.
Some other researchers also claim that there is scientific evidence that homeopathy helps in many problems and diseases&lt;ref name=Van_Wassenhoven&gt;{{citation |

Dr. James Tyler Kent

Dr. James Tyler Kent was born in 1849, a native of woodhull, new York. He graduated from Electic Medical institute, cincinnati, ohio in 1871 and the Homeopathic medical college of missouri, St. Louis, where he was awarded the Diploma in 1889. He was Professor of Anatomy in the American Medical College St. Louis, 1877-78 about which time his attention was forcibly directed to Homeopathy through the serious illness of his wife, whose case refused to yield to any other treatment except Homeopathic. He then became a careful student of Hahnemann's Organon which resulted in his complete conversion to Homeopathy. He was one of the ablest teachers and exponents of the Homeopathic school in America. His contribution to the Homeopathic literature are known by their strength rather than their length and include more prominently his Repertory, Homeopathic Philosophy, Lectures on Materia Medica and Lesser Writings.

Dr. Hering

Dr. Constantine Hering was born on 1st Jan. 1800 in Oschath in Saxony. He studied Medicine and then at the request of his teacher Dr. Henrich Robbi studied Homeopathy in order to write a book against Homeopathy. But since his infected hand which was to have been amputated was healed by Homeopathy, he became converted to Homeopathy and became one of the most famous Homeopaths. After getting his degree from Woodsburg he went to Surinam on an expedition. There he extracted the poison of the Lachesis snake and proved it. From then on he practised, taught and wrote on Homeopathy for the rest of his life, so much so, that Hahnemann called him as one of his 'most efficient disciples' and 'as the truest and most zealous propagator of our art.' When he died on July 23rd 1880 his friend Dr. Nickle said of him &quot;He who never rested, rests&quot;.

Dr.M.L. Sircar

Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar, C, I .E&quot; M.D.. D. L., was not only the greatest Homeopath of his time in India, but also a great scientist. He was born on Nov. 2, 1833 in Paikpara, near Howrah. He appeared at the M.D. Examination in 1863 and came out first. He devoted his life wholly to the propagation of the principles of Homeopathy. The Calcutta Journal of Medicine, edited by him, was started in Jan. 1868 for this purpose. In the field of physical science, Dr. Sircar has made great contributions and was' a pioneer of .scientific research in India. Dr. J. C. Bose and Dr. P. C. Ray were also inspired by him. Recurrent malarial fever and bronchial asthma clouded the evening of his life and he died on Feb. 23, 1904.


 
Boger
Prominent as a physician and author of a number of medical text - books, Dr.Boger came to Parkersburg U.S.A. in 1888 and had since been engaged in the practice of medicine. He graduated from the Philadephia College of Medicine. He later studied at the Hahnemann Homeopathic Medical College in Philadelphia, from which also he graduated. During his long career in medical practice and research, Boger contributed important scientific text-books including the Synoptic Key of the Materia Medica addition to his authorship of a number o&quot; articles for medical journals.
His authorship of several scientific textbooks, his analysis and construction of Repertory, his lively translation of several medical books from notable German authors and his indefatigable labour for the production of orginal works, like the Times of the Remedies and Moon phases and his provings of Samarskite etc. made him universally recognised as an author and physician of great eminence. Dr. Boger passed away on 2nd Sep, 1935, at the age of 74.

== Delay statements ==

=== Relative delays ===
&lt;!-- A ''relative delay statement'' stops the exec &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/package|Standard}}.Duration&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/package|Ada.Real_Time}}.Time_Span&lt;/tt&gt; --&gt;
 {{Ada/kw|delay}} Wait_Time;

The Ravenscar profile forbids the use of the relative delay statement:

 {{Ada/restriction|No_Relative_Delay}}

{{Ada/2005|Delay}}

=== Absolute delays ===
&lt;!-- &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/package|Ada.Calendar}}.Time&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/package|Ada.Real_Time}}.Time&lt;/tt&gt; [http://www.adaic.com/standards/95rat/RAThtml/rat95-p2-9.html#3] --&gt;
 {{Ada/kw|delay}} {{Ada/kw|until}} Next_Time;

== Select statements ==

=== Delay alternative ===

Selective accept:

 {{Ada/kw|select}}
    {{Ada/kw|when}} Cond =&gt;
       accept_statement
       statements
 {{Ada/kw|or}}
   delay_alternative
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};

=== Timed entry call ===

 {{Ada/kw|select}}
    entry_call_alternative
 {{Ada/kw|or}}
    delay_alternative
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};

=== Asynchronous transfer of control ===

 {{Ada/kw|select}}
    {{Ada/kw|delay}} {{Ada/kw|until}} Abort_Time;
    ''statements''
 {{Ada/kw|then}} {{Ada/kw|abort}}
    ''abortable_part''
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|select}};

== Description ==

This keyword is used in the declaration of [[Ada Programming/Types/delta|fixed point types]]. Delta represents the absolute error bound of a [[Ada Programming/Types/delta|fixed point type]]; that is, delta gives a hint to the compiler how to choose the smallest incremental value of the type, called the ''Small'' of the type. This Small value is accessible via the attribute T'Small.

For Ordinary fixed point types, it is by default a power of two not greater than the delta; it is specifyable by an attribute clause to be any value not greater than the delta.

For decimal fixed point types, the Small value is equal to the delta, which of course must be a power of ten.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Fixed_Point {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} 0.01 {{Ada/kw|digits}} 10;  {{Ada/--|A decimal fixed point type}}
 My_Fixed_Point : Fixed_Point := 0.0;
 ...
 My_Fixed_Point := 0.1;   {{Ada/--|Ok}}
 My_Fixed_Point := 0.02;  {{Ada/--|Ok}}
 My_Fixed_Point := 0.001; {{Ada/--|Oops - this value is too small.}}
                          {{Ada/--|It will be represented by zero.}}

This keyword is used in:
*[[Ada Programming/Control#for loop|For loops]]
*[[Ada Programming/Representation clauses|Representation clauses]]:
**attribute definition clause
**enumeration representation clause
**record representation clause
**at clause (obsolescent)
* Quantified expressions
** Universal quantification
** Existential quantification

Nowadays ''representation clauses'' are formally called ''aspect clauses'' in the last versions of the Reference Manual due to some technicalities, although ''representation clauses'' is the name far more extended among Ada programmers. As a historical note, they were known as ''representation specifications'' (''rep specs'') in pre-Ada 83 proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|     author = [[Wikipedia:John Barnes (computer scientist)|John Barnes]]
|      title = High-Integrity Software &amp;mdash; The SPARK Approach to Safety and Security
|       date = 2003-03-25
|  publisher = Addison-Wesley
|       isbn = 0-321-13616-0
|        url = http://www.praxis-his.com/sparkada/sparkbook.asp
| accessdate = 2008-06-06
|      quote = Representation clauses are now strictly known as aspect clauses &amp;mdash; the name was changed in the 2000 Corrigendum for Ada 95 for subtle reasons that need not concern us; Ada historians might recall that they were known as representation specifications (rep specs) prior to the ANSI standardization in 1983. These various terminologies are all in use and the reader will encounter them in the literature. (pp.212&amp;ndash;213)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== For loops ==

 [''loop name'' {{Ada/delimiter|:}}] {{Ada/kw|for}} ''var'' {{Ada/kw|in}} [ {{Ada/kw|reverse}} ] [''type'' {{Ada/kw|range}}] ''range'' {{Ada/kw|loop}}
    ...
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}} [''loop name'']{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Where ''range'' can be:
* explicit range like &quot;&lt;code&gt;''low'' {{Ada/delimiter|..}} ''high''&lt;/code&gt;&quot;,
* range of scalar or array type: &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Range}}&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Range}}{{Ada/delimiter|(}}''n''{{Ada/delimiter|)}}&lt;/code&gt; for multidimensional array types)
* range of an array: &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;array&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Range}} (or &lt;i&gt;array&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Range}}{{Ada/delimiter|(}}''n''{{Ada/delimiter|)}}&lt;/code&gt; for multidimensional arrays)

Keyword {{Ada/kw|in}} may also be followed by an ''iterable''. This generalizes iteration by including types that have one of the interfaces defined in ''Ada.Iterator_Interfaces''.
{{Ada/2012}}

Another generalized form of looping iteration uses the keyword {{Ada/kw|of}} in place of  {{Ada/kw|in}}. The loop parameter is then referring to components of arrays or of iterable container types, directly.
{{Ada/2012}}

 [''loop name'' {{Ada/delimiter|:}}] {{Ada/kw|for}} ''var'' [{{Ada/delimiter|:}} ''type''] {{Ada/kw|of}} [ {{Ada/kw|reverse}} ] ''iterable'' {{Ada/kw|loop}}
    ...
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}} [''loop name'']{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

== Representation clauses ==

=== Attribute definition clause ===

 {{Ada/kw|for}} &lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}&lt;i&gt;attribute&lt;/i&gt; {{Ada/kw|use}} &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Where ''attribute'' can be any [[:Category:Ada Programming/Specifiable attributes|specifiable attribute]].

=== Enumeration representation clause ===

 {{Ada/kw|for}} ''enumeration type'' {{Ada/kw|use}} (''enum1'' {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} ''value1''{{Ada/delimiter|,}} ''enum2'' {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} ''value2''{{Ada/delimiter|,}} ...);

=== Record representation clause ===

 {{Ada/kw|for}} ''record type'' {{Ada/kw|use}}
   {{Ada/kw|record}}
      ''component1'' {{Ada/kw|at}} ''offset'' {{Ada/kw|range}} ''first bit 1'' {{Ada/delimiter|..}} ''last bit 1''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      ''component2'' {{Ada/kw|at}} ''offset'' {{Ada/kw|range}} ''first bit 2'' {{Ada/delimiter|..}} ''last bit 2''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      ...
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

=== At clause (obsolescent) ===

At clauses are obsolescent since [[Ada Programming/Ada 95|Ada&amp;nbsp;95]]:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} ''id'' {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|at}} ''address''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

where ''address'' is of the type &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|System}}.Address&lt;/code&gt;.

An at clause is equivalent to &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|for}} &lt;i&gt;id&lt;/i&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Address}} {{Ada/kw|use}} ''address''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Since Ada&amp;nbsp;95 this is the preferred method.

== Quantified expressions ==
{{Ada/2012}}&lt;br/&gt;

Quantified expressions are Boolean expressions. They are either '''True''' or '''False''', or propagate any exception raised during evaluation.

=== Universal quantification ===
[[w:Universal quantification|Universal quantification]] expression:

 ({{Ada/kw|for}} {{Ada/kw|all}} ''var'' {{Ada/kw|in}} ''range'' {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} ''predicate'')
 ({{Ada/kw|for}} {{Ada/kw|all}} ''var'' {{Ada/kw|of}} ''iterable'' {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} ''predicate'')

Both forms evaluate to '''True''' when all of the values in ''range'' (of ''iterable'') make the ''predicate'' yield '''True'''. Evaluation of ''predicate''  stops when either all values of loop parameter ''var'' have been exhausted, or when evaluation for some value yields '''False''' (short circuit).

=== Existential quantification ===
[[w:Existential quantification|Existential quantification]] expression:

 ({{Ada/kw|for}} {{Ada/kw|some}} ''var'' {{Ada/kw|in}} ''range'' {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} ''predicate'')
 ({{Ada/kw|for}} {{Ada/kw|some}} ''var'' {{Ada/kw|of}} ''iterable'' {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} ''predicate'')

Both forms evaluate to '''True''' when some of the values in ''range'' (of ''iterable'') makes the ''predicate'' yield '''True'''. Evaluation of ''predicate''  stops when either all values of loop parameter ''var'' have been exhausted, or when evaluation for some value yields '''True''' (short circuit).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A theory is a set of statements that allow us to explain, predict, or control events (Smith and Ragan, 1993). A theory provides an explanation for observations made over time. A theory explains and predicts behavior. A theory can be modified. Theories are rarely discarded if tested, but sometimes a theory may be widely accepted for a long time and later disproved. There are two kinds of theories on which instructional design is based:

#Descriptive Theories
#Predictive Theories

Descriptive theories describe how learning occurs. Prescriptive theories describe what to do to achieve certain outcomes. Most instructional theories are prescriptive. They suggest that if instruction follows a certain form and process, then learning will occur. This will be a section on the theoretical bases for the field of Instructional Design. By many accounts, there are four, sometimes referred to as the pillars of the field [http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/s/j/sjm256/portfolio/kbase/FoundationsISD.html (McGriff, n.d.)]:


==Audio-Visual Foundations==

===Visualization enhances the learning process===

Hoban, Hoban and Zisman (1937) explained impact of visuals on the learning process based on the mental processing including differentiation and integration to reach ultimate goal of education generalization. An object cannot be understood totally without making connection to the differentiated situations concretely in real life. In this process, visual aids play a key role for presentation of differentiated situations. However, differentiation is the secondary process of integration because the differentiated object must be put into a category or class again in real life situation. The integration of several differentiated concrete experiences related to an object produces abstraction and generalization. In this process, visual aids support not only alone differentiation but also integration of lower to higher level for the generalization purpose. The other role of the visual aids is supporting the progress of concrete to abstract. In fact, concrete and abstract forms of an object are relative terms. One is start; another is end points. During the integration to generalization process, the transition from concrete to abstract must be smoothly otherwise the process sounds meaningless. For the concrete differentiation, real sample of the object that provides sense of weight, volume and textures are appropriate. To take this process one step further for abstract forms, the visuals are very critical. Hence, visuals can be still concrete to the person without some senses and 
Hoban, Hoban and Zisman called them as semiconcrete. They can support that smooth transition to the abstraction. In some cases, direct concrete experience is not possible so the visual aids take the direct experiences role, such as in geography or history subjects. 

The similar type of support came from Dale’s Cone of Experience (1946) related to visualization and learning. Like Hoban, Hoban and Zisman (1937), Dale talked about the decreasing concrete experiences of motion pictures and its place between direct purposeful experiences and verbal symbols. The visual materials both motion and still pictures put the transition point. He also stressed the efficiency of the visualization; that one can reduce unnecessary part of the experience and concentrate the related parts. In 1949, another forerunner of audio-visual education movement Jim Finn joined Hoban and Dale (as cited in Januszewski, 2001) and supported the idea of rich concrete experiences providing with audio-visual materials rather than just presentation of eye and ear experiences.    

In other words, visualization is important for making learning process meaningful via diverse representations of the content to support both retention – within relations and transfer – relations between the other contents. Moreover, learning processes become more effective and efficient if unnecessary and unimportant parts are dismissed via utilization of visuals.      
Like the vision of Oettinger (1969), the visual materials are still very important manipulative to teach abstract concepts currently. However, the role of visual materials are not limited to the progress of concreteness to abstraction but also tied to individualized instruction regarding learning style or type of an intelligence of a person. For example, Gardner’s (1983) multiple intelligence theory includes visual/spatial intelligence.

==Communications Theory==

Communications theory is related to information processing and longterm storage and retrieval of knowledge. In the information processing model, the source of a message works its way through a channel which is influenced by noise. Sending a message involves encoding and transmitting it. Receiving a message involves receiving a message and then decoding its meaning. The form and structure of the message is of concern to instructional designers. The purpose of communications theory is to increase knowledge and understanding of some knowledge or skill; and, to persuade and/or motivate retention of the same. Communications theory can aid in the design of instructional materials by facilitating the transmission of messages and information from one person to another.

=== Communication is a two-way process that permeates all aspects of instruction === 

The fundamental starting point of communication in field of AV was the basic discussion of Harold Lassweell in 1948; that “who says what in which channel to whom with what effect?” (p. 250, as cited in Januszewski, 2001). Based on that model, other scholars of AV field got their attentions to the communication. The following to this theory, the two field were connected to each other with the Journal of AV Communication Review in 1953. 

According to Dale (1953), communication is the process of taking the other in order to reach the common experiences mutually. To understand each other clearly, communicator must establish two-way communication where the feedback is the critical part. As experience sharing process between the teacher and learner, instruction must be realized in the context of two-way communication. Although Gerbner (1956) was one of the advocator of social framework of communications, he mostly emphasized situation, perceived context, and all aspects of the content, which are the important variables of instructional environments. The social framework of communication is more detailed explained than behavioral one in which AV communication was accepted as a one-way communication and linear act where the messages were transferred form one person to another (Januszewski, 2001). In this framework, the AV field was more associated with machine and equipment perspective. 

Like Dale (1953), Hoban (1977) criticized open communication systems and proposed monitoring and correction or evaluation for the process where the user could be part of information flows. With this way, he believed, the effectiveness of information transfer could be increased. The evaluation process was based on observations. For the instruction environment, teacher must understand the reaction of students to audio-visual materials and make necessary corrections if there are some problems. He stated that without evaluations it has been impossible to improve effectiveness of the materials. 

At this time, two-way communication is the still very important principle of instruction. For example, in a form of distance learning web based instruction provides tools for communication to enhance outcomes. Moreover, most of the message design principle are the stemmed from effective communication. The most common type of message design is screen design for educational software or web based course in the field of IT. In constructivist perspective, I believe, the source of the communication process is the students and the receivers are the teachers who send feedback to facilitate students again.

==Systems Theory==

One definition of a system is that it is a set of interrelated objects working together toward a common goal (Hall &amp; Fagen, 1975). In other words, the system has a purpose or goal; its parts are organized and hierarchical. General systems theory assumes that the natural world is ordered and rational; and, planning and creation of order are valuable activities. Systems theory provides a framework for us to order the world around us in our own minds. It helps us understand relationships between people and other people, people and things, and things and other things.

The environment places constraints on a system. Through feedback mechanisms, dynamic systems change when interacting with the environment. These changes can lead to progress or self-destruction. 

Instruction is a system because it is purposeful, organized, governed by processes and is comprised of a set of interrelated part working together toward a common goal. It is used to create meaning out of existing structures, create new structures and ways to organize information, and solve problems.

=== Systems thinking and relation to historical roots of IT ===

The systems thinking in education was explained as an iterative, high speed, mental process of the frequent analysis and synthesis, called anasynthesis (Silvern, 1968). Analysis process is explained as breaking down of a whole into the parts with demonstrating all relationships of the parts to each others and to the whole itself. For a system, the relationships must be meaningful from each peace to the whole. Silvern identified process of analysis into four steps: (a) identify, (b) relate, (c) separate, and (d) limit. Synthesis is the process of combining non-related elements into meaningful relationships that produces the new product as a whole system. The main distinctive characteristic of synthesis is production of new or innovative things. As well as analysis, Silvern expressed synthesis contains five basic steps: (a) identify, (b) relate, (c) combine, and (d) limit.

Over and above of Silvern’s system explanation, Churchman (1965) proposed two principles to keep the system works. One is housekeeping principle that supports the idea of when you see a mess, clean it up. This principle fosters immediate straighten of an existing system. However, if the system becomes more complex, housekeeping principle cannot be simple to apply. In addition to housekeeping principles, Churchman talked about two fundamental design properties of any part of a system: its benefit to the whole and its price. When the change made in any part of the system, the expected benefits of it must be assessed for the whole cost to the system. Hoban (1977) explained the efficiency of the AV field by using the communication systems. He also proposed that AV communication system that indicates interaction among basic components of communication system. He advocated that in order to understand huge social system that are really difficult to analyze, we need manageable sub-systems, such as AV communication system.          

The common characteristics of educational engineering process are classified into four ways by Charters (Januszewski, 2001): (a) systematic process, (b) applications of science, (c) efficiency for the utilization of resources, and (d) aims to produce for wealth. With the systematic process, the emphasized concepts were thoroughness or step-by-step procedure and impartiality of the truth. The systematic development of instructional methods and product was the part of educational engineering. Educational engineering’s basic areas were psychology, sociology, and mathematics, like industrial engineering and its basic sciences psychics, chemistry. Educational engineering were derived from these basic sciences. Based on the discussion of Silvern (1968), Churchman (1965), and Hoban (1977), it can be proposed that system thinking is related to systematic step-by-step procedures, efficiency, and production of wealth characteristics of educational engineering. Two different ideas focus on a production system including meaningful relations by using the most efficient ways for the valuable outcomes to the outer system in a standardized way.  

The risen interest on exact measurement and prediction-based methods and outcomes by emphasized by science of education view could be easily adapted to a procedural concept of educational engineering. For the science of education perspective, we can easily observe that system thinking ensures the consistent outcomes via using comparative exact measures of benefits and costs to control system for continuous production. 

Especially, Hoban’s (1977) AV communication system was a kind of reusable module for all types of growing technologies. Hence, Hoban developed that model for the systems difficult to analyze and complex social systems. In other words, it is the effective representation why we need to use technology in complex educational environments. This is the rationale for the efficient and effective use of technology. 

As far as the programmed instruction is concerned, keeping consistency of a system production and its expected benefits and cost is closely associated because the programmed instruction includes immediate correction of the system components - housekeeping, such as reinforcement. However, Hoban emphasized that the housekeeping principle of the programmed instruction could be thought as the efficient way for instruction unless its benefits and cost to whole system were considered. He added that one of the common methods for immediate correction was supplementing the problem part with emerging technologies. In my opinion, this point is one the most critical evidence for the disappearance of the programmed instruction tools in education systems. It also must be considered for the current applied technologies nowadays.

==Learning Theory==

Behaviorism, Cognitivism and Constructivism - The Basics

Behaviorism: Based on observable changes in behavior. Behaviorism focuses on a new behavioral pattern being repeated until it becomes automatic.

Cognitivism: Based on the thought process behind the behavior. Changes in behavior are observed, and used as indicators as to what is happening inside the learner's mind.

Constructivism: Based on the premise that we all construct our own perspective of the world, through individual experiences and schema. Constructivism focuses on preparing the learner to problem solve in ambiguous situations (Schuman, 1996).

For a discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of each of the basic learning theories 

[[Instructional Technology/Learning Theory - Strengths/Weaknesses|Learning Theory - Strengths/Weaknesses]]


=== Contructivist Learning Theory [http://www.cdli.ca/~elmurphy/emurphy/cle2b.html] ===

What we call contructivism is based on the assumption that learning occurs as a result of what learners understand about their world. It is about the individual construction of knowledge. Constructivism is not a learning theory, per se, but rather philosophical approach to teaching and student learning. Constructivist education involves the creation of student-centred learning environments. Teachers adopt strategies and techniques that assist students in constructing knowledge by making links between old and new knowledge and experiences, in recognition that students bring old knowledge and experience to new learning experiences.   

Mental constructs (schema, mental models, etc.) are constructed by past experience, and modified through assimilation and accommodation of new knowledge and experience per the Piagetian framework of thinking about human learning processes. Constructivism, then, is a way of thinking about how we know what we know and understand things; and, a referent for models of instruction and learning (Tobin &amp; Tippin, 1993). In this sense, it is more of a philosphical approach to education which has implications for instructional design and practice.

==Instructional Theory==

Reigeluth (1983) defines Instructional Theory as &quot;identifying methods that will best provide the conditions under which learning goals will most likely be attained.&quot; In other words, the focus on instructional theory is on how to structure instruction and instructional material so it can be learned. Many researchers have contributed to the base of instructional theory, but Robert Gagne is considered the first to have direct connections to instructional technology. His most notable work includes his conditions of learning, nine events of instruction, learning hierarchies and taxonomy of learning objectives, (see [http://chd.gse.gmu.edu/immersion/knowledgebase/theorists/cognitivism/gagne.htm Gagne's Contributions]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Instructional design is the systematic process of designing, developing, evaluating and managing the entire instructional process to ensure effective and efficient learning. It is based on what we know about instructional and learning theories, systems design, information systems and management (Morrison, Kemp &amp; Ross, 2001). The basic elements of instructional design include:

*Analyze learner and organization needs
*Determine instructional goals and objective
*Construct a method for evaluating learner achievement
*Design and select instructional strategies
*Implement the training
*Evaluate the training


==Origins of Instructional Design==

Instructional design practices and procedures can be traced back to World War II. During the war, a number of psychologists and educators were called on to conduct research and provide training for the military. After the war, many of these individuals continued to work in the field (Reiser &amp; Dempsy, 2002).----


==Instructional Design Models==

Instructional design models help describe the process of how to conduct the various steps of instructional design. They also help us visualize the process and communication with other instructional designers and clients involved in a project. Almost all models of instructional design contain the core elements of analysis, design, develop, implement, and evaluate. This is referred to as the ADDIE model and helps ensure congruence between all phases of instruction. It is often depicted in a step-wise fashion, although it does not necessarily work that way in all cases. Several models for instructional design are described below:

===[[Instructional Technology/Instructional Design/ADDIE|ADDIE]]===

The   ADDIE instructional design model is possibly the best-known instructional design model by Christopher Pappas

The   ADDIE model refers to Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate. Furthermore, provides a step-by-step process that helps instructional designers plan and create training programs with a framework in order to make sure that their instructional products are effective and that their processes are as efficient as they can possibly be.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Analyze&lt;/span&gt;
In the analysis phase, the instructional problem is clarified, the instructional goals and objectives are established, and the learning environment and learner's existing knowledge and skills are identified. Below are some of the questions that are addressed during the analysis phase:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who is the audience and what are their characteristics?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did we identify the new behavioral outcome?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What types of learning constraints exist?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the delivery options?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the online pedagogical considerations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the timeline for project completion?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/span&gt;
The design phase deals with learning objectives, assessment instruments, exercises, content, subject matter analysis, lesson planning, and media selection. The design phase should be systematic and specific. Systematic means a logical, orderly method of identifying, developing, and evaluating a set of planned strategies targeted for attaining the project's goals. Specific means each element of the instructional design plan needs to be executed with attention to details. These are the steps used for the design phase:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Documentation of the project's instructional, visual, and technical design strategy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply instructional strategies according to the intended behavioral outcomes by domain (cognitive, affective, psychomotor).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create storyboards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design the user interface and user experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prototype creation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply visual design (graphic design)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/span&gt;
The development phase is where the developers create and assemble the content assets that were created in the design phase. Programmers work to develop and/or integrate technologies. Testers perform debugging procedures. The project is reviewed and revised according to any feedback given.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;List activities that will help the students learn the task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select the delivery method such as tapes, handouts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review existing material so that we do not reinvent the wheel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop the instructional courseware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synthesize the courseware into a viable training program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Validate the instruction to ensure it accomplishes all goals and objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Implement&lt;/span&gt;
During the implementation phase, a procedure for training the facilitators and the learners is developed. The facilitators' training should cover the course curriculum, learning outcomes, method of delivery, and testing procedures. Preparation of the learners includes training them on new tools (software or hardware), and student registration. This is also the phase where the project manager ensures that the books, hands on equipment, tools, CD-ROMs, and software are in place, and that the learning application or Web site is functional.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/span&gt;
The evaluation phase consists of two parts: formative and summative. Formative evaluation is present in each stage of the ADDIE process. Summative evaluation consists of tests designed for domain-specific, criterion-related referenced items and providing opportunities for feedback from the users.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review and evaluate each phase (analyze, design, develop, implement) to ensure it is accomplishing what it is supposed to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform external evaluations (e.g. observe that the learner on the job can actually perform the tasks that were trained).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Revise training system to make it better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

===[[Instructional Technology/Instructional Design/Dick &amp; Carey|Dick &amp; Carey]]===

The Dick and Carey Instructional Design Model by Christopher Pappas.

The Dick and Carey Instructional Design Model is based on a reductionist model of breaking instruction down into smaller components. Instruction is specifically targeted on the skills and knowledge to be taught and supplies the appropriate conditions for the learning of these outcomes. Dick and Carey Instructional Design Model is divided into ten sections.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Instructional Goals&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the goal of the instruction?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What will the learners  be able to perform after they complete the training program?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Instructional Analysis&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the skills that they will be involved to achieve in the desirable goal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Entry Behaviors and Learner Characteristics&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the skills that the learners will bring to the learning task?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Performance Objectives&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will we translate the needs and goals into specific and detailed objectives?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Criterion-Referenced Test Items&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the necessary prerequisites for learning new skills?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will we check the results of the apprentice learning during the process of the training and at the same time, provide these results to him/her?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Instructional Strategy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the instructional activities that we will follow in order to achieve the terminal objectives (exhibition of information, practice, feedback, testing)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Instructional Materials&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What type of instructional materials we will use (printed, media, both)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Formative Evaluation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What data should we revise to improve the instructional materials?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will we make instructions as effective as possible for a larger number of learners?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Revise Instruction&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will we revise the instruction after the formative evaluation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What were the difficulties for the learners and who will revise them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Summative Evaluation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was the system effective as a whole?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did the instruction work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did we achieve the desired results?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;References

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What are Learning Objects?==

Design a package of information that can be reused, reconfigured, adaptable to many environments, found whenever needed, and works right out of the box - then you have just designed a reusable learning object.

This is where the majority of the confusion begins. There are many definitions around the idea of what a package of information consists of, which makes up the reusable learning object. Due, in part, to the nature of the object itself, the data required to make it searchable by others (metadata), and varying standards of the creator, reusable learning objects may vary greatly.  

In an attempt to clear up this confusion, definitions were offered to define exactly what a reusable learning object is. As with most things, multiple definitions have been created, each varying slightly. The [http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/mlx/ Maricopa Learning Exchange] defines learning objects as &quot;discreet pieces of content that are electronic, interactive and include a form of assessment that relates to an educational goal.&quot; Cisco Systems, Inc. defines a reusable learning object as a combination of reusable information objects. &quot;An RIO is granular, reusable chunk of information that is media independent.&quot; Cisco Systems, Inc. then goes on to say &quot;individual RIOs are then combined to form a larger structure called a Reusable Learning Object (RLO)&quot; (Cisco Systems Inc., 2000). A third definition is &quot;any entity, digital, or non-digital, which can be used, reused, or referenced during technology-supported learning (Barritt &amp; Alderman, 2004).

Where agreement seems to be shared is in the purpose of a learnign object. Learning objects are instructional units designed to help learners to reach a single instructional objective. This singularity of purpose means that learning objects are self-contained, so a learner does not need supporting information to use a learning object.  

Learning objects are also reusable. This means that a user can access a learning object repeatedly, and that different users can access any learning object as a part of different curriculums, regardless of delivery the method.  Delivery options can include e-learning, intructor-led, a mix of the two, or witten documentation.

Learning objects are searchable. Each learning object is embedded with metadata that describe the subject covered in the learning object. This metadata enables users to easily locate specific learning objects by performing a simple search for a specific subject. 

Learning objects are also known by the following names:

* Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs)
* Educational Objects
* Content Objects
* Training Components
* Nuggets
* Chunks

== Characteristics of Learning Objects ==
{{Wikipedia|Learning management system}}

Barritt and Alderman (2004) identify seven main characteristics each reusable learnign object should have. These are;
**Objective-based - Each should accomplish a single learning objective.
**Context free - Each learning object can stand alone.
**Interactive - Keep the interest of the learner.
**Self-descriptive - Contain enough metadata for successful searching.
**Self-contained - Ability to stand alone or in unison with other objects.
**Single-sourced - Can be used in multiple formats and environments by multiple authors.
**Format free - Formatting the look and feel should be done during delivery.

Wiley (2000) describes three characteristics that define learning objects;
* &quot;Modular digital resources, uniquely identified and metatagged,that can be used to support learning.&quot;
* &quot;Digital resource that can be reused to support learning...&quot;
* &quot;The main idea of 'learning objects' is to break educational content down into small chunks that can be reused in various learning environments, in the spirit of object-oriented programming.&quot;

Attributes of learning objects are further represented with the mnemonic aid, &quot;RAID&quot;.

'''R - '''Reusable&lt;br&gt;
Learning objects should have future compatabilities for a longer usable lifetime.

'''A - '''Accessible&lt;br&gt;
Learning objects should be easy to locate, access, archive, and reuse.

'''I - '''Interoperable&lt;br&gt;
Learning objects should smoothly migrate as platforms evolve.

'''D - '''Durable&lt;br&gt;
Learning objects should have a long lifetime of materials.

Learning objects with these attributes have a greater potential for providing the following benefits:
* Benefit education in general
* Expand to use by a larger audience
* Commercial value, i.e. learning objects can be marketed singly or in sets. 

== Using Learning Objects ==
Once you've found the right learning objects, it is vital to understand how to use them effectively to achieve your learning goals and objectives. Finding learning objects to use is one aspect of instructional development, making sure that the learning object is used effectively and appropriately within the course context is another.

An online book that consists of a collection of writings around the instructional use of learning objects can help to connect learning objects to instruction and learning.

[http://reusability.org/read/ '''The Instructional Use of Learning Objects''']is a combination of material from respected authors in the area of instructional objects and theories.

This website also permits visitors to participate in discussions of the book's chapters with the authors and others. Readers may also submit any corrections or errors found in a chapter, or discuss other issues related to learning objects, instruction, and learning.

If these pages have not fully defined what are Learning objects? and you require a different kind of learning strategy,[http://showcase.alivetek.com/learningobjects/gameshow6_TRAIN2.swf click here]to play a game, as presented by Sandy Mills at the 2003 Distance Learning Administration Conference in beautiful Jekyll Island, Georgia, and learn all about learning objects.

== Creating Learning Objects ==

The Cisco System Corporation proposed a four phase system for RLO’s creation.  Each of these phases interacts with each other.  This system has built into it a blend of traditional ISD steps as well as newer computer instructional elements.  The phases were:

*Design- The design phase is where the foundation of the learning event is created.  There are four stages included in this phase:  Needs Assessment, Task Analysis, Learning Objectives, and RLO Types.  When designing learning objects, it is pertinent to consider how many objectives should be included.  If too many are included, the object may become large, which will limit its ability to be reused by other individuals.  

*Develop- The development phase is where text, graphics, video and supporting content are built.  This phase would be complete when alpha, beta testing and review stages are complete.

*Deliver- At the beginning of this phase, the RLO's are complete and produced.  The RLO would be stored in a database and are ready of use.  Packaging of the RLO for delivery to the user must be decided.  Three common types of delivery are:  Dynamic Web Packages, CD-ROM’s, and Instructor-Led Training Materials.

*Evaluate- The evaluation phase is built off of Kirkpatrick’s four levels of evaluation.  According to Cisco using these four levels will allow the author or organization to be able to make judgements about the effectiveness of the RLO.[http://ideal.cecs.missouri.edu/~yliu/learning%20objects/rlo_strategy_v3-1.pdf#search='Reusable%20Learning%20Object%20Strategy']

== Finding Learning Objects ==

Now that you have realized the potential and advantages of Learning Objects, where do you find them?
Learning object discovery may be conducted through a content catalog managed by a learning object repository.

===Metadata===

For learning objects to be used they must be found. It is not easy to find anything in a large distributed online environment like the World Wide Web or a large intranet. The solution is to store not only learning objects but also descriptions of the learning objects. Thinking of the learning objects as data, the descriptions are data about the data, or metadata. Learning object metadata potentially includes information about the title, author, version number, creation date, technical requirements and educational context and intent. Learning Object Metadata is compatible with the metadata used by the digital and online library community. A large amount of metadata can be input for each reusable learnign object, making this task somewhat labor intensive. A balance between inputing enough data to find the object and time spent inputing data is  usually determined by the size and importance of the reusable learning object.

==Shareable Content Objects==
When data characteristics are attached, or associated with a particular Learning Object, it can now become a Shareable Content Object. Also known as a SCO, it is the smallest logical unit of instruction that can be delivered or monitored by a Learning Management System.This attached data is contained in a special file referred to as the manifest file. This file is in a special XML language, that is placed in the top-level directory of a Learning Object and labeled &quot;[[Instructional Technology/Learning Management Systems/Learning Objects|imsmanifest.xml]].&quot; This data or metadata inside the manifest would describes course content and asset meta-data and data that can be maintained on the LMS for and about each student.

Each object should have enough material to be able to function as a stand alone module, without links to supporting material; the sequence in which the SCO appears is controlled through the learner management system. A SCO can conform to any of the more traditional instructional material roles, for example it could be a lesson, a module, a unit of a course, or a learning objective for a lesson. A well constructed SCO might contain all the &quot;assets&quot; needed to present a single lesson or learning objective.

It is shareable because it is usable in more than one course; its content consists of assets, that is the graphics, text or other multimedia that make up a Learning Objective, and it is treated as a single object.

Combine all the attributes of a SCO and what is now created is an object that is compliant with set standards to make it suitable for the acronym described earlier as RAID. The Shareable Content Object is now said to be SCORM compliant.

'''SCORM''' - Shareable Content Object Reference Model are the necessary specifications set-up by the [http://www.adlnet.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=scormabt Advanced Distributed Learning]initiative for improving the education and training of the workforce and the military.

The stated goals for the ADL include:
* providing access to high-quality, tailored education and training materials
* making these materials widely available whenever and wherever they are required
* accelerating large-scale development of learning software
creating a vigorous market for these products

'''The ADL has created its strategy for achieving their SCORM goals by proposing;'''
* to facilitate development of common standards for educational technology
* to pursue emerging network-based technologies 
* to promote widespread collaboration based upon common needs
* to work with industry to influence commercial product development

Because the Learning Object supports the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Instructional_Transaction_Theory_%28ITT%29 instructional transaction theory]of bringing many learning interactions together to acquire a piece of knowledge, many uses can be found throughout education for them such as in; [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Distance_Education distance education], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Reusable_Learning_Objects_in_Special_Education special education], and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Project_Based_Learning project based learning]environments.

==Imsmanifest.xml==

Data information containted within a Learning Object has three characteristics that are tracked. Course Description, Course Sequencing, and Course Resources are all placed in a single file called imsmanifest.xml. The imsmanifest.xml file is organized into four sections, the preamble section, the metadata section, the organization section, and the resources section.

* '''Preamble section:'''- This section is virtually the same in every imsmanifest.xml file. This section contains the information used by the LMS.
* '''Metadata section:'''- This section is where the course is described.
* '''Organization section:'''- This section describes the sequencing of the SCOs in the course.
* '''Resources section:''' This section lists all the files that are used with the corresponding SCOs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Beginning in the 1950s, the computer industry began using computers to train its own employees. Although able to provide self-paced, individualized instruction with feedback and evaluation, these computer programs were written in technical machine languages of the time, requiring the expertise of experienced computer professionals to design and create them.

With the relatively recent development of more approachable scripting languages such as Perl, ActionScript and JavaScript, it is now possible for instructional designers unskilled in computer programming, per se, to create branched feedback loops, testing modules and employ other methods of information exchange between computers and learners on the Web. In addition, high level authoring systems ease the process of creating interactive Web-based feedback loops, making it possible for them to create interactive Web sites and online instructional software, e.g. Macromedia Dreamweaver, Flash, Authorware, Director and Shockwave. As contemporary learning markets increasingly demand them, publishers are creating online testing and course content modules that compliment required texts as a means to online instruction effecting student learning. Course management and learning management systems are making it increasingly easier to develop large amounts of instruction and instructional material to an international audience.


==Distance Education Defined==
Teaching and learning in which learning normally occurs in a different place from teaching.
Often used interchangeably with distance learning. Typically the learners and instructors are separated by time and place. Interaction must take place through some form of media, such as print (correspondence courses) or electronic (computers). Most distance education courses use a combination of media and technologies.

Distance Education is systematic, planned instruction that is delivered in a manner in which the learner and the instructor are separated by distance and/or time.  The instruction should be hosted by an accredited organization or it can be delivered internally within a company or corporation.  The deliver methods should conform to current technological methods; such as teleconferencing, web-based over the Internet, CD or DVD-ORM disks that are hyperlinked to the Internet.  

This definition is based on a literature search via the Internet, that encompassed several institutions of higher education, including,  [[http://www.holmes.cc.ms.us/elearning/definition.htm Holmes Community College]] in Mississippi, [[http://www.uwex.edu/disted/definition.htm University of Wisconsin-Extension]], [[http://cde.psu.edu/de/what_is_de.html Penn State University]].  The search also included other organizational entities, such as  [[http://www.itcnetwork.org/definition.htm Instructional Technology Council (ITC)]],  and the [[http://www.ncacihe.org/resource/guidelines/gdistance.html Higher Learning Commission]].

The rationale for this definition is that the general consensus among all of the researched definitions, which were organizations within the United States, is that distance education is mainly a geographic separation between the instructor and the learners.  These definitions are a little more inclusive than the European definitions that make a strict requirement on separation by time (and geography).  All of the definitions in the research allowed both asynchronous and synchronous models of distance education.  All of the models allowed two-way video as an acceptable form of distance education.

Distance Education is not a new concept.  It began in the 19th century with [[Instructional Technology/Distance Education/Correspondence courses|correspondence courses]].  As time went on technology was a driver of many new forms of distance education. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The major forms of distance education include:&lt;br&gt;

**[[Instructional Technology/Distance Education/Broadcast Courses|Broadcast Courses]]

== History of Distance Education == 

Distance education offers a second chance at education for people who regret never having finished it. It also offers the flexibility to accommodate individual needs and meet a variety of learning styles and preferences. The earliest form of a distance classroom, an educational experience that separates the instructor and student from each other by distance and time, was paper-based correspondence. Issac Pittman introduced correspondence education in 1840 by sending his students instructions in shorthand through the mail (Curzon, 1977).

This form of distance education was just the beginning of what we are experiencing today. It was an educational experience that, at least part of the time, had the instructor and student at a distance from each other by transformation of the traditional classroom through a different mode. The technology of the time was paper and pen. The technology of today is the computer. “When the computer is used to move beyond traditional classroom walls, opportunities for learning expand. Education is becoming an experience of learning and sharing for students and teachers as a community of learners online [over the Internet]” (Brewer, DeJonge &amp; Stout, 2001, p. 34).
 
With many degrees, programs of study and opportunities for formal and informal education available online, the world of distance education has been transformed by the Internet. While the Web has made it possible for students and teachers to easily access information from their personal computer, it is increasingly used to deliver instructional material and instruction inside and out of the traditional classroom.

Distant learning is becoming a more popular way of learning, than the traditional classroom.  Many people prefere online classes and being able to complete homework on there own time.  It saves them time on the commute there and back everyday.  
Traditional student might find it difficult due to there ability to operate a computer or not having the resources for Internet.  Most people do not own a computer or can afford internet service in there home.  
Most students can adapt to change like online learning, for non traditional students this change might seem overwhelming to learn a new skill.  
Most student may choose to stay in classrooms and have contact with the teacher. Being able to ask questions and find answers in class from teachers or peers is benificial.  With online learning the response time from teacher to student may take longer.   
(Morley, Deborah, Parker, Charles S.&quot;Understanding Computers, Today and Tomorrow&quot;. 2011 p.332)

== K-12 Distance Education ==

Eighty percent of public school districts said that offering courses that are not currently available at their schools is the most important reason for having distance education in their schools. A new report just published by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the first ever to report data on K-12 Distance Education. It shows that about one third of all public school district had students enrolled in distance education courses in the 2002-2003 school year.  In this study, distance education is defined as courses taken for credit and offered to elementary and secondary school students in a school district where the teachers and students are in different locations.

The study found that a greater proportion of districts with students enrolled in distance education courses are located in rural areas (46 percent) than in urban areas (23 percent). 76% of students were in hhgh schools, 15% were in ungraded programs, 7% were in junior high schools, and 2% were in elementary schools.  14% of the total enrollments in distance education in K-12 were in Advanced Placement or college level courses. Distance Education in the K-12 environment has implications for the structure and organization of public education in this country. It moves us closer to the concept of Schools without Walls!
 
The report is titled &quot;Distance Education Courses for Public Elementary and Secondary School Students: 2002-03&quot;
and is available online at: [http://www.nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2005010]

Michigan Virtual High School(MVHS)provides courses and other learning tools that students otherwise might not have access to.  The courses are all taught by certified teachers.  MVHS cannot grant a high school diploma.  Visit the website for more information

== Principles of Good Online Practice ==

The lack of interactivity was a problem with many early Web designs. Early forms of Web instruction was limited to more or less electronic page turning. Hyperlinks generally didn’t change and they connected static pages that weren’t altered until a site administrator or developer updated the information on specific pages. The underlying problem was that hyperlinked paths through information do not necessarily produce better processing of information in memory or well-constructed personal structures of knowledge. In other words, learning doesn't occur just because the learner clicks on a hyperlink.

Arthur Chickering and Zelda Gamson (March, 1987) identified seven principles that can help improve undergraduate education. Although originally intended to improve teaching and learning of college age students in the traditional classroom, as well as the governance of higher education, this work is considered monumental to the improvement of online instruction. According to Chickering and Gamson, “each practice can stand on its own … together, they employ six powerful forces in education: activity, cooperation, diversity, expectations, interaction and responsibility” (p. 4). In summary, Chickering and Gamson’s principles of good practices in undergraduate education:

#Encourages contacts between students and faculty
#Develops reciprocity and cooperation among students
#Uses active learning techniques
#Gives prompt feedback
#Emphasizes time on task
#Communicates high expectations
#Respects diverse talents and ways of learning

Although Chickering and Gamson’s work came out in the mid-1980s (well before the introduction of online education), its relevance is renewed in light of increased interest in online teaching which has traditionally included presenting new information and then checked to see that learning has occurred. While teaching is principally an interactive process, the Web is historically a “push” technology, used to disseminate information of commercial and even educational value. Chickering and Gameson’s principles are useful in that they point out practices which inform approaches used in online education.

== Distance Education in the Developing World ==

For a long time, developing countries have sent people abroad for university training. These individuals were expected to return to staff universities and government ministries, and serve as conduits of knowledge and skills from the First World to the Third World.  Today, government funding has become more scarce, and university education more expensive. With the endless pressure to, “join the global information economy or perish,” is distance education the best way to train more people, better, and at lower costs? The interplay of technological, pedagogical, cultural, economical, and political factors — at both local and international levels — need to be explored. 

One of the things to keep in mind is that as distance education becomes more widespread and accepted globally, the types and configurations of delivery methods grow proportionately. It is within this diversity that many of the possibilities, stumbling blocks, and solutions for developing countries will be found. 

Developing countries have a rich diversity of university distance education. These institutions are found within single countries, across regions, and between continents. For reasons of cost and infrastructure, television broadcasting and written correspondence remain the preferred delivery method for most. The African Virtual University based in Nairobi, however, is using the Internet and educational software with content in English, French, and Portuguese to train students in a number of countries. 

There are many benefits to be had from distance education in the developing world, but there are also many stumbling blocks that have to be avoided. Apart from infrastructure restraints, there are differences in cultural attitudes toward communications that are becoming increasingly an issue as technologies enter more traditional cultures.

Established social and cultural values also play a key role in the success or failure of distance learning programs. The more “impersonal” computer-based and all asynchronous technologies often clash in traditional societies with cultures that often prefer more “face-to-face” interaction. Many parts of the developing world still retain teaching styles that emphasize rote learning and memorization and involve less independent reading and ensuing critical writing and analysis. How does interactive technology meet this challenge? Is the answer to copy blindly what is being done in the United States? Doing so without taking into consideration economical, social and cultural factors would be a mistake. There should not be just one method of delivery, but maybe a “cocktail of choices” that fits each particular region’s needs. Geography, infrastructure, financing, culture and learning styles will have an impact on what delivery methods should and can be utilized.

Definitions of terminology used in reporting cancer survival statistics. (NOTE: different authors may use varying definitions. Examples of trials using certain definitions are given for the purpose of comparison.)

==Survival statistics==
*'''Overall survival (OS)'''
**From date of diagnosis until death from '''any cause'''. {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
*'''Disease-free survival (DFS)'''
**From date of diagnosis until date of first recurrence, locoregional or systemic. All other events were censored. {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
**Events are death or recurrence. {{ref|EBMT}} {{ref|Sargent}}
**May also include second primary tumors (NSABP B-04).
**Only includes pts who reached a CR at the end of treatment. {{ref|GELA}}
*'''Local-recurrence-free survival'''
*'''Locoregional recurrence-free survival'''
**1) survival free of an isolated locoregional recurrence at a minimum of 6 months before a systemic event, or 2) survival free of locoregional recurrence occurring at any time before systemic recurrence. Other events were censored. {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
*'''Event-free survival'''
**From date of diagnosis until 1) locoregional or systemic recurrence, 2) second malignancy, or 3) death from any cause {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
**1) disease progression or relapse, institution of new unplanned anticancer treatment, or death from any cause {{ref|GELA}}

*'''Disease-specific survival'''
**From diagnosis until death due to the cancer (with or without a prior known date of locoregional or systemic relapse). All other causes of death censored. {{ref|BritishColumbia}}
*'''Metastasis-free survival'''
*'''Relapse-free survival (RFS)'''
**Includes any recurrence. Does not include death (i.e., ''deaths are censored''). May also include a contralateral breast cancer that is deemed a recurrence of the primary tumor (NSABP B-04).
*'''Progression-free survival (PFS)'''
**Same as EFS except late deaths not related to cancer or its treatment were excluded. 1) disease progression or relapse, institution of new unplanned anticancer treatment, or death related to disease {{ref|GELA}}

*'''Systemic disease-free survival'''
**From date of diagnosis until date of first systemic recurrence, including: 1) systemic recurrence outside the locoregional area at any time before or after locoregional relapse, 2) systemic recurrence with or without locoregional relapse, or 3) death from cancer with no information on systemic recurrence. (All other causes of death were censored.) {{ref|BritishColumbia}}

*'''Freedom from progression (FFP)'''
**Until first treatment failure. Includes failure to achieve CR (as opposed to RFS). Does not include deaths. {{ref|MilanHD}} {{ref|EORTC_H3}}

==Tumor response==
*CR - complete response 
**CRu - complete response (undocumented)
*PR - partial response
*Stable disease
*Progressive disease

==References==
*WHO definitions - PMID 7459811 &amp;mdash; &quot;Reporting results of cancer treatment&quot; Miller AB et al. Cancer. 1981 Jan 1;47(1):207-14. 
**I believe this publication gives the definitions for partial response, complete response, etc.
*'''RECIST''' criteria (2000) - Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
**Response is defined as a 30% decrease in the largest diameter instead of 50% decrease in bidimensional measurements. (0.7 * 0.7 is close to 0.50)
**[http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/TherasseRECISTJNCI.pdf Full publication (PDF)] (PMID 10655437) - [http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/quickrcst.doc Quick Reference (Microsoft Word)]
*'''RECIST 1.1''' criteria (2009) - Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Updated and Clarified
**HIGHLIGHTS OF REVISED RECIST 1.1: Major changes include: Number of lesions required to be assess tumor burden for response determination has been reduced from a max of 10 to a max of 5 total. Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated such that nodes with a short axis of 15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions. The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of tumour response. Nodes that shrink to &lt;10mm short axis are considered normal. Confirmation of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of interpretation of data. Disease progression is clarified in several aspects: in addition to the previous definition of progression in target disease of 20% increase in sum, a 5mm absolute increase is now required as well to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very small. Furthermore, there is guidance offered on what constitutes 'unequivocal progression' of non-measurable/non-target disease, a source of confusion in the original RECIST guideline. Finally, a section on detection of new lesions, including the interpretation of FDG-PET scan assessment is included. Imaging guidance: the revised RECIST includes a new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on the optimal anatomical assessment of lesions.

''Please see [[Wikijunior:Solar System/About weight and gravity|About weight and gravity]] for an alternate version of this module.''
----

Do you know your weight in kilograms or pounds? On Earth, your weight is a number. If you are heavier, then this number is larger. If you go to the moon, or to a space station, is this number the same? Some people say that it is the same, and some people say that it is different. To understand why, you need to know about '''gravity, mass, and weight'''.

=== Mass ===
Like many words, the word ''weight'' can have several different meanings. One meaning of weight is called ''mass''. The word &quot;mass&quot; is used in astronomy and other parts of science.

The mass of an object is simply the amount of material the object is made of. The more material the object is made of, the more mass it has. Things that have a big mass are harder to move and harder to stop than objects with just a little bit of mass. So an empty box (with only air inside) is easier to move than a box filled with books. The box with books has more material, and so more mass, than the empty box.

Our mass is a number for how much stuff there is in our body. That is, if we grow, adding more cells to our body, or retaining more body fat or increasing how big our muscles are, our mass will increase; the number for your mass becomes larger. If we start a diet, and reduce how much fat is kept by our body, the number for our mass becomes smaller. In countries that use the metric system, also called the &quot;Le Système International d'Unités&quot; or SI, the units of mass used for the weight of people is often ''kilograms'' (kg).

Suppose that a child has a mass of 40 kg.
Now suppose the child goes to the moon or to a space station, but does not change in body composition. Then the number for how much stuff the body has does not change. The child's mass on the moon or at a space station is 40 kg. 

Our mass on any planet on the solar system (Jupiter, Venus, Earth, or anywhere else) is the same. But if we step on a scale, the reading will be different on all of these planets, because a scale measures weight, not mass, and weight depends on gravity as well as on mass.

=== Gravity ===
There is another meaning of weight, called &quot;force of gravity&quot;. The word &quot;weight&quot; can mean one of two things, &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;force of gravity&quot;. But what is &quot;gravity&quot;?

Suppose we jump into the air. We cannot fly, but instead we fall and land on the ground. There is a ''force'' which pulls us to the ground. This force is called ''gravity''. The Earth makes gravity, so every time that we jump, we will land on Earth again, because the Earth's gravity pulls us, and we are not strong enough to jump fast enough to escape that gravity.

Which objects make gravity? To make significant gravity, an object must have a very large number for mass. A child may only be 40 kg. The Earth's mass is about 6 million billion billion kg. (That's six followed by twenty-four zeros). The Earth has enough mass to make us fall, as quickly as we do, when we jump.

All things with mass make gravity and attract one another. The more mass an object has, the more it attracts other objects toward it. So while the Earth pulls on a child, the child also pulls on the Earth. The force on the child is the same as the force on the earth. Because the earth is so massive, that force moves it very little. If we could look very closely, though, we would see that when the child jumps, the Earth is pushed away by the force of the child's legs, a very small distance, mostly it's the child who moves. And then, when the child falls, the Earth also &quot;falls&quot; just a little bit toward the child.

Everything with mass makes gravity. When we are on Earth, the moon, the other planets, and the sun are far away, and the force of gravity gets smaller with distance, so we land on Earth again. (Gravity pulls us towards the center of any massive object. Because we are so close to the center of the Earth, compared to the center of other planets and the Sun, we are mostly pulled toward the center of the Earth when we are on the Earth. Gravity would pull us towards the center of the Venus, or any planet, if we were on the Venus or another planet.)

Suppose we went to the moon. Now the Earth is too far away to have much effect on how we would fall. If we jump from the moon, we will land on the moon again. The mass of the moon is about 70 thousand billion billion kg. This is much less than the mass of the Earth, 81 Moons would have as much mass as the Earth.

The force of gravity varies directly with the two masses that we consider, multiplied together. If we are jumping on the moon, our mass would be the same as on the Earth, but the mass of the Earth is 81 times that of the Moon, so the attractive force, if we were at the same distance from the center of the Earth or Moon, would be 1/81 as great for the Moon as for the Earth. Because the Moon is smaller, though, we are closer to the center, and the gravity on the Moon's surface is about one sixth that of the gravity on the surface of the Earth.

To describe how gravity changes with distance is a little more complicated. If we divide the distance by two, we will increase the force by two times two, or four. That's said this way: &quot;The force of gravity varies with the inverse square of the distance.&quot; When the distance is large, a little change in distance makes almost no change in the force of gravity, but the change in gravity from moving from a beach near the ocean to the top of a mountain can be measured. It's not enough to notice just from how it feels to jump!

=== Force ===
Gravity exerts a force and that force may be measured in units called &quot;newtons.&quot; The force on a mass exerted by gravity will vary with the mass and how strong the gravity is where the mass is located. If we double the mass we will double the force.

However, when we push on an object that is free to move, that object will start to move in the direction we push. How fast it moves depends on three things: how hard we push, the mass of the object, and how long we push.

The more massive the object, the slower will be its response to our pushing. The result is that, although the force of gravity increases with mass, the motion decreases with mass, and these two effects cancel each other out.

So how fast things fall doesn't change with the mass. However, other things may change it, especially friction or air resistance.

A cannonball is pulled more strongly by gravity than a ball-bearing, but it has more mass and takes more effort to start moving. A ball-bearing has less mass, but takes less effort to start moving. Both then take the same amount of time to roll down a ramp, and perhaps you have seen or will see a demonstration of something like this.

Why, then, does something like a feather or piece of paper take so much longer to fall to the ground than a cannonball? This is because the ''resistance'' from the air in which they are falling is much greater for the feather or paper than for the cannonball. The resistance is a force opposite in direction to the motion, so it reduces the net force on the object.

(Gravity is always attracting us to the center of the Earth. Even when we are standing on the ground. The ground ''resists'' the force of gravity, pushing back up with an equal and opposite force, so we stay put.)

What happens, then, if there is no air? In 1971, astronaut David Scott visited the Moon, where there is no air. He held a feather and hammer, each in one hand, and then dropped them at the same time. They both hit the surface of the moon, also at the same time.

=== A table showing how gravity changes what happens elsewhere ===

If we were able to travel to another world, like the astronauts of the Apollo lunar exploration crews, there are a number of things that we would notice that are different from what you would experience on the Earth.  There are also some things that would be just the same.

The following is a table regarding what kinds of experiences, if we weigh 40 kg. on Earth, would have if we visited different planets or moons in the Solar System:

&lt;center&gt;
{| width=&quot;65%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|- 
! !! Earth !! Moon !! Mercury !! Venus !! Mars !! Phobos 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!Surface Gravity (compared to Earth = 1000 milli-g)
| 1000 ||  170 || 380 || 900 || 380 || 5 (average)
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!Our weight (mass)
| 40 kg || 40 kg || 40 kg || 40 kg || 40 kg || 40 kg
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!How much we could lift
| 10 kg || 59 kg || 26 kg || 11 kg || 26 kg || 2000 kg 
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!How high we could jump
| 20 cm || 120 cm || 53 cm || 22 cm || 53 cm || 400 m
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!Time to fall back to ground (seconds)
| 0.4 || 2.4 || 1.1 || 0.4 || 1.1 || 380
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!How far we could kick a ball
| 20 m || 120 m || 53 m || 22m || 53 m || (into Martian orbit)
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

In a pressurized chamber like a huge domed city, on the Moon, we would be able to put on wings and flap our arms to fly like birds do here on the Earth.  Human powered flight is almost impossible here on the Earth because humans weigh too much here.

Phobos is one of the moons of Mars, and is so tiny that the gravity is very low.  For example, if we kicked a ball really hard it could leave Phobos completely and go into orbit as a separate object orbiting Mars.  Jumping up would take several minutes before the gravity would pull us back down, so we could jump over a mountain on that moon of Mars if we wanted to.

Of all the objects in the Solar System with a &quot;solid&quot; surface that we could walk on, the Earth has the strongest gravity.  Jupiter and Saturn may have stronger gravity, but there is nothing we can say is a &quot;solid&quot; surface to walk on.  There may be planets that are larger than the Earth with a solid surface, but they are not found in our Solar System. (However, if there were a floating platform on Jupiter or Saturn, we could walk on it, but it would be difficult, we'd weigh so much.)

If you're new to the Blender, do you find this exercise useful?  Please let me know, thank you.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 14:20, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)


I thought your explanation was clear and concise. --marytee

I found it useful, helps understanding of what's going on with mesh modeling :) --rushton

Very useful piece, made the differences between edge/face/vertex quite clear. --adam

Couldn't have been better.  It gives a very good idea of how 3D modeling works for someone who has little knowledge of it.  --matt

== Important difference in who you want to reach ==

Okay, I must say that I found this very interesting. I can accept that some people won't get the explanation because there aren't any images with it. You might put a few images as a reference, at then end or the beginning of this document. Only there, I believe it would interfere with this perfectly written text otherwise.

What I also think, is that you ask your question a little bit vague.
I am a semi-n00b to rendering, I'm a student in architecture, so I know programs like sketchup etc.  And out of personal interest I too, know programs like Cinema4D, VectorWorks &amp; some Bentley systems programs (just basic introductions to them, I have had).

It is boring as hell for those who know it, and rather difficult to understand for those who know nothing about it, they don't have time to put in their heads ;-).

But, I must say, that is written very well, and for me, it was plain old perfect :-D


thank for the tut btw


MADnificent (at gmail.com)


--I've been rendering for a good few years in 3ds max now, and I'm looking at Blender to teach as a free alternative. I think your explanation is excellent, I'll probably be using it to demonstrate principles to students some time soon.  --Will S

++I think that this exercise is useful for remembering how a model is built up it is quite helpful - even if I already knew some of it!

Thanks for the excellent Tutorial.

--Joel

== Simple and concise ==

This is a good concise explanation of Mesh Modeling

== Great Tutorial ==

Very easy to follow.

--Ummon

== Plural of vertex ==
While the Webster certainly knows ''vertices'' as plural of ''vertex'', it also (and firstly) mentions ''vertexes''.


---------------------------------------
The commonly used mathematical term for the plural of vertex is vertices.

--Ummon

== 3 dots 'roughly in the shape of a triangle' ==

What does this mean? Unless they are collinear, 3 dots define a non-degenerate triangle. Does it mean equilateral triangle?

--Ummon


It is most likely there to make sure no one puts the dots in a straight line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Austria|Austrian Cuisine]]

The [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Austria|Austrian]] version of the Goulash [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] is an easy to prepare, inexpensive, tasty and filling
dish well suited for cold winter days. This thick, sweet-spicy soup of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Hungary|Hungarian]] origin is served in inns and restaurants across Austria. 

The key ingredient for goulash soup is a good quantity of sweet [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]] powder. 
It is important not to use hot paprika, the red powder sold simply as &quot;paprika&quot; in most supermarkets, as this
would make the soup too spicy and of the wrong consistency. 
Sweet paprika can be obtained from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Polish]] or central [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]] delis and specialist supermarkets. It is normally sold in 250 [[Cookbook:g|g]] sachets.  
For the authentic taste, the [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway seeds]] and [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]] are indispensable. [[Cookbook:Thyme|Thyme]] and tomato puree can be
left out if unavailable. 

==Ingredients==
 
* 500 [[Cookbook:g|g]] lean [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 3 tbsp powdered ''sweet [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]'' 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] powdered ''hot paprika''
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway seeds]] (''not'' cumin)
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]] (fresh or dried)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]] (fresh or dried)
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] [[Cookbook:Puree|puree]]
* 50 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:l|l]] [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] or 2 stock cubes dissolved in 1 l of water. 
* [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]

==Procedure==

#Cut the beef and potatoes into 1.5 [[Cookbook:cm|cm]] cubes. Cut the caraway seeds into rough chunks with a kitchen knife. Chop onions into thin slices. Warm the beef stock.
#Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a cooking pan to medium/high heat. [[Cookbook:Fry|Fry]] the beef cubes until medium brown and crispy, remove and drain on a kitchen towel.
#Turn to medium heat. Add another tbsp of vegetable oil and roast the caraway seeds for 1 min. Add the onions and turn to low heat. Gently roast the onions until they turn yellowish. 
#Add the beef cubes and roast for another 2 min. Slowly add the vinegar, beef stock, potatoes and tomato puree. Add the sweet paprika and stir well to disperse clumps.
#Season with marjoram, thyme, hot paprika, the bay leaf and a pinch of black pepper. [[Cookbook:Simmering|Simmer]] for 30 min.

==Variations==

#Garnish each dish with a tbsp of [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]] or ''[[Cookbook:Creme Fraiche|creme fraiche]]'' and sprinkle with freshly cut [[Cookbook:Chive|chives]] before serving.
#Add 100 ml of [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]]  after frying beef/onions.
#For a more nutritious meal, fry 2 [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green peppers]], 3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], 1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] and 1 [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]] (all chopped) with the onions.

Agreed, but the 'what is a reef aquarium' is good as a first section. I think content can start to be added here. I'll prime it with a basic definition first.--[[User:ChrisJMoor|ChrisJMoor]] 00:55, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

I've started adding more information to this book. 

Marine Science 101 should not be very in depth, but should cover some of the basic ideas that relate to fishkeeping so that you have a bit of scientific understanding of why you shouldn't overcrowd, or what's in the water and what don't you want in it, and other things of that nature. Purely introductory level, but I believe that it is important to give aquarists this kind of background knowledge. 

BTW, as I go through this, there are many places where I have little experience, so as I edit there will be some parts that should still be fleshed out by others. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 04:27, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

I changed it to Marine Aquaria because I believe that Reef aquaria, although an important subset, excludes other smaller topics that are not extremely different. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 13:02, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__

'''Jambalaya''', one of [[wikipedia:Louisiana|Louisiana's]] most famous dishes, is rooted in [[wikipedia:Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[wikipedia:French cuisine|French]] cuisine and is the [[wikipedia:New World|New World]] version of [[cookbook:paella recipes|paella]].

Jambalaya originated in the [[wikipedia:French Quarter|French Quarter]] of [[wikipedia:New Orleans|New Orleans]]. It was the accidental result of Spaniards attempting to make paella in the New World where [[cookbook:saffron|saffron]] was not readily available due to import costs. Consequently, tomatoes became the substitute for saffron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crawfish.com/crawfish-jambalaya.php &quot;Crawfish And Tasso Jambalaya.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As time went on, French influence became strong in New Orleans, and spices from the [[wikipedia:Caribbean|Caribbean]] changed this New World paella into a unique dish. In modern Louisiana, the dish has evolved into many variations but primarily there are two types of Jambalaya: Creole and Cajun. 

Creole Jambalaya, also called red Jambalaya, is found primarily in and around New Orleans and is made with tomatoes which make it red.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elook.org/recipes/american/510.html Creole Jambalaya recipe]&lt;/ref&gt; Cajun Jambalaya, which has no tomatoes, originated in Louisiana's rural, low-lying swamp country. It has a distinct smokey flavor and brown color, the result of browning the meat in a cast iron pot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/throwdown-with-bobby-flay/cajun-chicken-and-sausage-jambalaya-recipe/index.html Cajun Jambalaya recipe]&lt;/ref&gt; Both versions can contain virtually any kind of meat and/or seafood but [[wikipedia:crayfish|crayfish]] (called crawfish in Louisiana) is a popular inclusion.

This famous dish is surprisingly simple to prepare and works well as an everyday meal. The below Creole Jambalaya recipe includes [[Cookbook:Meat_and_poultry#Poultry|poultry]] and [[Cookbook:Tomato|canned tomatoes]].

==Ingredients==
* 1/3 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 2/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] long grain [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 14.5 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (411[[Cookbook:g|g]]) can of [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es, diced or torn apart
* 1.5 cups [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Stock|broth]]

{{spice}}

'''Bay leaves''' are the aromatic leaves of several species of the laurel family. They are used in cooking for their distinctive flavor and fragrance, and may be used fresh or dried.

'''Mediterranean bay leaf'''
: The leaf of the bay laurel or &quot;true laurel&quot;, Laurus nobilis, is a culinary herb often used to flavor soups, stews, and braises and pâtés in Mediterranean Cuisine.
'''California bay leaf'''
:The leaf of the California bay tree also known as 'California laurel', 'Oregon myrtle', and 'pepperwood', is similar to the Mediterranean bay, but has a stronger flavor.
'''Indian bay leaf (Tej pat)'''
:The leaf of the Cinnamomum tejpata tree, similar in fragrance and taste to cinnamon bark, but milder. In appearance, it is similar to the other bay leaves, but is culinary quite different.
'''Indonesian bay leaf (Daun Salam)'''
:The dried leaf of the Eugenia polyantha Wight plant of the Myrtaceae family.  There is no good substitute for this leaf in cooking.  Daun Salam is Indonesian for Peace Leaf.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unlike Allopathic Medicine Homeopathy does not advise the use of Specific medicine for diseases,however in this section medicines are arranged under disease headings for brevity and ease of understanding.

==Adenoids==
Calcium phosphate (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the prime Homeopathic medicine for the treatment of Adenoids. Another remedy used by the old German doctors was calcium iodide (CaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Both of these medicines are given in lower potencies especially '''6X'''. When Adenoids occur following vaccination the indicated medicine is '''Thuja''' in high potencies. A common strategy is to give calcium phosphate or 4 tablets twice daily and ''Thuja'' twice weekly.

==Anemia==
Schuessler recommends the use of calcium phosphate for Green sickness in young girls.Vineger, Pickles, And Lemons should be proscribed if their use in subjects is very high.

In persons lacking intellect can try Baryta Carb 200 once a day but in homoeopathy totality of symptoms count so it is advisible to take proper Homoeopathic consultation.

==Arteriosclerosis==
Homeopaths believe that the common milk thistle (''Silybum marianum''), which they call '''Carduus Marianus''', can cure arteriosclerosis. The dose is 5 drops of Tincture thrice daily. Free use of Olive oil should be encouraged in such patients.
The most effective to remove blockages of the arteries has been and still is Crataegus Q, taking several drops, 3 to 5 times daily over at least 6 months.
another remadies baryta muriaticum and baryta carbonica(both in 30 and 200 potencies) are nearly specific for this condition especially in eiderly.

==Asthma==it surly cure by
         1.blata orien mother tincture 3month
         
         2.senega 200 BD/4glbs         3month

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Never Used a Computer ==

I've moved this back here. This book is about flat-out basics for absolute beginners. For a more specific tutorial on Windows XP, I've left the
book Windows XP for Beginners as a separate project. -- [[User:Klafubra|Klafubra]] 23:34, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

 

As a passing comment, it may be worthwhile to have a section on how to explore in a computer. In the limited sample of my family members and friends, those that are computer illiterate are most afraid of breaking the computer, which makes them afraid to try out new things. I'd argue that the ability to explore a computer on your own is a key skill to get anywhere in using a computer. The section could have some info like what is safe to do, what you should avoid doing, ways to try out things if you don't know what they do, etc.

--[[User:Naerbnic|Naerbnic]] 21:54, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Help my bewk. We could be 1337 together. ^_^;;
--[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 04:02, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Naerbnic - That's a great idea. I'll try to fit it in somewhere sometime.
Cyberman - I'm kind of busy with my book, but I'll check yours out and see if I can add anything. By the way, I know nothing about A+ cerfification. :-)

--[[User:Kram|Kram]] 23:05, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Ok, I wrote a bit on web browsing, but there is a paradox here. If the poor computer-illiterate doesn't even know how to browse the web, how are they even reading this book anyway?! I think wikibooks really needs an easy way to export PDFs or something, books like this one can be printed and given out to under-developed countries etc.

--[[User:Sideris|Sideris]] 18:29, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

First of all Sideris, you should move your bit on web browsing to the actual chapter instead of the TOC. Also, I copied the text from the website, put it in OOo Writer, and exported it as a pdf. This worked okay, but it would be better if there was a program that would take the source for the wikibook and make a pdf out of it.

--[[User:Kram|Kram]] 17:09, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes, sorry I put it in the TOC, it was a moment of confusion :-) I will move it when I find some free time. About printing: it is easy to print one-page articles from wikipedia in the way you described, but the structure that wikibooks follow would make printing one whole wikibook very tedious. You need a program for that (and again, if I find the time, I'll sit down and write it myself!)

--[[User:Sideris|Sideris]] 11:54, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Paradox ==

I agree with kram that there is a paradox here - how can a person who doesn't &quot;know how to move a mouse&quot; browse through this?

==Windows XP for Beginners==

I moved this here because: almost all new computer users will have Windows XP, it is impossible to accurately teach several operating systems, and it's almost all Windows XP stuff anyway.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 01:12, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Also, do you really think that anyone who is new to computers would use Linux, I mean, come on, get serious- new users dont go out and buy Linux, period.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 01:19, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::They don't go out and buy ''any'' OS, period. They do get Linux on the $199 Walmart computers though, and they get MacOS X on Macs.

::Okay, smartguy, yes, they do buy an OS sometimes, but no, not when getting a computer.  And no one who buys that $199 computer with linux will be happy they did-they are bad for new users, ''period''.  And there's a reason you never see ''REAL'' books about all kinds of different OS's, for instance, ''maybe'' you might see Mac OS X and Windows, but you can't describe how to use the trillion plus linux os's in one book (well, since they all are just Windows 98-GUI clones, maybe you can).--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 04:35, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't see why you think so. Maybe ''you'' would not like a Linux computer. Somebody expecting to run a particular Windows-only game will of course be unhappy. The modern Linux box can do all the basic grandma tasks though. If you're thinking about the command line (like a fancy DOS box, ugh), you haven't seen a modern end-user-oriented Linux distribution.

:::It may be news to you, but many people only use the web browser. Consider that this provides email access, online tax prep, all the forums one could want, flash-based games for the grandkids, wikipedia, and so on. Linux boxes even continue functioning long after they are purchased, while Windows boxes are often replaced because of spyware-related slowdowns and crashes. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:19, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I'm okay with the name change, but there is some Linux information in the book already. Should it be removed? --[[User:Kram|Kram]] 21:01, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:If this book aims to about Windows XP, then anything not about windows xp should not be here. So I deleted a section on creating symbolic links in linux. Delete any more if you find 'em. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 01:48, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

At least until someone creates a [[Linux for Beginners]].  I'm sorry I changed it without saying anything, but to me it just seemed common sense.  If I offended someone, I'm sorry.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:35, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)


I don't think the change by [[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] was a good idea.  I would like to change it back to ''Never Used a Computer''.
Here is why:

* Windows XP will be obsolete in a few years. It would be nice to make this book a bit more generic and future proof.

* This books includes info about hardware, as it should. Absolute beginners need to be informed about hardware just as much as software. They also find it hard to distinguish between hardware and software, so both should be included in the same book.

* There is a lot more to computers than just the operating system. The info on the internet is totally independent of the operating system.

*  Naryathegreat says it is impossible to accurately teach several operating systems. As the original name implied, the book is meant for absolute square-one beginners. They don't need to be taught ''accurately'' about any operating system. They only need to  know the very basics, which are similar enough for XP, Linux and MacOS.  It is not hard to include supplementary info where there are differences. Why do we need to exclude non-Windows users categorically if they can be catered for with little effort?

* Naryathegreat says almost all new computer users will have Windows XP. What he has failed to ask is whether people reading ''this'' book will have Windows XP. People in developing nations will find this book more useful than people in the West who can afford tutorials. We should also aim this book at the vast population in developing nations purchasing the &quot;100 dollar PC&quot; over the next few years, most likely a Linux PC.

* Naryathegreat says it's almost all Windows XP stuff anyway. Not it's not. There is a large section on hardware and the internet in general, and some users are already trying to delete the section because of the name. 

I have nothing against a book called ''Windows XP for Beginners and Intermediates'' but this does not seem to be the intention of this book.
-- [[User:Klafubra|Klafubra]] 18:33, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Organizing the book ==

Hi there, you have a nice book that grows well. I'd like to suggest two things: 
# On the main page, you don't have to put links to subpages into &lt;nowiki&gt;[[sections]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It just invites people to click on the &quot;edit&quot; button to the right and put their information to the wrong place, and you have to write this &quot;If you want to add stuff, click on the chapter please!&quot; line, which, frankly, I have not seen on other Wikibooks. Why? Because they don't use headings for links. Have a look at these simple examples: [[Hamster Care]], [[How To Build A Computer]], [[CPAM with TWW]], ...
# There are several ways to organize books (see the current discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]), but I would recommend you to change to a more standardized delimiter, using either &quot;:&quot; or &quot;/&quot;. The latter (subpages via &quot;/&quot;) will give you the additional benefit of an autmatic link back to the main page of your book. Your subpages would then be organized as
 [[Windows XP for Beginners/Introduction]]
 [[Windows XP for Beginners/Buying A Computer]]
 [[Windows XP for Beginners/Flat Out Basics]]
and so on. (You can move pages easily with the &quot;move&quot; command on top of the page, once you are logged in). If you need any help or advice, just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:05, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Thanks Andreas, I think I'll fix the layout right now. --[[User:Kram|Kram]] 15:53, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:On the [[How To Build A Computer]] wikibook, we have a simplified TOC, then a link to the more complete TOC. I think that would be a good idea for this book too. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 22:43, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Removal of Computer Buying 101 Chapter ==

Since it's about XP, and not Computer Buying 101, I believe the &quot;Buying a Computer&quot; section isn't really appropriate for this book. --icez

This book was originally for people who never used a computer. [[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] then insisted on calling it Windows XP for Beginners.
I do think it is appropriate to include hardware because a) beginners find it hard to distingush between hardware and software b) beginners will
find the information very useful. [[User:Klafubra|Klafubra]] 17:56, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jobarts. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jobarts~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
