&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Python Programming/Navigation|Overview|Setting it up}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In order to program in Python you need the Python interpreter.  If it is not already installed or if the version you are using is obsolete, you will need to obtain and install Python using the methods below:

== Python 2 vs Python 3 ==
In 2008, a new version of Python (version 3) was published that was not entirely backward compatible. Developers were asked to switch to the new version as soon as possible but many of the common external modules are not yet (as of Aug 2010) available for Python 3. There is a program called ''2to3'' to convert the source code of a Python 2 program to the source code of a Python 3 program. Consider this fact before you start working with Python.

== Installing Python in Windows ==
Go to the [http://www.python.org/download/ Python Homepage] or the [http://activestate.com ActiveState website] and get the proper version for your platform. Download it, read the instructions and get it installed.

In order to run Python from the command line, you will need to have the python directory in your PATH. Alternatively, you could use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python like DrPython[http://drpython.sourceforge.net/], eric[http://www.die-offenbachs.de/eric/index.html], PyScripter[http://mmm-experts.com/Products.aspx?ProductID=4], or Python's own [[w:IDLE_(Python)|IDLE]] (which ships with every version of Python since 2.3).

The PATH variable can be modified from the Window's System control panel. To add the PATH in Windows 7 :
# Go to Start.
# Right click on computer.
# Click on properties.
# Click on 'Advanced System Settings'
# Click on 'Environmental Variables'.
# In the system variables select Path and edit it, by appending a ';' (without quote) and adding 'C:\python27'(without quote).

If you prefer having a temporary environment, you can create a new command prompt short-cut that automatically executes the following statement:
 PATH %PATH%;c:\python27
If you downloaded a different version (such as Python 3.1), change the &quot;27&quot; for the version of Python you have (27 is 2.7.x, the current version of Python 2.)

=== Cygwin ===
By default, the Cygwin installer for Windows does not include Python in the downloads.  However, it can be selected from the list of packages.

== Installing Python on Mac ==
Users on Apple Mac OS X will find that it already ships with Python 2.3 (OS X 10.4 Tiger) or Python 2.6.1 (OS X Snow Leopard), but if you want the more recent version head to [http://www.python.org/download/mac Python Download Page] follow the instruction on the page and in the installers. As a bonus you will also install the Python IDE.

== Installing Python on Unix environments ==
Python is available as a package for some Linux distributions.  In some cases, the distribution CD will contain the python package for installation, while other distributions require downloading the source code and using the compilation scripts. 

=== Gentoo GNU/Linux ===
Gentoo is an example of a distribution that installs Python by default - the package system ''Portage'' depends on Python. 

=== Ubuntu GNU/Linux ===
Users of Ubuntu will notice that Python comes installed by default, only it sometimes is not the latest version.

=== Arch GNU/Linux ===
Arch does not install python by default, but is easily available for installation through the package manager to pacman. As root (or using sudo if you've installed and configured it), type:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ pacman -Syu python&lt;/source&gt;

This will be update package databases and install python. Other versions can be built from source from the Arch User Repository.

=== Source code installations ===
Some platforms do not have a version of Python installed, and do not have pre-compiled binaries. In these cases, you will need to download the source code from the [http://www.python.org/download/ official site].  Once the download is complete, you will need to unpack the compressed archive into a folder.

To build Python, simply run the configure script (requires the Bash shell) and compile using make.  

=== Other Distributions ===

Python, which is also referred to as [[CPython]], is written in the [[C Programming]] language. The C source code is generally portable, that means CPython can run on various platforms. More precisely, CPython can be made available on all platforms that provide a compiler to translate the C source code to binary code for that platform.

Apart from CPython there are also other implementations that run on top of a virtual machine. For example, on Java's JRE (Java Runtime Environment) or Microsoft's .NET CLR (Common Language Runtime). Both can access and use the libraries available on their platform. Specifically, they make use of [[w:Reflection (computer programming)|reflection]] that allows complete inspection and use of all classes and objects for their very technology.

CPython ships with IDLE; however, IDLE is not considered user-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/11/29/the-things-i-hate-about-idle-that-i-wish-someone-would-fix/ The Things I Hate About IDLE That I Wish Someone Would Fix ].&lt;/ref&gt; For Linux, KDevelop and Spyder are popular.

The Python official wiki has a [http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments complete list of IDEs].

There are several commercial IDEs such as Komodo, BlackAdder, Code Crusader, Code Forge, and PyCharm. However, for beginners learning to program, purchasing a commercial IDE is unnecessary.

==Keeping Up to Date==
Python has a very active community and the language itself is evolving continuously. Make sure to check [http://www.python.org python.org] for recent releases and relevant tools. The website is an invaluable asset. 

Public Python-related mailing lists are hosted at [http://mail.python.org mail.python.org]. Two examples of such mailing lists are the '''Python-announce-list''' to keep up with newly released third party-modules or software for Python and the general discussion list '''Python-list'''. These lists are mirrored to the Usenet newsgroups '''comp.lang.python.announce''' &amp; '''comp.lang.python'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Variables and Strings|Sequences}}

There are five fundamental concepts in [[Python Programming|Python]].

===Case Sensitivity===
All variables are case-sensitive.  Python treats 'number' and 'Number' as separate, unrelated entities.

=== Spaces and tabs don't mix ===
Because whitespace is significant, remember that spaces and tabs don't mix, so use only one or the other when indenting your programs. A common error is to mix them. While they may look the same in editor, the interpreter will read them differently and it will result in either an error or unexpected behavior. Most decent text editors can be configured to let tab key emit spaces instead. 

Python's Style Guideline described that the preferred way is using 4 spaces.

{{Code:Tip
|
Tips: If you invoked python from the command-line, you can give -t or -tt argument to python to make python issue a warning or error on inconsistent tab usage.

|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
pythonprogrammer@wikibook:~$ python -tt myscript.py
&lt;/source&gt;

|
This will issue an error if you have mixed spaces and tabs.
}}

===Objects===
In Python, like all object oriented languages, there are aggregations of code and data called Objects, which typically represent the pieces in a conceptual model of a system.

Objects in Python are created (i.e., instantiated) from templates called [[Python Programming/Classes|Classes]] (which are covered later, as much of the language can be used without understanding classes).  They have &quot;attributes&quot;, which represent the various pieces of code and data which comprise the object.  To access attributes, one writes the name of the object followed by a period (henceforth called a dot), followed by the name of the attribute.

An example is the 'upper' attribute of strings, which refers to the code that returns a copy of the string in which all the letters are uppercase.  To get to this, it is necessary to have a way to refer to the object (in the following example, the way is the literal string that constructs the object).
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
'bob'.upper
&lt;/source&gt;

Code attributes are called &quot;methods&quot;.  So in this example, upper is a method of 'bob' (as it is of all strings).  To execute the code in a method, use a matched pair of parentheses surrounding a comma separated list of whatever arguments the method accepts (upper doesn't accept any arguments).  So to find an uppercase version of the string 'bob', one could use the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
'bob'.upper()
&lt;/source&gt;

===Scope===
In a large system, it is important that one piece of code does not affect another in difficult to predict ways.  One of the simplest ways to further this goal is to prevent one programmer's choice of names from preventing another from choosing that name.  Because of this, the concept of scope was invented.  A scope is a &quot;region&quot; of code in which a name can be used and outside of which the name cannot be easily accessed.  There are two ways of delimiting regions in Python: with functions or with modules.  They each have different ways of accessing the useful data that was produced within the scope from outside the scope.  With functions, that way is to return the data.  The way to access names from other modules lead us to another concept.

===Namespaces===
It would be possible to teach Python without the concept of namespaces because they are so similar to attributes, which we have already mentioned, but the concept of namespaces is one that transcends any particular programming language, and so it is important to teach.  To begin with, there is a built-in function &lt;tt&gt;'''dir()'''&lt;/tt&gt; that can be used to help one understand the concept of namespaces.  When you first start the Python interpreter (i.e., in interactive mode), you can list the objects in the current (or default) namespace using this function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
Python 2.3.4 (#53, Oct 18 2004, 20:35:07) [MSC v.1200 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir()
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__']
&lt;/source&gt;

This function can also be used to show the names available within a module namespace.  To demonstrate this, first we can use the &lt;tt&gt;'''type()'''&lt;/tt&gt; function to show what __builtins__ is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(__builtins__)
&lt;type 'module'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Since it is a module, we can list the names within the __builtins__ namespace, again using the &lt;tt&gt;'''dir()'''&lt;/tt&gt; function (note the complete list of names has been abbreviated):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(__builtins__)
['ArithmeticError', ... 'copyright', 'credits', ... 'help', ... 'license', ... 'zip']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Namespaces are a simple concept.  A namespace is a place in which a name resides.  Each name within a namespace is distinct from names outside of the namespace.  This layering of namespaces is called scope.  A name is placed within a namespace when that name is given a value.  For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir()
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__']
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = &quot;Bob&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir()
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'math', 'name']
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that I was able to add the &quot;name&quot; variable to the namespace using a simple assignment statement.  The import statement was used to add the &quot;math&quot; name to the current namespace.  To see what math is, we can simply:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; math
&lt;module 'math' (built-in)&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Since it is a module, it also has a namespace.  To display the names within this namespace, we:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(math)
['__doc__', '__name__', 'acos', 'asin', 'atan', 'atan2', 'ceil', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'e',
'exp', 'fabs', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'hypot', 'ldexp', 'log', 'log10', 'modf', 'pi', 'pow',
'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you look closely, you will notice that both the default namespace, and the math module namespace have a '__name__' object.  The fact that each layer can contain an object with the same name is what scope is all about.
To access objects inside a namespace, simply use the name of the module, followed by a dot, followed by the name of the object.  This allow us to differentiate between the &lt;tt&gt;__name__&lt;/tt&gt; object within the current namespace, and that of the object with the same name within the &lt;tt&gt;math&lt;/tt&gt; module.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (__name__)
__main__
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (math.__name__)
math
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (math.__doc__)
This module is always available.  It provides access to the
mathematical functions defined by the C standard.
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.pi

&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Body note|This page is not part of the main Haskell Wikibook. It overlaps with the primary introductory material. Because learning works best when experiencing things from many angles, reading this as a supplement to reinforce basic concepts may useful.

The page here is especially thorough in explaining the basics of computing and programming, and it also clarifies some precise details about Haskell. There may be room to eventually incorporate some of the elements from this back into the main book.}}

[[Haskell|Haskell]] is a [[w:programming language|programming language]]. If you can write and understand Haskell, you can create new computer programs and understand and modify programs others have written. Learning to program is a fairly complex task, but Haskell is a great way to start because it is fairly simple and predictable. Even if you end up doing most of your programming in other languages, a significant portion of your knowledge will carry over. Haskell is more than a beginning language, however; it is also one of the most advanced and powerful.

== Haskell Software ==

To begin using any programming language, you will need some special software to make up your ''development toolchain''. At the minimum, you will need a [[w:compiler|compiler]] or an [[w:interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].

First, we need to reveal a little about how computers work. You may have heard of CPUs([[w:central processing unit|Central Processing Unit]]s). They are pieces of hardware responsible for interpreting data known as [[w:machine language|machine language]] stored in the computer's memory. Machine language encodes simple instructions which, when processed by the CPU, cause the computer to do useful things such as bring you to this Web page. In other words, it is a programming language. The programs your computer executes, and the data they operate on, are stored in the same manner.

One significant consequence of this architecture is that programs can write other programs. That is how interpreters and compilers work. They translate programs written in a language such as Haskell into programs written in machine language which can then be directly executed by the computer.

The difference between a compiler and an interpreter has to do with the internal workings of the software, and you don't need to worry about it too much. Today, the difference is becoming increasingly unclear and irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;For example: is an interpreter an interpreter if what it is really doing is just compiling an expression to machine code and executing it really fast? The theoretical difference between interpretation and compilation seems to be minimal to nonexistent given [[w:Partial evaluation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For Haskell, we use the [[w:Glasgow Haskell compiler|Glasgow Haskell Compiler]] (GHC). It is a free/libre/open-source program, available for all major operating systems. [http://haskell.org/ghc/download.html Download]

== The REPL: Using Haskell as a Calculator ==

GHC includes a program known as GHCi, or &quot;GHC Interactive.&quot; This program lets you type in small Haskell programs on one line, and executes them when you hit Enter. Consult the [http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/index.html GHC documentation] for info on how to start GHCi, and do so.

You should have a prompt, which says something such as &lt;code&gt;Main&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, in front of you. (Don't be alarmed if it says something else, such as &lt;code&gt;Prelude&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). When GHCi is in this state, it is ready to accept and execute a program. Try typing in the following simple program: &lt;pre&gt;1 + 1&lt;/pre&gt; GHCi should respond by displaying the number two. This is, in fact, the purpose of this program: to compute the sum of 1 and 1, and display it. Programs that compute things and display them are called ''expressions'', and they make up the larger part of Haskell. When you execute an expression to determine the value it produces, it is referred to as ''evaluating'' that expression.

Note that, once you've evaluated an expression, you can do more than simply display it; in fact, there are a variety of ways in which the values expressions produce can be used. We will encounter these various techniques later on. For now, simply be aware that they exist.

Moving back to less theoretical matters, at this point, your interaction with GHCi should look something like this: 
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; 1 + 1
2&lt;/pre&gt;
When showing examples, we will display interactions with GHCi this way, as well. A program will generally be included with its result, and preceded by a &lt;code&gt;Main&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; prompt. You can duplicate the same interaction with GHCi by typing in the program on the prompt.

=== More Arithmetic ===
As you may have guessed, Haskell supports a full complement of arithmetic operators; addition (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;), subtraction (&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;), multiplication (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;), and division (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;). Numbers can be notated in the usual way, as integers or real numbers, with one catch; no number may be written without numbers before the decimal point. That is, for instance, &lt;code&gt;.5&lt;/code&gt; should always be written as &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt;. The operators follow the normal order of operations, and parentheses can be used in the usual way. You can also use a variety of constants and functions, such as &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cos&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;tan&lt;/code&gt;.

Go ahead and try out a few expressions; you can't break anything if you mess up. Here are some simple examples:
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; 3 * 3 * 3
27
Main&gt; 9.6
9.6
Main&gt; 5 / 7
0.7142857142857143
Main&gt; sqrt(2)
1.4142135623730951
Main&gt; (7 - 5) * 3
6
Main&gt; cos(pi)
-1.0&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that the spaces in the examples are not necessary; the first one could have been written &lt;code&gt;3*3*3&lt;/code&gt;, and the fifth &lt;code&gt;(7-5)*3&lt;/code&gt;, for instance. In general, Haskell isn't picky about spaces, except where otherwise noted. When in doubt, however, use more spaces, rather than fewer.

=== Errors ===
Any computer user is familiar with errors. You can get them when programming, as well. Try this little experiment: 
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; 1 +
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:3: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)&lt;/pre&gt;
When you make a mistake in your program, GHCi will notify you, and tell you what it perceives to be the problem. Unfortunately, it doesn't always guess correctly, and it's usually rather cryptic about its diagnosis. In this example, aside from the useless comment about indentation, it's on the right track, but it still has the latter problem of being rather cryptic. So, what is a &quot;parse error?&quot;

A [[w:parser|parser]] is the part of a compiler responsible for breaking the program down into logical pieces, and converting it to a format suitable for translation into machine language. A &quot;parse error,&quot; then, is when the compiler can't make sense of your program; this means that there's a problem with your program.

So, what's this business: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;interactive&amp;gt;:1:3:&lt;/code&gt;? The first part, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;interactive&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, means that it's reporting an error from the program you just typed.&lt;ref&gt;There are other methods of program entry (which we are ignoring for now), which would display something else here.&lt;/ref&gt; The first number is the number of the line that the error occurred on; it will always be 1 for interactively entered programs, so, again, it is of little use to us. The second is the column in which GHC thinks the erroneous piece of code occurs (actually, the first column is numbered zero, so it's the offending code's column number minus one). Here it points to the fourth column, just after the plus sign; this is correct, because the problem is that we omitted a right operand for the operator. (By the way, in general, do not take these numbers as Gospel; GHC sometimes gives you numbers that are slightly off.)

Now, what about when GHC guesses the problem incorrectly? Let's consider a slightly modified version of the mistake above:
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; (1 +)

Top level:
    No instance for (Show (a -&gt; a))
      arising from use of `print' at Top level
    Probable fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (a -&gt; a))
    In a 'do' expression: print it&lt;/pre&gt;
We made a small change, and the error message changed completely. In addition, the message now diagnoses a problem completely different than the actual one, and refers to fairly advanced features of Haskell which you have yet to learn. An unfortunately large class of errors produces messages like this one; dealing with these messages is a more challenging aspect of learning Haskell. (Other programming systems share this problem, as well, but most are somewhat better off than Haskell.)

Of course, this was an extreme example; most of the time, the messages will not be so far off-target as this one.

Try typing in a few invalid programs and see what kinds of error messages you get back, just to get a feel for them. Again, you can't break anything, so don't worry about it. Here are some examples: &lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; xxx
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0: Not in scope: `xxx'
Main&gt; .5
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0: parse error on input `.'
Main&gt; 5*.5

== Variables ==
Haskell supports a feature called [[w:variable|variables]]. These are similar to the variables of algebra, but there are more restrictions on their usage.

A variable is named by one or more letters; &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jane&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;respond&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;xyzzy&lt;/code&gt; are all acceptable names for variables. They can contain uppercase letters, as well, but not as the first letter; &lt;code&gt;Jane&lt;/code&gt;, for instance, is not an acceptable variable name, although &lt;code&gt;jAnE&lt;/code&gt; is. The typical use of uppercase letters is to delimit words in names; for instance, instead of writing &lt;code&gt;multiwordvariablename&lt;/code&gt;, it is customary to write &lt;code&gt;multiWordVariableName&lt;/code&gt;, which is easier on the eyes.

You can assign values to variables with a program of the form: 
  let ''variable name'' = ''value''
For instance, the program &lt;code&gt;let x = 5&lt;/code&gt; defines &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to be five. The value can also be an arbitrary expression, such as &lt;code&gt;(2 + 3) / 1&lt;/code&gt;. 

Notice that the name of a variable is the ''only'' thing that can appear on the left side of an equals sign. These programs all work incorrectly: 
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let 5 = x
Main&gt; let 2 * x = 5
Main&gt; let x = x&lt;/pre&gt;
Curiously, GHCi generates no errors for the latter two. That's because they're valid Haskell; they just don't do what you expect. For instance, after executing the second statement, &lt;code&gt;2 * 7&lt;/code&gt; is five, and, after executing the third statement, attempting to find the value of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; will result in GHCi hanging. (Press ctrl+c in UNIX, ctrl+. in Mac OS X, and ctrl+break in Windows to stop it.)

Bottom line: Haskell isn't exactly algebra; don't use it as such.

Once you've established a variable's value, you can use that variable in following expressions; each occurrence of the variable will be substituted for its value. For instance: 
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let x = 5
Main&gt; let y = 2 + 2
Main&gt; let z = sqrt 9
Main&gt; x * (y + z)
35.0&lt;/pre&gt;
Multiple variables can be established in one &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; by delimiting the assignments with a semicolon. For instance, the previous example could be rewritten as:
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let x = 5; y = 2 + 2; z = sqrt 9
Main&gt; x * (y + z)
35.0&lt;/pre&gt;

== Functions ==
While you've made it through quite a bit of material, you may feel like you're not much closer to programming your computer. The programs we've written so far haven't accomplished much; you'd do just as well with pencil and paper or a conventional pocket calculator. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to do less trivial things, but the examples will still be quite contrived. However, at this point, you have nowhere to go but up; the variety and complexity of the programs you can write will begin to grow exponentially from here, and continue for the next several chapters, as you learn about new kinds of expressions, and new ways to combine expressions.

Haskell supports [[w:subroutine|functions]]. To begin with, don't assume any preconceptions of this word related to mathematical functions; Haskell's functions are somewhat distinct.

A better match to Haskell functions is Haskell variables. A variable stands in for an expression. A function stands in for an expression, as well, with one twist: it takes an [[w:parameter (computer science)|argument]]; a variable which is defined inside the function, supplied when the function is used. This concept is perhaps best understood by example: &lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let f x = x + 3&lt;/pre&gt; This code defines the function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, with the argument &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.

What can we do with &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;? We can ''apply'' it to an argument. Suppose the argument is to be 4. The code for this is: 
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; f 4
7&lt;/pre&gt;
What's going on here? Let's refer back to the definition of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;: 
&lt;pre&gt;let f x = x + 3&lt;/pre&gt;
The expression &lt;code&gt;f 4&lt;/code&gt; is substituted by the definition of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, with &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; substituted by four. Thus, it becomes &lt;code&gt;4 + 3&lt;/code&gt;, which is, of course, 7.

The general form of a function definition is:
  let ''function'' ''argument'' = ''definition''
And the general form of a function application is: 
  ''function'' ''argument''
Notice that, in these definitions, the word &quot;argument&quot; is used in two different ways. The first is the kind the function has attached to its definition; simply a name standing in for a value that is supplied when it is applied. The second is the actual value that ousts the previous type of argument when the function is applied, resulting an expression which can be evaluated.

A few more examples: 
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let reciprocal n = 1 / n
Main&gt; reciprocal 5
0.2
Main&gt; let theSame thing = thing
Main&gt; theSame 6
6
Main&gt; let funny joe = log(pi / joe) * cos(joe + 3)
Main&gt; funny 6
0.5895282337509272&lt;/pre&gt;
Again, there is a simple technique for figuring out the value of a function expansion by hand: 
# Write down the expansion of the function. 
# Write it down again, with all occurrences of the argument name substituted for the argument value.
# Evaluate the resulting expression.

=== Functions With Several Arguments ===
The function notation suggests that it might be possible to create a function with more than one argument. In fact, this is possible, and works exactly as you might expect:
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let add x y = x + y
Main&gt; add 5 6
11
Main&gt; let average x y z = (x + y + z) / 3
Main&gt; average 5 6 7
6
Main&gt; let first a b = a
Main&gt; first 8 1
8&lt;/pre&gt;
One &quot;gotcha&quot; to watch out for when programming with multi-argument functions is giving too many arguments, or not enough arguments, to a function. These examples demonstrate the problem:
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; average 1 2
Top level:
    No instance for (Show (a -&gt; a))
      arising from use of `print' at Top level
    Probable fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (a -&gt; a))
    In a 'do' expression: print it
Main&gt; average 1 2 3 4
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    No instance for (Fractional (t -&gt; a))
      arising from use of `average' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-6
    Probable fix: add an instance declaration for (Fractional (t -&gt; a))
    In the definition of `it': it = average 1 2 3 4&lt;/pre&gt;
Both of these errors look fairly similar. In general, if you get an error of this form, check that you gave the right number of arguments to your functions.

=== Functions in Expressions ===

Up until now, we have only given numbers as arguments to functions. However, you can give expressions as arguments, as well, and use function applications as expressions:
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let f x = 2 * x
Main&gt; f (1 + 1)
4
Main&gt; f (f (f 3))
24
Main&gt; f 4 + 2
10&lt;/pre&gt;
Function applications are evaluated before operators; thus, &lt;tt&gt;f 4 + 2&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;(f 4) + 2&lt;/tt&gt;, not &lt;tt&gt;f (4 + 2)&lt;/tt&gt;.

Since function applications are expressions, they can be used in function definitions. For instance: 
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let f x = 2 * x; g x = 3 + f x
Main&gt; f 5
10
Main&gt; g 5
13&lt;/pre&gt;
There are several small points to note here: 
* We used the semicolon notation in the &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt; expression to squeeze in definitions for two functions; &lt;tt&gt;f x = 2 * x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;g x = 3 + f x&lt;/tt&gt;.
* &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; is defined before &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt;, but it doesn't have to be that way; the program would still work if the definitions were reversed. However, this does not work:
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let g x = 3 + f x
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:14: Not in scope: `f'&lt;/pre&gt;
(When GHC complains that a variable or function is &quot;not in scope,&quot; it simply means that it has not yet seen a definition of it yet. As was mentioned before, GHC requires that variables and functions be defined before they are used.)
* The definition of &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;3 + f x&lt;/tt&gt;, is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;3 + (f x)&lt;/tt&gt;, as mandated by the rules given earlier. Thus, &lt;tt&gt;g 5&lt;/tt&gt; becomes &lt;tt&gt;3 + (2 * 5)&lt;/tt&gt; after expanding the definitions of &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;; the expression is further evaluated to produce 13.

== Conditional Tests ==

We promised that, as you read more of this book, you would learn to write newer, more exciting types of programs. In this chapter, we will fill in another missing piece of the puzzle.

The programs you have written so far have seemed somewhat simplistic; they haven't been able to make choices, to do different things at different times. An easy to achieve simple choice-making is to use an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; expression. These expressions take the following form:
  if ''test'' then ''expression'' else ''expression''
The test part can take one of the following forms:
  ''expression'' == ''expression''
  ''expression'' /= ''expression''
  ''expression'' &lt; ''expression''
  ''expression'' &gt; ''expression''
  ''expression'' &lt;= ''expression''
  ''expression'' &gt;= ''expression''
Each form describes some sort of relation between the two expressions; for instance, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the mathematical less-than test. Each is a plain-text corruption of some mathematical operator:
{|
| &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt;
| The equal-to test. It is a doubled equals sign to distinguish it from the equals sign used in &lt;tt&gt;let&lt;/tt&gt; expressions.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt;
| The not-equal-to test. It is a corruption of &lt;math&gt;\ne&lt;/math&gt;.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
| The less-than and greater-than tests.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;
| The less-than-or-equal-to and greater-than-or-equal-to tests. Corruptions of &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

When an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; expression is evaluated, if the ''test'' part states something true (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;5 &lt; 6&lt;/tt&gt;), then it evaluates to the ''then'' expression; otherwise, if the ''test'' part states something false (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;5 == 6&lt;/tt&gt;), then it evaluates to the ''else'' expression. This is demonstrated in these examples:
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let x = 5
Main&gt; if x &lt; 7 then 1 else 2
1
Main&gt; if x &lt;= 5 then x + 1 else pi
6
Main&gt; 1 + (if 2 * x == 10 then 2 else 1)
3
Main&gt; if x &lt; 6 then (if x &lt; 5 then 1 else 2) else 3
2
Main&gt; if x &lt; 5 then 1 else (if x &lt; 6 then 2 else 3)
2&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that, in the last three examples, the parentheses were not necessary; however, if the last example had been written with the operands to the plus sign reversed, the parentheses would have been necessary; thus, it would be
&lt;pre&gt;(if 2 * x == 10 then 2 else 1) + 1&lt;/pre&gt;
If it were written without the parentheses, it would evaluate to:
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; if 2 * x == 10 then 2 else 1 + 1
2&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Examples ===
Here are a few examples of functions using &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; expressions.

==== Absolute Value ====
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let abs x = if x &lt; 0 then -x else x
Main&gt; abs 5
5
Main&gt; abs (-3)
3
Main&gt; abs 0
0&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Numerical Three-Way Tests ====
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let nif x p z n = if x &gt; 0 then p else if x == 0 then z else n
Main&gt; nif 3 1 2 3
1
Main&gt; nif 0 1 2 3
2
Main&gt; nif (-6) 1 2 3
3&lt;/pre&gt;

This function corresponds to the following mathematical function:

&lt;math&gt;f(x,p,z,n) =
\begin{cases}
  p &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0;\\
  z &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0;\\
  n &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The last test, instead of being &lt;tt&gt;if x &lt; 0 then n&lt;/tt&gt;, is simply &lt;tt&gt;else n&lt;/tt&gt;. This is because, by the definition of the numeric relations, if &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is neither less than or equal to zero, it must be greater than zero, so the test will always be true. Furthermore, every &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; needs an ''else'' clause, and what would you put in an ''else'' clause that can never be reached?

Actually, Haskell has a tool for these cases; &lt;tt&gt;undefined&lt;/tt&gt;. This is the name of a special value that, when produced as an answer from an expression, simply flags an error. It is a good value to put in &quot;impossible&quot; cases of your &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; expressions.

==== Sign ====
&lt;pre&gt;Main&gt; let sign x = nif x 1 0 -1
Main&gt; sign 5
1
Main&gt; sign 0
0
Main&gt; sign (-8)
-1&lt;/pre&gt;

This function corresponds to the following mathematical function:

&lt;math&gt;S(x) =
\begin{cases}
  1 &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0;\\
  0 &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0;\\
  -1 &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

We could have defined it like this:
&lt;pre&gt;let sign x = if x &gt; 0 then 1 else if x == 0 then 0 else -1&lt;/pre&gt;
However, since &lt;tt&gt;nif&lt;/tt&gt; turns out to be a generalization of the sign function, it is simpler to define it as an application of &lt;tt&gt;nif&lt;/tt&gt;. In fact, expanding &lt;tt&gt;nif&lt;/tt&gt; into the function's body leaves you with exactly the above code!

==Introduction==
&lt;br&gt;
Capacitors and inductors follow similar laws as resistors when it comes to simplification. 
==Simplifying Capacitor Configurations==
===Capacitors in Parallel===
&lt;br&gt;
Capacitors in parallel are the same as increasing the total surface area of the capacitors to create a larger capacitor with more capacitance. In a capacitor network in parallel, '''all capacitors have the same voltage over them'''.

[[Image:Electronics Capacitorsparallel.png]]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In a parallel configuration, the capacitance of the capacitors in parallel is the sum of the capacitance of all the capacitors.
:&lt;math&gt; C_{eq} = C_1  + C_2 + \cdots + C_n \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

===Capacitors in Series===
&lt;br&gt;
Capacitors in series are the same as increasing the distance between two capacitor plates. As well, it should be noted that placing two 100V capacitors in series results in the same as having one capacitor with the total maximum voltage of 200V. This, however, is not recommended to be done in practice. Especially with capacitors of different values. In a capacitor network in series, '''all capacitors can have the a different voltage over them'''.

[[Image:Electronics Capacitorsseries.png]]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In a series configuration, the capacitance of all the capacitors combined is the sum of the reciprocals of the capacitance of all the capacitors.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \cdots +  \frac{1}{C_n}&lt;/math&gt;

==Simplifying Inductor Configurations==
An inductor works by opposing current change

===Inductors in Parallel===

Each inductor has a decreased amount of current flowing through it.&lt;br&gt;
Take two inductors of the same strength that are in parallel.  This divides the current so half the current is flowing through each inductor.  

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{L_{eq}} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2} + \cdots +  \frac{1}{L_n}&lt;/math&gt;

===Inductors in Series===

Inductors in series are just like resistors in series. Simply add them up.

[[Cookbook:Jam|Jam]]s, [[cookbook:jelly|jellies]], and [[cookbook:preserves|preserves]] will not set unless they have enough pectin in them, so it is often added as an extra ingredient in the form of products such as 'jamsetta'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sample Time Colors ==
By selecting '''Format'''-&gt;'''Sample Time Colors''', you can get Simulink to color code signal lines according to their sample times.  Colors are only updated when the model is ''updated'' or simulated.

&lt;!-- It is not clear to me where to draw the line regarding duplicating existing reference material.  The table below is already available in the Mathworks documentation.  Only the note at the bottom is actually useful information.  I had to e-mail support to find it out.  (I didn't copy what they said to me -- it's not copyrighted.) --&gt;

The most common colors are:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
summary=&quot;This table gives the color, sample time pairings for
Simulink's sample time colors.  I couldn't get the
MediaWiki markup to work&quot;
|-
| Magenta || Constant
|-
| Black ||  Continuous
|-
| Red || Fastest Discrete Sample Time
|-
| Yellow || Hybrid/Mixed Sample Time
|}

For the rest of the colors and other information, see [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/simulink/ug/creating_model8.shtml Enabling Sample Time Colors (the Mathworks website)]

''Note: Constant sample time will only be displayed if '''Inline Parameters''' is checked in the '''Advanced''' Tab of '''Simulation'''-&gt;'''Simulation Parameters'''.  This is because constant blocks can have variables as their arguments.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello. I am a system administrator for this wiki.  You will notice that this wiki may be less active, but it has a better atmosphere (less trolls). Welcome! [[User:Perl|Perl]] 03:38, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

A troll is a user who tries to make other users mad by saying unkind things about other users and/or posting argumentative comments with the goal of inciting others. People who are good at trolling are able to make the unkind messages seem perfectly to everyone but the victim. The english RfA page is a good place to look for trolls. They are the ones opposing various individuals nominations with direct references to other users (one of those references was to me and I had to ask one of the sysops on the wikipedia to temp block me so I wouldnt respond.

Thanks for titling my talk page. I am happy that you did so. Also, I unprotected [[MediaWiki:Movepagetext]] so you can edit it. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 13:35, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)

===Octave Wiki===
Dear Rs2,

I used Matlab pretty heavily for a couple of years,
but I haven't touched it in several years.
Real Soon Now, I'm planning to install Octave, because
I've been told that Octave is almost identical to Matlab.
Have you seen the Octave wiki
http://wiki.octave.org/
?

-- [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 04:23, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: I hadn't seen it until just now.  I don't think I have the option of switching to Octave and it looks like the Wiki is quite young still.  --[[User:Rs2|Rs2]] 17:04, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Rs2. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Rs2~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">From the Wiki page:
Capacitors in series are the same as increasing the distance between two capacitor plates. As well, it should be noted that if you place two capacitors of a 100V max rating together in series, you can charge them both (in series) to 200V without destruction.

reference: http://www.oz.net/~coilgun/theory/capacitors2.htm
(I could probably get a better reference, however i think this one will prove my point)

suggests this is only true if the two capacitors are identical.  And warns against doing this in practice.

[[User:Peterblockley|Peterblockley]]

&gt;&gt;That is true. I was trying to keep the article concise, but i'll add some reality into it now.</text>

[[Image:jicama_CDC.jpg|right|jicama]]
'''Jicama''' (pronounced ''hickama'') is a legume, a relative of the [[Cookbook:Bean|bean]] family. It is a popular dietary staple in Latin America and widely grown in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]] and Central America. There are many names for Jicama including: the Mexican potato, Mexican yam bean, ahipa, saa got, Chinese turnip, lo bok, and the Chinese potato.

Jicama looks similar to a [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]] or a large [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]], and it can be used as an alternative to the [[Cookbook:Water Chestnut|water chestnut]]. Its skin is thin and can be gray, tan, or brown in color. Additionally, it has a short root and contains white flesh. The skin is typically peeled before eating it raw. Raw jicama tastes similar to a [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]] or [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]. It also does not discolor when exposed to the open air for awhile. Because of this, raw jicama is often used as an accompaniment to raw vegetable platters. When jicama is used in cooking it tends to take on the flavors of the ingredients that it is being combined with. Therefore, jicama is a nice complement to various [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] dishes because it blends well with many vegetables and seasonings.

Jicama is a very versatile vegetable that contains a high amount of vitamin C, is low in sodium, and has no fat. One adult serving of jicama, which is equal to approximately 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of cubed jicama or 120 [[Cookbook:g|grams]], also contains only 45 [[Cookbook:Calorie|Calories]].

Jicama is available year-round. When purchasing jicama, select tubers that are firm and have dry roots. Make sure that the jicama has an unblemished skin and that is not bruised. Once purchased, store jicama for up to two weeks in a plastic bag in your refrigerator.</text>

{{vegetable}}

The '''sunchoke''', often called the '''Jerusalem artichoke''', is a tuber from a plant that is related to the [[Cookbook:Sunflower|sunflower]]. It is native to America, and has nothing to do with either Jerusalem or [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichokes]]. The tubers are gnarly and uneven, vaguely resembling ginger root. The white flesh is nutty, sweet, and crunchy like [[Cookbook:Chestnut|chestnuts]] when raw. [[Cookbook:Baking|Baked]] in their skins, they become more like [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] with a mild taste of artichoke hearts.

The sunchoke is widely grown in gardens in Texas and is harvested in the fall for highest quality. Widely available in supermarkets, its peak period is September through January, but often continues through the early spring.

Select firm sunchokes that are firm and free from mold and wrinkles. If left too long in the open, they become wrinkled and soft and can develop a bitter taste. Sunchokes vary in color from dark brown to light brown, similar to ginger.

These tubers need be refrigerated, unwashed, in a plastic bag for up to 1 week for successful storage.

Unlike most tubers, the tubers store the carbohydrate inulin (not to be confused with insulin) instead of starch. For that reason, they are an important source of [[Cookbook:Fructose|fructose]] for industry.

== History ==
Sunchokes were cultivated by the Native Americans (who called them &quot;sun roots&quot;) long before the arrival of the [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europeans]].  The [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] explorer Samuel de Champlain found them being grown at Cape Cod in 1605.

== Cultivation ==
Sunchokes are easy to grow.  In fact the problem for many people is to '''not''' grow them once they have been planted.  For this reason, it is tempting to just leave them in place year after year and dig them as needed.  But the quality of the tubers degrades with this treatment.  Keeping the soil fertile is important.  Every small piece of tuber will grow if left in the ground and they can become a persistent weed.</text>

===Preface===
2004, March 22nd

For better or for worse, [[MATLAB Programming|Matlab]] has become part of modern engineering.  For those who work with Matlab regularly, few things are as frustrating as knowing that Matlab can solve one's problem, but not knowing how.  For this reason, I wanted to start a Matlab Wiki.  Every time I need to figure out how to do something by myself or give up and e-mail Mathworks support, I have the desire to prevent others from repeating the process.  A few dozen people collaborating on a Wiki could help each other a great deal.  A few hundred people collaborating could write the definitive Matlab reference.  Feel free to criticize me as wickedly as you like, just make sure that the effect of your edits are increases in the amount of information or in its clarity.  My plan is to write an entry a day, starting with things that are undocumented or poorly documented on the internet.  Hopefully you will join in.

--[[User:Rs2|Rs2]] 05:41, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

: I'm just starting out with this whole Wikibooks thing, and I'd like to contribute where I can. Hopefully soon I can contribute to the Matlab book-to-be, but until I dust off my cobwebs, I'm just going to start with some minor copy editing, such as changing all the interwiki links to the short form that doesn't generate the off-site image. [[User:Sbb|Scott B]]

==Introduction==

''From Wikipedia:'' (all links to Wikipedia) MATLAB is a [[en:computer program|computer program]] by ''[[en:MathWorks|MathWorks]]'' which allows one to easily manipulate [[en:Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], plot [[en:function (mathematics)|function]]s and data, and implement [[en:algorithm|algorithm]]s in its own internal [[en:programming language|programming language]]. It runs on [[en:Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[en:MacOS|MacOS]], [[en:Linux|Linux]], and [[en:Unix|Unix]] and is widely used in the teaching of [[en:linear algebra|linear algebra]] and [[en:numerical analysis|numerical analysis]]. The language was invented by Cleve Moler in the late [[en:1970s|1970s]]. 

[[en:Free software|Free software]] alternatives to MATLAB include [[en:GNU Octave|GNU Octave]] and [[en:Scilab|Scilab]], which have an identical (or at least very similar) syntax. Another free alternative is [[en:Python programming language|Python]] in combination with libraries like [[en:Numeric Python|Numeric Python]] and [[en:SciPy|SciPy]].

Gone are the days when engineers used drafting boards and pencils.  In today's world, high speed computing replaces hand-drawn [[en:Bode plot|Bode]], [[en:Nyquist plot|Nyquist]], [[en:Root locus|root locus]], and Nichols plots as well as [[en:Impulse response|impulse]] and [[en:Step response|step response]]s with numerically generated ones.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:20px;&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;
Robotics brings together several very different engineering areas and skills. There is metalworking for the body. There is mechanics for mounting the wheels on the axles, connecting them to the motors and keeping the body in balance. You need electronics to power the motors and connect the sensors to the controllers. At last you need the software to understand the sensors and drive the robot around. 

This book tries to cover all the key areas of robotics as a hobby. When possible examples from industrial robots will be addressed too.

You'll notice very few &quot;exact&quot; values in these texts. Instead, vague terms like &quot;small&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;light&quot; will be used. This is because most of the time you'll have a lot of freedom in picking these values, and all robot projects are unique in available materials.

=== Sensors ===
Sensors that a robot uses generally fall into three different categories:

# [[/Environment Sensors|Environment sensors]] tell the robot what is happening around it
## [[/Sensors/Thermal Sensors|Thermal Sensors]]
## [[/Sensors/Pressure Sensors|Pressure Sensors]]
## [[/Sensors/Ranging Sensors| Ranging Sensors]]
## [[/Sensors/Touch Sensors|Touch Sensors]]
# [[/Feedback Sensors|Feedback sensors]] tell the robot what it is actually doing, and
# [[/Communication Sensors|Communication sensors]] allow a human or computer to provide a robot other information.

Sensors aren't perfect. When you use a sensor on your robot there will be a lot of times where the sensors acts funny. It could miss an obstacle, or see one where none is. Key to successfully using sensors is knowing how they function and what they ''really'' measure.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;restaurant&gt;My favorite restaurant is &lt;restaurantname&gt;Olive Garden&lt;/restaurantname&gt;. It is a
chain that has branches all over. I have been to the restaurants in 
&lt;location&gt;Houston&lt;/location&gt;, &lt;location&gt;Marietta&lt;/location&gt;, and
&lt;location&gt;Alpharetta&lt;/location&gt;. They serve &lt;cuisine&gt;Italian&lt;/cuisine&gt; food -- my favorite is 
the &lt;dish&gt;Stuffed Chicken Parmigiana&lt;/dish&gt;, and I also recommend the
&lt;dish&gt;tiramisu&lt;/dish&gt;.&lt;/restaurant&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Answers to practice questions on series circuits===
*''Q1)Let R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&amp;Omega;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;= 3&amp;Omega;, and V=5V what is the voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ?''

*The total resistance =5&amp;Omega;
* So the current is = 1A
*Apply Ohm's law to each resistor in turn gives:
::V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2V 
::V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 3V


*''Q2)Let R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3&amp;Omega;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;= 3&amp;Omega;, and V=6V what is the voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ?''

* The total resistance is 6V
* The current is therefore 1A
::V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3V 
::V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 3V

*''Q3)Let Let R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&amp;Omega;,  V=5V  and I= 1A what is the value of resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ?''

*The total resistance = V/I 
::=5/1 
::= 5&amp;Omega;
So R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 3&amp;Omega;

===Answers to Questions on Parallel Circuits===

[[File:2 resistors in parallel.png]]

*''Q4)You disconnect one of the bulbs, does the other stay lit?''

Yes it does. 

*''Q5)You reconnect the disconnected bulb, does the other dim or brighten?''

Ideally it should not make any difference. The brightness of the lit bulb should remain the same. ''(In practice the bulb will probably dim a tiny bit because of the internal resistance of the battery, but that's more advanced than this course)''


*''Q6)Would it be reasonable to say &quot;each branch of the circuit behaves as if the other branch weren't there&quot; ?''

It certainly would.

*''Q7) Calculate the resistance of the above pair of resistors ''if'' they had been in ''series'' rather than parallel.''

R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 + 1 = 2 &amp;Omega;
*''Q8) A parallel circuit has two resistors, one is 2 &amp;Omega; the other is 3&amp;Omega; what is the total resistance of the circuit?''

Let the Voltage be '''V'''. 

From Ohm's Law 
:current I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V/2 A
:current I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = V/3 A

So the total Current I = V/2+V/3
:::= V(1/2 +1/3)
:::= V (5/6)

Now we Apply Ohm's Law to the circuit again only this time using the total current so that we know what the total resistance is-

R = V/I
: = V/{V(5/6)}
: = 1/(5/6)          ''We cancel the V's''
: = 6/5              ''To divide by a fraction, turn it upside down and multiply''

*''Q9) Three resistors are in parallel (three separate branches) their resistances are 2&amp;Omega;,2&amp;Omega; and 3 &amp;Omega; what is the resistance of the circuit?''

Rather than going through the whole procedure for Q8 again we note that -

1/R = 1/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 
: = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/3
: = 4/3

So R = 3/4 &amp;Omega;

=Learning Objectives=
Upon completion of this chapter, you will:
* be able to understand what XML Namespace is and its purpose
* be able to recognize XML Namespace structure and what each part is doing
* be able to think of organizations in which Namespace would be necessary

=What is Namespace?=
An XML namespace is a collection of names that are identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) reference, which are used in XML documents as element types and attribute names. URIs were used simply because they are a well-known system for creating unique identifiers. Namespaces consist of several parts including local names, namespace URIs, prefixes and declarations. The combination of a local name and a namespace is called a universal name.
You might find it easier to think of a namespace as a '''dictionary''' that is a source of definitions for items that  you use within an XML document. 

All schemas include the namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance. You can think of this as the master dictionary to which all schemas must refer because it defines the fundamental items of an XML schema. The namespace's address looks like a URL, but in XML we use the broader term [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier Uniform Resource Identifier] (URI). 

Because a document can refer to multiple namespace, we need a convenient short form for referencing the namespace. One of the common forms used is '''xsd''' as illustrated in the following.

 xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;

The ''xlmns'' informs XML that you are referencing a name space, and the ''xsd'' indicates this is the short form of the namespace.

For example, you might use the following line of code in an XML schema

 &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;item&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;

The previous line of code states that the definition of element name and string are found in &quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;

Namespace enables you to use elements described in multiple schemas within your XML document, so the short form of a namespace's URI is useful for identifying the namespace to which you are referring.

=History=
Namespace in XML was a new W3C recommendation in January, 1999. Namespace was created to be a pretty simple method to distinguish names used in XML documents. The main purpose of Namespace is to provide programmers a method for which to grab elements and attributes that they want, leaving behind other tags that they do not need. These programmer-friendly names will be unique across the Internet. The XML namespaces recommendation does not define anything except a two-part naming system for element types and attributes.

For additional information regarding the W3C recommendation, follow this link: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/.

=When would you use Namespace?=
It would mainly be used to avoid naming conflicts. If you don’t have any duplicate elements or attributes in the XML that you use, namespaces are not necessary. It is however beneficial if you have duplicate elements or attributes. It basically makes two part structures that make it unique. Instead of just defining element A, for example, you have to define element A with some other type of identifier. That is where the URI comes into play. The URI in combination with the element or attribute creates your namespace and it is then a universal name. 
 

=Namespace Structure=
XML namespaces differ from the &quot;namespaces&quot; conventionally used in computing disciplines in that the XML version has internal structure and is not, mathematically speaking, a set.

This is an example of 2 Namespace declarations:

     &lt;Organization
       xmlns:addr=&quot;http://www.example.com/addresses&quot;
       xmlns=&quot;http://www.example.com/files&quot;&gt; 


The first declaration associates the addr prefix with the “www.example.com/addresses” URI.
The second declaration defines www.example.com/files as the default namespace. If there is not a prefix defined for that element, a default namespace is applied. This default namespace is applied to all elements without a prefix. Please note, however, that default namespaces do not apply directly to attributes.

=How Does It Work?=
When specifying a universal name in an XML document, you use an abbreviation based on an optional prefix that's attached to the local name. This abbreviation is called the qualified name or qname.
To declare an XML namespace, you use an attribute whose name has the form:
 xmlns:prefix
These attributes are often called xmlns attributes and their value is the name of the XML namespace being declared. This is a Uniform Resource Identifier. The first form of the attribute (xmlns:prefix) declares a prefix to be associated with the XML namespace. The second form (xmlns) declares that the specified namespace is the default XML namespace.

=Namespace Best Practices=
* Try to limit the number of Namespaces to about 5 per document. More than five namespaces in a document gets unwieldy.
* Make distinctions in XML namespaces only when there are truly distinctions between the things being named.
* Try to stick to documents in namespace normal form wherever possible because they are simplest to read and to process.
* Avoid overriding namespaces frequently because it can cause confusion in your documents.

=Example of Namespace Use=
Let’s say we are going to be pulling address values from two different sources and address from one source pulls in a mailing address while from the other source, it pulls in a computer IP address. We’ll need to create a Namespace so that we can distinguish the two addresses elements. 

Postal Address XML document
 &lt;address&gt;100 Elm St., Apt#1&lt;/address&gt; 

IP Address XML document
 &lt;address&gt;172.13.5.7&lt;/address&gt;

How do we distinguish these Address elements in the case that they need to be combined into the same document? 
We would assign each address name to a namespace. Therefore, it becomes defined in two parts, the address element and the XML namespace. Every time the element Address comes up, it will have to look at two things instead of one for definition, but this look up only has to be performed one time because the combination is universally unique. 

In this instance, we could create Namespaces for the address element:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;Example Organization
xmlns: addr=&quot;http://www.example.com/postal_addresses&quot;
xmlns=&quot;http://www.example.com/ip_addresses&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The first declaration associates the prefix 'addr' with the URI, &quot;www.example.com/postal_addresses and the second declaration sets &quot;www.example.com/ip_addresses&quot; as the default namespace. So, where a the prefix 'addr' is used, it will pull the postal address and for others, it will pull the IP address. 

=Defining the location of an XML schema=
Assume you have created a schema, example.xsd, that is located in the same directory as your XML document, example.xml. In the XML document you will indicate the location of the schema with the following code.
 
 &lt;xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='example.xsd'&gt;

Of course, if example.xsd is stored somewhere other than the same directory as example.xml, you specify the full path.



=Potential Problems with Namespace=
* Different XML technologies are going to process namespaces differently. Some will see namespace declarations as such and some will just see them as attributes. 
* Namespace is a compromise solution that doesn't meet the needs of all users.
* XML namespaces seem simple on their face, but they can cause real confusion and increased complexity if they are not handled or managed correctly. To manage Namespaces correctly, you must understand thoroughly the meaning, rules, and implications of the various concepts that make up the XML namespaces mechanism and stick consistently to simple conventions. 
* As mentioned in Best Practices, using more than 5 namespaces can get unwieldy. So, how do large organizations tackle this design difficulty if there is a need for many namespaces? The basic source of this problem is that naming convention for most information architecture is fundamental, but with XML, it was patched together as an afterthought. Namespaces have been very difficult to incorporate smoothly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I started adding to this page, but it may not be totally in line with the how the chapter was planned initially: 

Chapter 1 begins like this (now): Botany is the branch of biology concerned with the scientific study of plants. Traditionally, botanists studied all organisms that were not generally regarded as animal. However, advances in our knowledge about the myriad forms of life, especially microbes (viruses and bacteria), have led to spinning off from Botany the specialized field called Microbiology. Still, the microbes are usually covered in introductory Botany courses, although their status as neither animal nor plant is firmly established

This sounds like chapter 6 should be about bacteria en viruses in general. However, I am focussing on plant pathogenic bacteria and viruses - I think that makes more sense in the context of this textbook. I you think different - please tell me how you think it should be done.

'''[[w:Bioeconomics|Bioeconomics]]''' is the theory of economic exploitation of living resources, dealing with two dynamic systems: [[w:population_dynamics|population dynamics]] and the dynamics of economic systems. Bioeconomics therefore leans on two traditional university disciplines, biology and economics.

==Short reference to production theory==
[[w:Production_theory_basics|Production theory]] is a central element in [[w:microeconomics|microeconomics]] and describes simply the conversion of inputs (''v'') into outputs (''Q''):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;Q = Q({v_1},{v_2}....{v_n}) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; | ('''2.1''')
|}
|}

There are several ways of specifying this function. One is as an additive production function:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;Q = {p_0} + {p_1} {v_1} + {p_2} {v_2} + ... + {p_n} {v_n} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; | ('''2.2''')
|}
|}

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', .... ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are parameters that are determined empirically.

Another is as a Cobb-Douglas production function (multiplicative):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;Q = {p_0} \cdot {v_1}^{p_1} \cdot {v_2}^{p_2} \cdot ... \cdot {v_n}^{p_n}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; | ('''2.3''')
|}
|}

Other forms include the constant [[w:Elasticity_(economics)|elasticity]] of substitution production function ([[w:Constant_Elasticity_of_Substitution|CES]]) which is a more general formulation including the Cobb-Douglas function, and the quadratic production function which is a specific type of additive function. The best form of the equation to use and the values of the parameters vary from company to company and industry to industry.

In a short run production function at least one of the (inputs) is fixed. In the long run all factor inputs are variable, in principle at the discretion of management.

In classical theory production may involve three types of input: Labour (''L''), Capital (''K'') and Natural resources (''R''). Some classical works splits the latter into two: Natural resources and Energy resources (''E''). 
More often outputs from other production processes are used as inputs others. But in principle it should be possible to separate all inputs down to the three or four basic types of input.

==Catch production in the short run==
The simplest model of catch production involves only two input factor: A natural resource (''x'') and a fishing activity (fishing effort, ''F'').

===Production of fishing effort===
Let us start to discuss the production of a certain quantity of fishing effort. Further let us assume that human labour input (which could be regarded as a natural resource, but is more practically described as labour) and Capital (boats, fishing gears, etc.) is the two basic types of input in the production of fishing effort. Also assume one of the two factors could be perfectly substituted by the other in a certain quantity.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;F = F(L,K)  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; | ('''3.1''')
|}
|}

While limiting the input factor to two, the substitution rates can easily be viewed in a contour plot, often referred to as isocurves of production (Fig. 3.1).


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; |
[[Image:Bioeconomics_fig3_1.png]]
| bgcolor=&quot;#e3e3ee&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;bottom&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; | &lt;i&gt;'''Figure 3.1'''&lt;br&gt;Isocurves of fishing effort production.&lt;br&gt;The curves show at which rate ''L'' (Labour) can be substituted by ''K'' (Capital) and the other way around, each curve representing a constant output of ''F''. The blue point is representing a certain production of fishing effort involving a high degree of labour inputs, while much of the labour in the red point is substituted by capital, e.g. small boats and hand line (blue point) vs. a few trawlers (red point). The dotted arrow indicates increase in effort production.&lt;/i&gt;
|}

===The concept of efficient production===
Equation 3.1 is simply giving a technical description on how ''F'' is produced by the input factor ''L'' and ''K'' and does not give us any suggestions on which mix of input factors are to be preferred. In order to prioritize between different alternatives of producing a specific quantity of ''F'', it is convenient to look at the cost of the two input factors. Let the unit cost of labour (''L'') be ''w'' and the unit cost of capital (''K'') be ''r''. The total cost of production (''C'') then is:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;C = w L + r K  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; | ('''3.2''')
|}
|}

Lagrange's method can be used in order to maximise the production of fishing effort at a cost constraint, which is the dual problem of minimising the cost at a given production. The Lagrange equation will be:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} = F(L,K) - \lambda ({C_0} - w L - r K)&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''3.3''')
|}
|}

where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the given cost and &lt;i&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/i&gt; the Lagrange multiplier.

The first order condition when maximising the Lagrange equation, is that the partial derivatives of the equation with respect of ''L'' and ''K'' equals 0, from which follows:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac {\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}} = \frac {w}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''3.4''')
|}
|}

This expression is referred to as the marginal rate of technical substitution (''MRTS''). In the most cost-efficient production ''MRTS'' should according to Eq. (3.4) equal the price ratio of the two input factors. Cost efficient solutions of different levels of production are shown in Figure 3.2.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; |
[[Image:Bioeconomics_fig3_2.png]]
| bgcolor=&quot;#e3e3ee&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;bottom&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; | &lt;i&gt;'''Figure 3.2'''&lt;br&gt;Efficient production.&lt;br&gt;The thick line connects the infinite number of points consistent with equation (3.4), when varying the cost constraint C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
|}

===Producing fish harvest by two input factors===
By regarding production of fishing effort as an independent production process, production of (''h'', fish harvest) can be expressed by the two input factors ''x'' and ''F'':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;h = h(x,F)  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''3.5''')
|}
|}

It is reasonable to assume that ''x'' and ''F'' is substitutable in the same way as ''L'' and ''K'' in Figure 3.1. In order to fish a certain quantity, say one kilo fish, when the stock biomass is low (low ''x''-value), one has to input a larger fishing effort than in the case of a higher stock density (large ''x''-value).

Eq. (3.5) therefore is of the same type as Eq. (3.1) and in principle we have the same type of continuous substitution as indicated in Figure 3.1.

===Market failures while using common resources===

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#e3e3ee&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''There are however two core issues which turns this production into a drastically different task:'''
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identifying efficient production levels involves however prices on the input factors from a perfect market. In this case we certainly can calculate a perfect market price on fishing effort (''F'') based on the paragraphs above. But what is the price of the other input factor, ''x''?
&lt;br&gt;
If the resource is regarded as a common property, the price will be zero! In that case there is no limits on how much ''F'' (which has a positive price), we want to substitute with the free input factor ''x'', until the resource is fully produced and converted into fish harvest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The availability (and accessibility) of ''x'' is in the short run given. In the long run it will also be given, now as a function of catch production in the past. The two input factors in other words are interrelated to each other! By that traditional methods in production theory break down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
|}

The first problem makes it impossible to continue along the normal methods of identifying cost efficient solutions. Since the scarcity of the natural resource is not reflected in a price, we lack the value information on this factor. The other problem is also corrupting our model, as it attacks the basic assumption of independency in availabilities of the two input factors. In the long run in fact we have:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;x = x(F) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''3.6''')
|}
|}

The straight forward implication of this is obvious from Eq. (3.5):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;h(x,F) = h(x(F),F) = h(F) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''3.7''')
|}
|}

showing that in the long run (keeping fishing effort constant over a sufficient period of time) catch will be determined by the fishing effort alone.

The crucial relationship to investigate further therefore is the ''x''-''F'' relationship. How the stock biomass ''x'' be defined as a function of fishing effort ''F''? At this point we have to turn to biology and population dynamics.

==Population growth==
Population dynamics is the study of marginal and long term changes in numbers, individual weights and age composition of individuals in one or several populations, and biological and environmental processes influence those changes. In idealized population growth models one differs between compensatory growth and decompensatory growth, the first one is regarded as normal growth.

The logistic growth model is a widely-used compensatory growth model.

===Logistic growth===
Let us assume annual biomass growth of a fish population to follow [[w:Logistic_map|logistic growth]] (first proposed as a demographic model by [[w:Pierre_François_Verhulst|Verhulst]], 1838. (Applied as a biomass growth model by Pearl, 1934.) The [[w:Population_dynamics|population dynamics]] is described by a differential equation where biomass (''x'') is a function of time (''t'') and the time derivative of population biomass is:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t) = r \cdot x(t) \left(1 - \frac {x(t)}{K} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''4.1''')
|}
|}

Note that the two parameters (constants), &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; often referred to as the intrinsic growth rate and &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; the population biomass at natural equilibrium, are not the same as the parameter ''r'' and the variable ''K'' above (in pnt. 3).

The parabolic function (square function) in Eq. 4.1, shown in Figure 4.1, describe and increasing biomass growth as the population biomass increases, up to a certain population size (which is easy to identify as ''K''/2), where the biomass growth starts declining to reach zero at biomass level ''K''. ''K'' therefore represents a natural equilibrium biomass of an unexploited stock.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; |
[[Image:Bioeconomics_fig1.png]]
| bgcolor=&quot;#e3e3ee&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;bottom&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; | &lt;i&gt;'''Figure 4.1'''&lt;br&gt;Equation 4.1, where the time derivative of ''x'' is measured along the ''y''-axis&lt;/i&gt;
|}

===Biomass growth as a function of time===
The differential equation (4.1) has a unique solution ( = INTEGRAL):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;x(t)=\frac{e^{r\,t}\,K\,{x_0}}{K + \left(e^{r\,t} - 1\right) \,{x_0}}&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''4.2''')
|}
|}

''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; being the biomass at ''t''=0.

==Catch production in the long run==
Let us start with catch production in the short run as discussed above. Eq. (3.5) defines catch as an output from of production process where stock biomass, ''x'', and fishing effort, ''F'', are input factors. ''x'' can be substituted by ''F''. This assumption of substitution is taken care of in the so-called Schaefer production equation:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;h(x,F) = q \cdot x \cdot F&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''5.1''')
|}
|}

''q'' is a constant (parameter) often referred to as the ''catchability coefficient''. By referring to Eq. (2.3) we see that the Schaeffer production equation is of the Cobb-Douglas type, with powers set equal to 1. Later we will investigate the consequences of the choice of power values.

The biomass growth equation (4.1) now has to be adjusted to include catch. The annual biomass growth will be the natural growth (right hand side of 4.1) minus the harvested biomass (e.g. 5.1):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = r \cdot x \left(1 - \frac {x}{K} \right) - q \cdot x \cdot F&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''5.2''')
|}
|}

As Eq. (4.1) identify ''K'' as the natural biomass equilibrium when &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow {\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, Eq. (5.2) also identify an equilibrium biomass when keeping ''F'' constant over an infinite number of years. The equilibrium is defined by


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''5.3''')
|}
|}

from which follows (in the case of Eq. 5.2):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;r \cdot x \left(1 - \frac {x}{K} \right) = q \cdot x \cdot F&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''5.4''')
|}
|}

Skipping the trivial solution ''x''=0, the stock biomass - fishing effort relationship is given directly from Eq. (5.4):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;500&quot; | &lt;math&gt;x(F) = K \left( 1 - \frac {q}{r} F \right)&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;20&quot; | ('''5.5''')
|}
|}

The long term catch equation is finally found by inserting Eq. (5.5) into the short term catch equation defined by Eq. (5.1):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|

== Foreword ==
The web is a hypertext medium. It is a means of communication using inter-linked pages of text called webpages. A coherent group of such pages is called a website; all pages together are called the World Wide Web.

This short course will attempt to provide a hands-on approach to teach you how to make high-quality webpages; how to express yourself in the hypertext medium that is the web. After a short introduction, you will be thrown in at the deep end and start making webpages yourself.

== Rationale ==
Many textbooks approach the creation of webpages and websites as a computing task. Many others approach it as a graphical design challenge. Both approaches are rooted in treating the web as if it were a computational or graphical medium. Rooting the web in a understandable metaphor may be comforting, it is also misleading. 

The web is a new medium, that requires a completely new approach to building parts of it. Although students will often pick up some of the right concepts while studying the 'programming' and 'designing' books, it is often better to start with the right concepts, and deal with the computational and graphical aspects of the web later.

What this textbook therefore tries to accomplish, is providing the student with a strong basis for learning more about building webpages. This book will try and do this in a practical, hands-on way. Almost from the get-go, students will start authoring their own webpages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Requirements =

In order to use this tutorial, you must have a web browser and a text editor capable of saving files with an .html extension. Most operating systems come shipped with such a text editor. 

If you use Microsoft Windows, you will find an editor called Notepad in your accessories. 

Note: a text editor is not the same as a word processor. Do not use a word processor for this course. 

Once you get more comfortable authoring webpages, you may want to acquire a more powerful text editor. For now, however, editors like Notepad, Simpletext (Apple Macintosh) or Nano (GNU/Linux) suffice.

Also, some minimal computing knowledge is assumed. If you do not know how to operate a computer, this course is not for you, yet.

== Testing: Your first Webpage ==

In order to test whether you fulfil the requirements, you will now create your first web page in the following simple steps.

* Open your text editor program.
* Type in the following simple HTML document. Note: all valid webpages must start with a DOCTYPE. This selects the version of HTML used by the web page.
&lt;!-- This is the simplest valid HTML markup that is possible in HTML 4.01 without omitting optional tags. Please ensure that after any changes to the example the markup is still valid. Please don't change the DOCTYPE to Transitional or Frameset. --&gt;  
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; Simple document &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The text of the document goes here!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Save your text as a file called 'first.html' to your hard disk (or other storage medium; do not type the quote characters). For the remainder of this course, it would be handy if you had a separate folder where you could save your webpages.
* Open your web browser program.
* Open the .html file you just saved in your web browser. Most browsers have a menu called something like 'File/Open File' for this.
* Your browser should now display your first webpage.

This doesn't look very impressive, does it? Well, it will get much more impressive soon, and the good news is that it will not get much more difficult.

To reach true impressiveness though, you need to be able to reach your audience. To reach your audience, a webserver program needs to know about your webpages, so that it can serve your pages to all who ask for them.

== Webservers ==

You could run your own webserver, but setting up such a program is beyond the scope of this tutorial. 

If you follow this course in a class, the teacher will have set up a webserver for you. 

If you follow this course by yourself, please check the website hosting options your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has available. (The ISP  is the company that connects you to the internet. If you are connected through your work or college, consult with your systems administrator about hosting possibilities.) A form of web hosting may even be a free service your ISP offers you as part of your access package.

== Recapitulation ==

In short, you need: 
# A texteditor (program)
# A webbrowser (program)
# A webserver (program+internet connection, or computer+program+internet connection)

The first two items you need right away, the last you need when you want to publish your webpages on the internet.

Well, this is a bit ironic - I've only had a few, and certainly none recently. I think I'll set the target to start doing all the stuff I need to properly at the end of the week, when the stress is over. At the moment, I'm remembering about 1 dream ''every week'', so I'm not going to get LDs any time soon. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 00:05, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Woah, I thought ''everybody'' knew what the [[en:Placebo effect]] is! [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:29, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Each to his or her own, is all I can say. In some forums, people would decide to give it an acronym - SCILD (SimCity Induced Lucid Dream). But not me.

Should section 1.1 (Waking up and getting back to bed) be merged with the WBTB section? Partly?

[[Talk:Lucid dreaming]] has a list of stuff I want to do. I'm just going through everything with MS Word for spelling and grammar right now. (But not appendices, that would take ages more) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 21:34, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)

From your new edits on the &quot;reality checks&quot; section, can I assume you got another LD? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 05:29, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:Why is that so funny? We should be willing to take whatever we can. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 22:45, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)

People are rarely interested in many different games, unlike the sections of the [[lucid dreaming]] wikibook. I suggest you scrap the nav. Sorry! [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 18:53, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)

No more LD count? Did you lose motivation? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 21:00, 5 May 2004 (UTC)

== SamE ==

Great idea for the ToC. I like it - could it be expanded to the other categories (other than just computer games), or should we wait until we can get some more game walkthroughs for those types of games? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 22:45, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== SimCity ==

I've expanded the page on [[SimCity]] quite dramatically, and given that you have contributed to it in the past, I'm wondering if you have any comments, suggestions, or anything else to contribute to it? [[User:AmishThrasher|AmishThrasher]] 15:47, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called KirbyMeister. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name KirbyMeister~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:19, 17 March 2015 (UTC)
&lt;!-- SUL finalisation notification --&gt;

== Renamed ==

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Goals of this course ==

This course has only one goal: to teach the practice of creating webpages. 

If you want to teach your pupils about computing, networking, the internet, HTML et cetera, I would like to refer you to other WikiBooks. 

=== Related Wikibooks ===

* [[Internet Technologies]]

== Requirements ==

In order to be able to teach this course, you need to: 
* familiarise yourself with the material;
* provide your students with a computer linked to the internet, or make sure they have access to such a computer for the duration of the lesson;
* provide your students with web browsing software, or make sure they have access to a web browser;
* provide your students with text editing software, or make sure they have access to a text editor;
* set up a web server, and provide access to it;
* provide storage space for your student's projects; and 
* make sure your students possess a minimum of computing experience.

Optional:
* graphics to be used in the practice projects; and
* graphics editing software, to create such graphics.

=== Web browsers ===

The web browsers you use should be able to handle HTML 4 or better. Web browsers that are shipped with current operating systems are acceptable for this goal.

There are lessons in this course that deal with graphical presentation of web pages. You may skip these lessons, but if you don't, you need to provide a so-called graphical web browser. Well known such browsers are for instance [[Wikipedia:Mozilla|Mozilla]], [[Wikipedia:Apple Safari|Apple Safari]], [[Wikipedia:Opera|Opera]], and Microsoft Internet Explorer. These browsers are either provided with your operating system, or can be downloaded and used freely.

If you need to download and install a web browser, we recommend the [[Wikipedia:FireFox|FireFox]] family of web browsers.

Ideally you will provide your students with several web browsers on side-by-side computers. This will allow them to see how the rendering of web pages varies between different browsers.

=== Text editors ===

The text editors that generally accompany an operating system are all that is needed to create webpages in this course. 

Although you may use editors that are specifically geared towards creating and editing websites, we advise against this. It might make your students dependent on such editors. Even if all they will use after they finished the course is such an editor, learning the basics of creating a webpage can be very helpful during trouble shooting.

=== Webservers ===

None of the practice projects are so complex that they require a certain server set-up. Later versions of this course may require more advanced webservers. If you do not know how to set up a webserver, consult your systems administrator.
 
One thing to keep in mind is that you may wish to run your webserver solely on an intranet. That way, your students cannot abuse the school's Internet connection to publish information the school does not wish to be associated with.

If you are the systems administrator, you might find
[[Wikipedia:Apache2Triad|Apache2Triad]]
or more generally
[[Wikipedia:comparison of web servers]]
helpful.

On the other hand, using a
[[Wikipedia:free web hosting service|free web hosting service]]
is likely to be easier than setting up even the easiest intranet web server.
It may help student motivation to see that their work is becoming part of the &quot;real&quot; WWW that anyone in the world can immediately read,
and not just another homework assignment that only the teacher can read.
Although some hosting services provide &quot;templates&quot; and &quot;wizards&quot; for creating websites, we recommend against using those tools -- it might make students dependent on that hosting service.
Instead, use ordinary file uploads.

=== Storage space ===

The practice projects are all reasonably small. You may devise a large end-of-course project though. Also, your students may wish to study webpages they created earlier on. For these reasons, it could be handy to provide your students with storage space to keep their projects on and reference later.

The HTML and CSS and JavaScript files (which does not include image files, MP3s, videos, etc.) for one larger than average web site is under 8 MB.

''Does this need to be separate from the files on the web server?''

=== Previous knowledge === 

If your students are new to computing, you may want to spend the first lesson acquainting them with some general principles of computing. At the very least, they should know how to: 

* Start up and switch off a computer or session;
* Start and quit programs;
* Open and close files from programs;
* Copy, move, create and delete files on a file system;
* Operate a webbrowser; specifically, how to open a URL; how to open a file; how to navigate between webpages using hyperlinks; how to navigate between webpages using browser functionality.

== Class project ==

Since this is a work book as much as a text book, students will benefit from having engaging projects in which they can test their skills to the fullest. 

Many of the exercises in this book are designed to provide such project but will probably be found lacking by almost all students. The exercises are limited by their nature: they must assume incomplete knowledge in the earlier chapters of the book, and they must be finishable within the time set for homework.

Therefore, it would be advisable to have an end-project in which the students can test all the skills and knowledge they acquired during this course. 

The teacher is free to invent such a project, and hopefully in the course of time, many cool project proposals will be added to this Wikibook. 

However, a teacher of minors can also choose to participate in the six-monthly [http://www.thinkquest.org ThinkQuest competition]. ThinkQuest is a website creation competition for elementary and secondary school students that has produced some of the finest sites on the web today. Students are pitted against other students from all over the world. The competition is fierce and the participants need to use all they've got to have a chance at winning. All participating teams must have a school teacher as team leader, but the students themselves must do all the work.

In due time, this Wikibook will provide all the basic knowledge required for participating in and winning a ThinkQuest competition with one major exception: this book will not deal with embeddable content, such as images, animation, video et cetera.
These form an important part of the web, but they fill a whole separate book on their own: the [[Web Design]] book.

The students who are following this course on their own, are encouraged to think up their own projects. If you come up with fun projects, please share them by posting their descriptions here.

Microcontrollers are the core of many robots. They have considerable processing power packed on to one chip, allowing lots of freedom for programmers. Microcontrollers are [[w:Low-level_programming_language|low level]] devices and it is common to program them using an [[w:Assembly_language|assembly language]], this provides a great deal of control over the hardware connected to the controller. Many manufacturers also provide [[w:High-level_programming_language|high-level language]] [[w:Compiler|compilers]] for their chips, including [[w:BASIC_programming_language|BASIC]] and [[w:C_programming_language|C]].

What's the difference between a
''[[Wikipedia:microcontroller|microcontroller]]'', ''[[Wikipedia:microprocessor|microprocessor]]'', and a ''[[Wikipedia:CPU|CPU]]'' ?
The CPU is the part which actually executes the instructions (add, subtract, shift, fetch, etc.).

A ''microprocessor'' is any [[w:CPU|CPU]] on a single chip.

A ''microcontroller'' is a kind of microprocessor, because it includes a CPU, but it typically also contains all of the following components on the same single chip:
* (discrete) inputs
* (discrete) outputs
* [[Wikipedia:Read_only_memory|ROM]] for the program
* [[Wikipedia:Random_access_memory|RAM]] for temporary data
* [[Wikipedia:EEPROM|EEPROM]] for non-volatile data
* counter/timer
* clock

Some microcontrollers even include on board Analog-to-Digital converters (ADCs). This allows analog sensors to be directly connected to the microcontroller.

With this capability, microcontrollers are quite convenient pieces of silicon.

The outputs of a microcontroller can be used to drive many things, common examples include [[wikipedia:LED|LEDs]] and [[Wikipedia:Transistor|transistors]]. The outputs on a microcontroller are generally low power. Transistors are used to switch higher power devices (such as motors) on and off.

All CPUs are useless without software.

Most software for a PC is stored on the hard drive. But when you first turn one on, it starts executing the software in the boot ROM. If you wanted to change that software, you would have to pull out the ROM chip, program a new ROM chip (in a &quot;chip programmer&quot;), and then plug the new chip into the PC.

Most robots don't have a hard drive -- '''all''' their software is stored in ROM.
So changing that software is exactly like changing the boot code of a PC.
(If your robot has an external ROM chip, then that is the one that is pulled and replaced. If your robot uses a microcontroller with internal ROM, then the microcontroller is pulled and replaced).

Many recent PC motherboards and microcontrollers use [[Wikipedia:flash memory|Flash]] instead of ROM. That allows people to change the program without pulling out or putting in any chips.  They can be rewritten with new data, like a memory chip, but permanently, and only a certain number of times (10,000 to 100,000 erase/write cycles).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Ideal case===
Consider the illustration below.  Assume initially that no current is flowing in or out of the terminal marked Vout.  In this case, the only path for current is from V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; through R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to GND.  The equivalent resistance of this configuration is R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since these are [[Electronics/Resistors|resistors in series]].  From [[Electronics/DC Voltage and Current|Ohm's law]] the current flowing through both resistors is 
     &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V_{in}}{R_1+R_2}&lt;/math&gt;.
Also from Ohm's law, we know that the voltage drops across the resistors are I*R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and I*R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.  A quick check shows that the sum of the voltage drops across the resistors adds up to V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  Now we can calculate the voltage at V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; (still assuming that no current flows through the terminal V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;).  In this case the voltage is just 
     &lt;math&gt;0V + IR_2&lt;/math&gt; 
where the 0V is the voltage at GND.  If we substitute what we calculated for I, we obtain 
     &lt;math&gt;V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{in}&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the ''voltage divider equation'' for the ideal case where no current flows through the output.  Another way of saying that no current flows through the output is that the output has infinite resistance.  A quick mental check using &lt;math&gt;I=V/R&lt;/math&gt; shows that the voltage calculated divided by infinity equals zero

[[Image:PotentialDivider.png|120px|illustration of a voltage divider]]

===Non-ideal case - finite resistance outputs===
In the non-ideal case, we need to consider the resistance of the output.  If we assume that the resistance of the output is R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (and it is connected only to GND), we need to modify our analysis as follows.  Now we have two resistors in parallel from the V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; junction to GND.  The equivalent resistance of the parallel reistors then is 
 &lt;math&gt;R_{eq}=\frac{R_2R_3}{R_2+R_3}&lt;/math&gt; 
and the equivalent reistance of the entire circuit is
     &lt;math&gt;R_{tot}=R_1+\frac{R_2R_3}{R_2+R_3}&lt;/math&gt;.  
This yields a current of 
     &lt;math&gt;I=\frac{V}{R_{tot}}=\frac{V_{in}}{R_1+\frac{R_2R_3}{R_2+R_3}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Now we multiply this by &lt;math&gt;R_{eq}&lt;/math&gt; calculated above to obtain the output voltage:
     &lt;math&gt;V_{out} = IR_{eq} = \frac{R_{eq}}{R_{tot}}V=\frac{\frac{R_2R_3}{R_2+R_3}}{R_1+\frac{R_2R_3}{R_2+R_3}}V_{in}&lt;/math&gt;
Normally R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be much smaller than R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; so R&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; will be approximately equal to R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Keep in mind that a resistance R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that is 100 times as large as R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; results in a voltage sag of about 1% and that a reistance R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that is 10 times as large as R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; results in an almost 10% voltage sag.

===Non-ideal case - complex impedance===
Both voltage divider equations hold for complex [[Electronics/Impedance|impedances]].  Just substitute Z's for R's and do the complex arithmetic.  The resulting equations are just the following:
  &lt;math&gt;V_{out}=\frac{Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2}V_{in}&lt;/math&gt; - ideal case
  &lt;math&gt;V_{out}=\frac{\frac{Z_2Z_3}{Z_2+Z_3}}{Z_1+\frac{Z_2Z_3}{Z_2+Z_3}}V_{in}&lt;/math&gt; - non-ideal case

__NOTOC__
==The endless frontier==
[[Image:White-eyed Drosophila.jpg|300px|right|Drosophila]]
No matter how much we know about living organisms, there is always more to learn. This book is dedicated to the idea that asking questions is important. We welcome contributions of new questions about biology on the [[/Grist/]] page. Answers to all questions about biology can start with what is already known and then move on to what remains to be discovered, what remains unsolved. The goal of this textbook is to serve as an unorthodox introduction to biology. Each chapter starts with a question, maybe the sort of question a small child would ask, and explores the implications of that question out to the limits of the current state of research and then moves on into speculation about what might be discovered in the future.

'''What is life?''' The first chapter is called &quot;What is life?&quot; It starts with some of the history of biology and gives a version of the &quot;textbook answer&quot; that might typically be found in an [[General Biology|introductory biology textbook]]. Related questions are then investigated in an attempt to explore the boundaries of the physical domain we call &quot;life&quot;. Why is life on Earth made out of certain atoms such as carbon and oxygen? Are there life forms in the universe that are not based on carbon? Is there a clear boundary between carbon-based life and Artificial life? Does the concept of a non-physical thinking being make any sense or is life always instantiated in matter? The chapter concludes with a discussion of the idea that life is the means by which the universe comes to know itself.

==Some Unsolved Problems in Biology==

How did biological organisms start? Are the conditions necessary for the origin of life narrow or broad? How are the sizes of cells, organs, and bodies controlled? Did life start on this planet or was there an extraterrestrial intervention (for example a meteor from another planet) ? Why have so many biological systems independently developed sexual reproduction? What constitutes a species?

==Chapters==

# [[/What is Life?/]] Are there life forms in the universe that are not based on carbon? Is there a clear boundary between carbon-based life and Artificial life?

# [[/How Did It Start?/]] What are the different hypotheses of origin of life? Did life begin on this planet, was there inanimate intervention (such as a meteor hitting the earth) or intelligent, extraterrestial design? What are the mechanisms of biorhythms and chronobiology? Why is magnetite in living creatures?
# [[/Sexual Reproduction/]]: Why have so many biological systems developed sexual reproduction?
# [[/Tree of Life/]]: Do all animals link together to a primary source? 
# [[/Protein folding/]]: Given a DNA sequence, what  shape will the protein fold into? Given a particular desired shape, what DNA sequence will produce it? 
# [[/Consciousness/]]. What is it?  Can we create artificial life that has human-like consciousness?
# [[/Sleep/]]: Why is it necessary for mammals to sleep? Or dream, come to that?
# [[/Viruses/]].  What are the signs of current or past infection to discover where Ebola hides between human outbreaks?
# Where is memory/information stored in brain? How are other animals different than humans in regard to brain function?

==About copying content from WikiWikiWeb==

I have e-mailed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham Ward Cunningham], but until I hear back from him, I will operate from my interpretation of the following excerpt from [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiCopyRights Wiki Copy Rights]:

:''Q: Can I take unsigned pages relevant only to wiki use? I would like to start my own wiki based on the perl code distributed at the wikibase. I would like to copy the pages that were written primarily to help new users get over the first few moments of questions about wiki. --[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JohnRepici JohnRepici]

:''A: It would be fair use if you quoted wiki modestly and included a proper link or citation. (See HowToCiteWiki.) Taking pages from this site and posting them as your own would not. -- [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham WardCunningham]

I interpret this to mean that we can do what I have just done, i.e. quote from the WikiWikiWeb and give appropriate credit.  The same page raises a good point: why copy a Wiki when one can just link to it?  Some possible answers: (''add things I missed'')
* Wikis should be duplicated because one is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft Copyleft] and the other is not, or 
* Wikis should not be duplicated.
I believe the former.  For those who believe the latter, I encourage you to improve the guide at WikiWikiWeb.  Whatever you do, do not inappropriately copy material from WikiWikiWeb, i.e. without first getting permission from the original author of what you copy.
* If the other Wiki is only linked to, then if it goes down the current Wiki will lose content.

-[[User:Rs2|Rs2]] 05:17, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)

==Update - Ward's response==

Ward confirmed that [[Wikipedia:fair use|fair use]] is the rule.  He referred me to the following material that he wrote to address exactly these issues:
*	http://c2.com/ppr/about/copyright.html

== &quot;stolen link&quot; ==

I just now deleted the line

&quot;**[http://www.modesthosting.com Wiki Hosting]- someone seems to have &quot;stolen&quot; the link?&quot;

Edit 35207
( http://wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wiki_Science:How_to_start_a_Wiki&amp;diff=35207&amp;oldid=34152 )
originally added that link.
As far as I can tell, that site does not currently offer any special Wiki support (perhaps they did in the past).

If they do (perhaps in the future) offer wiki support, please post a link to the exact page that mentions Wiki support.

-- [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 06:10, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)



== Learning Wiki markup ==

I searched &quot;wiki markup&quot; and got information on how to start a wiki, but no information on how to create and edit pages. Something with simple instructions would be helpful. Standard html does not seem to work.

Thanks!

== NPOV ==

I found it very much agianst the NPOV that there where only two wiki-engines mentioned (they are not the only and not the best solution for everything. Instead I put in some links to sites which compare wiki-engines. If you disagree, please leave a note on [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Nemonand my userpage in the german wikipedia]. Thanks. --[[User:213.140.17.106|213.140.17.106]] 13:28, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

== Wikis for Existing Hostings ==

I was not able to find any information regarding '''which''' wiki engines do not require special privilege to install. If I already have a web hosting and want to add wiki in a particular section, which engines will work for me ,without any need to contacting technical support of hosting providers. I will be very happy if some body provides me with this information on this talk page. 
Thanks in advance.

== Free Wikis comparison table out of date ==

As of Oct 2005, the free wiki comparison table seems to be quite outdated. For example, Schtuff.com  apprently does have revisions and history, to the contrary of the table entry. Also, X-Wiki and some others have now very interesting advanced features, which would deserve mentioning in the &quot;pros&quot; column. --Andras





== MediaWiki ==

I like a section about how to start a [[w:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] engine.

== Paid wiki hosting ==
I suppose a web host included in this section should provide a reasonable set of services that enable people to build and maintain a wiki site. But no such set is described here, and I personally know that one of the web hosts listed here do not even provide the ability to run a basic MediaWiki maintanence script.
I would rather drop this section or provide more accurate information about each host.

== freewiki ==

Is http://freewiki.info/ useful enough to add to this module?
I like the screenshots there.

== Wikipedia ==
Is the big Wiki hosted on one of these? If it is hosted, on what? -Salty [[User:66.69.124.88|66.69.124.88]] 03:04, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

:They run dedicated servers for the big wikis. [[User:207.216.17.170|207.216.17.170]] 16:08, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

== Links from Wikipedia ==

The text of the article suggests, &quot;Link to your wiki on a relevant page in the Wikipedia namespace.&quot; Some readers have become quite upset by the fact that, when they follow this advice, their links are removed from Wikipedia. More clarification is needed. After all, [[w:WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not a collection of links]], and unless the wiki is particularly informative, there always going to be editors who will oppose its addition to Wikipedia articles. -[[User:66.92.76.142|66.92.76.142]] 15:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

:[[w:WP:NOT]] does allow for linking to relevent articles by people involved, but one must justify the relevency and value to avoid people who only partially understand the rules. [[User:207.216.17.170|207.216.17.170]] 16:07, 15 July 2006 (UTC) [[w:User:HighInBC]]


== Annoying Message ==
I just created a wiki at editthis.info, and whenever I add an external link to a page, it says: 

&quot;Hello link spammer. 
Just so you know, google does not follow links off this page. 
The links are tagged to be ignored by search engines, so go somewhere else. All you are doing is annoying users.
Adding links here will not help you page rank

Thanks,
Rob

Does anyone know why this is happening?--[[User:65.96.158.140|65.96.158.140]] 20:15, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

I'm getting exactly the same message! That's reeeeeally annoying! I've posted a message at the editthis help desk, but apparently no one's there!

[[User:200.177.128.231|200.177.128.231]] 22:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== WYSISWYG ==

I have a request. I dont know if Ishould be discussing here but I need a Wiki (preferably free but I dont mind paying if it is really good) that will allow the maximum ease of use. I am pretty fammiliar with Wiki syntax but I wish to use one which will not require Wiki syntax or little for a project. Most of all I want a tabular format which I can edit with as much ease as MS excel. What I want is something like this: I create a set of tables (with or without syntax) but each cell in the table should be editable individually by clicking on it. Is there a Wiki which offers a lot of ease for naive computer users. --[[User:59.162.197.16|59.162.197.16]] 13:26, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

== Terminology ==

The terms &quot;self-hosting&quot; and &quot;Hosted wikis&quot; currently used in chapter names seem dubious. Better terms are welcome. Other terms coming to mind are &quot;in-house&quot;, &quot;outsourced&quot;, and &quot;outsourcing&quot;. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:06, 15 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 11. Bryology ~ The Liverworts and Mosses&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;

''Bryology'' is the study of nonvascular complex plants classified in the '''Division Bryophyta'''.

The Bryophytes have several adaptations that allow them to grow on land, but are still tied to moisture for their reproduction. Their size is also restricted because they do not have vascular tissues, which limits their height and keeps them close to the nutrition and moisture of the ground. Rhizoids anchor them to the ground, but do not conduct water or nutrients as roots do. Some mosses have developed pores, but they do not open and close as stomata do. 

Most mosses look like undifferentiated green mold on rocks, but while they are non vascular, they have complex forms and parts. They have what appear to be leaves coming off their stalks, but are not leaves because they have no veins. Most notable in their anatomy is the peculiarity of their life cycle. The haploid organism is actually most of what we would call the moss. That green mat is the gameteophyte contains half of the DNA, or one full set of chromosomes. When the female gametophyte is fertilized with motile sperm from the male gametophyte, the diploid sporophyte grows directly out of the gametophyte. So out of an ordinary spiky green moss stalk, a tall curved stalk grows, with a large cap on it. That structure is the sporophyte. It will produce spores (that are haploid) that will propagate more haploid mosses. Each successive evolutionary adaptation of plants has reduced the haploid stage in size, and increased the diploid, or sporophyte stage. In ferns, the next evolutionary innovation based in bryophytes, the gametophyte stage functions the same way as here, the haploid spores make a haploid organism, which after fertilization grows a full diploid sporophyte from it. However, what we know as a fern is the diploid organism, the gametophyte is a very small heart shaped organism at the base of the fern.

== Chapter 13. Equisetophyta ~ The Club Mosses and Horsetails ==

The Equisetophyta is a very old division&amp;mdash;the plants of this division were among the first plants to grow on land. Equisetophyta are sometimes referred to as fern allies, as they have the same life cycles as ferns, and have similar developments that allow them to grow taller than the bryophytes.

==Kirchoff's Current Law==

Current is conserved.

Current flowing into a junction is equal to that flowing out.

I1 = I2 + I3

:&lt;math&gt; I_{1} = I_2  + I_3 + \cdots + I_n \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

Current is the flow of electrons through a piece of metal.  Given the sheer number of electrons involved it is similar to the flow of water through a pipe.  When the pipe branches the water has multiple paths to travel.  The only rule is that the amount of water entering any place has to be equal to the amount of water leaving any that place.  Otherwise the pipe would explode from the pressure or the water would cease to exist.

'''Borscht''', or '''borsch''' is a hearty beetroot [[Cookbook:Vegetables|vegetable]] [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] considered to originate from Ukraine or Western Russia. 
The soup is part of the local culinary heritage of many Eastern and Central European nations. It is also a staple dish in Eastern Europe, and made its way into United States cuisine by way of Jewish immigrants (as well as other Eastern Europeans).

Recipes of borscht vary, but beetroot is an essential ingredient.

==Ingredients==
===Soup===
*1½ cups thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es (about 3 small potatoes)
*1 cup thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Beet|beet]]s.
*4 cups water
*1-2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1½ cups chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (about ⅓ of a large onion)
*1½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 stalk [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]], chopped
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], chopped
*3 to 4 cups shredded [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] (about ⅓ of a large cabbage)
*a little fresh ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Dill|Dill]] weed
*1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]
*1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Tomato|Tomato]] purée or ¼ to ½ cup tomato paste

===Garnish===
*[[Cookbook:Sour cream|Sour cream]] or [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
*Dill weed

==Procedure==
#Place the potatoes, beets, and water in a medium-sized [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]. Cover and cook over medium heat until tender (20-30 minutes). While that is cooking, do steps 2-3.
#Melt the butter in a [[Cookbook:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]]/[[Cookbook:Stock pot|soup pot]]. Add the onion and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent (8 to 10 minutes).
#Add the celery, carrots, cabbage, and two cups of the water in which the potatoes and beets are cooking. Cover and cook over medium heat until the vegetables are tender (8 to 10 minutes).
#Add the remaining soup ingredients (including the potatoes, beets, and the rest of the water in which they are cooking). Cover and simmer for at least 15 more minutes. Correct the seasonings. If it is too thin, let it simmer uncovered, and maybe add a ''little'' more tomato paste. 
#Serve hot, topped with sour cream or yoghurt and sprinkled with dill. (If desired the sour cream or yoghurt can be served with the soup and used as a condiment to taste.) 

Serves about 6.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Sour environment is essential for the authentic taste and preservation of the red color, but excessive amount of [[Wikipedia:acetic acid|acetic acid]] from the vinegar (esp. distilled) causes sharp restaurant smell and taste. The cider vinegar can be replaced with sauerkraut or extra tomatoes.

== a few questions ==

First, this is a rather particular version.  A very basic recipe (without tomatoes, potatoes, honey or sugar) would be better, and then a section on regional or suggested variations.  By the way, do you mean sliced potatoes and beets or diced?  Sliced would be very difficult to eat with a spoon. 
Second, I don't get the point of saying it is from Ukraine or Western Russia, and mentioning Eastern and Central Europe, and then specifying it made its way into THE United States by way of Jewish immigrants.  The article should specify Ashkenazic Jewish immigration if it were true, which I don't think it is anyways.  Why not just say &quot;central and eastern European immigration&quot;?  
Third, what is a &quot;sour environment&quot;?  And what is a &quot;sharp restaurant smell and taste&quot;?  --[[User:Richardson mcphillips|Richardson mcphillips]] ([[User talk:Richardson mcphillips|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Richardson mcphillips|contribs]]) 14:54, 29 November 2014 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnamese Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]]

={{lang|vi|Bánh mì}}: colorful Saigon sandwich=

'''''{{lang|vi|Bánh mì}}''''' means 'wheat cake/pastry' in [[Vietnamese]]. It may have started as a 'kitchen sink' recipe in [[w:Vietnam|Vietnam]], where various leftovers would be tossed into a [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]] to finish them up (like a [[Cookbook:Po' Boy|po' boy]]). {{lang|vi|Bánh mì}} is now sought after by many for its unique and delicious flavors.  There are many different types of bánh mì sandwiches, ranging from chunked BBQ grilled [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], sliced pork pate, and shredded grilled [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], to grilled and smoked [[Cookbook:Seafood|fish]], sardine, meatball, Chinese-style [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]], and tripe.

Choices of bread are also quite varied.  It is customary to use a toasted French [[Cookbook:Baguette|baguette]] or French bread, because of the textures these breads provide: bánh mì tastes best when the outer crust of the bread is firm but not overly hard, and the inner part of the bread is fluffy and light like a yeast roll, that is, one which is not overly dense or spongy.  The reason for this is that the crust's firmness provides a barrier for the moisture of the sandwich, and the lightness of the inner bread does not overwhelm the flavors of the sandwich, which would otherwise make the sandwich taste overly 'bready'.  Still, no sandwich tastes better than the flavor of the bread, so make sure the bread is fresh and flavorful (preferably one from a bakery).  Using a store-bought bread yields unpredictable results as they tend to taste overly processed or they taste like the plastic or paper bag in which they are kept. 

To make a {{lang|vi|bánh mì}} sandwich, begin with a toasted French baguette.  Cut a length of baguette in half lengthwise and either remove excess bread from the inner portion of the sandwich by digging out a cavity in the two halves or press into the bread to form trenches. These depressions are where we will put the [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] and ingredients.

The following are different ingredients used to make bánh mì.  Put in as many as you wish in your sandwich - each is different.  The first list of ingredients are typical bánh mì ingredients, the second list are [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] ingredients, and the third list are optional other ingredients.  Have fun!

==Kirchoff's Voltage Law==

Kirchoff's laws can be described with a sentence as, What comes in, must go out. It's that simple. You have a potential on one side of a battery, then you need the negative potential on the other side of the battery. You have a current into a junction, the same current must go out of the junction.

in a circuit 

in series voltage drops and current stays constant
in parallel voltage stays constant and current divides according to the resistance

voltage stays constant in parallel and current drops in p

Voltage is the potential between two charges.

The nice things about potentials is you can add or subtract them in series to make a larger or smaller potential as is commonly done in batteries.

In parallel voltage...

The flow a circuit is that of a potential drop.  Electrons flow from areas of high  potential to ground which is low potential.  At a given place in a circuit there are numerous paths to ground.  Each of them has the same voltage as they have the same potential from ground.  

All the components of a circuit have resistance that acts as a potential drop.

==Diode==
Theoretically, a diode allows current flow in only one direction. An ideal diode acts as a perfect insulator for currents flowing in one direction and as a perfect conductor for currents flowing through it in the other direction. The direction in which the diode allows current to flow is called the forward bias direction and that in which current is resisted is called reverse bias direction. Diode has a symbol as shown 
: [[Image:Diode symbol.svg]]


===Construction===
The modern semiconductor diode consists of two regions of semiconductor each having impurities of different types such that one side has excess holes (p-region) and the other has excess electrons (n-region). Such a junction of p and n regions is called a pn junction diode. The p-region has about twice as much area as the n-region to compensate for the lesser mobility of holes compared to electrons.
: + o-- [P | N]--o  - .Theoretically, a diode allows current flow in only one direction the most common type today  is a crystalline piece of material with a p junction connected to two electrical terminals.

==Operation==
===I V Curve===
[[File:Rectifier_vi_curve.GIF|300px]]

As seen in the graph above the diode actually works in both the forward region and the backward region. In the forward region the value of I and V are positive and in the backward region I and V are negative.

===Forward Region=== 
: Current and Voltage are positive
: When V &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; . I = 0 . Diode does not conduct
: Khi V = V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; . I = 1mA . Diode starts to conduct . V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.3v|Ge , 0.6v|Si 
: V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is called Forward Break Over Voltage
: Khi V &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; . Diode conducts current . Current is calculated by &lt;math&gt;I = I_o [e^(\frac{V_d}{nV_T})t - 1&lt;/math&gt; ]

===Backward Region===
: Current and Voltage are Negative 
: When the value of voltage is more negative than the Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) Voltage the Diode will be destroyed

===Ideal Diode===
The real diode approaches the ideal diode in the sense that the reverse current is extremely small (less than 1fA) at least for a significant part of the characteristic, and the forward current is very high (on the order of 1mA). Although a real diode does not have the characteristics as the ideal diode, in theory it is possible to make an ideal diode if the concentrations of dopants in both the regions are infinite. However, there is no way of actually doing this and experiments do not agree. 

===The Shockley equation===
The diode reverse (''saturation'') current is governed by the doping concentration. The current flowing through the device varies as the voltage applied across it changes as given by the Shockley diode equation (not to be confused with Schottky):

&lt;math&gt;I_D = I_S [ exp(V_D/nV_T) - 1 ]&lt;/math&gt;

In the equation above &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;V_T = k T/q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is Boltzmann's constant, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature in Kelvin, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the charge on an electron.

In the forward bias direction, current flows with low voltage. If one draws a characteristic for this equation, a sharp increase in current can be seen at a particular voltage called the ''cut-in voltage'' or the ''on-voltage''. 

In the reverse bias mode, the diode current is approximately &lt;math&gt;-I_S&lt;/math&gt;. This is called the reverse ''saturation'' current because it looks like the diode is saturated with charge and cannot allow more current in the reverse bias direction than this.

===Break-down===
However, a break from the above equation takes place at a point called ''break-down voltage''. One could think of it as the point where the Shockley equation ''breaks down'' and is no longer valid. There are two reasons for breakdown to occur. 

Avalanche Breakdown
:This occurs as a result of excess minority carriers in a region. Minority carriers are those carriers that are in the wrong region. For example, electrons will be minority carriers in the p-region.

Zener Breakdown
:This is basically due to a size difference or dopant concentration difference. One of the regions has a greater region of depletion (Reverse bias voltage induces a depletion region, which is sparse in a densely doped region and dense in a sparsely doped region. )

See also [[Electronics/Diodes/Zener diode|Zener diodes]]

===Summary===
So basically, there are three modes in which a diode operates:

'''Forward'''
: No current flows until a small forward voltage is reached called ''cut-in'' voltage. 

'''Reverse'''
: The diode prevents current from flowing in the opposite direction.  Current is small, and voltage can be large (but not exceeding the Zener voltage.)

'''Breakdown'''
: Once the diode voltage is more negative than the Zener voltage, the diode allows current to flow in the reverse direction.

When there is no voltage applied, the excess electrons of the N type semiconductor flow into the holes of the P type semiconductor.  This creates a depletion region that acts as a voltage.

==Diode Variations==
'''Bridge Rectifier:''' 
: A diode circuit that 'rectifies' alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC).  The bridge rectifier is a full-wave rectifier, meaning that both the positive and negative portions of the wave become positive.  (In a half-wave rectifier, positive stays positive, and negative becomes zero.)  The bridge rectifier has advantages over other full-wave rectifier designs, because it reduces peak-inverse voltage (PIV), the largest negative voltage across a single junction diode.  By reducing the PIV, it becomes possible to use diodes with lower breakdown (Zener) voltages.  This allows the use of cheaper diodes to perform the same function.
:[[File:4 Diode Bridge Rectifier.png|thumb|right|A bridge rectifier shown as 4 discrete diodes.]]

'''LED''' (Light Emitting Diode)
: A diode that emits light!
: [[Image:LED symbol.svg]]

'''Schottky:''' 
:A diode made from a metal-semiconductor junction, rather than an p-type/n-type silicon junction. These diodes typically have a much lower forward voltage drop than standard diodes (around 0.2V versus 0.6V).
:[[Image:Schottky diode symbol.svg]]

'''Zener:''' 
:A diode that is meant to be operated in the breakdown region.  These diodes have lower Zener (breakdown) voltages, so that they can achieve the breakdown mode without melting. Unlike other diodes, these have very specific breakdown voltages, typically between 2 and 200 volts. See also [[Electronics/Diodes/Zener diode|Zener diode]]s
:[[Image:Zener diode symbol.svg]]

'''Varicap:'''
:A diode that is build to use the capacity in dependance of the cross voltage. Although they rectify, they will be used in tuning circuits as a replacement of manual operated variable capacitors. They permit the use of electronic equipment to be controlled, this permits a phase-locked loop and other circuits which needs stability and electronic control.  Semiconductor diodes begin conducting electricity under certain conditons.</text>

'''These are the units you would find when doing problems in electronics.'''&lt;br&gt;
The majority of these units are named after famous people in the field who either discovered the units or had someone else name the units after them.  

One reason people don't understand math or Physics very well is that it literally is Greek to them.

''(Do we want these separated from the definitions page?  or should we include all of these on the definitions page and just have a separate units page too?)''

''My take on the units page is that it is a guide for doing math problems.  Imagine doing a math problem and coming across &amp;Xi;.  That's where the units page comes in handy as you only have to search through a small number of units to find the unit you want.  Ideally all the definitions in Units should find their way into the main definitions page.''

''Ok.  So we should copy all of these to the definitions page as well?  Things like frequency, length, time and wavelength are not units; they should be in the definitions section and not here.  Hertz, meters, and seconds are units.''

'''Ampere, Amp''' (A): The SI unit for current I.  Equals a coulomb (1 C) of charged particles moving past a point in one second (1 s).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{C}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Coulomb''' (C): The SI unit for charge Q.&lt;br&gt;
1 C = 6.24 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; Q

'''Cycles per second''' (cps): As the name implies, a measurement of frequency in full cycles of a wave per second.  This is equivalent to Hertz, but Hertz is the official unit.  The unit cps (or kilocycles, megacycles, etc.) is more often seen in older documents.

'''Farad''' (F): The SI unit for Capacitance (C).  One Farad equals a capacitor that has a Coulomb (1 C) of charge on it with a voltage separation of a Volt (1 V).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{C}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Frequency

'''Henry''' (H): The SI unit for inductance.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H =V \frac{s}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Hertz''' (Hz): The SI unit for frequency.  One Hz is one cycle per second.   

'''Horse Power''' (HP): The power a horse can achieve.&lt;br&gt;
1 HP = 746 W

'''Joule''' (J): The work required to move a Newton (1 N) a meter (1 m).&lt;br&gt;
J = N m

'''Length''': (l): The symbol for distance in meters (m).

'''Meter''' (m): The SI unit for distance.  The distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 second.

'''Ohm''' (&amp;Omega;): A measure of resistance or impedance.&lt;br&gt;
1 Ohm =

'''Second''' (s): The SI unit for time.  

'''SI''': The standard system of units.

'''Time''' (t): The symbol for time in seconds (s).

'''Volt''' (V): A potential due to an electric field.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{C}{J}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Watt''' (W): A measure of power (P).  A Watt is a Joule (1 J) of work done in a second (1 s). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{J}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Wavelength''' (&amp;lambda;): The distance between two peaks of a cycle.

      <comment>/* LONG BONE */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The framework of the body is built upon a series of bones, supplemented in certain regions by cartilage; the bony part of the framework constitutes the skeleton. 

The skeletal system serves several functions, among them are:

*Protection and support: The ribs protect the organs of the thorax and the skull protects the brain. The legs support the weight of the entire body. The vertebrae also support the upper body.

*Movement: Most skeletal muscles attach to the bones of the skeletal system and use them as leverage points for movement of the body. 

*Production of blood cells: The bone marrow produces blood cells in a process known as hematopoiesis. 

*Storage: &quot;Yellow bone marrow&quot; or adipose tissue stores fat in the medullary cavity of long bones. Bones can also be broken down to release inorganic calcium and phosphorus stored in the non cellular matrix of the bone.

In the skeleton of the adult there are generally 206 distinct bones:

Axial Skeleton:
:Vertebral column 26
:Skull 22
:Hyoid bone 1
:Ribs and sternum 25
:Auditory ossicles 6
:Total 80

Appendicular Skeleton:
:Upper extremities 64
:Lower extremities 62
:Total 126


Total 206


==Types of Bones==

Bones are divisible into four classes: Long, Short, Flat, and Irregular. Long Bones are found in the limbs and function as levers, they are longer than they are wide. Short Bones transfer forces of movement and are cube shaped as in the carpus and tarsus. Flat Bones are used for either extensive protection or the provision of broad surfaces for muscular attachment. The bones expand into broad, flat plates, as in the skull and the scapula. Irregular Bones have  peculiar forms, cannot be grouped under the preceding heads, and are used for muscle attachement and articulation. Some irregular bones include the vertebræ, sacrum and coccyx.

===LONG BONE===

Long bones consists of a body or shaft and two extremities. The body, or diaphysis is cylindrical, with a central cavity termed the medullary cavity. The wall consists of dense, compact tissue of considerable thickness in the middle part of the body, but becoming thinner toward the extremities. Within the medullary cavity is adipose tissue or &quot;yellow bone marrow&quot;. 

The extremities are refered to as the epiphysis.  Within the epiphysis is the &quot;spongy bone&quot; also known as &quot;red bone marrow&quot;.  It is within this marrow that red blood cells are produced at an average rate of 2.5 million per second.   Running horizontally across the spongy bone of this region is the Epiphyseal line which is a region of cell growth responsible for lateral bone growth during youth, when growth is complete this line calcifies and becomes known as the epiphyseal plate.  

Nutrient foramen run through the compact bone and allow the passage of nutrients in and out of the bone.  There is a thin outer layer of connective tissue called the PERIOSTEUM which is highly vascular and allows for muscle and tendon attachment, it is bound to the bone itself by PERFORATING FIBERS which are composed of collagen.  This layer does not cover the articulating regions of the bone.  The bones belonging to this class include: the clavicle, humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, fibula, metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges.
it is strongest largest of all body bones.

===SHORT BONE===

Short bones are generally equal in length, width, and thickness. They are found in the wrists and ankles. Aside from points of insertion and vascular areas, short bones are almost completely covered by articular surfaces.

===FLAT BONE===

These bones are composed of two thin layers of compact tissue enclosing between them a variable quantity of spongy bone. They generally offer protection, as is the case with the bones of the cranium and with the ribs and sternum.

Indian food is almost always prepared with fresh ingredients along with delicate mixtures of many different fresh and dried spices and the exact recipes often vary greatly from one household to the next.  To refer to Indian Cuisine is almost a misnomer, since the regional dishes vary tremendously from region to region. 

==General Perception and Myths==
'''Curry Phenomenon:''' In Western countries, such as Great Britain and the United States, the complex formulations of fresh and dried spices are often replaced by simple dry powders such as red chilli powder and curry powder. The word ''[[Cookbook:Curry|curry]]'' comes from the Tamil ''kari'' or marathi kadi (a type of thick sauce).

'''Hot/Spice Factor:''' Indian food is usually perceived as 'spicy' or 'hot'. While that is sometimes true, most Indian foods are not necessarily 'spicy' or 'hot'. Chilli peppers similar to cayenne chili peppers, commonly referred to as &quot;chilli(es)&quot; in Indian cookbooks and lexicon, are the common culprit for making the dishes fiery hot. If you do not prefer the heat, stay away from dishes that contain liberal use of chillies, or tone down the chilli amount to suit your taste. The other ingredient to be careful with is peppercorn, most commonly referred to as &quot;pepper&quot; in Indian recipes and cookbooks. Cloves and cinnamon also increase the heat.

As in most cuisines, most vegetable and meat dishes are called by thousands of different names, depending on the region, language, ingredients and method of preparation. The recipes listed here are only examples of a few Indian dishes and should not be considered as a general guide to Indian food. Feel free to experiment with them. Substituting spices and altering the suggested procedures is encouraged. Indians regularly engage in such practices and often create unique tastes in their household.

__NOTOC__
'''Kovaim''' are Hungarian cheese dumplings.

==Ingredients==
===Dough===
*300 g [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]]
*3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]]s
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Water|Water]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste

===Filling===
*Try a dry cheese like dry ricotta for this filling, and some salt. You could add some spicier cheese to the filling like cheddar, or even Parmesan, but make sure this is not more than a third of the filling.

==Procedure==
# Mix the flour, salt, eggs and water into a dough. Knead it until it is very smooth. Cover the dough in a plastic bowl, and let it rest for at least half an hour. 
# Roll the dough out into a sheet as thin as possible (about three millimeters thick). Cut into squares and fill with cheese (or cooked potatoes and onions, or ricotta cheese with sugar for a sweet dumpling). Fold and boil in water for about five minutes.
# Serve hot. This recipe goes really well with cheddar cheese and ketchup.

__NOTOC__
'''Paprika chicken''' is a dish of Hungarian origin traditionally made with chicken, paprika and lard, served over pasta. There is no official recipe. Preparations of this dish often vary between families. In the Americanized version, sour cream is often used in place of lard and mild red paprika is typically used in place of the more authentic sweet paprika used by Hungarians. 

==Ingredients==
*1 2&amp;ndash;3 pound [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], cut into parts
*2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], chopped
*2-4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] sweet (not hot) [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*5 to 7 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] olive oil.
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sour cream|sour cream]]
*1/5 -1/2 cup heavy cream
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*fresh green parsley
*  6-7 whole black peppercorn

==Other Ingredients==
Vegetables are optional. The traditional Hungarian version contains none.

*1 green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]
*&amp;frac12; red bell pepper;
*1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], thinly chopped
*For every carrot used, add 1/3 parsnip, thinly chopped. This takes away the slight sweetness of the carrot.
* also add one thinly chopped onion.

==Procedure==
#Cut the chicken into eight pieces. 
#Add the oil to a medium [[Cookbook:Sauté pan|sauté pan]]. [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] the onions, for about 3-4 minutes or until turn yellow.
#Add the chicken, peppercorn, salt, paprika and stir it rapidly. It is a lot of paprika, but it is '''not hot''' and this is a Paprikash. Add water immediately so it will cover the meat. Continue cooking on a small fire, simmer the dish. (Add peppers and carrot after ten minutes if you wish. Optional.) Check on the meal. Stir occasionally until the chicken is tender. If necessary add more water, but very sparingly. Do not boil the chicken, it should be almost fried in the end. This takes about 45-50  minutes. The last 15 minutes stop adding more water and wait until the liquid is almost boiled off. Keep about a half finger thick gravy on the bottom of the pan
#Add the sour cream and heavy cream to the gravy and  stir. If you want to avoid the heavy cream, use more sour cream. Add fresh chopped parsley on the top.
#Serve with dumplings, rice or mashed potatoes and salad. 

==Note==
It is important not to use hot paprika, the red powder sold simply as &quot;paprika&quot; in most supermarkets, as this would make the soup too spicy and of the wrong consistency. 
Sweet paprika can be obtained from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Polish]] or central [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]] delis and specialist supermarkets. It is normally sold in 250 [[Cookbook:g|g]] sachets

'''Rakott Krumpli''' (potato casserole) baked in the oven, a popular dish in Hungary.

==Ingredients==
* 6 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]]
* 350 grams sour cream around 40% fat (called tejföl or smetana).
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
* 4 Tablespoons olive oil.

==Other Ingredients==
The dish works fine without meat as well.
Optional.
* 1 kolbász (Hungarian sausage)

==Procedure==
# Cook the potatoes for about 15-20 minutes.
# Put a little olive oil in the bowl. (Traditionally most Hungarian cooking used lard, preferably home-made. Olive oil works just as well as a substitution.)
# Peel the potatoes and the eggs.  
# Slice eggs, potatoes, sausage into slices and arrange in alternating layers of potatoes, eggs, salt or sausage in the bowl. Spread the olive oil over the dish and top with sour cream.
# Bake in a preheated oven at 200°C for about 35 minute

'''Silvash Gombotz''' (Plum Dumplings, correct Hungarian spelling: Szilvás gombóc)

This is a traditional dessert recipe from Hungary. During the freezing cold winters, warm filling desserts are very popular.

==Ingredients==

*2 pounds peeled [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*fresh [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]], plum [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] or plum [[Cookbook:Compote|compote]]

==Procedure==
#Cook two pounds of potatoes until very soft (at least an hour). Peel and mash with a fork. Add an egg to the mixture, a little salt, three tablespoons of oil and enough flour to make it smooth.
#This is the best you can get by way of recipes from my granny, I think she means about six or seven tablespoons, and add them one by one.
#Knead the potato dough and then roll it out into a thin sheet (about five millimeters thick), and cut into squares. Put half a plum or a teaspoon of plum jam on each square (also works with apricots, in which case the dumplings will be called &quot;barackos gombóc&quot; or &quot;Baratzkosh Gombotz&quot;). Wrap the dough around the filling and seal the edges. Cook in boiling water for ten to fifteen minutes.
#Serve with bread crumbs fried in butter.

[[Image:Dutch Oven -McClures Magazine.jpg|thumb|right|A dutch oven]]

A '''Dutch oven''' is a heavy, cast-iron or aluminium pot with a tight-fitting lid. Once heated, it retains heat exceptionally well, making Dutch ovens a good choice for slow-cooked [[cookbook:stew|stew]]s. Dutch ovens are one of the best ways to [[Cookbook:Camp Cooking|cook over an open fire]], and can be used to make a wide range of dishes. While camping, it can be useful to line a dutch oven with [[cookbook:Aluminium Foil|aluminium foil]], thus saving the job of cleaning it afterwards. &lt;br&gt;
Some Dutch ovens come with a heavy wire stand, instead of cast-in legs, and this has the advantage of other uses around the camp, but if an oven has legs, there is the possibility that a long drop may break off a leg, or worse, drive it up through the bottom, destroying a valuable treasure.

You can put plain potatoes in a Dutch oven and really enjoy the results.

==Care and feeding==

A Dutch oven (actually developed in many cultures, but many were imported by the Dutch to the Americas as a trade item) must be seasoned before use, by putting grease or oil (animal or vegetable-anything edible) over the entire inside '''including the lid''' and heating to cooking temperature for an hour or so, replenishing the oil as needed, then allow to cool. To clean the oven, wipe the food remnants out of the inside, while still warm, and re-oil. Washing should be done with plain water and a brush.  Soap or detergent can remove the seasoning.  This is true for any iron cooking surface.&lt;br&gt;
An alternate method of seasoning (the bottom) is to deep fry in it.&lt;br&gt;
Any Dutch oven worth its weight, iron or aluminium, will have a turned up edge on the lid, to keep coals, either wood or charcoal, from dropping into the food, when the lid is removed.&lt;br&gt;
An aluminium pot should be carefully heated: overheating may warp the lid!&lt;br&gt;
Most dishes will do much better, especially breads, when the pot is preheated before adding the food.&lt;br&gt;

==Use==
Heat can be introduced in one of two ways, charcoal briquettes or coals form the fire.  Each has their own benefits and drawbacks.  Charcoal briquettes provide a consistent heat source that can easily be adjusted for temperature.  Charcoal is fairly easy to light and quickly reaches the desired temperature. Each briquette contributes 10-20 degrees to your cooking temperature.  Doing some simple multiplication will get you to consistent cooking temps easily.  For example a 12 inch oven requires 16 bricks on the top and 8 on the bottom to bake at 350 degrees.  The drawback is that you have to carry a bag with you every time you want to cook.  Hardwood coals from a camp fire will also work, but its is much harder to control temperature.  When baking for example you should put 1/3 of your coals on the bottom and 2/3 on the top.  In addition, it takes a large amount of coals to keep several ovens going.  It may take an hour or two of a roaring fire to get the desired amount of coals.  Also placing the ovens too close to the fire may cause uneven cooking or burning on the sides if not careful.  


Cooking times may vary with either method depending on wind or elevation.  If you begin to smell the cake it may be time to check the oven.  

All the coals should be on the bottom for simple boiling or using the bottom for frying.&lt;br&gt;
The majority of the coals should be on the bottom for simmering a soup or cooking a stew, only about 20% on top. &lt;br&gt;
To roast meats, put equal amounts of coals on top and bottom.&lt;br&gt;
Baking breads and casseroles should have most of the coals on top, about 2/3.&lt;br&gt;</text>

==RLC Series==
An RLC series circuit consists of a resistor, inductor, and capacitor connected in series:
:[[Image:RLC series circuit v1.svg|left|100px]]



By Kirchhoff's voltage law the differential equation for the circuit is:
:&lt;math&gt;L \frac{dI}{dt} + IR + \frac{1}{C} \int I dt = V(t)&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;L \frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + R \frac{dI}{dt}  + \frac{I}{C} =\frac{dV}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
Leading to:
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 + \frac{R}{L} s + \frac{1}{LC} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha&lt;/math&gt;  ± &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;

with 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

There are three cases to consider, each giving different circuit behavior,
&lt;math&gt; \alpha^2 = \beta^2, \alpha^2 &gt; \beta^2, or \alpha^2 &lt; \beta^2 &lt;/math&gt; .

;&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 = \beta^2&lt;/math&gt; . 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ \frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = 2 \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

Equation above has only one real root
:s = -α = &lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = A e^{(-\frac{R}{2L}) t}&lt;/math&gt;


;&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &gt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt; , 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{2L}&lt;/math&gt; &gt; &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R &gt; 2\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

Equation above has only two real roots
:&lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ± &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = e^(-\alpha + \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}) t + e^-(\alpha + \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}) t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = e^(-\alpha)  e(\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}) t - e^-(\sqrt{\alpha^2 - \beta^2}) t&lt;/math&gt;



;&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 &lt; \beta^2&lt;/math&gt; . 
:&lt;math&gt;R &lt; 2\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

Equation above has only two complex roots
: &lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha&lt;/math&gt; + j&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;s = -\alpha&lt;/math&gt; - j&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = e^j(-\alpha + \sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2}) t + e^j(-\alpha + \sqrt{\beta^2 -\alpha^2}) t&lt;/math&gt;

==Circuit Analysis==
===R = 0 ===
If R = 0 then the RLC circuit will reduce to LC series circuit . LC circuit will generate a standing wave when it operates in resonance; At Resonance the conditions rapidly convey in a steady functional method.
:&lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

===R = 0  Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Z&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=== 
If R = 0 and circuit above operates in resonance then the total impedance of the circuit is Z = R and the current is V / R

At Resonance
: &lt;math&gt;Z_L + Z_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt; Or &lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C} &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_L + Z_C = R + 0 = R&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

At Frequency
: I = 0 . Capacitor opens circuit . I = 0
: I =  0 Inductor opens circuit . I = 0

Plot the three value of I at three I above we have a graph I - 0 At Resonance frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt; the value of current is at its maximum &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt; . If the value of current is half then circuit has a stable current &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt;does not change with frequency over a Bandwidth of frequencies É1 - É2 . When increase current above &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt; circuit has stable current over a Narrow Bandwidth .  When decrease current below &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt; circuit has stable current over a Wide Bandwidth

Thus the circuit has the capability to select bandwidth that the circuit has a stable current when circuit operates in resonance therefore the circuit can be used as a Resonance Tuned Selected Bandwidth Filter

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:LCR_diagram.png|Figure 1: RCL circuit]]&lt;br&gt;''Figure 1: RCL circuit''&lt;/div&gt;

When the switch is closed, a voltage step is applied to the RCL circuit.  Take the time the switch was closed to be 0s such that the voltage before the switch was closed was 0 volts and the voltage after the switch was closed is a voltage V.  This is a step function given by &lt;math&gt;V\cdot u(t)&lt;/math&gt; where V is the magnitude of the step and &lt;math&gt;u(t)=1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t\geq0&lt;/math&gt; and zero
otherwise.

To analyse the circuit response using transient analysis, a differential equation which describes the system is formulated.  The voltage around the loop is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
Vu(t)=v_c(t)+\frac{di(t)}{dt}L+Ri(t) \mbox{ (1)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage across the capacitor, &lt;math&gt;\frac{di(t)}{dt}L&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage across the inductor and &lt;math&gt;Ri(t)&lt;/math&gt; the voltage across the resistor.

Substituting &lt;math&gt;i(t)=\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; into equation 1:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
Vu(t)=v_c(t)+\frac{d^2v_c(t)}{dt^2}LC+R\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}C
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2v_c(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_c(t)=\frac{Vu(t)}{LC} \mbox{ (2)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The voltage &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; has two components, a natural response &lt;math&gt;v_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; and a forced response &lt;math&gt;v_f(t)&lt;/math&gt; such that:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_c(t)=v_f(t)+v_n(t)\mbox{ (3)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

substituting equation 3 into equation 2.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\bigg[\frac{d^2v_n(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_n(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_n(t)\bigg]+\bigg[\frac{d^2v_f(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_f(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_f(t)\bigg]=0+\frac{Vu(t)}{LC}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

when &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0s&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;u(t)=1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\bigg[\frac{d^2v_n(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_n(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_n(t)\bigg]=0 \mbox{ (4)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\bigg[\frac{d^2v_f(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_f(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_f(t)\bigg]=\frac{V}{LC} \mbox{ (5)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The natural response and forced solution are solved separately.

'''Solve for &lt;math&gt;v_f(t):&lt;/math&gt;'''

Since &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{LC}&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree 0, the solution &lt;math&gt;v_f(t)&lt;/math&gt; must be a constant such that:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_f(t)=K
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dv_f(t)}{dt}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2v_f(t)}{dt}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting into equation 5:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{LC}K=\frac{V}{LC}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
K=V
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_f=V \mbox{ (6)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

'''Solve for &lt;math&gt;v_n(t)&lt;/math&gt;:'''

Let:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{R}{L}=2\alpha
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{LC}=\omega_n^2
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=Ae^{st}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting into equation 4 gives:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2Ae^{st}}{dt^2}+2\alpha\frac{dAe^{st}}{dt}+\omega_n^2Ae^{st}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s^2Ae^{st}+2\alpha Ae^{st}+\omega_2^2Ae^{st}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s^2+2\alpha s+\omega_n^2=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s=\frac{-2\alpha\pm\sqrt{4\alpha^2-4\omega_n^2}}{2}=-\alpha\pm\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;v_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; has two solutions &lt;math&gt;Ae^{s_1t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Ae^{s_2t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; are given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s_1=-\alpha+\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s_2=-\alpha-\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The general solution is then given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=A_1e^{s_1t}+A_2e^{s_2t}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Depending on the values of the Resistor, inductor or capacitor the solution has three posibilies.

1. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''overdamped'''

2. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''critically damped'''

3. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''underdamped'''


== Example: ==
Given the general solution

&lt;center&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| R || L || C || V
|-
| 0.5H || 1k&amp;Omega; || 100nF || 1V
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\alpha=\frac{R}{2L}=1000
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\omega_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\approx 4472
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s_1=-1000-4359j
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s_2=-1000+4359j
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=A_1e^{(-1000-4359j)t}+A_2e^{(-1000+4359j)t}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Thus by Euler's formula (&lt;math&gt;e^{j\phi}=\cos{\phi}+j\sin{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;):

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=e^{-1000}\big[A_1\big(\cos(-4359t)+j\sin(-4359t)\big)+A_2\big(\cos(4359t)+j\sin(4359t)\big)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=e^{-1000t}\big[(A_1+A_2)\cos(4359t)+j(-A_1+A_2)\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;B_1=A_1+A_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_2=j(-A_1+A_2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=e^{-1000t}\big[B_1\cos(4359t)+B_2\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

'''Solve for &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_2&lt;/math&gt;:'''

From equation \ref{eq:vf}, &lt;math&gt;v_f=1&lt;/math&gt; for a unit step of magnitude
1V. Therefore substitution of &lt;math&gt;v_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; into equation \ref{eq:nonhomogeneous} gives:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_c(t)=1+e^{-1000t}\big[B_1\cos(4359t)+B_2\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; the voltage across the capacitor is zero, &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
0=1+B_1\cos(0)+B_2\sin(0)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
B_1=-1\mbox{ (7)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, the current in the inductor must be zero, &lt;math&gt;i(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
i(t)=\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}C
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
i(0)=100\cdot10^{-9}\big[e^{-1000t}\big(-4359B_1\sin(4359t)+4359B_2\cos(4359t)\big)-1000e^{-1000t}\big(B_1\cos(4359t)+B_2\sin(4359t)\big)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
0=100\cdot10^{-9}\big[4359B_2-1000B_1 \big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

substituting &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; from equation \ref{eq:B1} gives

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
B_2\approx-0.229
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_c(t)=1-e^{-1000t}\big[\cos(4359t)+0.229\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_{out}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_{out}=V_{in}-v_c(t)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_{out}=Vu(t)-v_c(t)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_{out}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_{out}=e^{-1000t}\big[\cos(4359t)+0.229\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Book structure and level===
Engineering fluid mechanics is a subject requiring several semesters of university study to properly understand - is it practical to cover this topic in this context? What level of complexity should this book be? Is it possible to split it into two books, one simple and one advanced? I think it should start where a introductory fluid mechanic course does. 

Chapter 1: key concepts, Density, Viscosity, ect
Chapter 2: Statics, Hydrostatics, ect
Chapter 3: Fluid Dynamics, Bernouli, ect
Just to start off... (unknown contributor)

-----
first, what do you mean by mechanics? Math or Physics? a Fluid behavior book for everyone? or a book with strongMath-basis for engineers and scientists? if the latter, I have ''worked'' eagerly 2 years to find an excellent structure for a fluid mechanics book. here is what I reached.

Theory:
* Fluid statics
** Pressure - pascal's law, equilibrium law
** Force - Horizontal, Vertical *
*Fluid Kinematics
** Scalar approach - Flow and potential functions
** Vector approach - Closed Subject's R, V &amp; A fields (Eulerian), Open Subject's V &amp; A Fields (Lagrangian)
** Tensor approach - Stress &amp; strain tensors
** Flow visualization lines - streamline &amp; streamtube, pathline, streakline, timeline
** Flow visualization techniques - Reflective techs, Surface techs
* Fluid kinetics
** Integral formulation - Reynold's conservation of 1.mass, 2.Force, 3.Moment, 4.Energy and 5.entropy increase
** differential formulation - conservation of 1.mass (continuity), 2.Force (naiver-stokes), 4.Energy(Bernoulli)
Applied
* Internal-incompressible flow *
* Internal-compressible flow
* Free surface flow *
* External flow

the sections marked with * seems to talk about liquid only. but it's not true. everything is the same for vapors &amp; gases.

==Chapter 2: Vector Calculus==
In this section we have some equation such as:
&lt;math&gt;Insert formula here&lt;/math&gt;A+B=c
== Headline text ==
This formula says that the addsition of vector A &amp; B is vector C.

==Chapter 4: Conservation Equations==

===Conservation of Mass===

Should the derrivation of these laws be done in both Lagrangian and Eulerian reference frames?
??That comes from Mr.Reynolds theory of transport... which unites Lagran. and Eules stuff into one pakaged deal no ??? -Mechstudent
Either way, it yeilds:

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot
  \left(
    \rho \mathbf{V}
  \right) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
In words we may suggest to use:

Rate of mass accumulation = Rate of mass in - Rate of mass out

== new idea ==

There is an open content fluid mechanics textbook by Dr. Bar-Meir at www.potto.org.
It seem that someone should take that book and insert it to here.</text>

&lt;center&gt;&lt;H1&gt;Imperfect and Future constructs&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Warning: Beyond the imperfect, this page is not entirely clear. Do not use it beyond the basic imperfect if you are a first time Latin student. Specific aspects confused me until I got up in the morning. Of course, I never knew them very well anyway.

See discussion for my thoughts on this.

&lt;B&gt;I have substansially corrected this page. I apologize for my prior errors.&lt;/B&gt;

[[User:Smkatz|Smkatz]] 14:14, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I don't believe that it's 3rd conjugation that receives the &quot;ie,&quot; but rather only 3rd-io. So, in your example, &quot;vinciebam&quot; ought to be, &quot;vincebam,&quot; but &quot;accipiō&quot; will be &quot;accipiebam.&quot;


== Imperfect Active Indicative ==

The imperfect is a construct like:
&lt;br&gt;'''I was seeing.'''
&lt;br&gt; In Latin it would look like this:
&lt;br&gt;'''Videbam.'''

English has a similar construct called progressive past. Actions seem incomplete, and so the imperfect label. For example, &quot;I was running,&quot; &quot;We were sailing,&quot; &quot;They were calling.&quot; Note that 'to be' is always there. Latin, however, would sometimes use imperfect like simple past; accordingly, &quot;We were sailing&quot; could be translated as &quot;We sailed.&quot; Other translations of imperfect can be used to/kept such as &quot;We used to sail/We kept sailing.&quot; 

Regardless of language, the concept of an imperfect is important. Imperfect is called imperfect for a reason - in Latin, the verb &quot;perficere&quot; means to finish/complete, which is what perfect is from. Thus, imperfect, in the grammatical sense, means not finished - that the action could be or could not be completed. Perfect instead means it has been finished - I saw. You have already seen, and it is now completed. I was seeing implies that the action is not yet completed.

The perfect tense, which we will learn later, is a more immediate reference to the past. The name, imperfect, helps you remember its use: in situations where you can't say when an event started or ended or happened, you must use the imperfect.

In situations where you can know when an event started or ended or happened, use the perfect. 

You conjugate the imperfect tense this way:
verb + ba + personal ending

The endings for imperfect are:

Sg.
&lt;br&gt;1. '''-bam'''
&lt;br&gt;2. '''-bas'''
&lt;br&gt;3. '''-bat'''
&lt;br&gt;Pl.
&lt;br&gt;1. '''-bamus'''
&lt;br&gt;2. '''-batis'''
&lt;br&gt;3. '''-bant'''

Note that the only thing we add are ba + the personal endings (the same as in the present tense) to the infinitive stem. This gives us the imperfect conjugation.

Note that in third and fourth conjugations, you will have to form it differenntly. There is *no* rule to explain this, it just is, although there are memorization techniques that can help.

ven&lt;U&gt;i&lt;/U&gt;re is 4th conjugation and is formed like:
veniebam
veniebas 
veniebat 
veniebamus
veniebatis 
veniebant

For third conjugation, an example used in some textbooks/study guides is: capere (to capture or seize) 

capiebam
capiebas
capiebat
capiebamus
capiebatis
capiebant

Note that it is easiest to think of what the endings -ere and &lt;U&gt;i&lt;/U&gt;re lack. The imperfect -ba + the personal ending, which we can call the imperfect conjugation,  must be prefixed by ie.

A few examples:

'''amabam''' - '''I was loving''' (A-conjugation--1st)
&lt;br&gt;'''monebatis''' - '''You were warning [object/personage]''' (of something negative) (Pl.) (2nd Conjugation)
&lt;br&gt;'''vinciebamus''' - '''We were defeating'' (long I-conjugation--3rd conjugation)
&lt;br&gt;'''capiebant''' - '''They were catching''' (short I-conjugation--3rd conjugation)
&lt;br&gt;'''pellebat''' - '''She/he/it was propelling''' (drive something (not a vehicle), propel something) (consonantic conjugation)

(Wiki-reading tips: See discussion. Some of the above may be unclear, however the clarifying '--' and '/' indicate verification. We may not know what the original author intended, but we know what conjugations the examples are.)

== Future I, Active ==

Future active is a tense which, unsurprisingly, refers to something which has not yet happened. The endings are fairly basic, and follow fairly regular rules - however, the future endings used in 1st and 2nd conjugation differ from the endings of 3rd, 3rd-io (not a typo!), and 4th.

For example - &quot;amo, amare&quot; (1st conjugation) would be

Ama bo - I will love&lt;br&gt;*
Ama bis - You will love&lt;br&gt;
Ama bit - He/She/It will love&lt;br&gt;
Ama bimus - We will love&lt;br&gt;
Ama bitis - Y'all will love&lt;br&gt;
Ama bunt - They will love&lt;br&gt;*
* 1st person singular and 3rd person plural use bo and bunt, not bi.
Note the B and the BIs - the distinguishing feature of future tense in Latin.

With &quot;venio, venire&quot; (4th conjugation--io), however, the endings are different. In future, this is what they look like:

Veni am - I will come &lt;br&gt;
Veni es - You will come&lt;br&gt;
Veni et - He/She/It will come&lt;br&gt;
Veni emus - We will come&lt;br&gt;
Veni etis - Y'all will come&lt;br&gt;
Veni ent - They will come &lt;br&gt;

[deleted paragraphs go here. deleted to maintain rigorous accuracy, which we will go back to striving for.)

To clarify: ven&lt;U&gt;i&lt;/U&gt;re, venio.. we know it is 4th conjugation verb and if we look at its first person singular conjugation, we see that it is an io verb, because the conjugation of the first person singular is &quot;ven'''i'''o&quot;. (an io category exists within 3rd and fourth conjugations and is a more general concept which we will briefly introduce here by using venire, venio as an example).

Let's first identify what we know.

We know it is 4th conjugation -io because it ends in &lt;U&gt;i&lt;/U&gt;re, which tells us that it is 4th conjugation, and io because its nominative singular ends in io (venio). Because it is io, we leave the i in. So, when we are asked (as all textbooks should phrase these &lt;B&gt;new&lt;/B&gt; questions):

1. What are the steps to form the future 2nd person conjugation?

We say:

1. It is better to know more than you need: check the infinitive nominative singular, we now know that it is 4th conjugation io.
2. We now know that we can form the stem: the stem is veni and can then add a personal ending--leaving in the i. We leave in the i because it is io. Because it looks weird, we never leave the i in the future perfect. 

What is the form for venire, in the future tense, in the 2nd person?

The answer is venies.

==Future conjugation==

Example: '''I will love''':
&lt;br&gt;'''ama''b''o'''


The table at the end of this page tries to sumamrize the future tense, with both sets of personal endings. As the warning notes, this summary may confuse some.

As an aid to your understanding, this table only applies to the future tense. Do not assume the table is displaying a pattern that is somehow applicable to all of Latin.

(Wiki-reading-tip: This is why they are in the future section, and were not discussed before.)

The A- and the E- conjugation are (relatively) straight-forward. The others are more advanced, and as the warning notes, could confuse a first-time student. Commercial textbooks probably explain it better at this point, although laying their explanation in a table like the one below is well-advised. Leave items marked with a ? in until issues are resolved.

Take a look at the following table:


{|
|-
| '''A''' || '''E''' || '''long I (vincere/3rd conj.)
| '''short I''' || '''Consonantic'''
|-
| ama-'''b'''o || mone-'''b'''o || vinci-'''a'''m
| capi-'''a'''m || pell-'''a'''m
|-
| ama-'''b'''''i''s || mone-'''b'''''i''s
| vinci-'''e'''s || capi-'''e'''s || pell-'''e'''s
|-
| ama-'''b'''''i''t || mone-'''b'''''i''t
| vinci-'''e'''t || capi-'''e'''t || pell-'''e'''t
|-
| ama-'''b'''''i''mus || mone-'''b'''''i''mus
| vinci-'''e'''mus || capi-'''e'''mus || pell-'''e'''mus
|-
| ama-'''b'''''i''tis || mone-'''b'''''i''tis
| vinci-'''e'''tis || capi-'''e'''tis || pell-'''e'''tis
|-
| ama-'''b'''''u''nt || mone-'''b'''''u''nt
| vinci-'''e'''nt || capi-'''e'''nt || pell-'''e'''nt
|}

The vocabulary mostly consists of verbs, and can easily be looked up in a dictionary. We will give a limited translation below, and the rest, for those who are particularly adept at language learning, can be learned through imersion.

capere (3rd conjugation--short ere): to seize, metaphorically or literally [see dictionary for full explanation]

amare (first conjugation -are): to love

EXERCISE: Can you be your own editor?

monere (what conjugation? 2nd Conjugation Does it change based on the macron over the first vowel on the ending? Yes long ere = 2nd short =3rd[long ere vs. short ere?]

It means to warn like in admonish (an English word that means to scold lightly.)

==Operators and Assignments==

C has a wide range of operators that make simple math easy to handle. The list of operators grouped into precedence levels is as follows:

===Primary expressions===

An identifier is a primary expression, provided that it has been declared as designating an object (in which case it is an lvalue [a value that can be used as the left side of an assignment expression]) or a function (in which case it is a function designator).

A constant is a primary expression. Its type depends on its form and value.

A string literal is a primary expression.

A parenthesized expression is a primary expression. Its type and value are those of the unparenthesized expression.

===Postfix operators===

First, a primary expression is also a postfix expression. The following expressions are also postfix expressions:

A postfix expression followed by a left square bracket (&lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;), an expression, and a right square bracket (&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;) constitutes an invocation of the array subscript operator. One of the expressions shall have type &quot;pointer to object &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&quot; and the other shall have an integer type; the result type is &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;. Successive array subscript operators designate an element of a multidimensional array.

A postfix expression followed by parentheses or an optional parenthesized argument list indicates an invocation of the function call operator.

A postfix expression followed by a dot (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) followed by an identifier selects a member from a structure or union; a postfix expression followed by an arrow (&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) followed by an identifier selects a member from a structure or union who is pointed to by the pointer on the left-hand side of the expression.

A postfix expression followed by the increment or decrement operators (&lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;) indicates that the variable is to be incremented or decremented as a side effect. The value of the expression is the value of the postfix expression ''before'' the increment or decrement.

===Unary expressions===

First, a unary expression is a postfix expression. The following expressions are all postfix expressions:

The increment or decrement operators followed by a unary expression is a unary expression. The value of the expression is the value of the unary expression ''after'' the increment or decrement.

The following operators followed by a cast expression are unary expressions:

 Operator     Meaning
 ========     =======
    &amp;         Address-of; value is the location of the operand
    *         Contents-of; value is what is stored at the location
    -         Negation
    +         Value-of operator
    !         Logical negation ( (!E) is equivalent to (0==E) )
    ~         Bit-wise complement

The keyword &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; followed by a unary expression is a unary expression. The value is the size of the type of the expression in bytes. The expression is not evaluated.

The keyword &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; followed by a parenthesized type name is a unary expression. The value is the size of the type in bytes.

===Cast operators===

A cast expression is a unary expression.

A parenthesized type name followed by a cast expression is a cast expression. The parenthesized type name has the effect of forcing the cast expression into the type specified by the type name in parentheses. For arithmetic types, this either does not change the value of the expression, or truncates the value of the expression if the expression is an integer and the new type is smaller than the previous type.

An example of casting a float as an int:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
float pi = 3.141592;
int truncated_pi = (int)pi; // truncated_pi == 3
&lt;/source&gt;

An example of casting a char as an int:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
char my_char = 'A';
int my_int = (int)my_char; // my_int == 65, which is the ASCII value of 'A'
&lt;/source&gt;

===Multiplicative and additive operators===

In C, simple math is very easy to handle. The following operators exist: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulus); You likely know all of them from your math classes - except, perhaps, modulus. It returns the '''remainder''' of a division (e.g. 5 % 2 = 1). 

Care must be taken with the modulus, because it's not the equivalent of the mathematical modulus: (-5) % 2 is not 1, but -1. Division of integers will return an integer, and the division of a negative integer by a positive integer will round towards zero instead of rounding down (e.g. (-5) / 3 = -1 instead of -2).

There is no inline operator to do the power (e.g. 5 ^ 2 is '''not''' 25, and 5 ** 2 is an error), but there is a
[[C Programming/Further math#Power functions|power function]].

The mathematical order of operations does apply. For example (2 + 3) * 2 = 10 while 2 + 3 * 2 = 8. Multiplicative operators have precedence over additive operators.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
int i = 0, j = 0;

    /* while i is less than 5 AND j is less than 5, loop */
    while( (i &lt; 5) &amp;&amp; (j &lt; 5) )
    {
        /* postfix increment, i++
         *     the value of i is read and then incremented
         */
        printf(&quot;i: %d\t&quot;, i++);

        /*
         * prefix increment, ++j 
         *     the value of j is incremented and then read
         */
        printf(&quot;j: %d\n&quot;, ++j);
    }

    printf(&quot;At the end they have both equal values:\ni: %d\tj: %d\n&quot;, i, j);

    getchar(); /* pause */
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

will display the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
i: 0    j: 1
i: 1    j: 2
i: 2    j: 3
i: 3    j: 4
i: 4    j: 5
At the end they have both equal values:
i: 5    j: 5
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== shift and rotate ===

Shift functions are often used in low-level I/O hardware interfacing.
Shift and rotate functions are heavily used in cryptography and software floating point emulation.
Other than that, shifts can be used in place of division or multiplication by a power of two.
Many processors have dedicated function blocks to make these operations fast -- see [[Microprocessor Design/Shift and Rotate Blocks]].
On processors which have such blocks, most C compilers compile shift and rotate operators to a single assembly-language instruction -- see [[X86 Assembly/Shift and Rotate]].

==== shift left ====

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; operator shifts the binary representation to the left, dropping the most significant bits and appending it with zero bits.
The result is equivalent to multiplying the integer by a power of two.

==== unsigned shift right ====

The unsigned shift right operator, also sometimes called the logical right shift operator.
It shifts the binary representation to the right, dropping the least significant bits and prepending it with zeros.
The &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator is equivalent to division by a power of two for unsigned integers.

==== signed shift right ====

The signed shift right operator, also sometimes called the arithmetic right shift operator.
It shifts the binary representation to the right, dropping the least significant bit, but prepending it with copies of the original sign bit.
The &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator is not equivalent to division for signed integers.

In C, the behavior of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator depends on the data type it acts on.
Therefore, a signed and an unsigned right shift looks exactly the same, but produces a different result in some cases.

==== rotate right ====

Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to write C code that compiles down to the &quot;rotate&quot; assembly language instruction (on CPUs that have such an instruction).

Most compilers recognize this idiom:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
  unsigned int x;
  unsigned int y;
  /* ... */
  y = (x &gt;&gt; shift) | (x &lt;&lt; (32 - shift));
&lt;/source&gt;

and compile it to a single 32 bit rotate instruction.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2007-11/msg01112.html GCC: &quot;Optimize common rotate constructs&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.mail-archive.com/llvm-commits@cs.uiuc.edu/msg17216.html &quot;Cleanups in ROTL/ROTR DAG combiner code&quot;] mentions that this code supports the &quot;rotate&quot; instruction in the CellSPU
&lt;/ref&gt;

On some systems, this may be &quot;#define&quot;ed as a macro or defined as an inline function called something like &quot;rightrotate32&quot; or &quot;rotr32&quot; or &quot;ror32&quot; in a standard header file like &quot;bitops.h&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://archive.is/20130415063059/kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2008/4/15/1440064 &quot;replace private copy of bit rotation routines&quot;] -- recommends including &quot;bitops.h&quot; and using its rol32 and ror32 rather than copy-and-paste into a new program.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== rotate left  ====

Most compilers recognize this idiom:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
  unsigned int x;
  unsigned int y;
  /* ... */
  y = (x &lt;&lt; shift) | (x &gt;&gt; (32 - shift));
&lt;/source&gt;

and compile it to a single 32 bit rotate instruction.

On some systems, this may be &quot;#define&quot;ed as a macro or defined as an inline function called something like &quot;leftrotate32&quot; or &quot;rotl32&quot; in a header file like &quot;bitops.h&quot;.

=== Relational and equality operators ===

The relational binary operators &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; (less than), &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (greater than), &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt; (less than or equal), and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt; (greater than or equal) operators return a value of 1 if the result of the operation is true, 0 if false.

The equality binary operators &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; (equals) and &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; (not equals) operators are similar to the relational operators except that their precedence is lower.

=== Bitwise operators ===

The bitwise operators are &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; (and), &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; (exclusive or) and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; (inclusive or). The &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator has higher precedence than &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;, which has higher precedence than &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Logical operators ===

The logical operators are &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; (and), and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; (or). Both of these operators produce 1 if the relationship is true and 0 for false. Both of these operators short-circuit; if the result of the expression can be determined from the first operand, the second is ignored. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator has higher precedence than the &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operator.

&lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; is used to evaluate expressions left to right, and returns a 1 if ''both'' statements are true.
&lt;source lang=c&gt;  
  int x = 7;
  int y = 5;
  if(x == 7 &amp;&amp; y == 5) {
      ...
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, the &amp;&amp; operator checks the left-most expression, then the expression to its right. If there were more than two expressions chained (e.g. x &amp;&amp; y &amp;&amp; z), the operator would check x first, then y, then continue rightwards to z if neither x or y is zero. 
Since both statements return true, the &amp;&amp; operator returns true, and the code block is executed.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;  
    if(x == 5 &amp;&amp; y == 5) {
        ...
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The &amp;&amp; operator checks in the same way as before, and finds that the first expression is false.
The &amp;&amp; operator stops evaluating as soon as it finds a statement to be false, and returns a false.


&lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; is used to evaluate expressions left to right, and returns a 1 if ''either'' of the expressions are true.
&lt;source lang=c&gt;      
    /* Use the same variables as before. */
    if(x == 2 || y == 5) { // the || statement checks both expressions, finds that the latter is true, and returns true
        ...
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operator here checks the left-most expression, finds it false, but continues to evaluate the next expression.
It finds that the next expression returns true, stops, and returns a 1. 
Much how the &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator ceases when it finds an expression that returns false, the &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; operator ceases when it finds an expression that returns true.

It is worth noting that C does not have Boolean values (true and false) commonly found in other languages. It instead interprets a 0 as false, and any nonzero value as true.

=== Conditional operators ===

The ternary &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; operator is the conditional operator. The expression &lt;code&gt;(x ? y : z)&lt;/code&gt; has the value of &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is nonzero, &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.

Example:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;  
int x = 0;
int y;
y = (x ? 10:6);
&lt;/source&gt;
The expression &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 0. The ternary operator then looks for the &quot;if-false&quot; value, which in this case, is 6. It returns that, so &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is equal to six. Had &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; been a non-zero, then the expression would have returned a 10.

=== Assignment operators ===

The assignment operators are &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; . The &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; operator stores the value of the right operand into the location determined by the left operand, which must be an [[lvalue]]

For the others, &lt;code&gt;x op= y&lt;/code&gt; is shorthand for &lt;code&gt;x = x op (y)&lt;/code&gt; . Hence, the following expressions are  the same :
     1. x += y     -     x = x+y
     2. x -= y     -     x = x-y
     3. x *= y     -     x = x*y
     4. x /= y     -     x = x/y
     5. x %= y     -     x = x%y

=== Comma operator ===

The operator with the least precedence is the comma operator. The value of the expression &lt;code&gt;x, y&lt;/code&gt; will evaluate both &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, but provides the value of &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;.  

This operator is useful for including multiple actions in one statement (e.g. within a for loop conditional). 

Here are some small examples of the comma operator:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int i, x;      /* declares two ints, i and x, in one statement */

/* this loop initializes x and i to 0, then runs the loop */
for(x = 0, i = 0; i &lt;= 6; i++) {
    printf(&quot;x = %d, and i = %d\n&quot;, x, i);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, thanks for your interest.

My interest in Wikibooks is generally twofold:  I'd like to contribute by editing a Shakespeare play by adding glosses; and I'd like to publish my thinking about education.  Later I may want to do other things, but these are my interests here at the moment.

See my thoughts about glosses at [http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Study_Guide:Shakespeare Talk:Study_Guide:Shakespeare].

I've started editing Shakespeare's Sonnets.

If you'd like to know more about me, visit my web page: [http://www.angelfire.com/art/megathink Al's Web Page]

Thanks for stopping by.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Reddi. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Reddi~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:40, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

== The Internet ==

The World Wide Web is one of many Internet services. The Internet is a network of (computer) networks: hence the name. 

The Internet itself does not do much; it just provides the means to pass packets of digital data around the globe. In order to make sense of these packets, you need services: protocols (sets of rules) that tell you what a certain piece of data means, and computer programs (software) that allow access to data based on such protocols.

The web is one such service, as are e-mail, FTP, Kazaa, Instant Messaging, et cetera. All these services require particular programs that understand their protocols, although some programs can work with multiple services. For instance, a web browser may also be capable of downloading files from an FTP site or managing e-mail.

== The web ==

The web was created to make finding and exchanging documents across the Internet more transparent. Until the web came along, if you had a document to offer through the Internet (for instance, a scientific paper, or a list of jokes, or a recipe, or your curriculum vitae), you had to put it up on an FTP site, and then pass the address of that FTP site to someone else. 

With the web, you embedded the address into the page, instead of passing it around. More than that, you could hide the real address from view by wrapping it in descriptive text. Instead of typing in a bunch of numbers in your FTP client, and then moving from folder to folder until you stumbled on a file called ppr_john.ps, you could create a 'link' called &quot;John's paper on astroturf&quot; that would take you directly to the desired file.

Webpages are written in a very basic form of hypertext: if you activate a word, or a bunch of words, the Web Browser opens a new document for you to browse. By creating webpages that link to other webpages, you are helping to create a giant spider's web of interlinking webpages: the World Wide Web. Using a webbrowser, you can hop from webpage to webpage ('surfing').

In a sense, the web is pretty similar to the Internet that lies beneath it. However, where the Internet connects millions of computers in a web like manner, so does the web connect webpages.

Webpages, then, in general fulfil two roles: that of a document being linked to by other documents, and that of a document linking to other documents.

== Webpages ==

There are no measures of success for webpages. Any document may be of interest to a reader, and any document may link to interesting documents. You decide what you want to write about. 

However, you may have expectations of a target audience. If you write a web diary for far-away family, you would probably like the far-away family to 1) be able to read your webpages, and 2) want to read your webpages. Although in this particular example it is fairly easy to find out whether you succeeded (call up aunt Jeanne and ask her if she has read your diary), often it is not easy to define your target audience and to measure whether they successfully surfed your pages. Also, your diary may draw visitors that weren't part of the target audience.

Although writing for an audience is very important for several reasons, it is necessary to note at this point that a webpage is created because you want to say something. It is important to note this, because often people judge webpages on their form, rather than their message. Claims that a webpage is not pretty, or looks amateurish are beside the point if the message gets across. 

Form is important, but message is more important. A wrong form can block the message from coming across, and a right form can help clarify the message, but the message comes first.

Luckily, this distinction is sort of baked into to the web. It is easy to first create your story, then attach a useful typography to it afterwards.

=== Hypertext ===

Let us recap: webpages are documents. They are files on computers. When displayed in a browser, they form a simple form of hypertext. The definition of files and computers is outside the scope of this textbook, but hypertext needs to be explained before we can continue.

Hypertext is a form of text in which words or phrases can be 'activated'; depending on the word or phrase you chose, part or whole of the text changes. 

Probably the first description of the idea came in 1945, when Vannevar Bush wrote an article in The Atlantic Monthly called &quot;As We May Think,&quot; about a futuristic device he called a &quot;Memex&quot;. He described the device as electronically linked to a library and able to display books and films from the library, and further able to automatically follow references from these to the work referenced.

The Memex did more than offer linked information to a user though. It was a tool for establishing links as well as following them. 

HTML, the hypertext language for the web (literally: HyperText Mark-up Language), was designed by Tim Berners-Lee with much the similar goals in mind: to provide a way for scientists to create a huge library of their interlinked works, and to provide a way for the users of this library to change certain documents, for instance to annotate them or to add links. 

The latter part of Berners-Lee's dream never really materialized until the advent of the wiki-wiki web (of which this textbook is part). Anybody can change the contents of this textbook on its website.

Let us finish this sub-section with a metaphor: hypertext is to text what reality is to television. It adds an extra dimension to it; as a consequence, it is much more dynamic, it contains much more surprises. 

There seem to be people out there who prefer television over reality; the former is much more focused, much more well-defined. It is hard to get lost within the confines of television.

Similarly, a simple text is much easier to understand than hypertext. 

Where hypertext links to another document, the author needs to make clear what it links to. (The dreaded 'click here' is without a doubt the worst way to create a hyperlink, as it tells the user absolutely nothing about the linked document.)

Where a hypertext document is part of a larger whole (say, a website), it is often helpful to the users if they can find out which part of a larger whole it is. The document should link to a homepage. The homepage is a webpage that forms the safe spot of a website, where the user can find his bearings again if lost, and where the user finds information about the focus of the website. 

For instance, a homepage might say: &quot;This is the personal homepage of Clarence Wiley&quot;. This suggests to the visitor that a medley of pages will be found here, often of a personal nature, most likely created by Clarence, and at least of some value to Clarence.

Similarly, a webpage that is part of a website may try and make that clear to the visitor by using a uniform style. Since arriving at a uniform writing style is not always easy or convenient (think of a webpage with dozens of authors), other hints may be employed that tell visitors where they are. One of such hints is explained in the following chapter.

== Dangerous metaphors ==

In the previous part, we said that &quot;hypertext is to text what reality is to television&quot;. We used a comparison, because we know that it can often be useful to explain characteristics of the new and unknown by comparing them with similar characteristics of the old and known.

As such, metaphors can be a useful and powerful device. However, the new and unknown has traditionally suffered harshly from a heavy stamping of the metaphor on the subject. 

It is said by some that when television was invented, it took fifty years for the new medium to escape from being a stage in a box. Far into the twentieth century, television was made by aiming a camera at a stage (a 'set' in television and cinema terms) and just passing on to the viewer what went on. 

Oddly enough, the things that are possible on television, but not on stage, were already possible when the first consumer grade television sets were being produced: broadcasting with a time-delay (record now, broadcast later), editing a program, using unusual viewpoints, animation, overlaying images et cetera. Of course there were a few 'revolutionaries' who used these techniques, but in general the metaphor (television is like a stage) held the new medium captive.

Even today, news anchors can sit behind their desk clad in nothing but underwear below the waist, safe in the knowledge that the camera will never do anything the audience of a stage play wouldn't do.

Today, the web has been struck similarly hard by failing metaphors. Since the web is clearly tied to computers, a lot of people confuse authoring webpages with programming. And since a lot of web content was written from the start by people using graphical web browsers (contrary to popular belief, the first web browser displayed images and used an early form of style sheets [http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb]), designing a web page is often primarily considered a graphical design task.

=== False metaphor #1: programming ===

Programming is the art of creating a computer program. A computer program is something that tells the computer what to do. Usually, a computer program is a list of instructions. For instance, a computer programmer can write a program that tells the computer to open a window on a screen, and display a large, bold text in the top-left corner. 

A hypertext document can be implemented as a computer program. A modern day example of programming hypertext would be PDF, the Adobe originated format for distributing print documents across computer networks and to printers. However, HTML, the hypertext language for the web, is not a programming language. Instead, it is a mark-up language: it allows one to mark-up the structure of a document. (You may want to revisit this section later, once you have 'marked up' a few webpages yourself.) In other words, it is a way to tell a computer what a document is, not what it should do with it.

Viewing HTML as a programming language means that you view its constructs, its labels, its mark-up, as instructions to the browser. For instance, you may want to indicate that a particular piece of text should be printed in large and bold letters. You could use the HTML code for headings for this, because most graphical browsers will display a heading as large, bold text. However, you may get visitors with browsers who don't display a heading as large bold text. That's the moment when the trap of the false metaphor closes around you.

=== False metaphor #2: web authoring as graphical design ===

To view the web as a graphical medium is a much more insidious problem, because it is largely a correct view. Most webpages are browsed through a graphical browser. On such occasions, the graphical design of a webpage can have a decisive influence on how well the content of that page is perceived and received by the visitor.

The problem lies not so much in seeing the web as a graphical medium, but in our assumptions on what graphical medium means. Since webpages are often displayed on computer screen, web page authors often design a lay-out grid with certain dimensions. Not everybody may be using the same dimensions though, and visitors are hardly ever willing to change the dimensions of their windowing system to accommodate the wishes of a web site's author.

The web can be displayed on a vast array of devices, some of which are not graphical in nature at all: think of speaking browsers, or touch browser (Braille rules for the blind). You need to adjust your assumptions on what a graphical medium means to write successful and accessible webpages.

=== Other, less damaging metaphors ===

It is clear that when we wish to see the web in the light of another, better-understood invention, we need to do this with care, and clearly delineating the limits of our comparisons.

I would like to propose a few metaphors that are just as useful as the ones before, but that have less potential for damage.

The media that are perhaps the most natural candidates for comparing the web too are unsurprisingly other Internet services. They all share with each other that they provide a way for people to talk directly to other people without intervention of middlemen such as editors and publishers. This possibility for direct contact stems from the underlying low-level protocols of the Internet. On the Internet, every computer can talk to any other computer.

Other systems for sharing information in the free-form manner the web allows, are abundant in real life. Just try and imagine all the possibilities you have when you want to announce a neighbourhood party to strangers, or when you want to share your daily troubles with relative strangers; letter pages, bulletin boards, pen pal magazines etcetera spring to mind.

== Conclusion ==

The important idea to take away from this chapter is that the web is a way of sharing information. There is nothing wrong with running programs on the web, or with presenting graphical design on it. As a matter fact, these are well understood and accepted uses of the web. What you should make a distinction between, though, is the web as a way to present information, and the form and shape that information takes.

Your need to share --&gt; Your way of sharing it --&gt; An audience.

== Questions and Exercises ==

1. Collect examples of typical webpages. How do they fit into the web? Which role do they play?

2. Find a webpage, any webpage; try and make a list of all possible audiences, and how they would experience the page. Would they find the information they were looking for? Which information would they not be able to find? Would they have an easy way of finding more information through hyperlinks? 

If you follow this course as part of a class, let the teacher pick a webpage and see how many different audiences the students can come up with. 

If you follow this course by yourself, you could go to http://www.google.com and enter a random word in its search box, then activate the &quot;I'm Feeling Lucky&quot; link. I find that the names of kitchen things often make great 'random' words ('ladle', 'cinnamon', 'fridge', 'stove' etcetera).

3. Try and view a webpage using a non-graphical browser, or a browser such as Opera with all graphics capabilities switched off. If this exercise is done as part of a class, form duos: let one student face away, let the other read out what's going on in the web page. Let the student who cannot read the webpage give surfing instructions and see how hard or easy it is the surf the website.

4. Try and think of a subject you would like to create a webpage or a website about. Go to a search engine (go online) and try and find webpages about this or similar subjects. For instance, if you would like to create a website for your football club, try and find the websites of other local and internationally famous clubs. According to your personal taste and opinions, what have the authors of these sites done right? What have they done wrong?

==Mathematical Picture of the Month==
We use the traditional for this page definition of a month as ''one twelfth of the orbital period'', where the planet in question is unspecified.

[[File:Juliasetsdkpictlightpot.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Julia set coloured using the distance to the set potential function + lighting effect]]
{{clear}}

Picture is from [[Pictures of Julia and Mandelbrot Sets]].  The mathematically interesting point about the picture is the smooth colouring, based on distance to the set, rather than the more usual banding of colour based on number of iterations before leaving the unit circle.  The distance is converted to a height, which then makes a 3D surface that can be lit.


Selected as ''Mathematical picture of the month'' from Jan 16th 2011.


== Things to do ==
Want to help with an existing mathematics text? 

There are mathematics books at every level from [[Wikijunior:Numbers from 1 to 20|preschool]] to [[Introduction to Rings and Algebras|Graduate Level]] and there is room for anyone to help, no matter your mathematics background.  Here are some ideas how you can get involved: 
* You can [[Help:Stub|expand on stubs]].  Mathematics pages will appear in [[:CAT:Mathematics stubs|Mathematics stubs]], or in [[:CAT:Stubs|Stubs]]
* Look at [[Special:RecentChanges|Recent Changes]] to see which mathematics books are being actively worked on and who by, and get involved.
* [[WB:WikiProject Languages|WikiProject Languages]] templated the Language pages with {{tlx|WikiProject Languages}}, perhaps we should consider making a similar template and implementing it.


==Active Books==
=== Book Merging and Splitting ===
Current thinking on how content should be split between books:
* Work has been done to combine two [[Algebra]] books that were at the same level and covered similar material.
* [[High School Trigonometry|High School Trigonometry]] is a wikibooks compatible licensed version of a Californian textbook.  It is not being merged with [[Trigonometry]] whose origins pre-date it.  
::One of the reasons is that the pedagogical approach is different.  [[Trigonometry]] explains how to remember formulas, check them, relate them and think about them - making memorisation easier.  Similarly through puzzle-like examples it shows how proofs can break down, explains how someone could arrive at a proof and gives alternative proofs, rather than present proofs as things to be rote learned.  It also has pedagogical innovations such as links to video.
* [[Trigonometry]] is a three volume book, currently all in one name space.  It is being split for different levels.  In particular algebra is done step by step in book one. 
* [[Modular Arithmetic]] is a subset of number theory.  The book is intended as a monograph, and is unlikely to be merged into a larger number theory book any time soon.

== Typesetting ==
There are several guides to help provide information of how to typeset mathematics, they are the following:
*[[Help:Formulas]]
Keep in mind that there is no correct choice of how to typeset mathematics on a Wikibook.  The goal should be consistency both within an individual module, and within the modules of a given book.  It is a good rule of thumb to take a look at how typesetting is done in a particular book when you start to edit it and to try to emulate that style.  This should hopefully give the readers a consistent presentation.  

Consider using \displaystyle on all formulas, even when in line in text.  That way the shape and appearance of symbols will be consistent across the html and the set off text.  Without this there can be confusions when the same symbol looks different in the two forms.

===Some LaTeX to Plunder===

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{C} \text{  defined as  } f:(x,y)\mapsto x+iy&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}x^{n-k}y^k.&lt;/math&gt;

==Images==

The best way to upload files is to upload them to [http://commons.wikimedia.org Commons], which transparently makes the files available in all of the Wikimedia projects. 

You can also browse that repository by category and by search term, and there are many useful images already there.  It is also possible to go to a related wikipedia page for a topic, follow the images to wikicommons, then look for other images in the same category or by the same uploader.

===Vector images===
There is a strong preference on Wikimedia for [[SVG]] graphics files.
 
Programs that can output graphics in svg format :
* [[Gnuplot]] (A general mathematical plotting program)
:: [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] can give information on producing animated graphs.
* [[Inkscape]] (An svg image editor)
::The current stable version of inkscape has problems reading svg graphs produced by Gnuplot.  A good width for lines in geometric figures is 1.7px.  A good font to use is Lucida Bright.  Greek letters like 'alpha' can be inserted by cutting and pasting from Word.  Fonts should be converted to paths in case not present on user's machine, even though it makes i8ln harder.  Check svg images in firefox before uploading.  If you see unwanted black regions it is because of 'rotated text' tags that are Inkscape specific.  If you've converted the text to paths the rotated text tags can be removed (use the XML editor feature) to fix this problem. Many geometric images, especially of tiling and subdivision, look a lot better with solid fill of pastel colours.
* Octave (Which actually calls gnuplot.)
* [[Maxima | Maxima CAS]] (Which can call gnuplot, but also other programs like VTK )
* [http://zirkel.sourceforge.net/ C.a.R (Compass and Ruler)] (produces fixed-scale graphs)

Note that one can also [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/SVG#Own_programs|directly create SVG file]].

===Image Requests===

If you need a diagram to illustrate a mathematical text, describe what you need here.  The mathematical project has recently been producing diagrams for geometry (for the trigonometry book) and even fake road signs to help teach mathematical concepts.

Resonance is where the reactance of capacitors and inductors cancel at a specific frequency.
:&lt;math&gt;Z_C = Z_L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{j\omega C} = j\omega L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

This frequency is called Resonance Frequency usually, denoted as &lt;math&gt;\omega_o = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Differential geometry''' studies geometry by considering differentiable paramaterizations of curves, surfaces, and higher dimensional objects. Prerequisites include vector calculus, linear algebra, analysis, and topology. 

One goal of differential geometry is to classify and represent differentiable curves in ways which are independent of their paramaterization. For example consider the curve represented by &lt;math&gt;y=3x&lt;/math&gt;. Although &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(t,3t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(3t,9t)&lt;/math&gt; are different paramterizations, they both represent the same curve. More generally, we consider the slope of the curve
&lt;math&gt;3=\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{dt}\cdot\frac{1}{\frac{dx}{dt}}=\frac{3}{1}&lt;/math&gt;.

We call this type of curve a line. We can even rotate, and move it around, but it is still a line. The goal of Differential Geometry will be to similarly classify, and understand classes of differentiable curves, which may have different paramaterizations, but are still the same curve. 

By adding sufficient dimensions, any equation can become a curve in geometry. Therefore, the ability to discern when two curves are unique also has the potential for applications in distinguishing information from noise. There may be multiple ways of receiving the same information--in different paramterizations, but we want to distinguish if the information is actually unique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A matrix may be more popularly known as a giant computer simulation, but in mathematics it is a totally different thing. To be more precise, a matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular array of numbers. For example, below is a typical way to write a matrix, with numbers arranged in rows and columns and with round brackets around the numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 5&amp;10&amp;20 \\
1&amp;-3&amp;-5&amp;9\\
3&amp;-1&amp;-1&amp;-1\\
3&amp;2&amp;4&amp;-5
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The above matrix has 4 rows and 4 columns, so we call it a 4 &amp;times; 4 (4 by 4) matrix. Also, we can have matrices of many different shapes. The ''shape'' of a matrix is the name for the dimensions of the matrix (''m'' by ''n'', where ''m'' is the number of rows and ''n'' the number of columns). Here are some more examples of matrices:

This is an example of a 3 &amp;times; 3 matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;3\\
4&amp;5&amp;6\\
7&amp;8&amp;9\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is an example of a 5 &amp;times; 4 matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;b&amp;c&amp;d\\
h&amp;g&amp;f&amp;e\\
i&amp;j&amp;k&amp;l\\
p&amp;o&amp;n&amp;m\\
q&amp;r&amp;s&amp;t\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is an example of a 1 &amp;times; 6 matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;5&amp;6\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The theory of matrices is intimately connected with that of (linear) simultaneous equations. The ancient Chinese had established a systematic way to solve simultaneous equations. The theory of simultaneous equations was furthered in the east by the Japanese mathematician, Seki and a little later by Leibniz, Newton's greatest rival. Later, Gauss (1777 - 1855), one of the three giants of modern mathematics, popularised the use of Gaussian elimination, which is a simple step by step algorithm for solving any number of linear simultaneous equations. By then the use of matrices to represent simultaneous equation neatly on paper (as discussed above) had become quite common&lt;sup&gt;[http://ualr.edu/lasmoller/matrices.html 1]&lt;/sup&gt;.

Consider the simultaneous equations:
:&lt;math&gt;x + y = 10&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x - y = 4&lt;/math&gt;
it has the solution ''x'' = 7 and ''y'' = 3, and the usual way to solve it is to add the two equations together to eliminate the ''y''. Matrix theory offers us another way to solve the above simultaneous equations via matrix ''multiplication'' (covered below). We will study the widely accepted way to ''multiply'' two matrices together. In theory with ''matrix multiplication'' we can solve any number of simultaneous equations, but we shall mainly restrict our attention to 2 &amp;times; 2 matrices. But even with that restriction, we have opened up doors to topics simultaneous equations could never offer us. Two such examples are
# using matrices to solve linear recurrence relations which can be used to model population growth, and 
# encrypting messages with matrices.

We shall commence our study by learning some of the more fundamental concepts of matrices. Once we have a firm grasp of the basics, we shall move on to study the real meat of this chapter, matrix multiplication.

=== Elements ===
An element of a matrix is a particular number inside the matrix, and it is uniquely located with a pair of numbers. E.g. let the following matrix be denoted by ''A'', or symbolically:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;3\\
4&amp;5&amp;6\\
7&amp;8&amp;9\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
the (2,2)th entry of ''A'' is 5; the (1,1)th entry of ''A'' is 1, the (3,3) entry of ''A'' is 9 and the (3,2)th entry of ''A'' is 8. The (''i'' , ''j'')th entry of A is usually denoted ''a''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; and the (''i'' , ''j'')th entry of a matrix ''B'' is usually denoted by ''b''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; and so on.

=== Summary ===
* A matrix is an array of numbers
* A ''m''&amp;times;''n'' matrix has ''m'' rows and ''n'' columns
* The ''shape'' of a matrix is determined by its number of rows and columns
* The (''i'',''j'')th element of a matrix is located in ''i''th row and ''j''th column

=== Matrix addition &amp; Multiplication by a scalar ===
Matrices can be added together. But only the matrices of the same ''shape'' can be added. This is very natural. E.g.
:&lt;math&gt;
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;3\\
4&amp;5&amp;6\\
7&amp;8&amp;9\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
B = 
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;9&amp;8\\
0&amp;-1&amp;8\\
4&amp;6&amp;7\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;
A + B = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;3\\
4&amp;5&amp;6\\
7&amp;8&amp;9\\
\end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;9&amp;8\\
0&amp;-1&amp;8\\
4&amp;6&amp;7\\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1+2&amp;2+9&amp;3+8\\
4+0&amp;5+(-1)&amp;6+8\\
7+4&amp;8+6&amp;9+7\\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;11&amp;11\\
4&amp;4&amp;14\\
11&amp;14&amp;16\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly matrices can be multiplied by a number. We call the number a ''scalar'' to distinguish it from a matrix. The reader need not worry about the definition here, just remember that a ''scalar'' is simply a number.
:&lt;math&gt;
5A = A + A + A + A + A =
5\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;3\\
4&amp;5&amp;6\\
7&amp;8&amp;9\\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
5&amp;10&amp;15\\
20&amp;25&amp;30\\
35&amp;40&amp;45\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
in this case the scalar value is 5. In general, when we do ''s'' &amp;times; ''A'' , where ''s'' is a scalar and ''A'' a matrix, we multiply each entry of ''A'' by ''s''.

== Matrix Multiplication ==
The widely accepted way to multiply two matrices together is definitely non-intuitive. As mentioned above, multiplication can help with solving simultaneous equations. We will now give a brief outline of how this can be done. Firstly, any system of linear simultaneous equations can be written as a matrix of coefficients multiplied by a matrix of unknowns equaling a matrix of results. This description may sound a little complicated, but in symbolic form it is quite clear. The previous statement simply says that if ''A'', ''x'' and ''b'' are matrices, then ''Ax'' = ''b'', can be used to represent some system of simultaneous equations. The beautiful thing about matrix multiplications is that some matrices can have multiplicative inverses, that is we can multiply both sides of the equation by ''A''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to get ''x'' = ''A''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;''b'', which effectively solves the simultaneous equations.

The reader will surely come to understand matrix multiplication better as this chapter progresses. For now we should consider the simplest case of matrix multiplication, multiplying ''vectors''. We will see a few examples and then we will explain process of multiplication
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}

A_{2\times 1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
2\\
9\\
\end{pmatrix}
&amp; , &amp;
B_{1\times 2} =
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 5
\end{pmatrix}

\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

then
:&lt;math&gt;
B_{1\times 2} \times A_{2\times 1}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
3 &amp; 5
\end{pmatrix}
\times
\begin{pmatrix}
2\\
9\\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
(3 \times 2) + (5 \times 9)
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
51
\end{pmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly if:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix}

A_{3\times 1} = \begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 2\\ 3\end{pmatrix}
&amp; , &amp;
B_{1\times 3} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\end{pmatrix}

\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

then
:&lt;math&gt;
B_{1\times 3} \times A_{3\times 1}=
\begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp; 5 &amp;6 \end{pmatrix}
\times
\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\3\\\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}(4 \times 1) + (5 \times 2) + (6 \times 3)\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
32
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

A matrix with just one row is called a ''row vector'', similarly a matrix with just one column is called a ''column vector''. When we multiply a row vector ''A'', with a column vector ''B'', we multiply the element in the first column of ''A'' by the element in the first row of ''B'' and add to that the product of the second column of ''A'' and second row of ''B'' and so on. More generally we multiply a&lt;sub&gt;1,i&lt;/sub&gt; by b&lt;sub&gt;i,1&lt;/sub&gt; (where ''i'' ranges from 1 to n, the number of rows/columns) and sum up all of the products. Symbolically:

: &lt;math&gt; A_{1\times n} \times B_{n\times 1} = (\sum_{i=1}^na_{1,i}\times b_{i,1} )&lt;/math&gt; (for information on the &lt;math&gt;\sum&lt;/math&gt; sign, see [[ HSE_Summation_Sign | Summation_Sign]])
:where ''n'' is the number of rows/columns.

: In words: the product of a column vector and a row vector is the sum of the product of item 1,''i'' from the row vector and ''i'',1 from the column vector where ''i'' is from 1 to the width/height of these vectors.

'''Note:''' The product of matrices is also a matrix. The product of a row vector and column vector is a 1 by 1 matrix, not a scalar.

=== Exercises ===
Multiply:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{8}&amp;9\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}16\\2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}d\\e\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}6 + 6b&amp;3 - b\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;abc\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}a\\0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multiplication of non-vector matrices===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;A_{m \times n}B_{n \times p} = C_{m \times p}&lt;/math&gt; where ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are matrices.
We multiply the ''i''th row of ''A'' with the ''j''th column of ''B'' as if they are vector-matrices. The resulting number is the (''i'',''j'')th element of ''C''. Symbolically:
:&lt;math&gt;c_{i,j} = \sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{i,k}\times b_{k,j}&lt;/math&gt;

''' Example 1 '''

Evaluate ''AB'' = ''C'' and ''BA'= ''D'', where
:&lt;math&gt; A =
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;2\\
5&amp;6\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; B =
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;6\\
8&amp;7\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''
:&lt;math&gt;c_{1,1} = \begin{pmatrix} 3&amp;2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}2\\ 8\end{pmatrix} = (3\times 2 + 2\times 8) = 22&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{1,2} = \begin{pmatrix} 3&amp;2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}6\\ 7\end{pmatrix} = (3\times 6 + 2\times 7) = 32&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{2,1} = \begin{pmatrix} 5&amp;6 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}2\\ 8\end{pmatrix} = (5\times 2 + 6\times 8) = 58&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{2,2} = \begin{pmatrix} 5&amp;6 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}6\\ 7\end{pmatrix} = (5\times 6 + 6\times 7) = 72&lt;/math&gt;
i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;C =
\begin{pmatrix} 22&amp;32\\58&amp;72 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 4 '''
Evaluate the following multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}

''' Solution '''

Note that:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a 2 by 1 matrix and 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
c&amp;d\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a 1 by 2 matrix. So the multiplication makes sense and the product should be a 2 by 2 matrix. 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
c&amp;d\\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
ac&amp;ad\\

''' Solution '''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;0\\
0&amp;b
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
c&amp;0\\
0&amp;d
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
ac&amp;0\\
0&amp;bd
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 7 '''
Evaluate the following multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note''' Multiplication of matrices is generally not commutative, i.e. generally ''AB'' &amp;ne; ''BA''.

==== Diagonal matrices ====
A diagonal matrix is a matrix with zero entries everywhere except possibly down the diagonal. Multiplying diagonal matrices is really convenient, as you need only to multiply the diagonal entries together. 

'''Examples'''

The following are all diagonal matrices
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;0\\
0&amp;b
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
c&amp;0\\
0&amp;d
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0\\
0&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;c&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Example 1 '''
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;0\\
0&amp;b
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
e&amp;0\\
0&amp;f
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
h&amp;0\\
0&amp;i\\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
aeh&amp;0\\
0&amp;bfi\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Example 2 '''
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;0\\
0&amp;b
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;0\\
0&amp;b
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;0\\
0&amp;b
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
a^3&amp;0\\
0&amp;b^3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The above examples show that if ''D'' is a diagonal matrix then ''D''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; is very easy to compute, all we need to do is to take the diagonal entries to the ''k''th power. This will be an extremely useful fact later on, when we learn how to compute the ''n''th Fibonacci number using matrices.

=== Exercises ===
1. State the dimensions of ''C''
:a) ''C'' = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&amp;times;p&lt;/sub&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;p&amp;times;m&lt;/sub&gt;
:b) &lt;math&gt;C = 
\begin{pmatrix}
10^{10}&amp;20\\
5000&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4\\
2&amp;5&amp;6&amp;6
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

2. Evaluate. Please note that in matrix multiplication (''AB'')''C'' = ''A''(''BC'') i.e. the order in which you do the multiplications does not matter (proved later).
:a)
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
0&amp;1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
0&amp;1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
0&amp;1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
1\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:b)
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;1\\
2&amp;8\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
0&amp;2\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
0&amp;1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
1\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

3. Performing the following multiplications:
:&lt;math&gt;
C = \begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2\\
4&amp;5
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0\\
0&amp;1\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
D = \begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0\\
0&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;2\\
4&amp;5\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
What do you notice?

== The Identity &amp; multiplication laws ==
The exercise above showed us that the matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0\\
0&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a very special. It is called the 2 by 2 identity matrix. An identity matrix is a ''square'' matrix, whose diagonal entries are 1's and all other entries are zero. The identity matrix, ''I'', has the following very special properties
# &lt;math&gt;A \times I = A&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;I \times A = A&lt;/math&gt;
for all matrices ''A''. We don't usually specify the ''shape'' of the identity because it's obvious from the context, and in this chapter we will only deal with the 2 by 2 identity matrix. In the real number system, the number 1 satisfies: r &amp;times; 1 = r = 1 &amp;times; r, so it's clear that the identity matrix is analogous to &quot;1&quot;.

'''Associativity, distributivity and (non)-commutativity'''

Matrix multiplication is a great deal different to the multiplication we know from multiplying real numbers. So it is comforting to know that many of the laws the real numbers satisfy also carries over to the matrix world. But with one '''big''' exception, in general ''AB'' &amp;ne; ''BA''.

Let ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' be matrices. ''Associativity'' means
:(''AB'')''C'' = ''A''(''BC'')
i.e. the order in which you multiply the matrices is unimportant, because the final result you get is the same regardless of the order which you do the multiplications.

On the other hand, ''distributivity'' means
:''A''(''B'' + ''C'') = ''AB'' + ''AC''
and
:(''A'' + ''B'')''C'' = ''AC'' + ''BC''

'''Note:''' The commutative property of the real numbers (i.e. ab = ba), does not carry over to the matrix world.

''' Convince yourself '''

For all 2 by 2 matrices ''A'', ''B'' and ''C''. And ''I'' the identity matrix.

1. Convince yourself that in the 2 by 2 case:
:''A''(''B'' + ''C'') = ''AB'' + ''AC''
and
:(''A'' + ''B'')''C'' = ''AC'' + ''BC''

2. Convince yourself that in the 2 by 2 case:
:''A''(''BC'') = (''AB'')''C''

3. Convince yourself that:
:&lt;math&gt;AB\ne BA&lt;/math&gt;
in general. When does ''AB'' = ''BA''? Name at least one case.

Note that all of the above are true for all matrices (of any dimension/shape).

== Determinant and Inverses==
We shall consider the simultaneous equations:
:''ax'' + ''by'' = &amp;alpha; (1)
:''cx'' + ''dy'' = &amp;beta; (2)
where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', &amp;alpha; and &amp;beta; are constants. We want to determine the necessary conditions for (1) and (2) to have a ''unique'' solution for ''x'' and ''y''. We proceed:
:Let (1') = (1) &amp;times; ''c''
:Let (2') = (2) &amp;times; ''a''
i.e.
:''acx'' + ''bcy'' = ''c''&amp;alpha; (1')
:''acx'' + ''ady'' = ''a''&amp;beta; (2')
Now
:let (3) = (2') - (1')
:(''ad'' - ''bc'')''y'' = ''a''&amp;beta; - ''c''&amp;alpha; (3)
Now ''y'' can be uniquely determined if and only if (''ad'' - ''bc'') &amp;ne; 0. So the necessary condition for (1) and (2) to have a unique solution depends on all four of the coefficients of ''x'' and ''y''. We call this number (''ad'' - ''bc'') the ''determinant'', because it tells us whether there is a unique solution to two simultaneous equations of 2 variables.
In summary
:if (''ad'' - ''bc'') = 0 then there is ''no unique'' solution
:if (''ad'' - ''bc'') &amp;ne; 0 then there ''is'' a ''unique'' solution.

'''Note:''' ''Unique'', we can not emphasise this word enough. If the determinant is zero, it doesn't necessarily mean that there is no solution to the simultaneous equations! Consider:
:''x'' + ''y'' = 2
:7''x'' + 7''y'' = 14
the above set of equations has determinant zero, but there is obviously a solution, namely ''x'' = ''y'' = 1. In fact there are infiinitely many solutions! On the other hand consider also:
:''x'' + ''y'' = 1
:''x'' + ''y'' = 2
this set of equations has determinant zero, and there is no solution at all. So if determinant is zero then there is either no solution or infinitely many solutions.

''' Determinant of a matrix '''
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
We define the determinant of a 2 &amp;times; 2 matrix 
:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;b\\
c&amp;d
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
to be
:&lt;math&gt;\det (A) = ad - bc \!&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Inverses ===
It is perhaps, at this stage, not very clear what the use is of the det(A). But it's intimately connected with the idea of an inverse. Consider in the real number system a number ''b'', it has (multiplicative) inverse 1/''b'', i.e. ''b''(1/''b'') = (1/''b'')''b'' = 1. We know that 1/''b'' does not exist when ''b'' = 0. 

In the world of matrices, a matrix ''A'' may or may not have an inverse depending on the value of the determinant det(A)! How is this so? Let's suppose ''A'' (known) does have an inverse ''B'' (i.e. ''AB'' = ''I'' = ''BA''). So we aim to find ''B''. Let's suppose further that
:&lt;math&gt;A
= \begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;b\\
c&amp;d
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;B
= \begin{pmatrix}
w&amp;x\\
y&amp;z
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
we need to solve four simultaneous equations to get the values of ''w'', ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in terms of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' and det(''A'').
:''aw'' + ''by'' = 1
:''cw'' + ''dy'' = 0
:''ax'' + ''bz'' = 0
:''cx'' + ''dz'' = 1
''the reader can try to solve the above by him/herself''. The required answer is
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\begin{pmatrix}
d&amp;-b\\
-c&amp;a
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
In here we assumed that ''A'' has an inverse, but this doesn't make sense if det(''A'') = 0, as we can not divide by zero. So ''A''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (the inverse of ''A'') exists if and only if det(''A'') &amp;ne; 0. 

'''Summary'''

If ''AB'' = ''BA'' = ''I'', then we say ''B'' is the inverse of ''A''. We denote the inverse of ''A'' by ''A''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The inverse of a 2 &amp;times; 2 matrix
:&lt;math&gt;A =
\begin{pmatrix}
a&amp;b\\
c&amp;d
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is 
:&lt;math&gt;A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\begin{pmatrix}
d&amp;-b\\
-c&amp;a
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
provided the determinant of ''A'' is not zero.

=== Solving simultaneous equations ===
Suppose we are to solve:
:''ax'' + ''by'' = &amp;alpha;
:''cx'' + ''dy'' = &amp;beta;
We let
:&lt;math&gt; A = \begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\c&amp;d\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; w = \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \begin{pmatrix}\alpha\\ \beta\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
we can translate it into matrix form
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\c&amp;d\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\alpha\\ \beta\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
i.e
:&lt;math&gt; Aw = \gamma&lt;/math&gt;
If ''A'''s determinant is not zero, then we can pre-multiply both sides by ''A''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (the inverse of ''A'')
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
A^{-1}Aw &amp;=&amp; A^{-1}\gamma\\
Iw &amp;=&amp; A^{-1}\gamma\\
w &amp;=&amp; A^{-1}\gamma\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{pmatrix}d&amp;-b\\-c&amp;a\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\alpha\\ \beta\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which implies that ''x'' and ''y'' are unique.

We would like to spread the word though Paprika is great with almost everything!

== sour cream? ==

I make something similar, chicken paprikash, which has a sour cream, paprika, and onion sauce. Here is the recipe:

http://www.recipesource.com/ethnic/europe/hungarian/00/rec0019.html
:&quot;Chicken paprikash&quot; and &quot;paprika chicken&quot; are exactly the same thing, which Hungarians call &quot;paprikás csirke&quot;.

==problems==

If you follow this recipe as given you'll end up with a scorched mess which you'll have to throw away. It should have some chicken stock or water added in which to simmer the meat and vegetables until they're cooked, otherwise the paprika and veggies will burn and the chicken will be dry and undercooked in places.
[[User:motterj|motterj]]


True...and also, regarding the sour cream question....authentic Chicken Paprikas is indeed finished in the last minute or two of cooking with sour cream and sometimes (optionally) a little bit of white &quot;rantas&quot; (roux) if you like a slightly thiker sauce (just don't overdo the thickening).  
Some folks use tomato as well and some don't but most Hungarians agree that if you leave out the sour cream, you haven't really made chicken paprikas.  Period.  It is essential to the dish.
[[User:AnonymousHunkie|AnonymousHunkie]]

==No problem==

True. Let's make this recipe work.

==Transistor ==
A transistor is a solid state device made by joining three positive-type and negative-type semiconductors together. In general, all transistors have three pins: base, collector, and emitter. Transistor is a bi-polar device that is a transistor with two junctions namely BE and CE DE EE FE. In theory we take a specified formulae incorporate this with using any type of meter in figuring the mathematical solution.
:[[File:Electronic_component_transistors.jpg|200px]]

=== Construction ===
A lightly doped region called base is sandwiched between two regions called the emitter and collector respectively. The collector handles large quantities of current, hence its dopant concentration is the highest. The emitter's dopant concentration is slightly lesser, but its area is larger to provide for more current than the collector. The collector region should be heavily doped because electron-hole pairs recombine in that region, while the emitter is not such a region. We can have two varieties in this kind of transistor. 

===NPN Transistor ===
An NPN transistor is made by joining one positive-type semiconductor in between two negative-type semiconductors. Here a lightly doped p-type semiconductor (semiconductor with more holes than electrons) is sandwiched between two well-doped n-type regions. It is like two pn-junctions facing away. An IEEE symbol for the NPN transistor is shown here. The arrow between the base and emitter is in the same direction as current flowing between the base-emitter junction. Power dissipated in the transistor is
:&lt;math&gt;P=V_{CE}I_C&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V_{CE}&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage between the collector and the emitter and &lt;math&gt;I_C&lt;/math&gt; is the collector current.

::[[File:BJT_symbol_NPN.svg|50px]]

===PNP Transistor===
A PNP transistor is made by sandwiching a negative-type semiconductor in between two positive-type semiconductors.
: [[File:PNP_BJT.svg|300px]]
::[[File:BJT_symbol_PNP.svg|50px]]

==Transistor Operation==
===Amplifier===
A transistor conducts current when the base voltage is greater than BE junction's voltage. Current is non zero.
: &lt;math&gt;I_B \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_C = \alpha I_E&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_C = \beta I_B&lt;/math&gt;

===Switch===
A transistor conducts current when the base voltage is greater than BE junction's voltage. Current is non zero. This corresponds to a closed switch. A transistor does not conduct current when the base voltage is less than BE junction's voltage. Current is zero. This correspond to an open switch.

I have put my declaration of intent in the Rationale in the book's first pages (after the table of contents). This is a book about authoring, not about designing or programming. Some coding should be discussed (specifically, HTML mark-up and CSS coding), and the consequences of graphical design and typography will also be treated, though in optional chapters (you don't need to be able to see to create a webpage).

My weaknesses are in the didactic and linguistic realms: I am not a teacher, nor am I a native speaker of English. 

I request that you will let me finish the main text of this more or less uninterupted, so that the unity of my message remains at least until the first draft of the work is finished. After that, I would be honoured if people took this work apart.[[User:Branko|Branko]] 22:20, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)

''Thank you for starting this book. It looks good so far.''
''I posted the &quot;merge&quot; notice, but now that I look closer, I think this might be different enough in emphasis to be worth keeping as 2 books -- perhaps [[Web Design]] should be the sequel to [[Authoring Webpages]] ?''
''--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:41, 8 November 2005 (UTC)''

I agree that this should NOT be merged with [[Web Design]]; if anything, I started this as the anti-dote to books that treat web authoring like it is a graphic design or programming discipline. 

I stopped working on this a while ago, not because I lost interest, but because I lost my idea of how to proceed. A lot of what I wrote here is in the subconscious of many a web expert, but little of it was ever put in words and collected in one place.

The thing with books, even if they are collaberately produced, is that they still need a single vision. A merge with the book you mentioned would probably blur that vision too much.

I have got a question for you. I wanted to work on this book until it had a modicum of editability, and only then link to it from other wikibooks pages. Do you think that is the right approach, or should I make it public earlier? Thanks for your insights.--[[User:Branko|Branko]] 17:57, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

[[Image:LCR_diagram.png|Figure 1: RCL circuit]]&lt;br&gt;''Figure 1: RCL circuit''
&lt;/center&gt;

When the switch is closed, a voltage step is applied to the RCL circuit.  Take the time the switch was closed to be 0s such that the voltage before the switch was closed was 0 volts and the voltage after the switch was closed is a voltage V.  The voltage across the capacitor consists of a forced response &lt;math&gt;v_f&lt;/math&gt; and a natural response &lt;math&gt;v_n&lt;/math&gt; such that:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_c=v_f+v_n
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The forced response is due to the switch being closed, which is the voltage V for &lt;math&gt;t\ge0&lt;/math&gt;.  The natural response depends on the circuit values and is given below:

Define the pole frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; and the dampening factor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\alpha=\frac{R}{2L}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\omega_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Depending on the values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system can be characterized as:

1. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''overdamped'''.  The solution for the system has the form:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=A_1e^{\big(-\alpha+\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}\big)t}+A_2e^{\big(-\alpha-\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}\big)t}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

2. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''critically damped'''  The solution for the system has the form:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=Be^{-\alpha t}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

3. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''underdamped'''  The solution for the system has the form:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=e^{-\alpha t}\big[B_1\cos(\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2} t)+B_2\sin(\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2} t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

[[Electronics/RCL_time_domain1|How do you calculate these equations?]]


== Example: ==
Given the following values what is the response of the system when the switch is closed?

&lt;center&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| R || L || C || V
|-
| 1k&amp;Omega; || 0.5H || 100nF || 1V
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

First calculate the values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\alpha=\frac{R}{2L}=1000
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\omega_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\approx 4472
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

From these values note that &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt;.  The system is therefore '''underdamped'''.  The equation for the voltage across the capacitor is then:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_c(t)=1+e^{-1000t}\big[B_1\cos(4359t)+B_2\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Before the switch was closed assume that the capacitor was fully discharged.  This implies that v(t)=0 at the instant the switch was closed (t=0).  Substituting t=0 into the previous equation gives:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
0=1+B_1
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Therefore &lt;math&gt;B_1=-1&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly at the instant the switch is closed, the current in the inductor must be zero as the current can not instantly change.  Substituting the equation for &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; into the equation for the inductor and solving at the instant the switch was closed (t=0) gives:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
i(t)=\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}C
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
0=100\cdot10^{-9}\big[4359B_2-1000B_1 \big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Therefore &lt;math&gt;B_2\approx-0.229&lt;/math&gt;.  Once &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; is known, the voltage across the inductor and resistor (&lt;math&gt;V_{out}&lt;/math&gt;) is given by:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_{out}=e^{-1000t}\big[\cos(4359t)+0.229\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Inductor==
An inductor is a passive electronic component dependent on frequency used to store electric energy in the form of a magnetic field. An inductor has the symbol
:[[File:Inductor diagram.svg|200px]]

==Inductance==
Inductance is the characteristic of the Inductor to generates a magnetic field for a given current. Inductance has a letter symbol L and measured in units of Henry (H).
:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{B}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- (Please add any useful formulas listed here. Remember to include a full list of variables used. please do not prove these here - this page is heavy enough already. Feel free to create a new page for the Wikibook to do this.) --&gt;
&lt;!-- (Can someone sort this imperial unit thing out - everything should be in metric) --&gt;
This section list formulas for inductances in specific situations. Beware that some of the equations are in Imperial units. 

The permeability of free space, ''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', is constant and is defined to be exactly equal to 4''&amp;pi;''&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; H&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Basic inductance formula for a cylindrical coil===

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{\mu_0\mu_rN^2A}{l}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:: ''L'' = inductance / H
:: ''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = relative permeability of core material
:: ''N'' = number of turns
:: ''A'' = area of cross-section of the coil / m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:: ''l'' = length of coil / m

===The self-inductance of a straight, round wire in free space===

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{self} = \frac{\mu_0 b}{2 \pi}
\left[ \ln \left(\frac{b}{a}+\sqrt{1+\frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}}\right)
-\sqrt{1+\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}}+\frac{a}{b}+\frac{\mu_{r}}{4}
\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

:: ''L&lt;sub&gt;self&lt;/sub&gt;'' = self inductance / H(?)

:: ''b'' = wire length /m
:: ''a'' = wire radius /m
:: &lt;math&gt;\mu_r&lt;/math&gt; = relative permeability of wire

If you make the assumption that ''b'' &gt;&gt; ''a'' and that the wire is nonmagnetic (&lt;math&gt;\mu_r=1&lt;/math&gt;), then this equation can be approximated to

:&lt;math&gt;L_{self} = \frac{\mu_0 b}{2 \pi} \left[ \ln \left( \frac{2b}{a} \right) - 3/4 \right]&lt;/math&gt; (for low frequencies)

:&lt;math&gt;L_{self} = \frac{\mu_0 b}{2 \pi} \left[ \ln \left( \frac{2b}{a} \right) - 1 \right]&lt;/math&gt; (for high frequencies due to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect skin effect])
:: ''L'' = inductance / H
:: ''b'' = wire length / m
:: ''a'' = wire radius / m

The inductance of a straight wire is usually so small that it is neglected in most practical problems. If the problem deals with very high frequencies (''f'' &gt; 20 GHz), the calculation may become necessary. For the rest of this book, we will assume that this self-inductance is negligible.

===Inductance of a short air core cylindrical coil in terms of geometric parameters:===

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{r^2N^2}{9r+10l}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:: ''L'' = inductance in &amp;mu;H&lt;br&gt;
:: ''r'' = outer radius of coil in inches&lt;br&gt;
:: ''l'' = length of coil in inches&lt;br&gt;
:: ''N'' = number of turns&lt;br&gt;

===Multilayer air core coil===

:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{0.8r^2N^2}{6r+9l+10d}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:: ''L'' = inductance in &amp;mu;H&lt;br&gt;
:: ''r'' = mean radius of coil in inches&lt;br&gt;
:: ''l'' = physical length of coil winding in inches&lt;br&gt;
:: ''N'' = number of turns&lt;br&gt;
:: ''d'' = depth of coil in inches (i.e., outer radius minus inner radius)&lt;br&gt;

===Flat spiral air core coil===
:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{r^2N^2}{(2r+2.8d) \times 10^5}&lt;/math&gt;
:: ''L'' = inductance / H&lt;br&gt;
:: ''r'' = mean radius of coil / m&lt;br&gt;
:: ''N'' = number of turns&lt;br&gt;
:: ''d'' = depth of coil / m (i.e. outer radius minus inner radius)&lt;br&gt;

Hence a spiral coil with 8 turns at a mean radius of 25 mm and a depth of 10 mm would have an inductance of 5.13µH.

===Winding around a toroidal core (circular cross-section)===

:&lt;math&gt;L=\mu_0\mu_r\frac{N^2r^2}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

:: ''L'' = inductance / H&lt;br&gt;
:: ''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = relative permeability of core material&lt;br&gt;
:: ''N'' = number of turns&lt;br&gt;
:: ''r'' = radius of coil winding / m&lt;br&gt;
:: ''D'' = overall diameter of toroid / m&lt;br&gt;


===Quality of good inductor===
There are several important properties for an inductor that may need to be considered when choosing one for use in an electronic circuit. The following are the basic properties of a coil inductor. Other factors may be important for other kinds of inductor, but these are outside the scope of this article.

: Current carrying capacity is determined by wire thickness and resistivity.
: The quality factor, or Q-factor, describes the energy loss in an inductor due to imperfection in the manufacturing.
: The '''inductance''' of the coil is probably most important, as it is what makes the inductor useful. The inductance is the response of the inductor to a changing current.

The inductance is determined by several factors.

: Coil shape: short and squat is best
: Core material
: The number of turns in the coil. These must be in the same direction, or they will cancel out, and you will have a resistor.
: Coil diameter. The larger the diameter (core area) the larger the induction.

===Coil's Characteristics===
For a Coil that has the following dimension
: [[Image:Basic Inductor with B-field.svg|300px]]
: Area enclosed by each turn of the coil is ''A''
: Length of the coil is 'l'
: Number of turns in the coil is ''N''
: Permeability of the core is ''&amp;mu;''. ''&amp;mu;'' is given by the permeability of free space, ''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' multiplied by a factor, the relative permeability, ''&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''
: The current in the coil is 'i'

The magnetic flux density, ''B'', inside the coil is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;B=\frac{N \mu i}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

We know that the flux linkage in the coil, &amp;lambda;, is given by;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda=NBA \,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\frac{N^2A\mu}{l}i&lt;/math&gt;

The flux linkage in an inductor is therefore proportional to the current, assuming that ''A, N, l'' and ''&amp;mu;'' all stay constant. The constant of proportionality is given the name '''inductance''' (measured in Henries) and the symbol ''L'':

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda=Li \,&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the derivative with respect to time, we get:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \lambda}{dt}=L \frac{di}{dt} + i \frac{dL}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''L'' is time-invariant in nearly all cases, we can write:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \lambda}{dt}=L \frac{di}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, Faraday's Law of Induction states that:

::&lt;math&gt;-\mathcal{E}=N \frac{d \Phi}{dt}=\frac{d \lambda}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

We call &lt;math&gt;-\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; the electromotive force (emf) of the coil, and this is opposite to the voltage ''v'' across the inductor, giving:

::&lt;math&gt;v=L \frac{di}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the voltage across an inductor is equal to the rate of change of the current in the inductor multiplied by a factor, the inductance. note that for a constant current, the voltage is zero, and for an instantaneous change in current, the voltage is infinite (or rather, undefined). This applies only to ideal inductors which do not exist in the real world.

This equation implies that

* The voltage across an inductor is proportional to the derivative of the current through the inductor.
* In inductors, voltage leads current.
* Inductors have a high resistance to high frequencies, and a low resistance to low frequencies.  This property allows their use in filtering signals.

An inductor works by opposing current change. Whenever an electron is accelerated, some of the energy that goes into &quot;pushing&quot; that electron goes into the electron's kinetic energy, but much of that energy is stored in the magnetic field.
Later when that or some other electron is decelerated (or accelerated the opposite direction), energy is pulled back out of the magnetic field.

==Inductor and Direct Current Voltage (DC)==
When connect a Coil of several turns to an Electricity source in a closed loop . The current in the circuit set up a Magnetic Field that has the same properties like a Magnetic Field of a Magnet 
: B = L I 

When the current is turned off , the Magnetic Field does not exist . 
: B = 0

Conducting Coil is called  ElectroMagnet

==Inductor and Alternating Current Voltage (AC)==
===Inductor's Voltage===

:&lt;math&gt;v=L\frac{di}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

===Inductor's Current===

:&lt;math&gt; i = \frac{1}{L} \int V dt&lt;/math&gt;

===Reactance===
: &lt;math&gt;X_L = \omega L \angle 90 = j \omega L = sL&lt;/math&gt;

===Impedance===
: &lt;math&gt;R_L + X_L = R_L \angle 0 +  \omega L \angle 90 = R_L + j \omega L = R_L + sL&lt;/math&gt;

===Angle Difference Between Voltage and Current===
For Lossless Inductor 
: The angle difference between Voltage and Current is 90 

For Lossy Inductor
:&lt;math&gt;Tan \theta = \omega \frac{L}{R_L} = 2\pi f \frac{L}{R_L} =  \frac{2\pi}{t} \frac{L}{R_L}&lt;/math&gt;

Change the value of L and R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will change the value of Angle of Difference , Angular Frequency, requenct and Time
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{Tan\Theta} \frac{L}{R_L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi Tan \Theta} \frac{L}{R_L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{t}{2\pi Tan \Theta} \frac{L}{R_L}&lt;/math&gt;

===Time Constant===
: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{L}{R_L}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Quality factor ===
Quality factor denoted as Q is defined as the ability to store energy to the sum total of all energy losses within the component
:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{X}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Inductor's Connection==
===Series Connection===
:[[Image:Inductors in Series.svg]]
:&lt;math&gt;L_{eq}=L_1+L_2+\cdots+L_n&lt;/math&gt;

===Parallel Connection===
:[[Image:Inductors in Parallel.svg]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{L_{eq}}=\frac{1}{L_1}+\frac{1}{L_2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{L_n}&lt;/math&gt;

==LR Circuits==

An LR circuit has an inductor and a resistor.

When the circuit is turned on the inductor will initially oppose the flow of electrons and no current will flow.  Over time the inductor will stop opposing the current and will act as a short allowing current to flow unhindered.  

Once the current is shut off the inductor will oppose the decrease in current.
This only happens if there is a resistor to bleed off the current.

Originally people thought that radio waves propagate through the ether.

The ether was disproved by showing that it did not flow.

==Modulation and Mixing==

Put simply, modulation is the change of an electric signal based on the change in another signal. Another way to look at it practically, is the use of electric signals to carry information.

mixing is the addition and subtraction of signals.

Magic equation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;cos(x)cos(y) = \frac{cos(x - y) + cos(x + y)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Has strange effects on bandwidth and creates sidebands.

==CW (Continuous Wave)==
* morse code

==AM (Amplitude Modulation)==

simpler than FM. An AM receiver detects the power of the radio wave, and amplifies changes in the power measurement to drive a speaker or earphones.

AM radio. known as medium wave. started in the 1920s. has a long enough wavelength that it diffracts and follows the curvature of the earth traveling a great distance. lower audio fidelity. used for broadcasts. Affected by light and solar flares, and works better during the night. Clear channel stations are allowed to broadcast all the time, but other stations are only allowed to broadcast during the day.

* Crystal Radio: primitive radio consists of an antenna and a diode and a speaker in parallel.

===SSB (Single SideBand)===
AM with only one side band. carrier.The other one sideband block or can be use for other information tranmission.

==FM (Frequency Modulation)==
* '''VCO''' (Voltage Controlled Oscillator): Oscillator that is controlled by voltage.
In FM modulation, frequence of carrier signal vairy according to the audio frequency signal(Which is our actual signal).

==PM (Phase Modulation)==

Change phase by modifying capacitor and inductor values. Since capacitors and inductors are 180 degrees out of phase.

==PM (Pulse Modulation)==

[[Image:LCR_diagram.png|Figure 1: RCL circuit]]&lt;br&gt;''Figure 1: RCL circuit''&lt;/center&gt;

When the switch is closed, a voltage step is applied to the RCL circuit.  Take the time the switch was closed to be 0s such that the voltage before the switch was closed was 0 volts and the voltage after the switch was closed is a voltage V.  This is a step function given by &lt;math&gt;V\cdot u(t)&lt;/math&gt; where V is the magnitude of the step and &lt;math&gt;u(t)=1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t\geq0&lt;/math&gt; and zero
otherwise.

To analyse the circuit response using transient analysis, a differential equation which describes the system is formulated.  The voltage around the loop is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
Vu(t)=v_c(t)+\frac{di(t)}{dt}L+Ri(t) \mbox{ (1)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage across the capacitor, &lt;math&gt;\frac{di(t)}{dt}L&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage across the inductor and &lt;math&gt;Ri(t)&lt;/math&gt; the voltage across the resistor.

Substituting &lt;math&gt;i(t)=\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}C&lt;/math&gt; into equation 1:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
Vu(t)=v_c(t)+\frac{d^2v_c(t)}{dt^2}LC+R\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}C
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2v_c(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_c(t)=\frac{Vu(t)}{LC} \mbox{ (2)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The voltage &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; has two components, a natural response &lt;math&gt;v_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; and a forced response &lt;math&gt;v_f(t)&lt;/math&gt; such that:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_c(t)=v_f(t)+v_n(t)\mbox{ (3)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

substituting equation 3 into equation 2.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\bigg[\frac{d^2v_n(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_n(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_n(t)\bigg]+\bigg[\frac{d^2v_f(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_f(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_f(t)\bigg]=0+\frac{Vu(t)}{LC}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

when &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0s&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;u(t)=1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\bigg[\frac{d^2v_n(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_n(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_n(t)\bigg]=0 \mbox{ (4)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\bigg[\frac{d^2v_f(t)}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv_f(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v_f(t)\bigg]=\frac{V}{LC} \mbox{ (5)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The natural response and forced solution are solved separately.

'''Solve for &lt;math&gt;v_f(t):&lt;/math&gt;'''

Since &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{LC}&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree 0, the solution &lt;math&gt;v_f(t)&lt;/math&gt; must be a constant such that:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_f(t)=K
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dv_f(t)}{dt}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2v_f(t)}{dt}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting into equation 5:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{LC}K=\frac{V}{LC}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
K=V
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_f=V \mbox{ (6)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

'''Solve for &lt;math&gt;v_n(t)&lt;/math&gt;:'''

Let:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{R}{L}=2\alpha
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{LC}=\omega_n^2
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=Ae^{st}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting into equation 4 gives:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2Ae^{st}}{dt^2}+2\alpha\frac{dAe^{st}}{dt}+\omega_n^2Ae^{st}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s^2Ae^{st}+2\alpha Ae^{st}+\omega_2^2Ae^{st}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s^2+2\alpha s+\omega_n^2=0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s=\frac{-2\alpha\pm\sqrt{4\alpha^2-4\omega_n^2}}{2}=-\alpha\pm\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;v_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; has two solutions &lt;math&gt;Ae^{s_1t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Ae^{s_2t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; are given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s_1=-\alpha+\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s_2=-\alpha-\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The general solution is then given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=A_1e^{s_1t}+A_2e^{s_2t}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Depending on the values of the Resistor, inductor or capacitor the solution has three posibilies.

1. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''overdamped'''. The system has two distinct real solutions:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=A_1e^{\big(-\alpha+\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}\big)t}+A_2e^{\big(-\alpha-\sqrt{\alpha^2-\omega_n^2}\big)t}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
2. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''critically damped'''.  The system has one real solution:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=\big(A_1+A_2\big)\big(e^{-\alpha t}\big)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
:Let &lt;math&gt;B_1=A_1+A_2&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=Be^{-\alpha t}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

3. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''underdamped'''.  The system has two complex solutions:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s_1=-\alpha+j\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
s_2=-\alpha-j\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=e^{-\alpha t}\Big[A_1e^{j\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}t}+A_2e^{-j\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}t}\Big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
:By Euler's formula (&lt;math&gt;e^{j\phi}=\cos{\phi}+j\sin{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;):
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=e^{-\alpha t}\big[(A_1+A_2)\cos(\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2} t)+j(-A_1+A_2)\sin(\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2} t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

:Let &lt;math&gt;B=A_1+A_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_2=j(-A_1+A_2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=e^{-\alpha t}\big[B_1\cos(\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2} t)+B_2\sin(\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2} t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Example: ==
Given the following values what is the response of the system when the switch is closed?

&lt;center&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| R || L || C || V
|-
| 0.5H || 1k&amp;Omega; || 100nF || 1V
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\alpha=\frac{R}{2L}=1000
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\omega_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\approx 4472
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_n(t)=e^{-1000t}\big[B_1\cos(4359t)+B_2\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

'''Solve for &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_2&lt;/math&gt;:'''

From equation \ref{eq:vf}, &lt;math&gt;v_f=1&lt;/math&gt; for a unit step of magnitude
1V. Therefore substitution of &lt;math&gt;v_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; into equation \ref{eq:nonhomogeneous} gives:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_c(t)=1+e^{-1000t}\big[B_1\cos(4359t)+B_2\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; the voltage across the capacitor is zero, &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
0=1+B_1\cos(0)+B_2\sin(0)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
B_1=-1\mbox{ (7)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, the current in the inductor must be zero, &lt;math&gt;i(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
i(t)=\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}C
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
i(0)=100\cdot10^{-9}\big[e^{-1000t}\big(-4359B_1\sin(4359t)+4359B_2\cos(4359t)\big)-1000e^{-1000t}\big(B_1\cos(4359t)+B_2\sin(4359t)\big)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
0=100\cdot10^{-9}\big[4359B_2-1000B_1 \big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

substituting &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; from equation \ref{eq:B1} gives

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
B_2\approx-0.229
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_c(t)=1-e^{-1000t}\big[\cos(4359t)+0.229\sin(4359t)\big]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_{out}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_{out}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
v_{out}=e^{-1000t}\big[\cos(4359t)+0.229\sin(4359t)\big]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Generation==
AC source alternates on a piece of wire. This creates an electric field that creates a magnetic field that creates an electric field. These waves are known as Electro-Magnetic waves, and are photons that travel through free space.

* EMP (Electro-Magnetic Pulse): Generated by a nuclear blast, a high intensity blast of many frequencies. Shorts out electrical components. 

==Propagation==
Originally people thought that photons propagate through an aether wind. The aether was disproved by showing that it was not flowing from any direction even though the earth is moving.

''My first tie in with other books. The idea is to have a short intro which motivates the other books so people will be interested in reading them. ''

In showing that the aether did not exist came the realization that light travels at the same speed regardless of how fast you are moving and that time is relative and events do not happen at the same time. With that knowledge came the famous E=MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; equation, time travel, the secrets behind blackholes, and how gravity and energy warp time and space. Click [[Special_Relativity|Here]] to unlock these secrets of the universe.

==Antennas==
You only need a quarter wavelength antenna to resolve a full wavelength. It is hard to resolve wavelengths of 200 meters. Use powerlines. Fractal antennas allow to compress the antenna size. As long as the antenna is long enough for a standing wave it does not matter how it is compressed.

The earth behaves like a conductor.  The ionosphere also behaves like a conductor.  Both can reflect radio waves.

If a variable is a matrix, is it always capitalised? Is it always italicised? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 11:36, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: When you write on paper, capitalize it. When it's printed, I think convention is to have capitals, bold, but not italicize. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 12:15, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I thought that one of the important things about multiplication is that it is commutative i.e. &lt;math&gt;ab = ba&lt;/math&gt; but it seems that with matrices this is not so. Why is this definition of multiplying matrices more useful than an alternative, commutative one? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 11:43, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: No, matrix multiplication is ''noncommutative''. AB != BA. It stems from the definition of matrices representing systems of equations, and is a bit complex to quickly explain here. If you like, pick two matrices, multiply them in the &quot;two-finger&quot; method (not sure if this nifty method is explained here), and then change the order. You might not get the same answer. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 12:15, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:As for ''why'' we use that definition, being noncommutative is ''very'' useful. It happens a lot in real problems. E.g rotate a book 90 degrees round a vertical axis then 90 degrees round an horizontal axis and it'll end up differently orientated to if you spin it roun the horizontal axis before the vertical. When you rotate things, order matters, so ''rotation is not commutative''. We need non-commutating matrices to describe it, and many other physically interesting systems. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

:: Or that a matrix represents a [[en:linear transformation|linear transformation]], and that performing one transform before another is not necessarily the same as doing it in the other order. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 12:39, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== problem with exercises ==

I have found a problem with exercise 4 in the exercises section after the text about multiplication of diagonal matrices. It seems to me that the multiplication of the two matrices should be reversed eg instead of c*b what is is now, it should be b*c. Otherwise this equation isn't usefull for the e and f part of the exercise.

The A defined in the equation in the d part of the exercise isn't the same A as defined in the a part of the exercise, as you can see below:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;1\\
1&amp;1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;0\\
0&amp;1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2}&amp;-\frac{1}{2}\\
-\frac{1}{2}&amp;\frac{3}{2}\\
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
4&amp;-3\\
1&amp;0\\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Cofactor Expansion ==

Shouldn't you talk about cofactor expansion for finding the determinant of a matrix? Giving only the formula for a 2x2 matrix won't take readers very far. At the very least, give them the general method to find determinants using permutations.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Delta G. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Delta G~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Time to get our hands dirty! (In a manner of speaking.)

== Text structures ==

In the first chapter, the one stating the Requirements for following this course, a small exercise was printed, in which you created your first simple webpage. If you haven't done that exercise yet, go there now and do it.

A text entered in a text editor and saved to a hard disk, or other form of storage, is often called a 'plain text file'. Plain text files generally provide for two small ways for marking up text: you can separate words using tabs and spaces, and you can separate paragraphs using returns. 

People have found creative ways of producing intricate lay-outs using just these small methods of mark-up. In webpages, these lay-outs will generally be discarded: a web browser must collapse all consecutive spaces, tab stops and returns into one single space or soft return, depending on where on the line the word occurs. There is a way around this, which will be discussed later.

When you structure a text, you generally do so to make it easier to digest and to read. By making chapter and section headings more pronounced, you allow the reader to skim over a text until they find an especially interesting part. By using introductions and abstracts, you allow a reader to decide if this text will be interesting to them. You can use illustrations, because sometimes people will much sooner understand what's going on when they can see what's going on.

HTML, the HyperText Mark-up Language for the web, and its successor XHTML, the eXtensible HyperText Mark-up Language, allows you to impose a structure on a plain text document. It replaces the few simple mark-up methods plain text allows you by its own. (Note: the abbreviation (X)HTML is often used when talking about features that are common to both HTML and XHTML.)

The way (X)HTML lets you do all this, is by letting you label certain parts of the text as heading, image, table, list, important et cetera. Some structures are not catered for by (X)HTML; it is a relatively simple mark-up language. For instance, there is no element for introductions, or leads. The reader will have to infer from the position in a text which is the introduction, the lead or the abstract.

Now there was a term you should know: element. (X)HTML lets you structure a text by dividing it up into elements. Elements are separated from each other by a type of label called tags.

An example: 

  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is an &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;important&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What you see above is a paragraph element with an embedded emphasis element. The paragraph element starts with a &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tag and ends with a &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; tag. The emphasis element starts with an &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; tag and ends with a &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; tag.

== A webpage by any other name... ==

There are several versions of the (X)HTML standard. The more recent ones add a lot of structure verbiage: many elements are obligatory under many circumstances. However, web browsers should also support older versions of the standard, so that examples such as the one given in the Requirements chapter are considered valid HTML documents. 

Every webpage must have a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; element (under older versions of HTML this was the only required element): 

  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;My webpage&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;

The title is the text by which the browser window will be named. It is the text that appears in your list of bookmarks if you bookmark a page (add it to your Favourites). It is the text by which your page will be listed by the search engine.

Find a descriptive title. The heading of your page will often do just fine. The heading of this chapter is 'Creating a simple webpage', so its title could be the same text. Since this webpage explains to you how to create simple webpage, that would be an excellent title.

Bad titles abound on the web. Companies who feel that their own satisfaction is much more important than their customer's satisfaction (which is very much true, but it's bad marketing to hammer that point home too much) tend to title their web pages as follows: 

  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Big Fridge Manufacturer Inc.&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;

If you are lucky, they will even add in a bit of information related to the webpage you are visiting, for instance:

  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Big Fridge Manufacturer Inc. - Manual of the Cool 3000 ice box&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;

Better for the visitor is: 

  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Manual of the Cool 3000 ice box - Big Fridge Manufacturer Inc.&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;

After all, it is much more likely that the visitor who gets to this page is searching for the manual, rather than for company info.

So, the lesson is: always put the important information first. Often, you only have a limited amount of characters available to you in your bookmarks menu, in the search engine listing or in the window title bar; utilize that space to the maximum.

An (X)HTML document with only a title element is not very useful. We will now introduce you to a couple of elements that will allow you to make good use of 90% of the power of the web.

== A simple linking webpage ==

; title
: The name of a page.
; h1
: The most important heading(s) on a page, often the same as the title.
; h2
: A sub-heading. There may be multiple of these.
; p
: A paragraph.
; a
: An anchor for a link.

With these elements, we can make the following simple web page: 

&lt;!-- Please ensure that after any changes to the example the markup is still valid. Please don't change the DOCTYPE to Transitional or Frameset. Please do not omit optional tags.--&gt;  
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Friends and family of Clemence Wylie&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Friends and family&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The following are links to the websites of my friends and family&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Friends&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.tomsawyer.us&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;&amp;gt;Tom Sawyer&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Family&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.tantejeanette.ca&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;&amp;gt;Aunt Jeanette&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Exercise 2-1 === 

Copy the above sample code to your text editor. Save it as exercise2-1.html. Open it in a webbrowser. Does it display like you expected?

=== Answers ===

For answers, see [[Authoring webpages:Answers|Answers to Questions and Exercises]].

== Doing the link ==

The &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; tags (the name is short for 'anchor') in the previous example have a special form. They contain attributes with attached values. Many (X)HTML tags can actually contain attributes. With attributes you may modify or extend the meaning of an element.

&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; tags have several possible attributes, of which the most important are &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; is the attribute that defines the URL (Uniform Resource Locator, a fancy way of saying the address) a link leads to. With &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; you can attach a name to an anchor, so that other anchors can in turn link to it. 

(Forward compatibility note. In XHTML 1.1 &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is replaced by &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;.)

A URL takes the following form: 

protocol://domain/path#named_anchor

The protocol for web pages is usually &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; (HyperText Transfer Protocol) or its secure variant &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;.

However, several of these components are optional. A URL can just be a relative path (for example 'wines/french/red/bordeaux.html' on the website of a wine lover): in that case, the address will be calculated from the page that contains the link.

A URL can also just be a service and domain name: 'http://www.tomsawyer.us/ ' leads to a website with that address; the web server of that site is supposed to figure out which document you want, which will typically be called 'index.html' or 'default.htm'.

== Elements deconstructed ==

An (X)HTML document consists of elements. These elements are constructed as follows: 

&amp;lt;tag&amp;gt;contents&amp;lt;/tag&amp;gt;

An opening tag may contain attributes, and attributes are often connected with attribute values, like so:

&amp;lt;tag attribute1=&quot;value&quot; attribute2=&quot;value2&quot; attribute3&amp;gt;

(Note: all attributes must have values in XHTML so attribute3 is valid HTML but invalid XHTML.)

The tag that closes an element is just like the opening tag, but has a forward leaning slash in front of the name, and cannot contain attributes: 

&amp;lt;/tag&amp;gt;

Not every element can contain every other element. The (X)HTML standards defines per element which other elements it can contain. The permitted combinations vary from version to version.

On a very abstract level, it can be said that elements are either block level elements or character level elements. Block level elements are larger elements: paragraphs, table cells, list items, forms et cetera. They can contain all character level elements and sometimes also other block level elements. Character level elements are generally smaller--links, emphasis, images et cetera--and can often only contain other character level elements.

For instance, the following is valid HTML: 

  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;Valid HTML&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

But this is not: 

  Invalid: &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;invalid HTML&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;

== Validity ==

The term 'valid (X)HTML' was already mentioned a couple of times. Since webpages are supposed to be authored by people, and since people make mistakes, web browsers tend to be extremely forgiving towards those mistakes. They will even try to correct your mistakes. 

Still, there are several reasons why you should try and mark up a webpage with valid (X)HTML:

* different browsers may correct your mistakes differently
* future browsers will not be as forgiving - particularly with XHTML.
* valid (X)HTML is easier to read and maintain
* when trying to correct bad mark-up, it helps if you are not side-tracked by other possible errors.

The organization currently responsible for maintaining the (X)HTML standard is the [http://w3.org World Wide Web Consortium]. It runs a validator service that you can use to check if your (X)HTML is indeed valid. You can find it at [http://validator.w3.org http://validator.w3.org]. Whilst learning (X)HTML is a good idea to validate every page you write to confirm you have understood the rules correctly.

A common mistake is to forget to start every document with a DOCTYPE. A document without a DOCTYPE is automatically invalid ([http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.2 HTML version information]). Note: many texts erroneously state that the DOCTYPE is optional. It is true that all major browsers will forgive the absence of DOCTYPE but this does not make the page valid. The appearance of a page may vary noticeably between different browsers if the DOCTYPE is omitted as each browser has its own peculiarities when rendering such pages.

== Exercises ==

Time to have some fun. The following exercises will let you make some simple webpages and websites. The goal is to teach you the power of the several different ways of linking.

=== Exercise 2-2 ===

Copy the example web page above to the clipboard and open [http://validator.w3.org http://validator.w3.org]. Paste the example in to the 'Validate by Direct Input' section and click on 'Check'. Is the example valid?

=== Exercise 2-3 ===

If you have an anchor &amp;lt;a name=&quot;anchor1&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, then &amp;lt;a href=&quot;#anchor1&quot;&amp;gt;link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; will link to it. That means that when you activate the link, the webpage will be displayed starting at the anchor (rather than as usual from the top).

Make a copy of the webpage you created in Exercise 2-1, and save it as 'exercise2-3.html'. Change this file to include a 'menu' of hyperlinks at the top that link to the headings of the different subsections (Family, Friends).

=== Exercise 2-4 ===

There is a hybrid form of book and game called Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA). In such a game-book, you read a bit of text as in a normal book, but after a (usually short) while, you get to make a choice as to how to continue. 

For instance: 

Sue Walkins was sitting in the tub, soaking, relaxing. Her rubber ducky was chattering away happily when suddenly a pike grabbed it from below and dragged it down. Sue 

- dived into to the water to save the ducky at page 89

- pulled the plug to empty the bath at page 24

In this exercise, you will write a short CYOA, in which the choices are represented by hyperlinks that will lead to the text  continuing from that choice. Every 'chapter' must be a separate webpage. 

Keep it snappy and don't spend too much time on this. Ten to twenty webpages should be sufficient. The story does not need to be good or finished.

Tip: create a template HTML file, on which you base all subsequent chapters.

=== Exercise 2-5 ===

Create a webpage and save it as 'exercise2-5.html'. The webpage should contain a short, informative text about a subject of your choice. It should contain at least three working links to external websites about the subject.

== Images ==

Including an image on a webpage is done using the &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; element. In HTML up to version 4.01, this was one of a few special case elements, in that they are empty. That is to say, although you use a tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to include an image on a webpage, you do not use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to indicate the end of the element.

The &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; element has two obligatory attributes: &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; takes a URL as value. A URL indicates the 'address', the location of the image. 

If an image is located in the same folder as the web page that includes it, the URL consists merely of the file name of the image.

The &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attribute contains a textual description that functions as the image when the image cannot be displayed. For instance, if the image is a photo of a lake with a castle, you could have the following code: 

&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;lakecastle.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;photo of a lake and a castle&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

When the purpose of the image is decorative, it can be wise to use an empty alt value. That way, when the page will be displayed, the 'decorative' text will not interrupt the flow of the page's main text.

&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;prettypattern.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

However, when the image has a function to fulfill on a webpage, the presence of an alt text is very important for visitors who do not get to see the image. For instance, many webpages have menus of links, where the links are represented by images. This allows the page author to clearly distinguish the menu items as such. 

&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;family.html&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;button-family.png&quot; alt=&quot;Family&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; element lets you embed an image on a page. You can of course also link to an image that you do not want to display on the page, because it has no role there. For instance, if you want to offer people the chance to download photos you made, you can offer links to those photos. For that you use the same &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; element that we have been using to link to other webpages:

&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;lakecastle-large.jpeg&quot;&amp;gt;Photo of a lake and a castle (JPEG, 512 kilobyte)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Note how you can create links to every file that can be located using a URL. Also note how we provide feed-forward to the user. By indicating that a photo is stored in the JPEG format (a very common file format for photos) and by indicating the file size, we give visitors the opportunity to decide whether they A) can use a file of this format, and B) whether they are willing to download a file of this size.

== Pre-formatted text ==

(X)HTML contains many more elements (for example, HTML 4.01, contains 91 different elements), but for now we will discuss only one more before moving on to the style of webwriting.

The &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt; element allows you to retain plain text formatting (as discussed shortly at the beginning of this chapter). This means that within the element, consecutive spaces, tabs and hard returns will not be collapsed into a single space or soft return.

There is little use for this element. It stops the text from reflowing neatly when the browser width is reduced or expanded, causing visitors to scroll horizontally, which websurfers generally hate to do. (X)HTML and its companion lay-out language CSS have plenty of options to display line-breaks and indentation. Also, it is pretty meaningless in non-visual browsers.

However, when you wish to copy preformatted text from other documents, it may be handy to use the &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt; element until you have the time to mark that text up.

Example: 

&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;1  2    4        8&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== Further reading ==

Later during this course, we will discuss further elements. However, the intention of this course is not to make you fluent in the HyperText Mark-up Language; it is to make you fluent in authoring webpages. 

Generally, to fully comprehend something requires that you fully comprehend its form first. You cannot be a successful karate-ka if you cannot perform the various moves. You cannot be a successful French speaker if you have not mastered its grammar and vocabulary first. However, knowing all the ways to hit someone does not make you a good karate-ka. And knowing all the words and rules of the French language does not prevent you from becoming a mumbling baboon the next time you need to speak French.

To fully comprehend authoring webpages, you need to look beyond the language in which you write them. This is what we will do in most of the further chapters of this book.

There are at the time of writing this several Wikibooks under development that aim to teach you (X)HTML. These have been referenced elsewhere in this book. ''where???''

The official (X)HTML Recommendations of the World Wide Web Consortium can be found at the  [http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/ HyperText Markup Language (HTML) Home Page]. At times, they can be pretty hard to read, but they represent the last word in any discussion of what is valid (X)HTML and what is not.

Further, one the authors of the HTML 4.01 Recommendations, Dave Ragett, has written a couple of handy guides to HTML and its companion lay-out language CSS, which you can find at [http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/#tutorials http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/#tutorials]. If there are points in this and later chapters that you do not fully comprehend, you could do worse than study Dave's texts. They are much clearer than the official specifications, and short enough to study alongside this text.

== More exercises ==

The following exercises are optional. You can use them to practice putting images on your webpages.

=== Exercise 2-6 ===

Download the following images, and put them all on a webpage that you will save as 'exercise2-6.html'. Think of useful &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; texts.

To download linked files, a lot of browsers contain a Save Link As function. In graphical browsers using a mouse, this function is often part of the context menu. On the PC this means you have to click you right mouse button, on Mac OS this means you have to press the &lt;code&gt;Ctrl&lt;/code&gt;-key and press the mouse button.

[[Image:LCR_diagram.png|Figure 1: RCL circuit]]&lt;br&gt;''Figure 1: RCL circuit''
&lt;/center&gt;

Define the pole frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; and the dampening factor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{R}{L}=2\alpha
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{LC}=\omega_n^2
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

To analyze the circuit first calculate the transfer function in the s-domain H(s).  For the RCL circuit in figure 1 this gives:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
H(s)=\frac{s\big(s+2\alpha\big)}{s^2+2\alpha s+\omega_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
H(s)=\frac{s\big(s+2\alpha\big)}{\big(s+\alpha+j\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}\big)\big(s+\alpha-j\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}\big)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

When the switch is closed, this applies a step waveform to the RCL circuit. The step is given by &lt;math&gt;Vu(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  Where V is the voltage of the step and u(t) the unit step function.  The response of the circuit is given by the convolution of the impulse response h(t) and the step function &lt;math&gt;Vu(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the output is given by multiplication in the s-domain H(s)U(s), where &lt;math&gt;U(s)=V\frac{1}{s}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the Laplace Transform available in the [[Electronics/Laplace_Transform_pairs|appendix]].

The convolution of u(t) and h(t) is given by:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
H(s)U(s)=\frac{V\big(s+2\alpha\big)}{\big(s+\alpha+j\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}\big)\big(s+\alpha-j\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}\big)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Depending on the values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system can be characterized as:

3. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; the system is said to be '''underdamped'''  The solution for h(t)*u(t) is given by:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
h(t)*u(t)=Ve^{-\alpha t}\big(\cos(\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}t)+\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}}\sin(\sqrt{\omega_n^2-\alpha^2}t)\big)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Example: ==
Given the following values what is the response of the system when the switch is closed?

&lt;center&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| R || L || C || V
|-
| 0.5H || 1k&amp;Omega; || 100nF || 1V
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

First calculate the values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_n&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\alpha=\frac{R}{2L}=1000
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\omega_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\approx 4472
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

From these values note that &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt;.  The system is therefore '''underdamped'''.  The equation for the voltage across the capacitor is then:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
h(t)*u(t)=e^{-1000 t}\big(\cos(4359 t)+0.229\sin(4359t)\big)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

== Various Topics == 

In this lesson, it says that &quot;Mein Name ist ...&quot; would be considered incorrect. Er ... um ... no. It's correct. It's slightly less common, and a little more formal than &quot;Ich heiße ...&quot;

----

I just started reading through the questions and answers, but when I got to the Wie Geht's section problems, a question asks for the word for terrific, which was previously given as Klasse!, but when referring to the answers, it uses Toll!. I think that either Toll! should be added to the lists of responses or the answer to the question should become Klasse! .

Need a guide to pronunciation - how does the esset sound?  Is there some phoenetic guidance that can possibly be written down?  Any way of including WAV or other audio files to cover the basic pronunciations?
:I added a link to the pronunciation guide, which has a pretty good overview of the pronunciations of all letters. I can't do audio, but others on the site can. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 05:01, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)

SamE - Is there a reason for having a '''Lesson Overview''' that so closely matches the page TOC? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 20:42, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I'm just curious, when you list the pronouns you put du and Sie together, which is true, but when you list the conjugations you don't make Sie clear. To me this might suggest that Sie would fit in with the conjugations of du rather then those of sie..

The names section, with &quot;our,their,hers his its&quot; does not mention that these are english possesive pronouns. it seems to me there are no possesive pronouns in german.  whatever the case may be, some mention of this needs to go on the page.

Is it Tschüss, or Tschüs? I have a 1993 dictionary and a 2000 textbook, and both say it only has one 's'. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 20:35, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)
: it's Tschüss --[[User:Moolsan|Moolsan]] 22:04, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)
:: Actually, since it is informal language, either Tschüs, Tschüss or Tschüß may be used and found. This is a bit weird, since the word is almost exclusively used in talk, not in the writing. [[User:Endymi0n|Endymi0n]] 04:33, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
----

&quot;Tschau, Susi!&quot;

---&gt; nonsense. Tschau is a &quot;Verballhornung&quot; of Ciao(it.).

This is not German. Susi is no common German name, it is a reduction of Susanne.

Regional other prases are used:

&quot;Tschüss&quot; (Hamburg) (&quot;adjüst&quot; (Helgoland), &quot;Ade&quot;, adieu(fr.))

:There isn't much else that is used as an informal good-bye, so if you have any other better suggestions, please put them here. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:06, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:: Right. As stated above this is weird, because there is no such word as &quot;bye&quot; which is used in both talk and writing. &quot;Hi&quot;/&quot;Hallo&quot; for greeting and &quot;Tschau&quot; (ciao)/&quot;Tschüs&quot; for goodbye are quite common, but there is a tendence to use regional words as &quot;Moin&quot; and &quot;Grüß Gott&quot;. However, these clearly indicate you as coming from a certain part of Germany (Austria,Switzerland) when mentioned in the wrong part. The statement beneath correctly mentions the use of the phrase &quot;Mach's gut&quot; as a common indirect way to say goodbye. May be added... [[User:Endymi0n|Endymi0n]] 04:33, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

::informal hellos and good-byes are very different, corresponding with the dialects. I would never use one of the above, but ''Servus'' or ''Pfüadi'', but this is not for a first chapter. A phrase i heared nearly in every circumstances is &quot;Machs gut!&quot; or &quot;Machen Sies gut!&quot;, which is only used when people are frendly (no matter weather they use ''Sie'' or ''Du'').

:It is important instead to add parts like Servus/Grüßgott - we had exchange studendts and I am from Regensburg, Germany. When they came they expected people to say &quot;Guten Morgen!&quot; and friends to say &quot;Tschüß!&quot;, but this did not happen. People there simply doesn't use this forms. So they should be added and explained in a note. This will help students when they come to Germany/Austria to understand immediately what people said. Of course one should not add dialect there, but only these few very important words. Maybe even the others like Ade etc. should be added in the note. --[[User:SabineCretella|SabineCretella]] 08:22, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I am german an just read the first lessons. You did it really fine; nobody can believe, that every thing is explained in the first lesson! Learn step by step!
It's true, that &quot;Tschau&quot; is a german version from &quot;ciao&quot;, but only if you know eachother well and feel good. &quot;Tschüß&quot; is the origin form, sice 2002 we have to write double s, one s can't be correct, you always pronounce it with double ss. The ß is also pronounced. 60 years ago, the german knew thre forms to write s, I think it was first a cause of &quot;good looking and easy writing&quot; (with hand).
There existe no Institution in germany for correct writing and til 19th century everybody could write as he liked. 
The german language includes many other languages and also some grammar of other languages. So meanwhile it's correct to say &quot;Mein Name ist...&quot;. 
Every word with &quot;''~chen''&quot; or &quot;''~lein''&quot; means little and get the Artikel &quot;''das''&quot;. 
&lt;small&gt;In former times houses and farmes had female workers called &quot;die Magd&quot;, a little one is &quot;das Mädchen&quot; and now common for every female child; the older words &quot;die Göre&quot; or &quot;die Dirn&quot;  (in lower Saxonie &quot;die Deern&quot;)changed their meaning: Göre is a cheeky girl and Dirne someone who sells sex. In Southgermany you can use &quot;Das Madel&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;
 Be sure, german girls don't like to be &quot;das&quot;!

== Pronunciation? ==

Hi! Thanks to everyone involved in the project. It is a very good guide for beginners but it is really handicapped by the lack of pronunciation for words. I think audio files for the conversations would really do a world of good to the project. I did not know Ich was pronounced as ''Ish'' and instead read it as ''Ikh''.
Thanks anyway.

: On my way of doing so... =) BTW: Both pronounciations are wrong, there is no adequate reference in English vocals. Try to pronounce &quot;ch&quot; as a &quot;sh&quot; but touch your palatine not with the tip, but with the middle of your tongue. [[User:Endymi0n|Endymi0n]] 04:33, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
----

I think &quot;Ich&quot; can be pronounced in either way; it seems to be a north/south dialect difference. I've seen pronounciation guides all over the internet and one of the things many of them seem to stress is that the &quot;ch&quot; can be pronounced either &quot;sh&quot; or &quot;kh&quot; and still be correct.

Also, I would like to help with making audiofiles for pronouncing the words, but wikipedia says it prefers this &quot;OGG&quot; format that I've never heard of and I can't find any software that supports saving audio in it. Can someone tell me what it can be made in? Would it really matter too much if I submit it in MP3?
--[[User:Shdwninja8|Shdwninja8]] 21:14, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

:&quot;[kh]&quot; (with a very soft &quot;k&quot; if pronounced at all) is always the right way to say &quot;ch&quot;. Everything else is a regional dialect.
:MP3 is afaik a patented. [[http://www.vorbis.com/ Vorbis.com]] provides tools for the free OGG format.
:--[[User:Messi|Messi]] 23:10, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

sorry, but this is not true. the pronounciation &quot;ikh&quot; is only used specific dialekt. The normal &quot;high german&quot; pronounciation just has no english equivalent or similiarity... The sound for the &quot;ch&quot; part of the word is produced by having your tounge loosley in your mouth (without touching your teeth or anything inside your mouth) and use a small amount of air with the right speed

:Well here's an easy way to get the idea: It's '''just like the ch in Michigan or Chicago'''. The usual English ch (change, charge, China) is pronounced ''tch'', remove the t/d and it's exactly right (well, not ''exactly'', it's still more like &quot;sch&quot;).

== The boy throws the sphere ==

I think using &quot;die Kugel&quot; as German translation for &quot;ball&quot; is just wrong; the appropriate word would be &quot;der Ball&quot;. In some situations, &quot;Kugel&quot; is best translated as &quot;ball&quot;, but in most cases, the meaning is more &quot;technical&quot;, more &quot;sphere&quot; than &quot;ball&quot;. &quot;Kugel&quot; definitely doesn't remind me of anything that is usually thrown by boys.

  &quot;Der Junge spielt der Ball&quot; is incorrect, it should be &quot;den Ball&quot; (cases)

:This is literally translated as &quot;The boy plays the ball&quot; which is nonsense. Correct tranlation is &quot;Der Junge spielt mit dem Ball&quot; (boy plays with the ball) or &quot;Der Junge spielt Ball&quot; which means the boy playing a ball game.

== einen? ==
What is this article ''einen''? as in the sentence &quot;Der Mann hat einen Hut.&quot; (I am a beginner.) -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] 05:37, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Take a look at [[German: Lesson 3#Indefinite Articles|German: Lesson 3 (Indefinite Articles)]]. ''einen'' is indefinite article ''ein'' (masculine) in accusative case.

:Thanks! -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]]

== on questions of format in forming questions ==

Hey!
I am really having a good time using the lessons and am learning quite a lot, but I simply wanted to say that on the section on forming questions it's not very linear. For instance, in the first two paragraphs there should be a consistent phrase instead of using different phrases throughout the paragraphs. However, if the intent is to continue using the different phrases, there should be a break in the text or label  it is an example. Just a thought.

== ? Incorrect form in 2nd Conversation ==

I am questioning the form used for asking the other persons name in this conversation. Is Herr Schwarz older than Franz, or have they met previously?  If not, then using &quot;Wie heisst du?&quot; is incorrect, it should be &quot;Wie heissen Sie?&quot;, since Sie is proindicated for use where both parties are adult (unless they have agreed to use du), or formal siuations where neither party has met the other, and should be used until they are familiar enough to use du.

Ca you clarify how this situation / conversation formed , and the forms used to support the text? [[User:Tmalmjursson|Tmalmjursson]] 13:05, 11 February 2006 (UTC) [[User_talk:Tmalmjursson|Thor's pet yack]]

:To me, a native speaker, the dialogue sounds like Herr Schwarz is older than Franz, as you said. I assume Franz is meant to be a child, because only then you get a situation in which one uses &quot;du&quot; while the other uses &quot;Sie&quot;. [[User:Epsilon|Epsilon]] 18:11, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:I wouldn't worry about the formal forms. I wouldn't use &quot;du&quot; to address a total stranger, a teacher, business man and so on, but no one's gonna kill you if you do. After all they'll be able to tell from your accent that you're not a native and will be positively surprised. It's not like in some Asian cultures where you &quot;lose your face&quot; when you use the wrong honorific. I'm not saying that the rules are wrong, but don't be afraid to commit a faux pas, where not nearly as strict as we're said to be. Same goes for the greeting: No one will be offended when you say &quot;Hi!&quot;, although it's probably uncommon for anyone over 30 ;-)

== SZ? ==

I disagree with the statement &quot;upper case ß is written as 'SZ'&quot;. I've never ever seen it.

For one thing, ß never is the first letter of a word, so in everyday wiritng it doesn't need to be capitalized.
If you want to capitalize a whole word, you'd use SS (Süßigkeiten --&gt; SÜSSIGKEITEN).

Any different views? [[User:Epsilon|Epsilon]] 18:17, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:I agree that you will rarely see it even though this sould not have been the case. See [[w:en:ß#Older usages|here]] for clarification. Thus it should now be changed to SS in the article. However, I would still continue to use MASZE for Maße, MASSE for Masse to make it easier to understand. Regards --[[User:217.83.69.74|217.83.69.74]] 19:40, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

Among others, the East German Duden apparently once made an attempt to introduce an upper case &quot;ß&quot; many years ago, but until this day such a glyph is not being used. Up until the spelling reform, Both SZ and SS were correct, when spelling a word in capitals only, such as in &quot;DAS GROSSE/GROSZE HAUS&quot;. Note that &quot;GROßE&quot; never has been correct, even if it is often seen, e.g. in publicity. Today, only SS is correct. However, in professional context (I'm an architect) I still prefer the &quot;wrong&quot; SZ, to avoid the aforementioned confusion between &quot;Maße&quot; / &quot;Masse&quot;, as both words are quite common there [[User:Thamane|Thamane]] 20:39, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

Note, that there is also [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/2/2b/Eszett_Leipziger_Duden_1957.png a large ß]. Since 2008 the large ß has even it own unicode. More information in German: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fes_%C3%9F [[Special:Contributions/85.179.37.72|85.179.37.72]] ([[User talk:85.179.37.72|discuss]]) 22:44, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

== Alphabet ==

The order you are using in the alphabet table is quite unfamiliar to a German native speaker. We just take that direction: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz äöüß, not mixing umlauts into usual alphabet [[User:HolgiDE|HolgiDE]] 10:49, 21 Mar 2006 (UTC)
:We do, but only if we actually spell the alphabet. Where, for example, would you look up ''Ärger'', ''Ökonom'', and ''über'' in a dictionary? Among A, O, and U, respectively, right? ''Note to non-German speakers:'' ä, ö, ü, and ß don't have places in the alphabet. Therefore, if you have to find an alphabetical order for words containing umlaute, you'd treat them as ae, oe, ue, and ss. [[User:Epsilon|Epsilon]] 10:24, 1 April 2006 (UTC)
::Sometimes they are treated as just a, o, u and s, as well. So if you don't find a word in one place, look in the other.
:::&quot;you'd treat them as ae, oe, ue, and ss&quot; - Never heard of that, as far as I know, Ä is either listed after A (A, Aal, Antenne, Arbeit, Atom, azur, Ärger), or as if it was an A (…Arbeit, Ärger, Atom…). … Okay, I looked in my Duden (standard German dictionary), here how they do it: '''äöü is treated like aou and ß as ss''', but before ss if the word is the same (i.e. Maße, Masse).

== Recording speech ==

Hey there!

I just registered at the english Wikibooks (though I've been quite active in the german one before), and I'd like to contribute to this Wikibook. I am willing to record some of the dialogues in this lesson (or probably in some of the other lessons as well) and provide the audio files to this community for free and for free use. Since German is my native tongue, this shouldn't be much of a problem.

Please tell me what I am supposed to do.

Cheers!

== Mistake in title ==

In title &quot;Wie Heißt du?&quot; the word &quot;heißt&quot; has to be written with a small capital, but this would change the name of the file/link. Maybe someone wants to change that.

--[[User:HolgiDE|HolgiDE]] 10:35, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

== Sentence Structure ==

'The common word order in a German sentence is the same as in English: Subject verb Objects. (SvO)'

:That's not the case. The syntax requires the (finite) verb being the 2nd part of every main sentence; 'Fußball spielt der Junge' is equally correct, but now the object is stressed. (Translation: 'Soccer is the game the boy plays' or sth. like that) The German syntax requires the finite verb to be the first part of every question, apart from interrogative pronouns, and requires the finite verb to be last part of a subordinate clause.

::The standard word order is subject-verb-object. However, you can place almost any part in the first place, in particular objects and adverbs. But this is not the standard word order. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:41, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

== Umlauts ==

This is a sentence from the section about umlauts: &quot;In writing, the umlauts are sometimes substituted with the vowel plus e, i.e ae, oe and ue.&quot; That i.e. is confusing. The first time I read it I didn't get it... I understood what the sentence means, but I just didn't get the examples it was showing because of the i.e. Maybe it should be changed to &quot;for example&quot;. [[User:84.9.187.195|84.9.187.195]] 12:40, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== Formation ==

Is the formation of &quot;Ich heiße Asd&quot; something like &quot;I'm called Asd&quot; or &quot;I'm named Asd&quot;? Just to know, 'cause in portuguese it's really much like that &quot;Eu me chamo Asd&quot; (literally: &quot;I call myself Asd&quot;) being used more than &quot;Meu nome é Asd&quot; (literally: &quot;My name is Asd&quot;). [[User:200.230.213.152|200.230.213.152]] 23:34, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

It's just &quot;Ich heiße Asd.&quot; There's no structure to it to compare it to in English or Portuguese. &quot;Heißen&quot; is a verb that just means &quot;to be called ...&quot;, &quot;to be named ...&quot;, &quot;to have the name/meaning&quot; etc. ''Ich'' = &quot;I&quot; ''heiße'' = &quot;am called&quot;, &quot;am named&quot;, &quot;have the name&quot;.

== Names ==

hi. in the names section on this page in the little blue box it says that &quot;Wie heißt ihr?&quot; means &quot;what are your names?&quot; but then it says (outside the blue box) that the plural form is &quot;Wie heißen...&quot; I'm very confused.
:It depends on who or what you are asking about. Wie heißt ihr? is how you ask a group of people what their names are; Like &quot;What are your(plural) names?&quot; Wie heißen sie? would be how you ask ABOUT a group of people; Like, &quot;What are their names?&quot; hope that makes sense. Also NB: Wie heißen Sie? (with a capital S) is the formal version of &quot;What is your name?&quot;

== error in venn diagram ==

&quot;guten morgen&quot; means &quot;good morning&quot; and is not a form of goodbye

:Good morning is also a form of goodbye in both German and English. In English it isn't as common anymore; don't know about German. Anyway, not an error.

::&quot;guten morgen&quot; should be &quot;guten Morgen&quot; and is no longer a form of goodbye in German. I removed the Venn diagram, because of the typos in it. Also, it doesn't make sense to teach students who want to learn German about Venn diagrams. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:37, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

== Keyboard Shortcuts for Umlauts and Eszett ==

I notice that you provide keyboard shortcuts for Windows and Mac computers to enter German characters, but what about users of Linux. For them, you can simply say that they can find the &quot;Character Map&quot; under Applications&gt;Accesories&gt;Character Map from the GNOME Desktop.

== Tschüs(s) ==

Tschüs should better be written with one 's' only, because in some regions the 'ü' is long, especially in the north. However, according to [http://dict.leo.org/?search=Tschüs LEO also the spelling with two s is correct].

:Where I live (in Kaiserslautern in Rhineland-Palatinate), people say Tschüss with a short ü, thus the spelling with two s is more appropriate here. In the old pre-1996 orthography, it would have been spelled Tschüß.

== Ciao ==

I'm wondering, why the Italien 'ciao' is taught here as a common German word. You rarely here it and never write it in German, and until I read it here, I probably would have written it 'Tschau!'. It is very informal. [[Special:Contributions/85.179.37.72|85.179.37.72]] ([[User talk:85.179.37.72|discuss]]) 22:33, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

== Pronunciation ==

I feel that a short guide to German pronunciation should be given at the very beginning of this course. I know giving a section on German pronunciation can be repelling (and scaring) to the new learner, but such a section will help him avoid a lot of effort in guessing the pronunciations. A little persistence from the student will make his life a lot easy.

== Dialog 1 – Names ==

The names ‘Franz’ and ‘Greta’ are out of fashion for decades. It could be a dialogue between 80 year old people, but German teenagers are nowadays more likely called ‘Felix’ and ‘Sarah’. Have a look at [http://www.beliebte-vornamen.de] to get an idea. -- [[User:Sloyment|Sloyment]] ([[User talk:Sloyment|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sloyment|contribs]]) 10:23, 31 July 2011 (UTC)

:Feel free to change the names consistently and rerecord the dialogues. '''But please do not change the names before you have recorded and uploaded the new versions of the audio files.''' :) And, for the record, I know a German girl called Greta who is about 10 years old now. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 13:42, 31 July 2011 (UTC)

even if this is from 2011. if you'd looked closely at your reference, you'd noticed that greta is still in the top 60. admitted franz is out of fashion, but not that bad. I'm only 40 and we had 3 franz in class. [[Special:Contributions/93.185.141.171|93.185.141.171]] ([[User talk:93.185.141.171|discuss]]) 06:54, 4 September 2012 (UTC)

== Dialog 1 – “Kennst du den Lehrer?” ==

This phrase is unidiomatic, i.e. it can be understood, but nobody would say it in that way. More realistic alternatives would be “Sag mal, weißt du, wie der Lehrer heißt?” or better “Wie heißt eigentlich unser [neuer] Lehrer?”. “Kennst du den Lehrer?” actually means “Do you know him personally?”, to which you could answer e.g. “Ja, wir sind gut befreundet.” or “Ich kenne ihn nur vom sehen.” -- [[User:Sloyment|Sloyment]] ([[User talk:Sloyment|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sloyment|contribs]]) 10:23, 31 July 2011 (UTC)

:I think the question is OK in this context because it kind of asks whether you had him as a teacher before. More importantly, it is grammatically easier to understand than other alternatives. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 13:48, 31 July 2011 (UTC)

Trouble is: Kennst Du den Lehrer which is a literal translation of do you know our teacher, doesn't mean the same. The German phrase 'kennst Du' means if you know him (personally). Better would be 'Weißt Du wer unser Lehrer ist?&quot; Do you know who our teacher is?.[[Special:Contributions/93.185.141.171|93.185.141.171]] ([[User talk:93.185.141.171|discuss]]) 06:43, 4 September 2012 (UTC)

:While one may prefer your form, 'Kennst du den Lehrer?' is not wrong. It is as acceptable as the English translation 'Do you know the teacher?'. And it's simpler than your proposal.

*4 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
===The standard method===

In a heavy [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]], bring the water to a boil.  Add the salt.  Stirring constantly with a stainless steel whisk, pour the cornmeal into the water in a steady stream.  Reduce heat to a slow simmer and keep stirring with the whisk until it starts to boil, then cover and continue to cook, stirring every 2-3 minutes with a wooden spoon, always in the same clockwise direction.  

The time necessary for the porridge to be correctly cooked and thus well-digestible is 45 minutes.  In case the porridge gets too thick, add some hot water or skimmed milk, to obtain a more creamy porridge.  Check frequently if more salt is needed.  

For eating polenta hot from the pan, put a tablespoon of water in a deep ceramic dish and scrape the polenta into it. Serve it with a big wooden spoon.  To eat it roasted, scrape the polenta into a non-stick pan or ceramic dish (or some container which will release it when it cools).  Cool completely.  The polenta will be like a loaf.  To serve it, cut into slices, heat in the oven or grill it and serve with whatever topping you desire.  Even the polenta leftovers from serving it as a hot side dish are usable, cut in slices and grilled.

===The quickie method===

Boil the water on the stove.  Pour it into a large microwave-safe bowl and add the salt. Stirring constantly, pour the cornmeal into the water in a steady stream.  Cook the polenta in a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]] on medium power for (2&amp;ndash;5 minutes, longer for a larger serving).  Remove from the microwave and stir vigorously.  It will not cook evenly and this stirring helps prevent lumps.  

Repeat this process until the polenta is thick, then proceed as above.

===The really quickie method===

Boil the water, toss in the salt and cornmeal and microwave on medium power for 5&amp;ndash;8 minutes (depending on quantity).  Remove from microwave and stir like crazy to smash all of the lumps.  Repeat if you need to thicken it some more, stir, and blend with the few remaining lumps.

===Variations===
Just before you take the polenta off the heat (i.e., when it's almost done), stir in any of the following.
* Two tablespoons of olive oil or butter and about half a cup of cheese.
* Two tablespoons of olive oil, 2-3 cloves of minced garlic, and a quarter cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes. (If packed in oil, drain the tomatoes first.)
* Half a cup of canned sweet corn kernels and a quarter cup of sliced green Spanish olives.
* One minced jalapeño chili, seeds removed, and half a cup of cheddar cheese.
* Two tablespoons of butter and about half a cup of crumbled gorgonzola cheese. Top with carmelized onions.

Polenta is also delicious topped with your favorite tomato sauce or with an assortment of grilled vegetables. Chilled, firm polenta may be served cut into triangles alongside chili or other hearty stews. Leftover polenta may be cut into strips or triangles, coated in seasoned bread crumbs and grated Parmesan cheese, and fried in olive oil. Like pasta, the possibilities for this versatile dish are virtually endless, so feel free to experiment with additions and toppings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

In the previous chapter, you have learned how to actually create a webpage.

To reiterate you should have learned

* that webpages consist of plain text intermingled with mark-up;
* that the mark-up is part of a language called HyperText Mark-up Language;
* that the HyperText Mark-up Language is often abbreviated to HTML;
* that HTML must be valid, for various reasons;
* that you can use a text editor to mark a text up; and
* how to apply some basic HTML elements to a text, such as paragraphs (p), links/anchors (a), important and less important headings (h1, h2), images (img) etcetera.

In other words, you have learned some of the mechanics of creating a webpage, and if you have followed the exercises, you actually gained some experience in writing webpages.

Now, you will begin to learn how to apply that knowledge in a meaningful way.

As we observed before, there is no right or wrong way to make a webpage. The page may consist of valid or invalid HTML, but whether a page is successful depends solely on the goals you have set yourself and whether they were met. However, we have also noted that there is no way of knowing whether the goals were met for all visitors.

Generally, your goal will be to tell the world a story. 

If you manufacture lawnmowers, your goal with a webpage may be: 

* to entice people to buy your lawnmowers
* to teach customers about how to use their lawnmower
* to educate people about the dangers involved with lawnmowers
* to show stock-holders in your company how business is going
* to make it easy for the press to write about your lawnmowers
* to impart your love for making lawnmowers onto others
* to offer a community of lawnmower minded people the chance to interact with each other
* to show suppliers how to reach your factory
* to warn customers of shoddy look-a-like products
* to accuse competitors
* to respond to accusations of competitors
* ...

This list is endless. Who knows why somebody makes a webpage? There could be a million reasons.

But once you have committed yourself to telling your story, it would help if you could get your story across.

General writing skills are beyond the scope of this textbook. There are other Wikibooks (under development at the time of writing) that teach you exactly this. See for instance [[How to write an essay]].

== Reading problems on the web ==

Although few hard facts are known about this, it is generally assumed that reading from a screen is harder than from paper. For instance, it takes about 30% more time to read a text off a screen than off paper. Although little is known about the reason for this, it could be because most screens are static, while readers who use paper generally can move the paper around. Another theory holds that because the resolution of text on paper is much higher than that on screen (300dpi vs. 100dpi), it is 'easier for the eye' to read text off paper.

Most visitors browse websites using a browser that displays the contents of a webpage on a screen. The standard typography of web browsers seems to accommodate for a harder reading experience: paragraphs are separated by empty lines.

Regardless of how difficult it appears to be to read off a screen, web surfers have shown a marked preference for lay-outs that make it easier to scan a text for important points. Some of the qualities of these lay-outs are: 

* list-type information in lists
* clearly marked hyperlinks
* no horizontal (sideways) scrolling
* all the important information above the 'fold'
* inverted pyramid structuring of text

Often, visitors will print out text that they want to read with attention, while they skim over text that does not warrant such close scrutiny.

== Information scent ==

Whatever they are searching for, most web surfers follow a similar strategy in hopping from page to page. They will 'scan' (skim through) a webpage, looking for interesting information. They will seek out elements that seem most promising to deliver that information, such as headings, emphasized text, and hyperlinks. If within the first few seconds a webpage does not seem to promise interesting information, the visitor will hop on the most promising hyperlink out of there. If there are no promising hyperlinks, visitors may even use the Back function of their browsers to return to a previous page.

The trail of promising elements is similar to the trail a bloodhound follows when hunting prey. It is therefore said that elements on a webpage emit an 'information scent'. The stronger that scent, the more likely the user is to follow it.

However, if a certain type of element has been producing false trails often, users will start turning away from such elements. For instance, although animated content is much more attention grabbing than static content, visitors turn away from animations more and more. This may be because web surfers have started to equate animations with advertisements; and advertisements rarely contain the sort of information the visitor was looking for. 

By knowing how to make a webpage more accessible to those who use graphical browsers, and by knowing how to apply the right amount of 'scent' to certain elements on a page, the webpage author arms himself with the right tools to reach his audience optimally.

In the following, we will take a look at a couple of such tools.

=== Links vs. Text ===

The term Hypertext consists of two parts: 'hyper' and 'text'. Hyper is originally a Greek word meaning 'over', 'beyond'. Hypertext is something that takes text to a new level; but it still remains text. Hypertext has all the properties text has, and then some.

Although the title of this section makes it seem so, the extra properties of text, i.e. the (hyper)links, are not at war with the original text. At least not all the time. 

When the theories of the web experts are correct, a web user surfs from page to page, following a trail of information scent. Whether that user is looking for a specific piece of information and trying all likely avenues that may lead to that piece; whether a user is looking for specific information, but gets side-tracked by other information; or whether a user is not looking for information at all, but just for some fun; all seem to be using the same strategy of following a trail of promising leads.

The longer a visitor stays on a page that does not hold his interest, the more the likelihood increases that the visitor starts looking for a way to escape. Although the promised information or fun may lie in the plain text that is presented on a webpage, all the escape routes are embedded in hyperlinks. Chances are, therefore, that any text that does not immediately captivate a visitor's attention, is unlikely to be read later on, unless much of the preceding text has already made abundantly clear to the visitor that this is where he wants to stay.

Let me repeat again that it is not the author's task to entertain the reader. But an author who does not want to entertain readers, will find himself without an audience. Similarly, an author who sets out to maximize the sense of reward someone gets from reading his work, will reach the maximum audience for that type of work. 

''???more to follow''

=== The fold ===

The fold is a term that could in some sense be used for all media, but is pretty useless when speaking of streamed media such as speech. It is a term used for visual browsers, meaning the bottom edge of the first displayed part of a webpage.

For instance, if a webpage consists of fifty lines of text, but only the first twenty are displayed, the fold is beneath the twentieth and above the twenty-first line.

That may seem to be an arbitrary position to give its own name, but it is not, because webpage visitors will generally look at what's above the fold, not at what's beyond.

Unfortunately, it is not a very useful metric, as each visitor has his web browser set up in different ways, and so for each visitor the position of the fold may differ.

However, it teaches us that things that need to be viewed by as many visitors as possible, need to be as high up on a page as possible.

=== The inverted pyramid ===

So far we have discussed the difficulty with which a visitor reads a webpage off a screen, and with which haste he does so. Forget to grab the right person's attention, and he will disappear to the greener grass on other webpages. The web is quite vicious like that: all your competitors are your direct neighbour. 

In the section about the fold we discussed how it is important to maximize your readership by putting important information at the top. 

The method of writing a text with the most important sentence first, the second most important sentence second, the third most important sentence third, etcetera, is called the Inverted Pyramid. 

Traditional essay writing holds that a piece is structured as follows: introduction, expansion, conclusion. For most of us, it is pretty common practice to sit on important facts for awhile, and only reveal them as the piece progresses. As readers, we have become accustomed to text being structured like this, and are willing to show a certain amount of forgiveness when an author does not come to the point right away. On the web, we click away without even blinking our eyes when we encounter a text that does not immediately tell us what we want to know.

== Pitfalls ==

So far, we have been stressing what happens when a visitor does not find the information he is looking for. But what happens when the visitor does find what he is looking for: does web text still need to be as oddly contorted as described before in order to appeal to the visitor? 

One would hope not. How would Alice in Wonderland read if we had put the most important facts first? If we had put links to more interesting literature in the text? If we had forgone all artistic ambition just to satisfy some weary surfer, who wasn't going to read our text anyway?

The usability extremists would say, yes, there are no artistic values--just a new world, with new rules. 

Unfortunately for them, people do read on the web. They are moved by what they encounter. They have ways to circumvent the difficulties of the web medium. For instance, people who find an interesting text on the web often print it out, so that they can read it from an easier medium.

I would also argue, without any facts to back me up, that the nature of a text plays a role. Informative and persuasive texts may be constructed according to the guidelines given before, whereas entertaining texts may be constructed in the old-fashioned, pre-web way. 

If you are trying to sell me something, for instance, there's really no need to fluff up your text with &quot;marketese&quot;. More likely than not, I will hit the Back button of my browser faster than you can say 'percentage'. 

If you are trying to inform me of something, I might be more lenient. The trade we are making (you get my attention, I get your insights) is much more immediate, and therefore worth more to me. 

But even the authors of entertaining webpages can learn something here. The most important thing: you write for an audience. The medium plays a role in that. A hard rock band must use loud speakers. It's what the audience expects. (And of course, the hard rock band that knows this can play on this, and show their soft side in an 'unplugged' session--but such things are better only tried by those who understand their medium.)

Even if the entertaining text is going to be printed out, even if the user is going to sit in front of his screen and persevere through your entire, brilliant play, some of the methods outlined before make sense. 

Should you not use the inverted pyramid, you should at least use headings for headings, don't fiddle with font sizes (yes, this is unfortunately possible), let paragraphs stay separated by blank lines, etcetera. It is not rare to find that some author of science fiction stories has found out a way to display their story the same as on paper--forgetting in the mean time that he is not publishing on paper, and losing part of his audience.

Most of the promotional value of an entertaining text is in the text itself. Entertainment is highly valued: if what you wrote is good, others will link to it, including search engines. 

== Usability and Accessibility ==

The World Wide Web Consortium has produced a set of [http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines] that provide guidance on some areas of writing web pages. The guidelines are quite daunting at first. Don't try to understand them all in a single reading. Some guidelines are easy to follow whilst others can require significant effort.

[http://webxact.watchfire.com/ Watchfire's WebXACT] is a popular free online tool for checking pages for accessibility. Although it can only check some of the guidelines and occasionally fails pages that do meet the guidelines it is a good starting point for learning the guidelines.

[http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-interim-accessibility Checkpoint 10.4], &quot;Until user agents handle empty controls correctly, include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas.&quot;, is now considered unnecessary and has been removed from the draft of the next version of the guidelines. See the UK's Royal National Institute for the Blind's article [http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_placementext.hcsp Place-holding text in form elements] for more information.

[http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-abbreviated-and-foreign Checkpoint 4.2], &quot;Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where it first occurs.&quot; It is now considered good practice to markup all occurrences of an abbreviation instead of just the first occurrence. HTML 4.01 and XHTML1.0/1.1 have two elements for marking-up abbreviations. The &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;/code&gt; element is used to markup any abbreviation. The &lt;code&gt;acronym&lt;/code&gt; element can be used to markup acronyms. Since acronyms are a special type of abbreviation they can also be marked-up with &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;/code&gt;. Abbreviations that are not acronyms should not be marked-up with &lt;code&gt;acronym&lt;/code&gt;.

== Questions and Exercises ==

=== Exercise 3-1 ===

Behold the following text: &quot;It is always the dead that are praised, or so claim those who are unsuccessful while alive. Perhaps this is so, partly because some people only revere that which has passed. However, works that have withstood the test of time, have withstood its scrutiny. Long-dead authors that are still remembered, are remembered because of the quality of their work. And no work can be stiled that of a genius, until other works have come along against which it can be compared.&quot; (Free after Samuel Johnson's [http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/5429 &quot;Preface to Shakespeare&quot;].)

Rewrite this paragraph using the inverted pyramid.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A student of everything, I seek to seek to understand the limitations of reality.   I like brute force and am adverse to math related rigor.  My strengths include perturbation of reality and plot devices, heuristics, video game design, programming, Computers, Physics, Math, Chemistry, Engineering, Bio, Cooking, and 3D packing.  

To date I have started the [[Electronics]] Wikibook on Mar 8, 2004, which I hope to finish someday.

As background for the Electronics Wikibook, I started the [[Physics in English]] Wikibook on May 5, 2004.

I also started the [[Book For Geeks]] Wikibook on Apr 14, 2004, which I hope to work on some day.

Besides these books I have a number of other books I could write.

Personal bookcase (Things everyone should know):

* Technical books:
# [[Physics in English]]: Writings on a number of high level topics.
# [[Electronics]]: Build your own computers and radios.
# [[Languages_bookshelf]]: Pick a language any language.

* Information Theory books:

* Practical books:
# [[Book For Geeks]]: How to deal with the real world.

Halohydrin formation uses a cyclic bridged ion as an intermediate. Because of this, the stereochemistry of the reaction process is ''anti.''

== Welcome to the course ==
Welcome to a course in Norwegian. When you have completed this course, you should have enough knowledge to speak, read and write the language rather well. In order to learn a language properly, you must take action, you must ''do'' something. So I suggest, after you've learnt the basics, that you look up some simple, easy Norwegian literature, and start reading. &lt;!-- Link to nice, easy articles/text here later --&gt; Knowing what is easy is not easy if you don't know any Norwegian at all though. If you know somebody who is Norwegian, they might be able to help you to some nice reading. I will also try to put up some links to read like easy articles here later.

== General remarks about Norwegian ==
Written Norwegian is, in contrast to English, very close to pronunciation in spelling. This means that, like Spanish, it is always possible to guess how a word is pronounced in Norwegian. Although Norwegian can only be written in two ways, Bokmål and Nynorsk; how one speaks it is usually reflected in where you come from, by your dialect. There are nine vowels in Norwegian:

{| width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.5em;&quot; valign=top
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| a
| e
| i
| o
| u
| y
| æ
| ø
| å
|}

and 15 consonants:
{| width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.5em;&quot; valign=top
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| b
| d
| f
| g
| h
| j
| k
| l
| m
| n
| p
| r
| s
| t
| v
|}

The consonants '''c''', '''q''', '''w''', '''x''' and '''z''' appear only in words of foreign origin.

Finally, there are 7 diphthongs:
{| width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.5em;&quot; valign=top
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| ai
| au
| ei
| oy
| oi
| ui
| øy
|}

== Syllable division ==
Syllable division marks the natural break in a word. When you know where the syllables divide, you can divide a word into its natural sections. This makes speaking correctly easier. You also get a correct speech rhythm. The general rule for syllable division is that each syllable contains one vowel each.

=== Before one consonant ===

{| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
| en ta-le
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a speech'''
|-
| å so-ve
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''to sleep''
|-
| en sa-me
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a sami''
|}

=== Between two consonants ===

{| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
| ei jen-te
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a girl'''
|-
| å san-ke
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''to gather''
|-
| et styk-ke
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a piece''
|}

=== Between two vowels that do not form a diphthong ===

{| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
| en bo-a
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a boa''
|-
| en ra-di-o
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a radio''
|-
| en ge-o-graf
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a geographer''
|-
| et pi-a-no
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a piano''
|-
| en ko-a-la
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a koala''
|}

== Information about the language ==
First of all, if you're a native English speaker, German speaker, or native in any other [[w:Germanic languages|Germanic]] language, learning Norwegian shouldn't be too difficult, as it will have some common traits with your own. I am not saying, however, that it will be easy just because of it.

=== Alphabet ===
The Norwegian alphabet is almost the same as in English, except for three additional letters, æ/Æ, ø/Ø and å/Å. These have no special function in sentences/words, they are normal letters, and you will see them in use nearly as much as any other letters would be in use in English.

Here's how to say the alphabet letter by letter:
{| width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
| 
{| width=&quot;100%&quot; align=left style=&quot;border-right: solid 1px black; background: transparent;&quot;

=== Bokmål and Nynorsk ===
There are two official written forms of the Norwegian language. This specific course will teach you Bokmål, which is the most widely used (85%). However, the two forms are very similar and you should not have great difficulties in understanding written Nynorsk. For more information about this, check out the Wikipedia article on the [[w:Norwegian language|Norwegian language]]. &lt;!--Because it is what I know, but I hope someone will put up a Nynorsk edition too, because I can't--&gt;

== Getting Started ==
Okay, if you're ready, all you gotta do is proceed to [[Norwegian Lesson 1|Lesson 1]]!

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Lesson One'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Pronunciation Guide==
Pronunciation in Norwegian can be quite different from English pronunciation. There are three extra letters: æ, ø, and å (sometimes written &quot;aa&quot;). The letter &quot;æ&quot; is pronounced like the letter &quot;a&quot; in the English word &quot;mad&quot;. The letter &quot;ø&quot; is pronounced like the letters &quot;e&quot; and &quot;u&quot; together. The sound is prominent in French words, as in the words &quot;peu&quot; and &quot;deux&quot;. The letter &quot;å&quot; is pronounced like &quot;aw&quot;. The best way to make this sound is to form one's mouth as if one were going to say the short &quot;o&quot; sound in English, but then making an English &quot;a&quot; sound. There are also other variations in Norwegian pronuncation. The letter &quot;s&quot; becomes a &quot;sh&quot; sound when followed by the letter &quot;l&quot; or when following the letter &quot;r&quot; (i.e. norsk is pronounced &quot;norshk&quot;). The letter &quot;r&quot; is pronounced like the Spanish &quot;r&quot;, but is never rolled. The &quot;r&quot; sound in Norsk is produced simply by rapping the tongue against the hard palate once. The letter &quot;g&quot; is pronounced like 'g' in &quot;good&quot;, but like 'y' in &quot;yes&quot; before i or j, and silent at the end of some words. The letter &quot;j&quot; is like the English letter &quot;y&quot;. The letter &quot;d&quot; is pronounced like the English &quot;d&quot;, but is in most cases silent at the end of a syllable or at the end of a word. The letters &quot;q&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are generally only found in foreign words and have no real function in Norsk.

===Gender===
In Norwegian, every noun (a person, place, thing, or idea) has a gender assigned to it. There are three genders in Norwegian - Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter. There are very few feminine nouns used in Norwegian, and many people simply treat them as masculine nouns, so in this course, we will combine the masculine and feminine genders into the &quot;common gender&quot;.

Below are two nouns - One neuter noun, one common noun.


'''Vin''' [veen]: Wine

'''Øl''' [euhl]: Beer


'''Vin''' is common, and '''Øl''' is neuter. Why does this matter? It matters because it affects the way you treat these words. An example is with the Norwegian word for &quot;one&quot;, which can either be &quot;en&quot; or &quot;ett&quot;.


'''En vin''' [en veen]: A wine [en vin]

'''Ett øl''' [en euhl]: A beer


Common gender words use &quot;en&quot; for one, while Neuter gender words use &quot;ett&quot; for one. We will cover more on gender later.

===Forming Questions===
To form a question in Norwegian, invert the verb and noun. For instance...

'''Du kommer fra:''' You come from (A statement)
'''Kommer du fra:''' Do you come from (lit: come you from) (A question)

You can also form a question by adding a question word (what, where, who, etc). So far, you have learned the words &quot;hvordan&quot;, &quot;hva&quot;, and &quot;hvor&quot;.

'''Hva lærer du?''' What are you learning?
'''Hvordan har du det?''' How are you?
'''Hvor kommer du fra?''' Where do you come from?


===Exercises===
Turn the following statements into questions. &lt;!-- NB: exercises are for the student not the author! --&gt;

'''1.''' ''Du er norsk.''                     &lt;!--          Er du norsk? --&gt;

'''2.''' ''Jeg er engelsk.''                  &lt;!--          Er jeg engelsk? --&gt;

'''3.''' ''Du bor i Bergen.''                 &lt;!--          Bor du i Bergen? --&gt;

'''4.''' ''Du har det bra.''                  &lt;!--          Har du det bra? --&gt;

'''5.''' ''Du studerer engelsk i London.''    &lt;!--          Studerer du engelsk in London? --&gt;          

'''6.''' ''Jeg kommer fra Norge.''            &lt;!--          Kommer du fra Norge? --&gt;

'''7.''  'Jeg heter ali.''                    &lt;!--          Heter jeg ali?--&gt;

At Wikibooks, '''stubs''' are short, apparently incomplete [[WB:MODULE|module]]s.

Typically, a stub appears because someone creates a new chapter or module of a book which is missing most of the intended content. Stubs tend to contain only a brief description or a suggestion of what the content should be. An incomplete table of contents is also a stub. (If the module only contains nonsense, then it can be [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy|marked for speedy deletion]].)

== Templates ==
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Markup
! Display
|-
| {{tl|stub}}
| {{stub|example=yes}}
|-
| {{tl|chapter stub}}
| {{chapter stub|example=yes}}
|-
| {{tl|sectstub}}
| {{sectstub|example=yes}}
|-
| {{tl|incomplete}}
| {{incomplete|example=yes}}
|}

You can use {{tl|stub}} to mark any stub. When one section of a module is a stub, then you can use {{tl|sectstub}}.

The {{tl|incomplete}} marker does not add the page to any category. Some users prefer this to the stub marker.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Lesson 2 ~ ''Grunnleggende grammatikk'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Gender of Nouns ==
Norwegian Bokmål has three genders - feminine, masculine and neuter. Each noun is associated with one specific gender only. There are no simple rules for knowing which noun belongs to which gender; the only way of learning is to memorize it. However, nearly all feminine words can also be used as masculine words. In fact the dialect of Bergen, which is the second largest city in Norway, has no feminine gender, the same goes for the moderate version of Bokmål and Riksmål (the traditional written form of Bokmål which still is used by many). For example, the noun &quot;dame&quot; (&quot;lady&quot; or &quot;woman&quot;) can be inflected as: ''ei dame/en dame - dama/damen'' (a woman - the woman), or ''ei dør/en dør - døra/døren'' (a door - the door). In addition, very few common words actually belong to neuter. This means that you can mostly assume that nouns are masculine, and just memorize those that are neuter.

In English, inflection of nouns can only be done using a/an/the. This is because the word &quot;cat&quot;/&quot;cats&quot; is the same in both the indefinite and the definite form. In Norwegian, this is done by inflecting the noun instead. Notice also that the ending 't' of the definite singular neuter is silent; it's not meant to be pronounced.

=== Basic Inflection Patterns ===
Here are examples from each of the three genders. Inflection pattern is marked with '''bold text'''.

| hest'''er'''
| hest'''ene'''
|-
| n
| '''et''' brev
| brev'''et'''
| brev
| brev'''a'''/brev'''ene'''
|}
|}

However, in Norwegian Bokmål, there's an alternative method of inflecting nouns, which basically turns feminine nouns into masculine. This is both accepted and common to do. If you choose to do this, you should also avoid using the '''a'''-form of the definite plural neuter. 

When speaking, it is not unusual to mix the masculine and feminine inflection of nouns. For example, you could say: ''en klokke'' - ''klokka'' (a clock - the clock). Here, the indefinite singular form is in mascular (&quot;en klokke&quot; instead of &quot;ei klokke&quot;) while the definite singular form is in feminine.

Check out [[../Appendix 1|Appendix 1: Advanced Noun Inflection]] to see all the ways the nouns can be inflected.

== Definite and Indefinite Articles ==

&lt;!-- === The Definite Article ===
In English, the definite article is always &quot;the&quot;

In Norwegian, the definite article is the same for all nouns except for neuter singular. The use of the definite article is not the same in Norwegian as it is in English. This is because of the way the nouns are inflected. Take this example:

*I want '''the''' car
*Jeg vil ha bil'''en'''

If you type
*Jeg vil ha '''den''' bilen
what you actually mean is
*I want '''that''' car.

!
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| f
| den
| de
|-
| m
| den
| de
|-
| n
| det
| de
|}
|}

(I believe we actually don't have a definite article in Norwegian...) --&gt;

==== The Indefinite Article ====
In English the indefinite articles are &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; (singular) or &quot;some&quot; (plural).

In Norwegian, the indefinite singular articles are dependent upon the gender of the noun being addressed. The indefinite plural article is the same for all genders. In the previous tables, you've already been introduced to the singular indefinite articles.

|-
| f
| ei/en
| flere/noen
|-
| m
| en
| flere/noen
|-
| n
| et
| flere/noen
|}
|}

== Personal Pronouns ==
These are very similar to the English personal pronouns. You'll quickly recognize them

| You
| Dere
| You
|-
| 3rd Person Plural/&lt;br&gt;Polite 2nd Person Singular
| De
| They
| Dem
| Them
|}
|}
The Polite 2nd Person Singular forms 'De' and 'Dem' and the Polite 2nd Person Plural form 'Dere' are always capitalized, unlike the other pronouns which follow normal rules for casing. For example, while ''&quot;Jeg elsker dem&quot;'' means ''&quot;I love them&quot;'', ''&quot;Jeg elsker Dem&quot;'' means ''&quot;I love you&quot;''. As a sidenote, the use of these polite forms is becoming rarer, and they are very seldom used in everyday language.

Both “den” and “det” mean “it”. If the noun is masculine or feminine, “den” is used, while “det” is used if the noun is neutral.

== Verbs ==
Learning verbs in Norwegian is easier than most other things you have learnt so far. Unlike English, verbs do not inflect depending on whether the subject is in plural/singular or 1st/2nd/3rd person. Here's an example - the verb &quot;to be&quot; and &quot;to run&quot;:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Appendix A: Advanced Noun Inflections ==

Unfortunately, there is not just one way to inflect a noun per gender. Each gender has several patterns, not to mention that there are plenty of irregular nouns as well.

=== Explanations of the left column in the inflection tables of the genders ===

{| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
| 1, 2, ...
| These indicate the different versions of inflection, like for instance&lt;br&gt; where ''m1'', '''gutter''' - ends with r, while ''m2'', '''lærere''' - ends with re.
|-
| b, c, ...
| This means it is just a variant of the same version, like for instance&lt;br&gt; where ''m1'', '''en gutt''' - has a double consonant at the end, while &lt;br&gt;''m1b'', '''en dam''' - has a single consonant at the end.&lt;br&gt;(However, the rest of the inflection pattern is equal, so it is a variant)
|-
| *
| This sign indicates a special case, such as '''(en) januar''' - (a) January.&lt;br&gt;
if it were represented with an article it would be ''en'', but it is very&lt;br&gt;
seldom used.
|-
| &lt;
| This sign indicates that the indefinite plural of a noun is the same as&lt;br&gt;
the indefinate singular (except for the article)
|}

=== Feminine Specific Inflection Patterns ===
There are three feminine inflection patterns.

{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #ffd6d6; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top

== Introduction ==
Data schemas are the foundation of all XML pages.  They define objects, their relationships, their attributes, and the structure of the data model.  Without them, XML documents would not exist.
In this chapter, you will come to understand the purpose of XML data schemas, their intricate parts, and how to utilize them.  Also, examples will be included for you to copy when creating your own data schema, making your job a lot easier.  At the bottom of this Web page a whole Schema has been included, from which parts have been included in the different sections throughout this chapter.  Refer to it if you would like to see how the whole Schema works as one.

== Overview of Data Schemas ==
The data schema, all technicalities aside, is the data model with which all the XML information is conveyed.  It has a hierarchy structure starting with a root element (to be explained later) and goes all the way down to cover even the most minute detail of the model with detailed steps in between.  
Data schemas have two main parts, the &lt;i&gt;entities&lt;/i&gt; and their &lt;i&gt;relationships&lt;/i&gt;.  The entities contained in a data schema represent objects from the model.  They have unique identifiers, attributes, and names for what kind of object they are.  The relationships in the schema represent the relationships between the objects, simple enough.  Relationships can be one to one, one to many, many to many, recursive, and any other kind you could find in a data model.
Now we will begin to create our own data schema.

== Starting your schema the right way ==
All schemas begin the same way, no matter what type of objects they represent.  The first line in &lt;u&gt;every&lt;/u&gt; Schema is this declaration:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 1:  XML Declaration &lt;/small&gt;

Exhibit 1 simply tells the browser or whatever file/program accessing this schema that it is an XML file and uses the encoding structure &quot;UTF-8&quot;.  You can copy this to use to start your own XML file.
Next comes the Namespace declaration:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:schema xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; elementFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 2:  Namespace Declaration &lt;/small&gt;

Namespaces are basically dictionaries containing definitions of most of the coding in the schema.  For example, when creating a schema, if you declare an object to be of type &quot;String&quot;, the definition of the type &quot;String&quot; is contained in the Namespace along with all of its attributes.  This is true for most of the code you write.  If you have made or seen other schemas, most of the code is prefaced by &quot;xsd:&quot;.  A good example is something like &quot;xsd:sequence&quot; or &quot;xsd:complexType&quot;.  sequence and complexType are both objects defined in the Namespace that has been linked to the prefix &quot;xsd&quot;.  In fact, you could theoretically name the default Namespace anything, as long as you referenced it the same way throughout the Schema.  The most common Namespace which contains most of the XML objects is &lt;i&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  Now onto Exhibit 2.

The first part lets any file/program know that this file is a schema.  Pretty easy to understand.  Like the XML declaration, this is universal to XML schemas and you can use it in yours.  The second part is the actual Namespace declaration; xmlns stands for '''XML''' '''N'''ame'''S'''pace.  This defines the Schema's default Namespace and is usually the one given in the code.  Again, I would recommend using this code to start your Schemas.  The last part is difficult to understand, but here is a pretty detailed explanation.  Using &quot;unqualified&quot; is most applicable until you get to some really complicated code.

== Entities in general ==
Entities are basically the objects a Schema is created to represent.  As stated before, they have attributes and relationships.  We will now go much further into explaining exactly what they are and how to write code for them.

There are two types of Entities: '''simpleType''' and '''complexType'''.  A simpleType object has one value associated with it.  A string is a perfect example of a simpleType object as it only contains the value of the string.  Most simpleTypes used will be defined in the default Namespace; however, you can define your own simpleType at the bottom of the Schema (this will be brought up in the restrictions section).  Because of this, the only objects you will most often need to include in your Schema are complexTypes.  A complexType is an object with more than one attribute associated with it, and it may or may not have a child elements attached to it.  Here is an example of a complexType object:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;GenreType&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;movie&quot; type=&quot;MovieType&quot; minOccurs=&quot;1&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
&lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 3:  The complexType Element &lt;/small&gt;

This code begins with the declaration of a complexType and its name.  When other entities refer to it, such as a parent element, it will refer to this name.  The 2nd line begins the sequence of attributes and child elements, which are all declared as an &quot;element&quot;.  The elements are declared as elements with the 1st part of the line of code, and their name to which other documents will refer is included as the &quot;name&quot; as the 2nd part.  After the first two declarations comes the &quot;type&quot; declaration.  Note that for the ''name'' and ''description'' elements their type is &quot;xsd:string&quot; showing that the type string is defined in the Namespace &quot;xsd&quot;.  For the ''movie'' element, the type is &quot;MovieType&quot;, and because there is no Namespace before &quot;MovieType&quot;, it is assumed that this type is included in this Schema.  (it could refer to a type defined in another Schema if the other Schema was included at the top of the Schema.  don't worry about that now)  &quot;minOccurs&quot; and &quot;maxOccurs&quot; represents the relationship between Genre's and MovieTypes.  &quot;minOccurs&quot; can be either 0 or an arbitrary number, depending only on the data model.  &quot;maxOccurs&quot; can be either 1 (a one to one relationship), an arbitrary number (a one to many relationship), or &quot;unbounded&quot; (a one to many relationship).

For each schema, there must be one &lt;b&gt;root element&lt;/b&gt;.  This entity contains every other entity underneath it in the hierarchy.  For instance, when creating a schema to include a list of movies, the root element would be something like MovieDatabase, or maybe MovieCollection, just something that would logically contain all the other objects (like genre, movie, actor, director, plotline, etc.)  It is always started with this line of code: &lt;code&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; showing that it is the root element and then goes on as a normal complexType.  All other objects will begin with either simpleType or complexType.  Here is sample code for a MovieDatabase root element:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;MovieDatabase&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
       &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
         &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;Genre&quot; type=&quot;GenreType&quot; minOccurs=&quot;1&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;/&gt;            
       &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
     &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
   &lt;/xsd:element&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 4:  The Root Element &lt;/small&gt;

This represents a MovieDatabase where the child element of MovieDatabase is a Genre.  From there it goes onto movie, etc.  We will continue to use this example help you better understand.

== The Parent / Child Relationship ==
The Parent / Child Relationship is a key topic in Data Schemas.  It represents the basic structure of the data model's hierarchy by clearly laying out the top down configuration.  Look at this piece of code which shows how movies have actors associated with them:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;MovieType&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;       
    &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;actor&quot; type=&quot;ActorType&quot; minOccurs=&quot;1&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
&lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
     
&lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;ActorType&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;lname&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;fname&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
&lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 5:  The Parent/Child Relationship&lt;/small&gt;

Within each MovieType, there is an element named &quot;actor&quot; which is of &quot;ActorType&quot;.  When the XML document is populated with information, the surrounding tags for actor will be &lt;code&gt;&lt;actor&gt;&lt;/actor&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;&lt;ActorType&gt;&lt;/ActorType&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  To keep your Schema flowing smoothly and without error, the ''type'' field in the Parent Element will always equal the ''name'' field in the declaration of the complexType Child Element.

== Attributes and Restrictions ==
An attribute of an entity is a simpleType object in that it only contains one value.  &lt;code&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;lname&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a good example of an attribute.  It is declared as an element, has a name associated with it, and has a type declaration.  Located in the appendix of this chapter is a long list of simpleTypes built into the default Namespace.  Attributes are incredibly simple to use, until you try and restrict them.

In some cases, certain data must abide by a standard to maintain data integrity.  An example of this would be a Social Security number or an email address.  If you have a database of email addresses that sends mass emails to, you would need all of them to be valid addresses, or else you'd get tons of error messages each time you send out that mass email.  To avoid this problem, you can essentially take a known simpleType and add a restriction to it to better suit your needs.  Now you can do this two ways, but one is simpler and better to use in Data Schemas.  You could edit the simpleType within its declaration in the Parent Element, but it gets messy, and if another Schema wants to use it, the code must be written again.  The better way to do it is to list a new type at the bottom of the Schema that edits a previously known simpleType.  Here is an example of this with a Social Security number:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:simpleType name=&quot;emailaddressType&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xsd:restriction base=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsd:pattern value=&quot;[^@]+@[^\.]+\..+&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:restriction&gt;
&lt;/xsd:simpleType&gt;
   
&lt;xsd:simpleType name=&quot;ssnType&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xsd:restriction base=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsd:pattern value=&quot;\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:restriction&gt;
&lt;/xsd:simpleType&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 6:  Restriction on a simpleType &lt;/small&gt;

This was included in the Schema below the last Child Element and before the closing &lt;code&gt;&lt;/xsd:schema&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  The first line declares the simpleType and gives it a name, &quot;ssnType&quot;.  You could name yours anything you want, as long as you reference it correctly throughout the Schema.  By doing this, you can use this type anywhere in the Schema, or anywhere in another Schema, provided the references are correct.  The second line lets the Schema know it is a restricted type and its base is a string defined in the default Namespace.  Basically, this type is a string with a restriction on it, and the third line is the actual restriction.  It can be one of many types of restrictions, which are listed in the Appendix of this chapter.  This one happens to be of type &quot;pattern&quot;.  A &quot;pattern&quot; means that only a certain sequence of characters will be allowed in the XML document and is defined in the &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt; field.  This particular one means three digits, a hyphen, two digits, a hyphen, and four digits.  To learn more about how to use restrictions, follow this [http://www.w3schools.com/schema/schema_elements_ref.asp link ] to the W3 school's section on restrictions.

== Not of little import:  Introducing the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xsd:import&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag ==
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;xsd:import&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used to import a schema document and the namespace associated with the data types defined within the schema document.  This allows an XML schema document to reference a type library using namespace names (prefixes).  Let's take a closer look at a simple XML instance document for a store that uses these multiple namespace names:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;store:SimpleStore xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
  xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/SimpleStore.xsd&quot;
  xmlns:store=&quot;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/Store&quot;
  xmlns:MGR=&quot;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/CoreSchema&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- Note the explicitly defined namespace declarations, the prefix store 
     represents data types defined in the     
     &lt;code&gt;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/Store.xml&lt;/code&gt; namespace and the 
     prefix MGR represents data types defined in the 
     &lt;code&gt;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/CoreSchema&lt;/code&gt; namespace. 
     Also, notice that there is no default namespace declaration – every element
     and attribute must be associated with a namespace (we will see this is 
     necessary weh we examine the schema document)  
--&gt;
  &lt;store:Store&gt;
    &lt;MGR:Name xmlns:MGR=&quot; http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/CoreSchema &quot;&gt;
      &lt;MGR:FirstName&gt;Michael&lt;/MGR:FirstName&gt;
      &lt;MGR:MiddleNames&gt;Jay&lt;/MGR:MiddleNames&gt;
      &lt;MGR:LastName&gt;Fox&lt;/MGR:LastName&gt;
    &lt;/MGR:Name&gt;
    &lt;store:StoreName&gt;The Gap&lt;/store:StoreName&gt;
    &lt;store:StoreAddress&gt;
      &lt;store:Street&gt;86 Nowhere Ave.&lt;/store:Street&gt;
      &lt;store:City&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/store:City&gt;
      &lt;store:State&gt;CA&lt;/store:State&gt;
      &lt;store:ZipCode&gt;75309&lt;/store:ZipCode&gt;
    &lt;/store:StoreAddress&gt;
    &lt;!-- More store information would go here. --&gt;
  &lt;/store:Store&gt;
  &lt;!-- More stores would go here. --&gt;
&lt;/store:SimpleStore&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 7 XML Instance Document – [http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/store.xml]&lt;/small&gt;


Let's look at the schema document and see how the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xsd:import&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag was used to import data types from a type library (external schema document).

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:schema xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
  xmlns=&quot;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/Store.xml&quot;
  xmlns:MGR=&quot;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/CoreSchema&quot;
  targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/Store.xml&quot; elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- The prefix MGR is bound to the following namespace name: 
          &lt;code&gt;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/CoreSchema&lt;/code&gt;
          The managerTypeLib.xsd schema document is imported by associating the 
          schema with the &lt;code&gt;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/CoreSchema&lt;/code&gt; 
          namespace name, which was bound to the MGR prefix. 
          The elementFormDefault attribute has the value ‘qualified' indicating that 
          an XML instance document must use qualified names for every element(default
          namespace can not be used)  
--&gt;
  &lt;!-- The target namespace and default namespace are the same  --&gt;
  &lt;xsd:import namespace=&quot;http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/CoreSchema&quot;
    schemaLocation=&quot;ManagerTypeLib.xsd&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;SimpleStore&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;Store&quot; type=&quot;StoreType&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:element&gt;
  &lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;StoreType&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xsd:element ref=&quot;MGR:Name&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;StoreName&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;StoreAddress&quot; type=&quot;StoreAddressType&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
  &lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;StoreAddressType&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;Street&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;City&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;State&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;ZipCode&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
&lt;/xsd:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 8: XML Schema [http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/SimpleStore.xsd&lt;/small&gt;


Like the include tag and the redefine tag, the import tag is another means of incorporating any data types from an external schema document into another schema document and must occur before any element or attribute declarations. These mechanisms are important when XML schemas are modularized and type libraries are being maintained and used in multiple schema documents.

== When the whole is greater than the sum of its parts:&lt;br&gt; Schema Modularization ==
Now that we have covered all three methods of incorporating external XML schemas, let’s consider the importance of these mechanisms. As is typical with most programming code, redundancy is frowned upon; this is true for custom data type definitions as well. If a custom data type already exists that can be applied to an element in your schema document, does it not make sense to use this data type rather than create it again within your new schema document? Moreover, if you know that a single data type can be reused for several applications, should you not have a method for referencing that data type when you need it?  

The idea behind modular schemas is to examine what your schema does, determine what data types are frequently used in one form or another and develop a type library. As your needs for more complex schemas increase you can continue to add to your library, reuse data types in your type library, and redefine those data types as needed. An example of this reuse would be a schema for customer information – different departments would use different schemas as they would need only partial customer information. However most, if not all, departments would need some specific customer information, like name and contact information, which could be incorporated in the individual departmental schema documents.

Schema modularization is a “best practice”. By maintaining a type library and reusing and redefining types in the type library, you can help ensure that your XML schema documents don't become overwhelming and difficult to read. Readability is important, because you may not be the only one using these schemas, and it is important that others can easily understand your schema documents.

== “Choose, but choose wisely…”: Schema alternatives ==
Thus far in this book we have only discussed XML schemas as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  Yet there are other methods of defining the data contained within an XML instanced document, but we will only mention the two most popular and well known alternatives: Document Type Definition (DTD) and Relax NG Schema.

We will cover DTDs in the next chapter. Relax NG schema is a newer and has many of the same features that W3C XML schema have; Relax NG also claims to be simpler, and easier to learn, but this is very subjective.
For more about Relax NG, visit: http://www.relaxng.org/

First is the full Schema used in the examples throughout this chapter:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

It’s time to go back to the beginning…and review all of the schema data types, elements, and attributes that we have covered thus far (and maybe a few that we have not). The following tables will detail the XML data types, elements and attributes that can be used in an XML Schema.

&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Primitive Types&lt;/h4&gt;

This is a table with all the primitive types the attributes in your schema can be.

|- 
|| \s
|| for any white space (including space, tab, newline, and return)

      <comment>/* Types and properties of sequences */ this really needs a complete rewrite, but for now just add some important missing things</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''sequence''' is an ordered list of objects (or events). Like a set, it contains members (also called ''elements'' or ''terms''), and the number of terms (possibly infinite) is called the ''length'' of the sequence. Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence.

For example, (C, R, Y) is a sequence of letters that differs from (Y, C, R), as the ordering matters. Sequences can be ''finite'', as in this example, or ''infinite'', such as the sequence of all even positive integers (2, 4, 6,...).
[[Image:Cauchy sequence illustration2.png|right|thumb|250px|An infinite sequence of real numbers (in blue). This sequence is neither increasing, nor decreasing, nor convergent. It is however bounded.]]

== Examples and notation ==
There are various and quite different notions of sequences in mathematics,
some of which (e.g., exact sequence) are not covered by the notations introduced below.

A sequence may be denoted (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...). For shortness, the notation (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is also used. 

A more formal definition of a '''finite sequence''' with terms in a set ''S'' is a function from  {1, 2, ..., ''n''} to ''S'' for some ''n'' ≥ 0.  An '''infinite sequence''' in ''S'' is a function from {1, 2, ...} (the set of natural numbers without 0) to ''S''.

Sequences may also start from 0, so the first term in the sequence is then  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

A finite sequence is also called an n-tuple. Finite sequences include the ''empty sequence'' ( ) that has no elements.

A function from all integers into a set is sometimes called a '''bi-infinite sequence''', since it may be thought of as a sequence indexed by negative integers grafted onto a sequence indexed by positive integers.

==Types and properties of sequences==
A subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence formed from the given sequence by deleting some of the elements (which, as stated in the introduction, can also be called &quot;terms&quot;) without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.

If the terms of the sequence are a subset of an ordered set, then a ''monotonically increasing'' sequence is one for which each term is greater than or equal to the term before it; if each term is strictly greater than the one preceding it, the sequence is called ''strictly monotonically increasing''. A monotonically decreasing sequence is defined similarly. Any sequence fulfilling the monotonicity property is called monotonic or ''monotone''. This is a special case of the more general notion of a monotonic function. A sequence that both increases and decreases (at different places in the sequence) is said to be ''non-monotonic'' or ''non-monotone''.

The terms ''non-decreasing'' and ''non-increasing'' are often used in order to avoid any possible confusion with strictly increasing and strictly decreasing, respectively.
If the terms of a sequence are integers, then the sequence is an integer sequence.
If the terms of a sequence are polynomials, then the sequence is a polynomial sequence.

If ''S'' is endowed with a topology (as is true of real numbers, for example), then it becomes possible to consider the ''convergence'' of an infinite sequence in ''S''. Such considerations involve the concept of the ''limit of a sequence''.&lt;!-- so give the definition here... --&gt;

It can be shown that bounded monotonic sequences must converge.&lt;!-- state as theorem and proof? --&gt;

==Sequences in analysis==
In analysis, when talking about sequences, one will generally consider sequences of the form
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(x_0, x_1, x_2, ...)\,&lt;/math&gt;
which is to say, infinite sequences of elements indexed by natural numbers.
(It may be convenient to have the sequence start with an index different from 1 or 0. For example, the sequence defined by  ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1/log(''n'') would be defined only for ''n'' &amp;ge; 2.
When talking about such infinite sequences, it is usually sufficient (and does not change much for most considerations) to assume that the members of the sequence are defined at least for all indices large enough, that is, greater than some given ''N''.)

The most elementary type of sequences are numerical ones, that is, sequences of real or complex numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The norm in Norwegian is to write numbers from one to twelve using letters and the numbers from 13 and above using numbers. It is recommended not to mix letters and numbers within the same sentence (or even within the same paragraph or the same document), so it would be better to write “from one to fifty cars” or “from 1 to 50 cars” than “from one to 50 cars”. When spelt with letters, they are either spelt in one word (''hundreogtrettito'') or separately (''hundre og tretti to'').

The decimal mark in Norwegian is the comma and the thousands separator is a blank space, so 987654 divided by 100 equals 9&amp;nbsp;876,54. Not all Norwegians follow these rules, so pay attention when a website prompt you for a number as the website will usually tell you what decimal mark to use (or even prompt for the decimals in a separate field).

In Old Norse, numbers one through four were all inflected in three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and four cases (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive). In modern Norwegian, most of the inflection is gone. The official orthography only contains inflected forms of ''one'', but some dialects have kept a larger portion. However, the case inflection is gone everywhere. The early Nynorsk orthography kept the gender inflection of all four numbers, but the forms gradually merged.

|&lt;small&gt;In Bokmål, masc. and fem. are sometimes merged into a common gender (''én''). The common gender is inherited from written Danish and is therefore not allowed in Nynorsk, which has always used three genders.

|Tre (tri)
|&lt;small&gt;Earlier ''tri'' in Nynorsk, still part of the official orthography, but not to be used by the authorities. Origin: Old Norse ''þrír'' (masc.), ''þrjár'' (fem.), ''þrjú'' (neuter).&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Appendix P: Norwegian Pronunciation ==
The pronunciation is indicated in [[w:IPA|IPA]]. The sounds are best learned from a native speaker. Whenever possible, practice these with a native speaker. Reading aloud will also help your confidence. Note that the Norwegian language is full of dialects, so there are several ways of pronouncing the words. Foreign learners are usually taught to speak the way that people in the Oslo-area speak. 
=== Vowels ===
The Norwegian vowels:

{| width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.5em;&quot; valign=top
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| a
| e
| i
| o
| u
| y
| æ
| ø
| å
|}

The main rule is that long vowels occur before single consonants, short vowels occur before double consonants. This is no absolute rule, though, as you will see in the examples below. '''Notice''': the short '''o''' sound is actually never to be found written with an ''o''! (It's usually represented by ''u'')

These are also quite equal to the English language, except that Norwegian does not have '''{{IPA|θ}}''', (as in ''thin'') '''{{IPA|ð}}''' (as in ''this'') '''{{IPA|ʒ}}''' (as in ''measure'') and '''{{IPA|z}}''', (as in ''zing'') but at the other hand, norwegians have the '''{{IPA|ç}}''' sound, which is sort of a ''stiffer'' version of the '''{{IPA|ʃ}}''' sound (as in German ''ich''). The '''ç''' sound is similar to the &quot;h&quot; in many English dialects' pronunciation of ''huge''.

=== Tonemes ===
Norwegian has two contrasting tonemes. These are kind of hard to describe using text, and some also say that foreigners (to Norway) are even unable to distinguish one from the other. However, they do exist. In the words indicated with 1 and a hacek, the tone is normal in the first part of the word, and rises in the last part of the word. In the words indicated with 2, the word is pronounced like any other normal word. (In other words, it's very hard to say 1 words in a monotone voice) Here are two examples:

{| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
! Example
! IPA
!English word
|-
| b'''ønd'''er

| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| l'''o'''ven
| ¹{{IPA|lɔ̌ːven}}
|the law
|-
| l'''å'''ven
| ²{{IPA|lɔːven}}
|the barn
|}

'''Notice''': The two last examples are ''very'' similar to each other even though they are different, and I am actually somewhat unsure if it's loven or låven which is the more &quot;special&quot; one. &lt;!--Someone correct me if they knnow.--&gt;

Suppose you have a full bottle containing twenty-four ounces of liquid. You also have three empty bottles: one of five ounces, one of eleven ounces, and one of thirteen ounces. How could you divide the twenty-four ounces of liquid into three equal parts, so that you have three bottles containing eight ounces of liquid each?

Having browsed wikipedia for a while now (not authored anything), I thought to myself &quot;You should help make an anatomy and physiology textbook&quot;. And so that's what I'm going to do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cool, I see that I've arrived just as an anatomy book is being started. My first issue, before I dive in, is that most textbooks I've seen have been anatomy and physiology. Here they're listed as two seperate books. I think it would be easier and more natural to have an A&amp;P book, what do you think? -StudentBScN

== Probably better separated ==

Recognized textbooks are written for either Anatomy or Physiology, not both, because the author is either an anatomist or a physiologist. Integrating anatomy and physiology is a new trend aimed at making things easier for students. I believe the anatomy book here should be separate from the physiology book, and we can easily create hyperlinks between the two books. It is also easier to write about a single topic instead of two. Besides, the plan in this book seems to be copying text over from Gray's anatomy, which is now considered public domain, if we integrate both, then this will be harder.

So my suggestion is to leave this as an anatomy book. A good idea might be created yet another book that integrates both anatomy and physiology.

:I agree. These books would certainly do better to be separated. There is a new, but active effort at [[Human Physiology]] to make a physiology book here, and there is plenty of material to create a single anatomy book as well. Keep the books separated, but provide cross links between them where necessary. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:27, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

:I also agree. I think it would be best to leave them as two books. The idea of the third book which integrates them also sounds good to me. [[User:DavidMendoza|DavidMendoza]] ([[User talk:DavidMendoza|talk]]) 20:56, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

== Digging Inn ==

23Sept2005, I can see this book has not been touched in well over a year so I'm going to dig right in.  If I do anything anyone has a problem I am sure that you will let me know.  I'm going to start with a unit on the Skelital System.

== Anatomy vs Human Anatomy ==

I didn't see anyone mention anything about the distinction between the [[Anatomy]] book and the [[Human Anatomy]] book. I think they should remain separate and that the Anatomy book should deal with the general subject whereas Human Anatomy should concentrate on human anatomy.

Right now neither have very much, so I will get to work on this one. If anyone has problems with what I'm doing, please let me know :) [[User:DavidMendoza|DavidMendoza]] ([[User talk:DavidMendoza|talk]]) 20:54, 12 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

An electronic '''circuit''' is a system in which electrons flow from a negative terminal of a source, through a load, to the positive terminal.  Unfortunately for electronics students, pioneers in the fields of electricity and magnetism believed that positive charge flowed, so many of the conventions in physics and electronics assume that [[Electronics/Voltage_and_Current|current]] flows from positive to negative, even though the particles that are moving are actually negatively charged electrons moving from negative to positive.  (''conventional current is covered in the voltage and current section.  should we take it out of here and just leave it there?'')

''Talking about conventional current here sounds like a good idea.  The discussion should include a blurb on the relationship between conventional current and voltage.''

If you are having trouble imagining this, consider what happens if you pass helium filled balloons to another person while you both are standing on scales.  If the balloons are very large, then the person receiving the balloon actually loses weight and you who gave the balloon gain weight -- as measured by the scales.  (This is because the balloons are pulling up on you.)  In other words, the person who gives the balloon seems to have received weight and the person who receives the balloon seems to have lost weight.  In the same way, when something gives electrons it seems to have received positive charge.

If this all seems confusing, rest assured that you will find a way to think about it that works for you.  Many people just ignore the electrons altogether and think of positive charge flowing around.  Except in rare cases this is completely fine.



So, different types of negative particles drift from negative to positive, and positive particles drift in the opposite direction, at different speeds in different materials. How to make sense of this? Conventional current. We define current as flowing from positive to negative, and ignore the particles that make it up (for most purposes), paying attention only to the amount of charge flow per unit time, and the speed of the electromagnetic waves. We will sometimes still talk about electrons flowing, since they are the predominant charge carriers in metal, and many circuit components. Just keep these principles in mind.

Current i / I is represented in Amperes / Amps / A and equals x number of y

== 1) Movie Collection ==
Use the following data model:

[[Image:Xml5moviedm.png]]

:a. Using the IDREF method, create an XML schema to describe the illustrated data model. Include all of the attributes listed in the data model.
:b. Create an XML document that includes at least two movies and two cast members per movie. 
:c. Create a simple XML style sheet to present the information in HTML format. No tables or CSS are necessary.

          stronghold until the mid-1980s. Only a sucker wouldn't have turned to crime and this is exactly 
          how naive teen Rocket views himself. Rocket shoots all of the action with his weapon of choice, 
          a camera.

        &lt;movieSynopsis&gt;
          Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a European-owned hotel in Rwanda, created a secret refugee camp 
          for the Tutsi people during the brutal genocide committed against them by the Hutu people in 1994. His 
          efforts helped to save 1200 lives out of close to a million who were killed.

        &lt;movieSynopsis&gt;
          The story's protagonist, Peter LaFleur, is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called
          Average Joe's. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman, the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, 
          egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and 
          Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. The only way Peter can save Average Joe's 
          is a showdown dodgeball competition against Globo Gym.

== 2) Student/Class Directory ==

:a. Every class at a school can have many students, and each student can be registered to more than one class at a time.  Create an XML schema to capture this many-to-many relationship.  Be sure to include the class name, capacity, building number, building name, and room number.  Also include the student first/last name separately  and his or her grade for the class.
:b. Using the XML schema created in part a, create an XML document and an XML stylesheet.  You can make up your own data, but be sure to use at least three students for each class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A electron moving through space creates a magnetic field that spins around the charge according to the right hand rule.  The magnetic field is created by the spin of the moving electron.  If the wire is bent in the shape of a ring, when its current is flowing it magnetic field will resemble water flowing through a hose.  In order for the ring to have a magnetic field, its magnetic field must first displace the magnetic field that is already there.  This is why inductors initially resist any changes in current when a voltage is applied.  Over time the magnetic field changes to reflect the magnetic field of the ring and current starts flowing.  

Inductors resist changes in current and take time to adjust.

A popular example of inductance is a electromagnet.  It is essentially an inductor connected to dc with a piece of metal in its core.  The flow of current creates a  magnetic flow that mimicks a magnet.  The direction of current determines the polarity of the magnet.

The nice thing about electromagnets is the strength of the current determines the strength of the magnetic field, so the more current the more magnetic field.  Also reversing the direction of the current switches the polarity of the electromagnet.  

This property allows electromagnets to be used as switches.  As the current increases the magnet becomes more repulsive to other magnets.  

Electromagnets are also used in loudspeakers.  You have a voltage that is dependent on distance so as the distance decreases the voltage increases and as the distance increases the voltage decreases.  The result is the ability to program the loudspeaker according to a vibration pattern.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mutual inductance is just like inductance except that there is a hose at the other end to collect the magnetic flow.  So current through a ring generates a magnetic field which is collected by the other ring and is turned into current that moves the opposite direction.  Mutual inductance relies on AC as DC does not disturb the magnetic field enough.  Nominally the inductance can flow through air, but the inductance is more effective when it flows through a magnetic core such as iron.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Transformer==

'''Description'''

A transformer is a device that is used to either raise or lower voltages and currents in an electrical circuit. In modern electrical distribution systems, transformers are used to boost voltage levels so as to decrease line losses during transmission.

'''Theory of Operation'''

Transfomers rely on Faraday's Law, which states that a time-varying magnetic field can induce a time-varying voltage in a loop of wire.   In a transformer, this is accomplished by wrapping multiple turns of wire around some type of ferromagnetic material.  Usually, there are two sets of windings: a primary and a secondary.  The primary winding is attached to the generator; the secondary side is attached to the load.  When a time-varying voltage is applied to the primary, a magnetic field is created inside the ferromagnetic core.  The ferromagnetic material serves to concentrate the magnetic flux within the windings. The magnetic flux on the outside of the windings is reduced and the efficiency of the device is increased.

The time-varying magnetic field induces a voltage in the secondary winding.       

The magnitude of the secondary voltage depends on the turns ratio of the primary and secondary windings.  Suppose that the secondary winding of a transformer has 100 turns, while the primary winding has only 50 turns.  The resulting secondary voltage will be twice that of the primary voltage.  Likewise, if the primary has 100 turns, and the secondary has 50 turns, the secondary voltage would be half that of the primary.

At this point it may seem that we're getting something for nothing, but this is not the case.  Recall that energy can neither be created nor destroyed.  We know that the electrical power flowing into the primary windings is the product of the current and voltage.  Similarly, the power flowing out of the transformer must also be product of its current and voltage.  Neglecting losses in the transformer core, the power entering the transformer must also be the power leaving the transformer.  This means that in order to raise the voltage, we must decrease the current.  Likewise, by lowering the voltage, we increase the current.  As with the transformer voltages, the ratios of the currents depend on the ratios of the primary and secondary windings.  However, when dealing with currents, it is important to remember that the side with the larger number of turns has the smaller current and vice versa.  Consider the transformer mentioned above with a primary to secondary turns ratio of 1:2.  A 100-A current flowing into the primary would result in a 50-A current flowing out of the secondary. 

'''Uses'''

The most obvious application of the electrical transformer is in power distribution.  Recall that in an electrical circuit, &lt;math&gt;P = I^2 R&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the power consumed by a circuit element is proportional to the ''square'' of the current flowing through it.  In a transmission line, this is important because the line itself has some characteristic impedance.  In order to reduce power losses in the transmission line, it is desirable to transmit the least amount of current possible.  For a given amount of power, the best way to do this is by increasing the voltage.  

The transformer is also used for impedance matching.  Given a voltage source and a transmission line with a characteristic impedance, it is possible to use a transformer to make the load appear larger or smaller so that the load receives maximum power. Note that maximum power is not equal to maximum efficiency. For maximum efficiency in the use of electrical energy, the load should have extreme resistance so that the energy lost in the rest of the circuit will be negligible. Looking into the equations, however, the load of extreme resistance will receive negligible power (though much higher than the rest of the circuit). For any given constant voltage across any load, the power received by the load is given by &lt;math&gt;P = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;, thus the relationship. Note again that the equation used here is the one above transformed with Ohm's Law, and is the only appropriate since Current will drop in this case if the resistance increases.

===3-phase transformers===
These are, in essence, 3 [[Electric Motors And Generators/Single-phase|single-phase]] transformers that have one of their terminals connected to a common terminal, called the neutral, which usually is connected to earth/ground. Their voltages are 120 degrees out of phase from the other two.

==Analysis Using Newton's Laws==

The acceleration of the mass at any time is given by Newton's second law

:&lt;math&gt;a=\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=\frac{F}{m}=-\frac{kx}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

An equation of this type is known as a ''differential equation'' since it involves a derivative of the dependent variable . Equations of this type are generally more difficult to solve than algebraic equations, as there are no universal techniques for solving all forms of such equations. In fact, it is fair to say that the solutions of most differential equations were originally obtained by ''guessing''!  

There are systematic ways of solving simple differential equations, such as this one, but for now we will use our knowledge of the physical problem to make an intelligent guess.

We know that the mass oscillates back and forth with a period that is independent of the amplitude of the oscillation. A function which might fill the bill is the sine function. Let us try substituting,
:&lt;math&gt;x=A\, \sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;omega; is a constant, into this equation. 

We get
:&lt;math&gt;-\omega^2 A\, \sin \omega t = -A \frac{k}{m}\, \sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the sine function cancels out, leaving us with &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=''k''/''m''. The guess thus works if we set
:&lt;math&gt;\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

This constant  is the angular oscillation frequency for the oscillator, from which we infer the period of oscillation to be  
:&lt;math&gt;T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

This agrees with the result of the dimensional analysis. Because this doesn't depend on ''A'', we can see that the period is independent of amplitude.

It is easy to show that the cosine function is equally valid as a solution,
:&lt;math&gt;x=B\, \cos \omega t&lt;/math&gt;
for the same &amp;omega;.  

In fact, the most general possible solution is just a combination of these two, i. e.
:&lt;math&gt;x=A\, \sin \omega t+B\, \cos \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

The values of ''A'' and ''B'' depend on the position and velocity of the mass at time ''t''=0.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Various legends and their status as true or false.

1. Touching both ends of a 12 Volt car battery will kill me.
False. The human body has millions of ohms of resistance so unless you are wet or are bleeding you should be ok.  Millions of ohms of resistance means that the amount of current flowing will be astronomically small.

2. Cell phones cause cancer or brain damage.
Probably false. A cell phone operates at 900 MHz and 3GHz.  Visible light has a frequency of 1 Petillion 10^15 Hz.  Just below that is UV where you get sunburns.  That's a million times the frequency.  So if cell phones hurt you than what must visible light be doing to you?  If you believe it will hurt you than your only hope is to live in darkness inside a Faraday cage like a CHUD.  No microwave, infared, or visible light for you.

3. One time a cell phone caused a fire at a gas station.

4. CRTs are bad for you and expose you to x-rays. False, there are some x rays that get through occasionally, but not frequently enough to cause real damage.

If I had any tips, I would put them in the book... of course. All I can say is to start off with dream recall (use MILD) + reality checks, then add on more techniques if you want while your dream recall is up. Constant vigilance is needed for reality checks to really work well. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 08:58, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Gabriel Beecham. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Gabriel Beecham~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

&lt;!-- raw spinach image is 212 pixels wide, so cooked spinach adjusted to match --&gt;
[[Image:CDC_spinach1.jpg|frame|right|raw spinach]]
[[Image:5aday_spinach.jpg|thumb|right|212px|cooked spinach]]
'''Spinach''' is a green vegetable used as an accompaniment to main dishes,and as an ingredient in many other dishes (the term ''florentine'' in a recipe indicates the presence of spinach). Young leaves can be eaten raw in [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]], [[Cookbook:Taco|tacos]], and [[Cookbook:Hamburger|burgers]]. Frozen spinach goes well on [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]].

Plain cooked spinach is best served steamed or boiled in a minimum amount of water for no more than five minutes. The bulk of the leaves reduces enormously in cooking. Allow about 100 [[Cookbook:g|g]] per serving and use the biggest pan you have. Serve with [[Cookbook:Lemon_Juice|lemon juice]], or perhaps with salt.

Spinach is a common ingredient in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cuisine]], where it is known as ''saag'', cooked in various combinations such as paneer, chicken, and goat meat. 
Try sprinkling the raw leaves with [[Cookbook:Garam masala|garam masala]] before cooking for a slighly different and low sodium alternative to salt.

==Purchasing==
Spinach can be bought loosely or in prepackaged bags.  You can get better quality when you buy loosely, because you can examine all the leaves.  When examining the leaves, pick the ones that are smaller and have a good green color to them.  Leaves that are crisp and spongy are of good quality.  Do not pick leaves that are wilting, brown or yellow. Fresh spinach should smell sweet, never sour or musty. Look for stems that are fairly thin and coarse. Thick stems indicate overgrown spinach, which may be leathery and bitter. If only bagged spinach is available where you shop, check whether the contents seem resilient when you squeeze the bag.

==Storage==
Spinach loses much of its nutritional value with storage of more than a few days. While refrigeration slows this effect to about eight days, spinach will lose most of its folate and carotenoid content. This is worth considering when purchasing spinach out of season. If the product has been &quot;in transit&quot; (picked, cleaned, shipped and shelved) for more than one or two days it will need to be used almost immediately to have much nutritional benefit. This is in spite of the taste and appearance of the plant which may still seem fine. 
		 
Fresh spinach should be cleaned thoroughly and then can be stored loosely in an unsealed bag in the crisper tray of the refrigerator for a few days. Even at 4°C, spinach loses much of its nutritional value by eight days so for longer storage it should be fresh frozen, cooked and frozen or canned. Storage in the freezer can be for up to eight months.

It is sometimes discouraged to reheat spinach leftovers since poisonous compounds are formed during this process. What is behind this advice is that certain bacteria can grow on prepared nitrate-rich food, such as spinach and many other green vegetables. These bacteria can convert the nitrates into nitrites, which may be especially harmful to infants younger than six months. The nitrate-converting enzymes produced by the bacteria can convert even more at elevated temperatures during the second heating. For older children and adults, small concentrations of nitrites are harmless, although formation of nitrosamine compounds from the nitrites could be of concern for adults as well.

== Warnings ==
* The oxalic acid contained in spinach can react with the calcium contained in [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] to produce a deposit on your teeth. You may wish to avoid serving milk with spinach. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
* The oxalic acid contained in spinach is bad for cast iron pans and carbon steel pans. Spinach will turn black when cooked in such pans. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Spinach|1|1|3|3|3|1|1|1|1|3|3|2|1}}

Spinach is a 'cool season' crop, which means it's best planted in cold ground, at the end of the winter, making it available from early spring. Many spinach cultivars can also be planted in the late summer months for a fall crop. In cooler climates, the season may last throughout the summer.
In the beginning and end of the year spinach grown in greenhouses (which has smaller leaves) is available. Frozen spinach is also a popular alternative out of season.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is found in batteries.  (''a battery could also be considered a current source, depending on perspective.  i think we should not include batteries yet and only focus on what &quot;voltage&quot; and &quot;current&quot; mean.  then we can move on to ideal voltage and current sources, and then real sources.'')  

(''Is there a difference between series and parallel voltage assuming there are no current splits?  Depends if you mean ideal voltage sources or things like batteries.  Ideal voltage sources can't be placed in parallel.  This would be the same thing as saying 5=3.  Real voltage sources have some internal resistance, R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, which would load the other battery's ideal voltage source.'')

:''Is there a difference between ideal and real sources besides a resistor?''

::''Nope.  An impedance, actually.  But basically the same thing.  It's a hugely important difference, though.  *Very* important for beginners to understand.''

:I don't get it. You mean the maximum current a power source can output? How else does internal resistance affect the output of a power supply?

:: Impedance contains information about capacitance and inductance, in addition to resistance.  Power supplies and cells (a battery is a stack of cells) can be quite different.  Even mere resistance will affect the battery's temperature, which will in turn affect the resistance.  Additionally, batteries are chemical devices and are impacted by the chemical processes that take place inside.  As a result, the voltage characteristics of batteries evolve during their lifetimes.  Also as a result, different types of batteries recharge differently.  A nominal 9V battery will not actually produce 9V during the entirety of its life.  Real batteries are quite complex.  We simplify thinking about them because most of that stuff seldom matters.  If you wanted to build a battery operated robot that would sit idle for months at a time and do something useful when its battery was going dead, then many of these things would begin to matter. --[[User:Rs2|Rs2]] 22:41, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:::Likewise, with other real voltage sources, like the output of an op-amp, it is important to realize that it has an output impedance, which cannot be separated from the ideal voltage source.  The impedance has effects on op-amp stability, power handling, maximum current/voltage, loading, etc.  We model real voltage sources as an ideal voltage source (which just creates a voltage between two conductors, regardless of anything else) with an impedance permanently attached.  A real battery has inductance, capacitance, and predominantly resistance right at the output of a perfect voltage source, meaning the battery will give different voltages depending on what it is loaded with, etc.  We should mention in the article that a short circuit across an ideal voltage source would produce infinite current and vice versa. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Springs==

=== Hooke's law ===

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}=-k\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;}}

k is the spring constant and x is the displacement (the force is the restoring force)

For this equation to be approximately accurate, x needs to be below the spring's elastic limit.  If x is more than the spring's elastic limit, the spring will exhibit &quot;plastic behaviour&quot; meaning that it will not return to its original position.

===Potential energy===
potential energy stored in a compressed recoiled spring 
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;U= -\int\limits_{0}^{x_f} -k\vec{x}\cdot\vec{\mathrm{d}x} = \frac{1}{2} kx_f^2&lt;/math&gt;}} 


T is the period, m is the mass, and k is the spring constant. 
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;T=2 \pi \sqrt{{m \over k}}&lt;/math&gt;}}

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] dry [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpeas]]
* water
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 2-3 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]] (t'hina) and water, to make a paste; fresh [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] can be substituted for some of the water
* ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]; fresh, coarsely cut [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]]; salt to taste

==Procedure==
'''On the night before you plan to cook'''

#In a large pot, add the chickpeas, 2.5 cups of water, and baking soda.  Leave to soak for 6-12 hours.
#Rinse.

'''Cook the peas'''

# Add the rinsed peas to 3 cups of water, the garlic, and one teaspoon of salt.  Bring to a boil.  After about 45 minutes, they should swell enough for their skins to come off. Give it a stir, and use a sieve spoon to remove as many of the skins as you can from the water.
# Cover the pot and continue cooking for about 2 hours, or until they almost dissolve to a paste.
# Pour out the water. (optionally, some can be reserved to add later, for extra flavor)
# Mash the peas by pressing them through a pasta sieve.
# If it doesn't work, you haven't cooked them enough. or use a food processor!
# Let it cool for 10 minutes.
# Add tahini and water until you get the right consistency.

Some cooks add tahini concentrate and lemon juice, instead of diluted tahini.

'''Season with'''

* salt
* ground cumin
* fresh, coarsely cut coriander leaves

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Lesson 3 ~ ''Kjekt å vite'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In this lesson the plan is to elaborate on what you learnt in [[Norwegian/Lesson 1|Lesson 1]], in other words, to get a more useful conversation going plus teaching you some things that are simply good to know.

== Where Are You From? ==
Here are some guys at a course to learn norwegian. Each person says who they are, what nationality they are, and what languages they speak. Aleksander is the teacher. Check out the vocabulary to understand what everybody is saying.

==Sorry, I Don't Understand==
David is an Englishman. He knows some Norwegian, but has forgotten what '''&quot;Hvordan går det&quot;''' means.

*'''Stian''': Hei David!
*'''David''': Hei Stian!
*'''Stian''': Hvordan går det?
*'''David''': Unnskyld, jeg forstår ikke hva du sier. Vennligst snakk saktere.
*'''Stian''': H-v-o-r-d-a-n g-å-r d-e-t?
*'''David''': Ah. Nå forstår jeg. &quot;Hvordan går det&quot; betyr &quot;How are you&quot;!
*'''Stian''': Ja.
*'''David''': Takk, det går bra. Hva med deg?
*'''Stian''': Takk, det går bra.

==May I Introduce Myself?==
The most common way Norwegians introduce themselves are by simply saying hello, and then telling you their name. For more formal situations, it's more common to greet by first saying your full name, and possibly a more proper greeting than just hello. '''Hyggelig å treffe deg''' or '''Hyggelig å treffe Dem''' means ''pleased to meet you''.

* Jonas Karlsen. God dag.
* Ine Ludvigsen. God dag. Hyggelig å treffe deg.
* Hyggelig å treffe deg.

The first time you meet somebody, you shake hands. In business environments, this is also done when a long amount of time has passed since you last met.

When you want to introduce two people to each other, you use the phrase '''Får jeg presentere ...''' which means '''May I present ...''' and then you say their names.

* Får jeg presentere: Line Jensen -- Jerry McMurphy

This introduction is quite formal. In less formal situations, you can basically just say

* Dette er Line Jensen -- Jerry McMurphy

'''Dette er''' means ''this is''. It's also not really necessary to use surnames in an informal situation. Especially so with young people and children.

===Greetings===

----


'''God morgen''', ''good morning'', is the first greeting of the day. You answer it simply with '''god morgen''' or '''morn'''', the latter being sort of a slang. Later on in the day you can say '''god dag''', ''good day'', answered by a '''god dag''' back.

Being less formal, you can just say '''hei''' or '''hallo'''; these work at any time of the day.

Later, when the evening has come, you say '''god kveld''', which means ''good evening'', or you could say '''god aften''', which is a synonymous (yet more formal) to '''god kveld'''. Finally, when you're going to bed, it's common to say '''god natt''', ''good night'' or '''natta'''', which is a slang expression for the same.

When you're leaving somebody, you can say '''ha det bra''' or just '''ha det''' (lit. &quot;have it&quot;, which is short for '''ha det bra''', which implies '''jeg håper du vil ha det bra''', which basically means ''I hope you'll be fine''. This is a very old saying, and as you can guess, ''have it'' wouldn't make much sense to anyone if it hadn't been for the history of the word, which everybody sort of knows, but nobody speaks of.) You can also just say '''snakkes''', (short for '''vi snakkes senere''', ''we'll talk later'') although this is more commonly used on the phone or in communications over written media.

===Thank You===

----


'''Takk''' means ''thanks''. '''Tusen takk''' (lit. ''thousand thanks''), '''Takker så mye/meget''' (lit. ''thank you so much'') and '''Mange takk''' (lit. ''many thanks'') all means ''thanks a lot''. Using '''meget''' is old-fashioned though, and comes from Danish.

The correct response for '''takk''', for instance when you've given someone a gift, or similar is '''vær så god''' (lit. ''be so kind'') which is equivalent to the English ''you are welcome'', ''don't mention it'' or ''it's nothing''

When someone says '''takk''' in order to express gratitude for a service or act performed, '''bare hyggelig''', (lit. ''merely pleasurable''), best translated as ''my pleasure'', is an appropriate response.

      <text xml:space="preserve">about the garlic, in English, we call them either cloves or heads.  A &quot;clove&quot; of garlic is a single &quot;bulb&quot;, about 2 cm long and 0.5 - 1 cm thick; several cloves (10 or more) are gathered together into &quot;heads&quot;, about 5 cm tall and 3 cm in radius; the bundle of paper wrapped garlic you can buy in a store, or go down to [[en:Gilroy, California|Gilroy]] and dig up.  I like the name teeth, as they do kinda look like the eye teath. I'm going to wikify this recipe now, making links to all the ingredient pages, then I'll add it to the [[cookbook:Recipes|Recipe Index]]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:14, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Thanks. Well, it was worth posting this recipe just to learn that. Garlic &quot;teeth&quot; is a literal translation from Hebrew. [[User:Yish|- yish]] 00:10, 1 Apr 2004 (UTC)


Instead of 'Thina' didn't you mean '[[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]]?' Tahini is sesame-seed paste and I thought it was an important ingredient in humus. I've never heard of 'thina' [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 02:42, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)


Well, yes. Thina, or perhaps T'xina, is what native English speakers call tahini. Sometimes &quot;tahini sauce&quot;. I tried to be true to the Hebrew / Arab phonetics, as I know it. [[User:Yish|- yish]] 23:07, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)

So what happened to the garlic in the recipe? There's no garlic mentioned in ingredients or procedure, just here in the discussion. How can you have hummous bi tahina without garlic?

Regarding the pronounciation of tahini/tahina - Native Lebanese speakers would say something that sounds more like tahini, which is why you see it spelled like that in English. Several Lebanese-American grocery companies began marketing tahini in the US in the early to mid 20th century and I believe that's how the spelling caught on. But a Palestinian would say tahina. It's a regional variation on how to pronounce the vowel. There is substantial variation in vowel and dipthong pronounciation across Arabic dialects - never mind what teachers insist correct pronounciation is. Spoken Arabic varies from standard or Classical Arabic. 

And BTW, the x in txina just indicates that special aspirated h that non-native Arabic speakers find so difficult. I never see scholars distinguishing between that letter and &quot;h&quot; when translating to English in popular writing - see Juan Cole, Abu-Aardvark, or As'ad Abu-Khalil. Leila - 28 Nov 2004

It would be nice to have as a part of the standard template a description of what role each ingredient plays in the recipe and the reasoning behind certain procedures.  In this recipe, for example, what purpose does the baking soda serve?  Why can't a food processor be used?  Why should the chickpeas be shelled?  Why must the chickpeas be soaked for so long instead of cooked for a shorter amount of time?  -T.M.- 20 Feb 2005

: I'm curious about the food processor warning too. I have a variant recipe (which for simplicity's sake uses two cans of chickpeas rather than the shelled kind, 6 Tbsp tahini, 6-8 Tbsp lemon juice, scallions, garlic and spices) which I've always used a food processor for and which has turned out fine for me on several occassions. --[[User:MC MasterChef|MC MasterChef]] 01:50, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Two variations I see from many other Humus recipies: 1) The ingredients list does not include olive oil.  Other recipies I have seen include this, and all local Greek/Lebenese restaurants serve the Humus with olive oil mixed in.  (Sometimes it separates and &quot;floats&quot; on the top.)  2) All of the other recipies I have seen recommend starting with canned chick peas rather than dry, and just mixing in a blender or food processor.  Also, I am not sure if adding the baking soda during soak is necessary or desirable unless you have hard water. -Aaron 23 June 2005

== Disambiguation ==

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm changing the name of the existing humus recipe to hummus I without reason. But, in the the process of creating a disambiguation page to accommodate a Greek variation of hummus, I had to choose the least ambiguous, and most easily recognisable form for the word (humus can also mean decayed vegetable matter in English).

==food processor - chickpeas==

My understanding of the suggestion to use the sieve and not the food processor is the fact that you will not be able to press the cooked chickpeas thru the sieve unless they are really overcooked and soft enough to go thru easily. A food processor has so much raw power, it will mash halfcooked chickpeas. Frank Z  March 27 2006


==criticism of this recipe==

First of all --- it is very legitimate in making Houmus to use a food processor.

My mother, who is from Israel, uses a food processor every time she makes Houmus - and her houmus is considered the best. Other people, who refuse to use a food processor - their Houmus does not turn out as well. There are other, better ways of determining when you've cooked the beans enough -- such as (maybe) sampling them.

Also, there's a number of other ways that this recipe for Houmus is not a good one at all.

-- S. Shapira - March 30, 2008
:Would you mind expanding on these other ways this recipe is not good?  Maybe this article can be improved.  I am making hummus for the first time, and I'd like to know do it right.

== images ==

I saw you posted two pics of the same thing, just different sizes, and I thought I'd let you know that's not necessary.  The wiki software can be told to render an image smaller that the file's resolution.  For example, [[Image:Oyster(L).jpg|150px|]] and [[Image:Oyster(L).jpg|50px|]] are from the same file, [[:Image:Oyster(L).jpg]] (which is quite large).  The software can be told the size by doing this: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Oyster(L).jpg|50px|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  More tricks about using images in wiki pages can be found in the MediaWiki Users guide article [[m:MediaWiki User's Guide: Adding multimedia|MediaWiki User's Guide: Adding multimedia]], which is at [[m:Main Page|Meta]].

&lt;li&gt;
[[../The one-to-one relationship#Exercises|In chapter 4]], you were asked to create a schema document to define a restaurant. [[../The many-to-many relationship#Exercises|In the next chapter]] you were asked to create a schema defining a franchise restaurant. In this exercise, you need to create a new XML Schema document and use the redefine mechanism to extend your original restaurant data type by appending the necessary franchise information. Amend the XML instance document you used for your franchise restaurant to use the newly created XML schema document for validation.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Create a schema document that contains the type library in the table below. Now create a new schema document that will be used to describe bars in a city, use the import mechanism to import the schema and namespace that contains the USAddressType, and use the USAddressType to define the address of the bar. Create an XML instance document with at least two bars for any US city to validate against the newly created schema document.

|}
'''Table 7-11: Exercise 2 – Type Library USAddress.xsd'''
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Retrieve the XML instance document and XML schema document you created in the exercises for chapter 2. Change the elementFormDefault value to ‘qualified’ and make the necessary changes to the XML instance document so that it will validate correctly.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Develop a type library for the tourGuide schema in chapter 4. Use common sense to group related elements and data types. Keep in mind that some data types may be reusable or may need to be generalized to allow them to be reused (or redefined).
&lt;/li&gt;

'''Lemonade''' is a sweetened beverage made from lemons, sugar, and water.  It is popular in the United States during the spring and summer, when it is generally served chilled, with ice.

In some countries, the word 'lemonade' is also used to describe any clear carbonated drink; in others, it means any fruit-flavored soda. 

==Ingredients==
*6 medium [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], should yield about 1 cup of juice
*3 1/2 [[Cookbook:cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]] (can be adjusted by +/- 1/4 cup to taste)

==Procedure==
# Juice the lemons on a citrus reamer. Rolling the lemons on the counter with moderate pressure prior to juicing will result in more juice from each lemon.  Try to keep out the seeds.  If you prefer lemonade with no pulp, strain the juice to remove it.
# Dissolve the sugar in the water. Heat may be helpful if using a large amount of sugar.
# Combine the juice and sugar water in a pitcher.  Stir well.
# Chill or serve over ice cubes.

==Alternative Recipe==
* 1 cup Lemon Juice
* 1 cup Sugar (or equivalent Sugar substitute)
* 6 Cups of Water (2 cups warm water, 4 cups cold water)

# Pour 2 cups of warm water into a pitcher and stir in sugar until it dissolves (Sugar dissolves quicker in warm water).
# Pour in lemon juice, stir again, and add the 4 cups of cold water.
# Chill or serve over ice cubes.

==Alternative recipe 2==
* 4 lemons
* 4 tablespoons of sugar
* 1 liter of carbonated water
* a few leaves of mint or ''Melissa officinalis'' (lemon balm)

Press the lemons and dissolve the sugar. Add carbonated water and melissa or mint.

'''Note''': Lemon juice may be replaced substituted by orange juice or other citrus juice, if desired.

==Alternative recipe 3==
* 7 cups of cold carbonated water 
* 1 cup of sugar (or sugar alternative like Splenda)
* 1 package of lemonade-flavored Kool-Aid, or similar powder drink mix

Pour the carbonated water into a two-quart pitcher.  Add sugar and Kool-Aid or drink mix. Stir thoroughly. Served chilled over ice, if desired.

==Alternative recipe 4==
*5 cups water
*1 cup lemon juice, about 5 large lemons or 8 small ones
*3/4 cups cane sugar or turbinado raw; the latter will make a very brown color
*Citrus reamer, 2-cup measuring cup, teaspoon, 2-quart bottle

Squeeze lemons into the measuring cup. Pour the juice into the bottle. Pour or spoon the sugar into the measuring cup. Pour the lemon juice back in, on top of the sugar. Stir until it is mostly dissolved. Pour into bottle. Pour 2 cups water in the measuring cup; stir to dissolve any remaining sugar. Pour into bottle. Pour two more cups; stir again and pour into bottle. Pour in the last cup; stir and pour into bottle. Put a lid on the bottle and shake well. Chill. 

Notes: If you do not have 1 cup lemon juice, edit recipe thus: 4 parts lemon juice to 3 parts sugar to 20 parts water (1 part is 1/4 cup). Sugar can be substituted for another sweetener. Sugar level can also be altered to make it more sweet or more bitter. Water level can be adjusted to make it stronger or weaker.

==Variations==
*Hard lemonade adds an alcoholic spirit, such as tequila, gin, or vodka, to the lemonade.
*Various fruits, such as [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]] and [[Cookbook:Raspberry|raspberries]] can be added for color and flavor.  A small amount of [[Cookbook:Beet|beet]] juice results in pink lemonade with little change in flavor.
*[[Cookbook:Herb|Herb]]s such as [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]], borage, lavender, and lemon verbena can change the aroma of the drink.
*Including the peels, bruised and sliced, gives more bite and a stronger aroma.
*Other citrus fruits can be used, including [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]], [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]], and [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|grapefruit]].  Sugar and water content should be adjusted to taste.  In American parlance, these are not technically lemonades, but limeade, orangeade, etc.

I have started making some diagrams that illustrate [[en:Mitosis#Anaphase|mitosis]] and meiosis. (also, see: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Three_cell_growth_types.png this Wikipedia image]) I am trying to think how to do it so that the diagrams can also be used here. Suggestions?

Would be more useful if there were three separate diagrams instead of just the one with three types of cell division - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:54, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)


: That [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Three_cell_growth_types.png big diagram] was for a comparison of the three types. The three parts can easily be split out. [[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 21:07, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)</text>

&lt;/ul&gt;

In previous chapters, we have introduced the basics of using an XSL stylesheet to convert XML documents into HTML.  This chapter will briefly review those concepts and introduce many new ones as well.  It is a reference for creating stylesheets.

= XML Stylesheets =

The eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) provides a means to transform and format the contents of XML document for display.  It includes two parts, XSL Transformation (XSLT) for transforming the XML document, and XSLFO (XSL Formatting Objects) for formatting or applying styles to XML documents.  The XSL Transformation Language (XSLT) is used to transform XML documents from one form to another, including new XML documents, HTML, XHTML, and text documents. XSL-FO can create PDF documents, as well as other output formats, from XML.  With XSLT you can effectively recycle content, redesigning it for use in new documents, or changing it to fit limitless uses.  For example, from a single XML source file, you could extract a document ready for print, one for the Web, one for a Unix manual page, and another for an online help system.  You can also choose to extract only parts of a document written in a specific language from an XML source that stores text in many languages.  The possibilities are endless! 

An XSLT stylesheet is an XML document, complete with elements and attributes. It has two kinds of elements, top-level and instruction.  Top-level elements fall directly under the &lt;tt&gt;stylesheet&lt;/tt&gt; root element. Instruction elements represent a set of formatting instructions that dictate how the contents of an XML document will be transformed. During the transformation process, XSLT analyzes the XML document, or the source tree, and converts it into a node tree, a hierarchical representation of the entire XML document, also known as the result tree. Each node represents a piece of the XML document, such as an element, attribute or some text content.  The XSL stylesheet contains predefined “templates” that contain instructions on what to do with the nodes. XSLT will use the &lt;tt&gt;match&lt;/tt&gt; attribute to relate XML element nodes to the templates, and transform them into the result document.

Let's review the stylesheet, city.xsl from chapter 2, and examine it in a little more detail:

'''Exhibit 1: XML stylesheet for city entity'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

&lt;!-- 
      Document:  city.xsl 
--&gt;

&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;
 xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;
             &lt;title&gt;Cities&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
             &lt;h2&gt;Cities&lt;/h2&gt;
             &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;cities&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;cities&quot;&gt;
      &lt;!-- the for-each element can be used to loop through each node in a specified node set (in this case city) --&gt;
      &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;city&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xsl:text&gt;City: &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
           &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;cityName&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;br/&gt;
         &lt;xsl:text&gt;Population: &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
           &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;cityPop&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;br/&gt;
          &lt;xsl:text&gt;Country: &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
          &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;cityCountry&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;br/&gt;
          &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
   &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since a stylesheet is an XML document, it begins with the XML declaration. This includes the pseudo-attributes &lt;tt&gt;encoding&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;standalone&lt;/tt&gt;. They are called pseudo because they are not the same as element attributes. The standalone attribute allows you to directly specify an external DTD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt&gt; &amp;lt;xsl:stylesheet&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tag declares the start of the
          stylesheet and identifies the version number and the official W3C namespace. Notice the conventional prefix for the XSLT namespace, xsl.  Once a prefix is declared, it must be used for all the elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;lt;xsl:output&amp;gt; tag is an optional element that determines how to output the result tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt&gt;  &amp;lt;xsl:template&amp;gt;  &lt;/tt&gt; element defines the start of a          template and contains rules to apply when a specified node is matched. The &lt;tt&gt;match&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is used to &lt;tt&gt;associate&lt;/tt&gt;(match) the template with an XMLelement, in this case the root (/), or whole branch, of the XML source document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no output method has been specified, the output would default to HTML in this case since the root element is the &lt;tt&gt;  &amp;lt;html&amp;gt;  &lt;/tt&gt;start tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt&gt; apply-templates&lt;/tt&gt; element is an empty element since it has no character content. It applies a template rule to the current element or the element's child nodes. The &lt;tt&gt;select &lt;/tt&gt; attribute contains a location path telling it which element's content to process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instruction element &lt;tt&gt;value-of &lt;/tt&gt; extracts the string value of the child of the selected node, in this case, the text node child of &lt;tt&gt;cityName&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;template&lt;/tt&gt; element defines the rules that implement a change. This can be any number of things, including a simple plain-text conversion, the addition or removal of XML elements, or simply a conversion to HTML, when the pattern is matched. The pattern, defined in the element’s &lt;tt&gt;match&lt;/tt&gt; attribute, contains an abbreviated [[../XPath/]] location path. This is basically the name of the root element in the doc, in our case, &amp;quot;tourGuide.&amp;quot;

When transforming an XML document into HTML, the processor expects that elements in the stylesheet be well-formed, just as with XML.  This means that all elements must have an end tag.  For example, it is not unusual to see the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tag alone. The XSLT processor requires that an element with a start-tag must close with an end tag.  With the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element, this means either using &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt; &lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; As mentioned in Chapter 3, the &lt;tt&gt;br&lt;/tt&gt; element is an empty element. That means it carries no content between tags, but it may have attributes. Although no end tags are output for the HTML output, they still must have end-tags in the stylesheet.  For instance, in the stylesheet, you will list: &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;picture.jpg&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/img&amp;gt; &lt;/tt&gt; or as an empty element &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;picture.jpg&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &lt;/tt&gt;. The HTML output will drop the end-tag so it looks like this: &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;picture.jpg&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &lt;/tt&gt; On a side note, the processor will recognize html tags no matter what case they are in - BODY, body, Body are all interpreted the same.

= Output =   
XSLT can be used to transform an XML source into many different types of documents. XHTML is also XML, if it is well formed, so it could also be used as the source or the result.  However, transforming plain HTML into XML won't work unless it is first turned into XHTML so that it conforms to the XML 1.0 recommendation.
Here is a list of all the possible type-to-type transformations performed by XSLT:

'''Exhibit 2: Type-To-Type Transformations'''
{| border=1
| align=center | 
| align=center | XML
| align=center | XHTML
| align=center | HTML
| align=center | text
|-

|-
| align=center | text
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;
|}  


The &lt;tt&gt;output&lt;/tt&gt; element in the stylesheet determines how to output the result tree. This element is optional, but it allows you to have more control over the output. If you do not include it, the output method will default to XML, or HTML if the first element in the result tree is the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &lt;/tt&gt;element.  Exhibit 3 lists attributes.

= XML to XML =   
Since we have had a lot of practice transforming an XML document to HTML, we are going to transform city.xml, used in chapter 2, into another XML file, using host.xsd as the schema.

'''Exhibit 4: XML document for city entity'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

&lt;!-- 
    Document:  city.xml
--&gt;

&lt;cities xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
  xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='host.xsd'&gt;
&lt;city&gt;
    &lt;cityID&gt;c1&lt;/cityID&gt;
    &lt;cityName&gt;Atlanta&lt;/cityName&gt;
    &lt;cityCountry&gt;USA&lt;/cityCountry&gt;
    &lt;cityPop&gt;4000000&lt;/cityPop&gt;
    &lt;cityHostYr&gt;1996&lt;/cityHostYr&gt;   
   
&lt;/city&gt;

&lt;city&gt;
    &lt;cityID&gt;c2&lt;/cityID&gt;
    &lt;cityName&gt;Sydney&lt;/cityName&gt;
    &lt;cityCountry&gt;Australia&lt;/cityCountry&gt;
    &lt;cityPop&gt;4000000&lt;/cityPop&gt;
    &lt;cityHostYr&gt;2000&lt;/cityHostYr&gt;   
    &lt;cityPreviousHost&gt;c1&lt;/cityPreviousHost &gt;   
&lt;/city&gt;

&lt;city&gt;
    &lt;cityID&gt;c3&lt;/cityID&gt;
    &lt;cityName&gt;Athens&lt;/cityName&gt;
    &lt;cityCountry&gt;Greece&lt;/cityCountry&gt;
    &lt;cityPop&gt;3500000&lt;/cityPop&gt;
    &lt;cityHostYr&gt;2004&lt;/cityHostYr&gt;   
    &lt;cityPreviousHost&gt;c2&lt;/cityPreviousHost &gt;   
&lt;/city&gt;

&lt;/cities&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;



'''Exhibit 5: XSL document for city entity that list cities by City ID'''

       &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
   &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

*  Although the &lt;tt&gt;output method&lt;/tt&gt; is set to &amp;quot;xml&amp;quot;, since there is no &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element as the root of the result tree, it would default to XML output.

*  &lt;tt&gt;attribute-set&lt;/tt&gt; is a top-level element that creates a group of attributes by the name of &amp;quot;date.&amp;quot; This attribute set can be reused throughout the stylesheet.  The element &lt;tt&gt;attribute-set&lt;/tt&gt; also has the attribute use-attribute-sets allowing you to chain together several sets of attributes.

*  The &lt;tt&gt;processing-instruction&lt;/tt&gt; produces the XML stylesheet processing instructions.

*  The element &lt;tt&gt;comment&lt;/tt&gt; creates a comment in the result tree

*  The &lt;tt&gt;attribute&lt;/tt&gt; element allows you to add an attribute to an element that is created in the result tree.


The stylesheet produces this result tree:

'''Exhibit 8: XML result tree for city entity'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;

&lt;!--
    Document:  city2.xsl
--&gt; 

  &lt;?xsl-stylesheet href=&quot;style.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;
    &lt;!--This is a list of the cities we are visiting this week--&gt;
    &lt;cityList year=&quot;2004&quot; month=&quot;03&quot; day=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
      &lt;city country=&quot;Belize&quot;&gt;Belmopan&lt;/city&gt;
      &lt;details&gt;Will write up a one page report of the trip&lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/cityList&gt;
    &lt;cityList year=&quot;2004&quot; month=&quot;03&quot; day=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
      &lt;city country=&quot;Malaysia&quot;&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/city&gt;
      &lt;details&gt;Will write up a one page report of the trip&lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/cityList&gt;
  &lt;/stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The processor automatically inserts the XML declaration at the top of the result tree. The processing instruction, or PI, is an instruction intended for use by a processing application.  In this case, the href points to a local stylesheet that will be applied to the XML document when it is processed.  We used &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:element&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to create new content in the result tree and added attributes to it.  

There are two other instruction elements for inserting nodes into a result tree.  These are &lt;tt&gt;copy&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;copy-of&lt;/tt&gt;. Unlike &lt;tt&gt;apply-templates&lt;/tt&gt;, which only copies content of the child node (like the child text node), these elements copy everything. The following code shows how the copy element can be used to copy the city element in city.xml:

'''Exhibit 9: Copy element'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
       &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;city&quot;&gt;       
               &lt;xsl:copy /&gt;    
       &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The result looks like this:  

'''Exhibit 10: Copy element result'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt; 
       &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
       &lt;city /&gt;
       &lt;city /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The output isn't very interesting, because copy does not pick up the child nodes, only the current node.  In our example, it picks up the two city nodes that are in the city.xml file. The copy element has an optional attribute, use-attribute-sets, which allows you to add attributes to the element.  However, it will leave behind any other attributes, except the namespace, if it is present. Here is the result if a namespace is declared in the source document, in this case, the default namespace:

'''Exhibit 11: Namespace result'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
       &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
       &lt;city xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
       &lt;city xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to copy more from the source file than just one node, the &lt;tt&gt;copy-of&lt;/tt&gt; element includes the current node, and any attribute nodes that are associated with it.  This includes any nodes that might be laying around, such as namespace nodes, text nodes, and child element nodes.  When we apply the &lt;tt&gt;copy-of&lt;/tt&gt; element to city.xml, the result is almost an exact replica of city.xml! You can also copy comments and processing instructions using &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:copy-of select=&amp;quot;comment()&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:copy-of select=&amp;quot;processing-instruction(&lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt;)&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &lt;/tt&gt;where &lt;tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the value of the name attribute in the processing instruction you wish to retrieve.  

Why would this be useful, you ask? Sometimes you want to just grab nodes and go! For example, if you want to place a copy of city.xml into a SOAP envelope, you can easily do it using &lt;tt&gt;copy-of&lt;/tt&gt;. If you don't already know, Simple Object Access Protocol, or SOAP, is a protocol for packaging XML documents for exchange.  This is really useful in a B2B environment because it provides a standard way to package XML messages.  You can read more about SOAP at www.w3.org/tr/soap.       

Use an XML editor to create the above XML Stylesheets, and experiment with the &lt;tt&gt;copy&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;copy-of&lt;/tt&gt; elements.

= Templates =

Since templates define the rules for changing nodes, it would make sense to reuse them, either in the same stylesheet or in other stylesheets.  This can be accomplished by naming a template, and then calling it with a &lt;tt&gt;call-template&lt;/tt&gt; element.  Named templates from other stylesheets can also be included. You can quickly see how this is useful in practical applications.  Here is an example using named templates:  

'''Exhibit 110: Named templates'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:output method=&quot;xml&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot; /&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;getCity&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

    &lt;xsl:template name=&quot;getCity&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;city&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Templates also have a mode attribute.  This allows you to process a node more than once, producing a different result each time, depending on the template. Let's create a stylesheet to practice modes.

'''Exhibit 12: XML template modes'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

&lt;!--
    Document:  cityModes.xsl
--&gt;

&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;
 xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;tourGuide&quot;&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
           &lt;head&gt;
              &lt;title&gt;City - Using Modes&lt;/title&gt;
           &lt;/head&gt;
           &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;city&quot;&gt;
                 &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;cityName&quot; mode=&quot;title&quot; /&gt;
                 &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;cityName&quot; mode=&quot;url&quot; /&gt;
                 &lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
           &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

     &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;cityName&quot; mode=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;current()&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
      &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;cityName&quot; mode=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Come visit &lt;b&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;current()&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;


*  &lt;tt&gt;apply-templates select=&quot;cityName&quot; mode=&quot;title&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; tells the processor to look for a template that has the same mode attribute value 
  
*  &lt;tt&gt;value-of select=&quot;current()&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; returns the current node which is converted to a string with &lt;tt&gt;value-of.&lt;/tt&gt;Using &lt;tt&gt;select=&amp;quot;.&amp;quot; &lt;/tt&gt;will also return the current node.

The result isn't very flattering since we didn't do much with the file, but it gets the point across.

'''Exhibit 13: Result from above stylesheet'''    
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Belmopan&lt;/h2&gt;
Come visit &lt;b&gt;Belmopan&lt;/b&gt;!

&lt;h2&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/h2&gt;
Come visit &lt;b&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/b&gt;!
&lt;/source&gt;


By default, XSLT processors have built-in template rules. If you apply a stylesheet without any matching rules, and it fails to match a pattern, the default rules are automatically applied. The default rules output the content of all the elements.

= Sorting =

Writing “well formed” code XML is vital.  At times, however, simply displaying information (the most elementary level of data management) is not all that is necessary to properly identify a project.  As information technology specialists, it is necessary to fully understand that order is vital for interpretation.  Order can be attained by putting data in a format that is quickly readable. Such information then becomes quickly usable. Using a comparative model or simply looking for a specific name or item becomes very easy. Finding a specific musical artist, title, or musical type becomes very easy. As an Information Specialist, you must fully be aware that it often becomes necessary to sort information.  
The basis of sorting in XMLT is the xsl:sort command. The xsl:sort element exemplifies a sort key component. A sort key component identifies how a sort key value is to be identified for each item in the order of information being sorted.
A Sort Key Value is defined as “the value computed for an item by using the Nth sort key component”
The significance of a sort key component is realized either by its select attribute, or by the contained sequence constructor.  A Sequence Constructor is defined as a “sequence of zero or more sibling nodes in the stylesheet that can be evaluated to return a sequence of nodes and atomic values”. There are instances when neither is present. Under these circumstances, the default is select=&quot;.&quot;, which has the effect of sorting on the actual value of the item if it is an atomic value, or on the typed-value of the item if it is a node. If a select attribute is present, its value must be an Xpath expression. 


The following is how the &lt;xsl:sort&gt; element is used to sort the output.
 
Sort Information is held as Follows:
Sorting output in XML is quite easy and is done by adding the &lt;xsl:sort&gt; element after the &lt;xsl:for-each&gt; element in the XSL file.

'''Exhibit 14: Stylesheet with sort function'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;
xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;TourGuide Example&lt;/h2&gt;
       &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;cities&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;cities&quot;&gt; 
       &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;city&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xsl:sort select=&quot;cityName&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;cityName&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;cityCountry&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This example will sort the file alphabetically by artist name.  
Note: The select attribute indicates what XML element to sort on. Information can be SELECTED and SORTED by “title” or “artist”. These are categories that the XML document will display within the body of the file. 


We have used the &lt;tt&gt;sort&lt;/tt&gt; function to sort the results of an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement before. The sort element has many other uses as well.  Essentially, it instructs the processor to sort nodes based on certain criteria, which is known as the sort key.  It defaults to sorting the elements in ascending order. Here is a short list of the different attributes that sort takes: 

'''Exhibit 15: Sort attributes'''
  
{| width=&quot;600&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| '''Attribute''' || '''Description'''
|-
| width=&quot;100&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;select&lt;/tt&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | Specifies the node on which to process
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;order&lt;/tt&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | Specifies the sort order: &amp;quot;ascending&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;descending&amp;quot;
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;case-order&lt;/tt&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | Determines whether text in uppercase is sorted before lowercase: &amp;quot;upper-first&amp;quot; or&lt;br&gt; &amp;quot;lower-first&amp;quot;
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;data-type&lt;/tt&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |   By default sorts on text data: &amp;quot;text&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;number&amp;quot;, or QName(qualified name)
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | Indicates the language in use since some languages use different alphabets. &amp;quot;en&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;de&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fr&amp;quot;, etc.  If no value is specified, the language is determined from the system environment.
|}    

The sort element can be used in either the &lt;tt&gt;apply-templates&lt;/tt&gt; or the &lt;tt&gt;for-each&lt;/tt&gt; elements. It can also be used multiple times within a template, or in several templates, to create sub-ordering levels.

= Numbering =

The &lt;tt&gt;number&lt;/tt&gt; instruction element allows you to insert numbers into your results.  Combined with a sort element, you can easily create numbered lists. When this simple stylesheet, hotelNumbering.xsl, is applied to city_hotel.xml, we get the result listed below:       

'''Exhibit 16: Sorting and numbering lists'''

          &lt;/xsl:apply-templates&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

     &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;hotel&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xsl:number value=&quot;position()&quot; format=&quot;&amp;#xa; 0. &quot;/&gt;
          &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;hotelName&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

The expression in &lt;tt&gt;value&lt;/tt&gt; is evaluated and the value for &lt;tt&gt;position()&lt;/tt&gt; is based on the sorted node list.  To improve the looks we are adding the format attribute with a linefeed character reference (&amp;amp;#xa;), a zero digit to indicate that the number will be
a zero digit to indicate that the number will be an integer type, and a period and space to make it look nicer.  The format list can be based on the following sequences:   

'''Exhibit 17:  Numbering formats'''     
 &lt;tt&gt;format=&amp;quot; A. &amp;quot; &lt;/tt&gt;    –    Uppercase letters

 &lt;tt&gt;format=&amp;quot; 000. &amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt;   –    Numeral prefix       
 &lt;tt&gt;format=&amp;quot; 1- &amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt;     –    Integer prefix/ hyphen prefix  
     
To specify different levels of numbering, such as sections and subsections of the source document, the &lt;tt&gt;level&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is used, which tells the processor the levels of the source tree that should be considered.  By default, it is set to &lt;tt&gt;single&lt;/tt&gt;, as seen in the example above.  It also can take values of &lt;tt&gt;multiple&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;any&lt;/tt&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;count&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is a pattern that tells the processor which nodes to count (for numbering purposes).  If it is not specified, it defaults to a pattern matching the same node type as the current node.  The &lt;tt&gt;from&lt;/tt&gt; attribute can also be used to specify the node where the counting should start.       

When level is set to &lt;tt&gt;single&lt;/tt&gt;, the processor searches for nodes that match the value of &lt;tt&gt;count&lt;/tt&gt;, and if it is not present, it matches the current node.  When it finds the match, it creates a node-list and counts all the matching nodes of that type.  If the &lt;tt&gt;from&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is listed, it tells the processor where to start counting from, rather than counting all nodes.  

When the level is &lt;tt&gt;multiple&lt;/tt&gt;, it doesn't just count a list of one node type, it creates a list of all the nodes that are ancestors of the current node, in the actual order from the source document.  After this list is created, it selects all the nodes that match the nodes represented in count.  It then maps the number of preceding siblings for each node that matches count.  In effect, &lt;tt&gt;multiple&lt;/tt&gt; remembers all the nodes separately.  This is where &lt;tt&gt;any&lt;/tt&gt; is different.  It will number all the elements sequentially, instead of counting them in multiple levels.  As with the other two values, you can use the &lt;tt&gt;from&lt;/tt&gt; attribute to tell the processor where to start counting from, which in effect will separate it into levels.       

This is a modification of the example above using the &lt;tt&gt;level=&amp;quot;multiple&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt;:

The first template matches the root node and then selects all &lt;tt&gt;hotel&lt;/tt&gt; nodes that have &lt;tt&gt;country&lt;/tt&gt; as an ancestor, creating a node-list.  The next template recursively processes the &lt;tt&gt;amenityName&lt;/tt&gt; element, and gives it a number for each instance of &lt;tt&gt;amenityName&lt;/tt&gt; based on the number of elements in the attribute.  This is figured out by counting the number of preceding siblings, plus 1.

= Formatting = 
Formatting numbers is a simple process so this section will be a brief overview of what can be done.  Placed within the XML stylesheet, functions can be used to manipulate data during the transformation.  In order to make numbers a little easier to read, we need to be able to separate the digits into groups, or add commas or decimals. To do this we use the &lt;tt&gt;format-number()&lt;/tt&gt; function.  The purpose of this function is to convert a numeric value into a string using specified patterns that control the number of leading zeroes, separator between thousands, etc.  The basic syntax of this function is as follows: &lt;tt&gt;format-number (number, pattern) &lt;/tt&gt;      
*&lt;tt&gt;numbers&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;pattern &lt;/tt&gt;is a string that lays out the general representation of a number. Each character in the string represents either a digit from number or some special punctuation such as a comma or minus sign.
The following are the characters and their meanings used to represent the number format when using the format-number function within a stylesheet:

'''Exhibit 20:  Format-number function'''      
     '''Symbol'''              '''Meaning'''       
        0               A digit.
        #               A digit, zero shows as absent.       
        . (period)      Placeholder for decimal separator.       
        ,               Placeholder for grouping separator.       
        ;               Separate formats.       
        -               Default prefix for negative.       
        %               Multiply by 100 and show as a percentage.       
        X               Any other characters can be used in the prefix or suffix.       
        ‘               Used to quote special characters in a prefix or suffix.

= Conditional Processing =   
There are times when it is necessary to display output based on a condition. There are two instruction elements that let you conditionally determine which template will be used based on certain tests. These are the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;choose&lt;/tt&gt; elements.

The test condition for an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement must be contained within the &lt;tt&gt;test&lt;/tt&gt; attribute of the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;xsl:if&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element.  Expressions that are testing greater than and less than operators must represent them by “&amp;amp;gt;” and “&amp;amp;lt;” respectively in order for the appropriate transformation to take place.  The &lt;tt&gt;not()&lt;/tt&gt; function from XPath is a Boolean function and evaluates to true if its argument is false, and vice versa.  The &lt;tt&gt;and&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;or&lt;/tt&gt; conditions can be used to combine multiple tests, but an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement can, at most, test only one expression. It can also only instantiate the use of one template.  

The &lt;tt&gt;when&lt;/tt&gt; element, is similar to the &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; statement in Java.  By using the &lt;tt&gt;when&lt;/tt&gt; element, the &lt;tt&gt;choose&lt;/tt&gt; element can offer a many alternative expressions. A choose element must contain at least one when statement, but it can have as many as it needs. The choose element can also contain one instance of the otherwise element, which works like the final else in a Java program.  It contains the template if none of the other expressions are true.  

The &lt;tt&gt;for-each&lt;/tt&gt; element is another conditional processing element.  We have used it in previous chapter exercises, so this will be a quick review.  The &lt;tt&gt;for-each&lt;/tt&gt; element is an instruction element, which means it must be children of template elements.  &lt;tt&gt;for-each&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates to a node-set, based on the value of the select attribute, or expression, and processes through each node in document order, or sorted order.

=Parameters and Variables=
XSLT offers two similar elements, &lt;tt&gt;variable&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;param&lt;/tt&gt;. Both have a required &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt; attribute, and an optional &lt;tt&gt;select&lt;/tt&gt; attribute, and you declare them like this:    

'''Exhibit 21:  Variable and parameter declaration'''
      &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;&lt;i&gt;var1&lt;/i&gt;&quot; select=&quot;''&quot;/&gt;      
      &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;&lt;i&gt;par1&lt;/i&gt;&quot; select=&quot;''&quot;/&gt;   

The above declarations have bound to an empty string, which is the same effect as if you had left off the select attribute.  With parameters, this value is considered only a default, or initial value to be changed either from the command line, or from another template using the &lt;tt&gt;with-param&lt;/tt&gt; element.  However, with the variable, as a general rule, the value is set and can't be changed dynamically except under special circumstances.  When making declarations, remember that variables can be declared anywhere within a template, but a parameter must be declared at the beginning of the template.  

Both elements can also have global and local scope, depending on where they are
defined.  If they are defined at the top-level under the &amp;lt;stylesheet&amp;gt; elements, they are global in scope and can be used anywhere in the stylesheet. If they are defined in a template, they are local and can only be used in that template.  Variables and parameters declared in templates are visible only to the template they are declared in, and to templates underneath them. They have a cascading effect: they can spill down from the top-level into a template, down into a template within that one, etc, but they cannot go back up!  

We are going to hard-code a value for the parameter in it's declaration element using the &lt;tt&gt;select&lt;/tt&gt; attribute.

          &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
       &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The value that you pass in does not have to be enclosed in quotes, unless you are passing a value with more than one word.  For example, we could have passed
either country=&amp;quot;United States&amp;quot; or country=Belize without getting an error.  

The value of a variable can also be used to set an attribute value. Here is an example setting the countryName element with an attribute of countryCode equal to the value in the&lt;tt&gt;$code&lt;/tt&gt; variable:    

'''Exhibit 23:  Attribute of countryCode'''    
   &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;countryName countryCode=&amp;quot;{$code}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/countryName&amp;gt; &lt;/tt&gt;      

This is known as an attribute value template.  Notice the use of braces around the parameter.  This tells the processor to evaluate the content as an expression, which then converts the result to a string in the result tree.  There are  attributes which cannot be set with an attribute value template:       
* Attributes that contain patterns (such as &lt;tt&gt;select&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;apply-templates&lt;/tt&gt;)       
* Attributes of top-level elements       
* Attributes that refer to named objects (such as the &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt; attribute of &lt;tt&gt;template&lt;/tt&gt;)       

Parameters, though not variables, can be passed between templates using the &lt;tt&gt;with-param&lt;/tt&gt; element.  This element has two attributes, &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;, which is required, and &lt;tt&gt;select&lt;/tt&gt;, which is optional.  This next example uses with-param as a child of the &lt;tt&gt;call-template&lt;/tt&gt; element, although it can also be used as a child of &lt;tt&gt;apply-templates&lt;/tt&gt;.

*  &lt;tt&gt;call-template&lt;/tt&gt;, as discussed earlier, calls the template named&lt;tt&gt;countHotels&lt;/tt&gt;

*  The element &lt;tt&gt;with-param&lt;/tt&gt; tells the called template to use the parameter named &lt;tt&gt;num&lt;/tt&gt;, and the select statement sets the expression that will be evaluated.

*  Notice the declaration for the parameter is in the first line of the template. It instantiates &lt;tt&gt;num&lt;/tt&gt; to an empty string, because the value will be replaced by the value of the expression in the &lt;tt&gt;  with-param&lt;/tt&gt; element's &lt;tt&gt;select&lt;/tt&gt; attribute.

*  &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#xa;&lt;/tt&gt; outputs a line feed in the result tree to make the output look nicer.

=The Muenchian Method=
&lt;nowiki&gt;
The Muenchian Method is a method developed by Steve Muench for performing
  functions using keys.  Keys work by assigning a key value to a
  node and giving you access to that node through the key value.  If there are lots
  of nodes that have the same key value, then all those nodes are retrieved when you use
  that key value.  Effectively this means that if you want to group a set of nodes
  according to a particular property of the node, then you can use keys to group them
  together. One of the more common uses for the Muenchian method is grouping items and counting the number of
occurrences in that group, such as number of occurrences of a city&lt;/nowiki&gt;

= Datatypes =
There are five different datatypes in XSLT: Node-set, String, Number, Boolean, and Result tree fragment. Variables and parameters can be bound to each of these, but the last type is specific to them.  

Node-sets are returned everywhere in XSLT. We've seen them returned from &lt;tt&gt;apply-templates&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;for-each &lt;/tt&gt; elements, and variables. Now we will see how a variable can be bound to a node-set. Examine the following code:

'''Exhibit 26:  Variable bound to a node-set'''&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;cityNode&quot;  select=&quot;city&quot; /&gt;
...
&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;$cityNode/cityName&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;  
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, we are setting the value of the variable &lt;tt&gt;$cityNode&lt;/tt&gt; to the node-set &lt;tt&gt;city&lt;/tt&gt; from the source tree.  The &lt;tt&gt;cityName&lt;/tt&gt; element is a child of city, so the output generated by apply-templates is the text node of &lt;tt&gt;cityName&lt;/tt&gt;. Remember, you can use variable references in expressions but not patterns. This means we cannot use the reference &lt;tt&gt;$cityNode &lt;/tt&gt; as the value of a &lt;tt&gt;match&lt;/tt&gt; attribute.       

String types are useful if you are interested only in the text of nodes, rather than in the whole node-set.  String types use XPath functions, most notably, &lt;tt&gt;string()&lt;/tt&gt;. This is just a simple example:

'''Exhibit 27:  String types'''&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;cityName&quot; select=&quot;string('Belmopan')&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This is in fact, a longer way of saying: 

'''Exhibit 28:  Shorter version of above'''&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;cityName&quot; select=&quot;' Belmopan'&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
It is also possible to declare a variable that has a number value.  You do this by using the XPath function &lt;tt&gt;number()&lt;/tt&gt;.

'''Exhibit 29:  Declaration of variable with number value'''&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;population&quot; select=&quot;number(11100)&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can use numeric operators such as + - * / to perform mathematic operations on numbers, as well as some built in XPath functions such as &lt;tt&gt;sum()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;count()&lt;/tt&gt;.                 

The Boolean type has only two possible values, true or false.  As an example, we are going to use a Boolean variable to test to see if a parameter has been passed into the stylesheet. 
 
'''Exhibit 30:  Boolean variable to test'''&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:param name=&quot;isOk&quot; select=&quot;''&quot; /&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;city&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
          &lt;xsl:when test=&quot;boolean($isOk)&quot;&gt;
               …logic here…
          &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
          &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
               Error: must use parameter isOk with any value to apply template
          &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;    
&lt;/source&gt;

We start with an empty-string declaration for the parameter &lt;tt&gt;isOk&lt;/tt&gt;. In the &lt;tt&gt;test&lt;/tt&gt; attribute of &lt;tt&gt;when&lt;/tt&gt;, the &lt;tt&gt;boolean()&lt;/tt&gt; function tests the value of &lt;tt&gt;isOk&lt;/tt&gt;. If the value is an empty string, as we defined by default, &lt;tt&gt;boolean()&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;false()&lt;/tt&gt;, and the template is not instantiated. If it does have a value, and it can be any value at all, &lt;tt&gt;boolean()&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;true()&lt;/tt&gt;.       

The final datatype is the result tree fragment. Essentially it is a chunk of text (a string) that can contain markup. Let's look at an example before we dive into the details:  

'''Exhibit 31:  Result tree fragment datatype'''&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;fragment&quot;&gt;     
  &lt;description&gt;Belmopan is the capital of Belize&lt;/description&gt;      
  &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice we didn't use the select attribute to define the variable. We aren't selecting a node and getting its value, rather we are creating arbitrary text. Instead, we declared it as the content of the element. The text in between the opening and closing variable tags is the actual fragment of the result tree.  In general, if you use the select attribute as we did earlier, and don't specify content when declaring variables, the elements are empty elements. If you don't use select and you do specify content, the content is a result tree.  You can perform operations on it as if it were a string, but unlike a node set, you can't use operators such as / or // to get to the nodes. The way you retrieve the content from the variable and get it into the result tree is by using the copy-of element.  Let's see how we would do this:   

'''Exhibit 32:  Retrieve and place into result tree''' &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;city&quot;       
        &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;cityName&quot; /&gt;      
        &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;$fragment&quot; /&gt;       
   &lt;/xsl:template&gt;      
&lt;/source&gt;
The result tree would now contain two elements: a copy of the city element and the added element, description.

= EXSLT =
[http://www.exslt.org/ EXSLT]  is a set of community developed extensions to XSLT. The modules include facilities to handle dates and times, math, and strings.

= Multiple Stylesheets =
In previous chapters, we have imported and used multiple XML and schema documents. It is also possible to use multiple stylesheets using the &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;include&lt;/tt&gt; elements, which should be familiar.  It is also possible to process multiple XML documents at a time, in one stylesheet, by using the XSLT function &lt;tt&gt;document()&lt;/tt&gt;.  

Including an external stylesheet is very similar to what we have done in earlier chapters with schemas.  The &lt;tt&gt;include&lt;/tt&gt; element only has one attribute, which is &lt;tt&gt;href&lt;/tt&gt;. It is required and always contains a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) reference to the location of the file, which can be local (in the same local directory) or remote.  You can include as many stylesheets as you need, as long as they are at the top level.  They can be scattered all over the stylesheet if you want, as long as they are children of the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stylesheet&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element. When the processor encounters an instance of include, it replaces the instance with all the elements from the included document, including template rules and top-level elements, but not the root &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stylesheet&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element.  All the items just become part of the stylesheet tree itself, and the processor treats them all the same.  Here are declarations for including a local and remote stylesheet:     

'''Exhibit 33:  Declarations for local and remote stylesheet'''&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:include href=&quot;city.xsl&quot; /&gt;
&lt;xsl:include href=&quot;http://www.somelocation.com/city.xsl&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Since &lt;tt&gt;include&lt;/tt&gt; returns all the elements in the included stylesheet, you need to make sure that the stylesheet you are including does not include your own stylesheet. For example, city.xsl cannot include city_hotel.xsl, if city_hotel.xsl has an include element which includes city.xsl.  When including multiple files, you need to make sure that you are not including another stylesheet multiple times.  If city_hotel.xsl includes amenity.xsl, and country.xsl includes amenity.xsl, and city.xsl includes both city_hotel.xsl and country.xsl, it has indirectly included amenity.xsl twice.  This could cause template rule duplication and errors.  These are some confusing rules, but they are easy to avoid if you carefully examine the stylesheets before they are included.

The difference between importing stylesheets and including them is that the template rules imported each have a different import precedence, while included stylesheet templates are merged into one tree and processed normally.  Imported templates form an import tree, complete with the root &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stylesheet&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element so the processor can track the order in which they were imported. Just like include, import has one attribute, href, which is required and should contain the URI reference for the document. It is also a top-level element and can be used as many times as need.  However, it must be the immediate child for the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stylesheet&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element, otherwise there will be errors. This code demonstrates importing a local stylesheet:  

'''Exhibit 34:  Importing local stylesheet'''&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;city.xsl&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The order of the &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; elements dictates the precedence that matching templates will have over one another.  Templates that are imported last have higher priority than those that are imported first.  However, the &lt;tt&gt;template&lt;/tt&gt; element also has a &lt;tt&gt;priority&lt;/tt&gt; attribute that can affect its priority. The higher the number in the &lt;tt&gt;priority&lt;/tt&gt; attribute, the higher the precedence.  Import priority only comes into effect when templates collide, otherwise importing stylesheets is not that much different from including them.  Another way to handle colliding templates is to use the &lt;tt&gt;apply-imports&lt;/tt&gt; element.  If a template in the imported document collides with a template in the importing document, apply-templates will override the rule and cause the imported template to be invoked.  

The &lt;tt&gt;document()&lt;/tt&gt; function allows you to process additional XML documents
and their nodes. The function is called from any attribute that uses an expression, such as the &lt;tt&gt;select&lt;/tt&gt; attribute.  For example:       

'''Exhibit 35:  Document() function'''&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;hotel&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xsl:element name=&quot;amenityList&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xsl:copy-of select=&quot;document('amenity.xml')&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:element&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

When applied to an xml document that only contains an empty hotel element, such as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;hotel&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/hotel&amp;gt;, &lt;/tt&gt;the result tree will add a new element called amenityList, and place all the content from amenity.xml (except the XML declaration) in it. The document function can take many other parameters such as a remote URI, and a node-set, just to name a few.

= XSL-FO =   
XSL-FO stands for Extensible Stylesheet Language Formatting Objects and is a language for formatting XML data.  When it was created, XSL was originally split into two parts, XSL and XSL-FO.  Both parts are now formally named XSL. XSL-FO documents define a number of rectangular areas for displaying output. XSL-FO is used for the formatting of XML data for output to screen, paper or other media, such as PDF format.  For more information, visit http://www.w3schools.com/xslfo/default.asp

| XML stylesheets can output XML, text, HTML or XHTML. When an XSL processor transforms an XML document, it converts it to a result tree of nodes, each of which can be manipulated, extracted, created, or set aside, depending on the rules contained in the stylesheet. The root element of a stylesheet is the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stylesheet&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element. Stylesheets contain top-level and instruction elements.  Templates use XPath locations to match a pattern of nodes in the source tree, and then apply defined rules to the nodes when it finds a match. Templates can be named, have a mode, or a priority. Node sets from the source tree can be sorted or formatted.  XSLT uses for-each and if elements for conditional processing.  XSLT also supports the use of variables and parameters.  There are five basic datatypes: a node-set, a string, a number, a Boolean, and a result tree fragment.  A stylesheet can also &lt;tt&gt;include&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; additional stylesheets or even additional XML documents. XSL-FO is used for formatting data into rectangular objects.

'''Allegro''' is a cross-platform game programming library for C/C++. Allegro is powerful but easy to use. It handles the low-level details of graphics, sound and input so users can concentrate on the higher level aspects of game creation and design.

Though many people find this to be an easy program to use, the potential of allegro is exponential.
When using Allegro there are many ways that one can use the simple language to do with what they like.
The way one uses this language is in the following way:

# Download Bloodshed C++ (PC)
#:Download allegro library and reference it in the code with '&lt;#include&gt; &quot;allegro/h&quot;' at the very top of the code
# Download XCode (mac)
#: Download allegro library and install it on the computer and when a new XCode project is created one of the choices as a new project will be &quot;allegro document&quot;

== Electric Field ==

'''Charged particles''' create an electric field

A good way to look at an electric field is '''electrolysis'''.  

'''''&lt;em style=&quot;font-family:Arial Black;color:blue&quot;&gt;cathode&lt;/em&gt; = '''''&lt;em style=&quot;font-family:Arial Black;color:green&quot;&gt;electron emitter.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
'''''&lt;em style=&quot;font-family:Arial Black;color:blue&quot;&gt;anode&lt;/em&gt; = '''''&lt;em style=&quot;font-family:Arial Black;color:green&quot;&gt;electron collector.&lt;/em&gt;  (Means up the path).  &lt;br&gt;

==Static Electricity==

''This is a rough draft.''

Generated by contact between dissimilar materials, dissapates through moisture when humid, dry air is a better insulator.

''As this is a book, it should have historical stories and stuff to make it more interesting.  Greeks and amber in this section, for instance.''

When a solitary atom has the same number of electrons and protons, it has no overall charge.  The individual charges cancel out.  It is said to be ''neutral''.

An atom that has more electrons than protons is negatively charged.  The atom will have a tendency to attract other particles that have a positive charge, and repel particles with a negative charge.

An atom that has less electrons than protons is positively charged.  The atom will attract negative particles (like solitary electrons or negatively charged atoms) and repel positive particles (like solitary protons or positively charged atoms).

If a solitary proton and electron are placed near each other (or even far away, as long as nothing else is nearby), they will move closer together, until the electron becomes &quot;attached&quot; to the proton and they form a hydrogen atom.  An atom of metal that is positively charged (missing electrons) and a free electron will behave the same way.

The same goes for macroscopic objects.  A metal sphere that has a significant amount of atoms that have the same number of electrons and protons is neutral.  Also, if there are several atoms that are positively charged or negatively charged, it is said that the whole object is charged. This may not be noticeable if only a few atoms on the object are charged.

Charged metal spheres will attract and repel each other according to the same rules as individual particles.  

A solitary metal sphere with an excess of electrons will tend to have the extra electrons spread out evenly across the surface of the sphere (not in the interior).  This is because the electrons repel each other, and try to get as far apart as possible.  On a positively charged sphere, the positive charge (absence of electrons) also spreads evenly across the surface due to its lack of electrons. (Talk about the neat shielding properties of Faraday cages)  In the space inside to the sphere there is no charge.

In the case of insulating spheres charge does not move throughout the object, it just sits there.  The electrons in this object are not constantly moving from atom to atom, so the empty holes have no way to be filled by their neighbors. 

A Van de Graaff generator is basically a pump for electrons (or a &quot;charge pump&quot;).  It uses the triboelectric effect to take electrons from one conductor and deposit them on another.  The triboelectric effect is caused when two different materials are brought into contact and then separated.  One material will have more of a tendency to attract extra electrons, and some of the electrons will transfer from one material to the other.  The Van de Graaff generator accomplishes this with a silk or rubber belt held tightly between two rollers of different materials.  As the belt comes into contact with one roller and then separates, it picks up charge from the roller.  When it comes into contact with the other roller and then separates, it deposits the charge.  

It thus makes one roller positively charged and the other negatively charged.  The electrons are supplied to one roller and extracted from the other by metal brushes, connected to the large conductors.  This creates a voltage between the conductors, due to their distance.

''(Should we really be going into so much detail about it though?...  I guess as an example of a very basic electric circuit, it is a good example.  Maybe we could just link to Wikipedia triboelectric effect?  That's the thing I don't like about wikibooks.  You have to provide all of the background instead of just directing them to it.)''

A dielectric is the material between two charges.  It impeds the flow of charge until a certain voltage threshold at which point charge starts flowing.

''When I first learned about capacitors I thought that this was the way capacitors were used.  They charge up to a strong enough voltage and then the dielectric breaks down and then they charge up again.  I thought this was the basis for timer circuits.  We need to be careful to separate dielectric breakdown from things that are '''supposed''' to happen in electronic circuits.''

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Nikola Herweg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Nikola Herweg~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) allows you to add structure and hyperlinks to a text. This in turn allows a web browser to display that text in a useful manner to the user. The mark-up you use has little or nothing to do with the display of the text: this makes it possible to display the hypertext on a wide array of devices.

The web browser has to make a translation between the mark-up you provide and display properties. For instance, a heading can be displayed in bold, large text on a graphical browser, and can be spoken out loudly in a speech browser, et cetera. 

Generally, manufacturers of web browsers make good choices. As well-trained readers, we know that a bold large text on its own line over a mass of normal sized text is probably its heading. So when a browser renders a heading like that, we tend to recognize it as a heading without even thinking. List items are preceded by list item markers such as numbers or 'bullets', emphasized text is printed in bold or italics, et cetera. 

Manufacturers of graphical web browser even consider that reading off a screen is hard: paragraphs are divided by empty lines, text is generally printed (by default) using a relatively large font-size, and hyperlinks are clearly marked as such, by using different colors and underlines or surrounding lines (the latter in the case of images). 

There are two things though, that current web browsers are getting wrong. One is that they display each and every webpage the same; the other that they generally fail at presenting webpages in an aesthetically pleasing way.

It can certainly be argued that the browser manufacturers cannot be blamed for these problems. 

=== Excercise 4-1 ===

Why can manufacturers of web browsers not be blamed for rendering all webpages alike? Why can they not be blamed for displaying webpages in an aesthetically unpleasing way? You may also argue the reverse, if you like.

One of the few clues a visitor might have about the quality of webpages is provided by a concept called website. A website is a collection of webpages that belong together. Because they belong together, they provide a powerful hint to the visitor that information that was promised on one page of the website, may be found on another page of that website. Similarly, if the visitor accepts the voice of a webpage author as an authority, other webpages by that author may provide an interesting target for further visits. 

There are several ways in which an author can make clear that webpages form part of one overarching website. One of these ways has already been discussed: by using a sensible &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; text, authors can show that pages belong together. The title of this page, &quot;Adapting a webpage for visual browsers - Wikibooks&quot;, helps to underline this. All pages on the Wikibooks website have a title that ends with &quot;- Wikibooks&quot;. If you feel like reading other textbooks, the message is clear: you should be on this site.

Another way to suggest a relation between webpages, that is, to suggest a website, is in the strategic use of the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the address of a webpage that is often displayed in a webbrowser's address bar. You can use similar addresses for similar webpages.  

The third way to suggest a relation between webpages is probably the most useful, though: you can use a uniform visual style to indicate to visitors on which website they are.

=== A bit of history ===

Originally, HTML was a mish-mash of graphical display mark-up and structural mark-up. This sounds perhaps worse than it was: only a few elements were reserved for visual presentation, such as &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; for bold text, and &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; for italicized text. Further, &lt;code&gt;PRE&lt;/code&gt; allowed an author to display text using 'plain text formatting' (as discussed before), &lt;code&gt;BR&lt;/code&gt; forced a graphical browser to start displaying following text on a new line, and &lt;code&gt;IMG&lt;/code&gt; let you display an image at a certain point in the text. 

All this wasn't so bad, really. It did not introduce a huge drop in accessibility, but allowed authors of pages for graphical clients (more or less the default since the beginning of the web) to 'ponce up' their pages and make them more attractive to visitors. 

However, by allowing display-only elements in an otherwise display-independent language, Tim Berners-Lee opened the door for abuse by browser manufacturers. 

The possibility to create a visually pleasing web page made the web a more attractive place to be. Just like the DTP revolution made everybody think that they were graphical designers (mistakenly, most of the time), so did the graphical web open the door for letting form rule over content.

When the web became more popular with users, it of course also became more popular with businesses. Actual businesses were founded to produce web browsers, something almost unheard of before. The most successful of these was Netscape.

==== Browser wars ====

Netscape quickly recognised that the instant appeal of pretty webpages was just as strong a selling-point for a web browser, if not stronger, than the other, more solid appeals, such as the promise of becoming one's own publisher, or being able to traverse a associative landscape of ideas.

However, Netscape only had control over the browser, not over the web itself, or its underlying HTM Language. So what Netscape did was let its web browser, Navigator, recognise an extended version of HTML. Frames, for instance, are a Netscape invention, as is JavaScript and the &lt;code&gt;FONT&lt;/code&gt; element. Using this strategy, Netscape Navigator soon became by far the most used browser on the web. With it the web (and with the web the internet) became a public space, rather than the academic space it had been before.

The one software company that had thoroughly missed the internet boat, and that was Microsoft. To the day of writing this, Microsoft still does not understand the internet: they don't see it as a space within which to operate, but rather as a thing to be owned. In the beginning they even tried to replace it with its own 'internet', called MSN; which is of course nonsense, because the internet is not an atomic network. It is a network of network. MSN was to be part of the internet, much to the chagrin of Bill Gates and his people.

Meanwhile, Netscape looked further ahead. For them, the internet was a vehicle to gain control over the 'desktop', the metaphor 1980s' operating systems use to describe themselves. If everybody had Netscape Navigator installed, and Netscape Navigator was this universal tool that could be used for everything, from playing games to word processing, it did not really matter which operating system was running beneath the browser. 

Microsoft was, through its original disdain for the internet and the web, suddenly threatened in the core reason of its existence. It then made a strategic decision that pulled it right into the centre of the internet: it would build its own browser.

Microsoft's browser was called Internet Explorer, and it started the so-called browser wars. Microsoft started playing Netscape's game. It first supported almost all of Netscape's HTML extensions, added a few of its own, and changed the behaviour of some elements in a way that made them work slightly better.

The web was under a threat of balkanization: the dividing in parts so small, that dealing with the web, and especially authoring web pages, was to become an ordeal that would almost prove too much for authors and surfers alike. 

Authors suddenly had to decided which browsers to support, or if they should support specific browsers at all. The possibility to treat the web as a purely visual medium planted the misguided thought in a lot of heads that web pages should look alike everywhere.

This was when the World Wide Web Consortium stepped in, and started rallying for stricter standards, and a division of document structure and document lay-out. The smartest move of the W3C was to get the browser manufacturers on board. With Microsoft and Netscape both having a direct say about how next versions of HTML would look like, they became stakeholders with an interest in creating a useful web language.

The W3C introduced a programming language for suggesting certain lay-outs to a web browser, called CSS. That abbreviation stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Stylesheets had a couple of things going for them. Most importantly, they promised a 'code once, view everywhere' approach to web authoring. This was good for the W3C, because that approach was what HTML was about in the first place. And it was good for the authors, because now they did not have to learn about the quirks of every web browser.

Other advantages of CSS were from the start: 

* They could be stored in separate files, so that the style for an entire site could be stored in one stylesheet; 
* They allowed for chaining ('cascading') stylesheets, so that part of a website could have its own distinct style from the rest of the site, while still looking part of the site; and
* They enabled a few tricks that Netscape and Microsoft hadn't gotten to yet, such as more control over text styles.

==== Future ====

It could be argued that allowing a few graphical display elements in a hypertext language was a good move. It popularized the web, and with it the internet. It introduced a great deal of authors to the web. However, today many of these authors see the web as a visual medium rather than the (hyper)textual medium it really is. Weaning those people from their wrong notion may prove an impossible task.

== Websites and home pages ==

=== Websites ===

As we saw before, webpages form part of the web, because they link to other pages or because other pages link to them. In other words, web pages do not live in a vacuum. When you receive a folder in a letter box for a pizza delivery service for instance, there is no context. You do not generally receive copies of competing services simultaneously, or a map that shows you where the delivery service is located, or an encyclopaedia that tells you about the history of pizzas. 

A webpage does come with such a context. For instance, if you visit a webpage that lets you order pizzas, you probably visited a page before that which let you choose from several pizza delivery services. Also, the order page may link to a map, or to an article about the history of pizzas. Even if it does not do so, the web browser may provide additional functionality to you. For instance, if you selected the name of a pizza in the Firefox web browser, then right-clicked, a menu item would appear that would let you search Google for the selected text in a new tab in the background.

Although all webpages have a such a context, only the ones provide by you are under your control. When you group a number of related webpages, such a grouping is called a website. Webpages may form a website for any number of reasons; because they belong to the same subject, because they are hosted on the same server, because they live on the same domain, or because the are created by a single person or organisation.

For instance, the collection of webpages at http://www.nasa.gov form the website of the US national space agency NASA. They may not all be served by the same server, and they are not created all by the same person, but they live on the same domain, try to be the voice of NASA on the web and deal with topics that are all related to NASA.

A person or an organisation may of course have multiple websites; and what is called a website in this respect is not really important. 

Websites are often characterised by 

* a main site navigation (&quot;menus&quot; of hyperlinks that are repeated on every webpage and that lead to important sections), 
* a coherent visual style across webpages, including a logo and a favicon, 
* coherent page names, for instance by repeating the site's name in the title element,
* a natural division of the website in topics and subtopics.

All these clues tell you after going from one page to another that you are either on the same website, or have left for another website. Most web authors get these clues at least partially right, and most web page visitors are able to tell which website they are on.

An interesting feature of a webpage is then that it contains information that is at the core of what the author wanted to say with that particular webpage, but that it also contains information to the visitor that they are on a particular website, where they are on that site, where they can go, etc.

Most webpages will contain a lot of information that are pertinent to the subject of that page, and a little information about the website itself. The exceptions are called home pages; home pages are about the website they are part of.

=== Home pages ===

The word &quot;homepage&quot; can mean a number of things; often it is used to indicate the website of a private person with. Here we use it in the meaning of a webpage that forms the &quot;holy&quot; page of a website, the page where visitors of a site can find pause and direction.

Sometimes people speak of a start page of begin page when they mean homepage. However, that word might create confusion, because they might also be understood to 

A homepage has a number of functions and a number of rules and heuristics that it better adhere to. The functions of a homepage are to: 

* provide navigational aid to those who are lost
* provide information on the site's overriding theme
* establish the brand identity of a website (what do webpages on this site look like?)
* provide leads to the rest of the site
* provide a means for visitors to reorient themselves
* provide the minimal location for a webpage author to link to
* live at an easy to remember location

Let's review these.

==== Navigational aid ====

When a visitor follows a information scent to your webpage, the webpage may or may not fulfil the information wish of the visitor. In the latter case, a visitor will either want to track back, or follow further scents. 

As we have noted, the indication that a webpage is part of a website provides a powerful hint to the visitor that the same voice that wrote the webpage has written other webpages on possibly similar subjects. A visitor who does not succeed at the current webpage, or who has succeeded, but now has changed goals, may want to further explore your websites. 

For example, if you collect jokes, and a visitor thinks the first of your jokes is funny, they may wish to read more of your jokes. 

Links on the webpage to related webpages can be very useful; but sometimes these links are lacking, or they are worded in a way that does not help your visitor, or they do not make clear that they lead to parts of the same website; and often a webpage does not show the intentions an author has with a website, the freshness of a website et cetera.

A homepage should provide this sort of information, or at least leads to it. A homepage of a larger should also provide alternative ways of navigation. This could be done through:

* a search function
* a main menu
* a catalogue
* highlighted webpages

A common way to link to a homepage is to use the logo or site name as a hyperlink, or to link to it from a breadcrumb trail.

== Site style ==

In order to find out that you are on a website, you need to have visited at least two webpages on that site: one to establish that a certain style was used, another to verify that style. Any webpage on a site can be used for that second function, but the homepage must always be usable in this way.

== Site meaning ==

The homepage of a website should always make clear what the website is about, just like a webpage should always make clear what that webpage is about.

== News ==

In lieu of other designated places where a visitor can review whether pages of a website have been added or updated, the homepage should be regularly updated to indicate that a website is still &quot;alive&quot;. Popular ways to do this are to show leads to recent news item, to regularly change highlighted items, or to regularly make simple changes to the lay-out of the homepage. Other ways are to introduce seasonal elements into a homepage. For instance, you could use your homepage to wish visitors happy holidays.

Other designated places that allow you to assess the liveliness of a website are the news page, or for example the Recent Changes page at Wikipedia. You can use these pages instead of the homepage for situational feedback, as long as it is clear to visitors that they need to look somewhere else, for instance because you clearly link to a news section. 

== Location ==

In general, you will wish to let the world know about specific webpages, instead of your website. However, there are instances when the latter is desirable. For those instances it would be useful if the homepage were easy to find and to get to. One way to achieve is, is to locate the homepage at the shortest possible URL. If your webpages are at http://www.example.com/~wily/friends.html, http://www.example.com/~wily/album.html, and http://www.example.com/~wily/contact.html, your homepage should be at http://www.example.com/~wily/. (When faced with a request for a directory instead of a file, a webserver will generally start looking for files with a certain name, such as index.html, index.php, welcome.html etc. This behaviour differs from webserver to webserver, but index.html is usually a pretty safe file name to give to your homepage.)

Also, when you forget to link to a homepage, or when the link cannot easily be found, visitors will apply a trick called the directory traversal attack. Despite its goulish name and the fact that it is a crime in the UK, this is a perfectly moral and fine thing to do. It works by guessing the parts of a URL that are superfluous for the homepage address.

For example, if you are at http://www.example.com/~wily/friends.html, removing &quot;friends.html&quot; or &quot;~wily/friends.html&quot; from the full address in the address bar of your web browser, may lead to the homepage of this webpage's site.


== Recapitulation ==

In essence, a homepage provides situational knowledge about a website. It should show a visitor what the site is about, what its main themes are, how you can get there, how fresh a site is, etc.

I see someone has changed
''&quot;There are four central problems in data management: capture, storage, retrieval, and exchange.&quot;''
to
''&quot;There are five central problems in data management: capture, storage, retrieval, and exchange.&quot;''
Huh ?

Yeah, this is an inherent flaw in using wiki.

My understanding of xml is not that it will replace html but will complement html.  Is this true?  If so consider changing  this statement which somehow does not ring true with me.

&quot;XML should steadily replace HTML on many Web sites because of some key advantages.&quot;



Using a rich application like NetBeans seems like a bad idea.  It can only run decently on two of the three machines I have, and in a way, you are more learning how to use a support tool to write XML than learning how to write XML.  I suppose it makes the whole process easier though :|

From Wikibooks, the free textbook project.

Hi and welcome to wikibooks. I noticed you started a book on electronics and just wanted to point out that i have already written a very basic introduction to electronics in the GCSE science book. Take a look at [[GCSE Science/Electricity|Circuits (GCSE science)]] and the pages that follow - you may find it easier to visit Electricity (GCSE science) and navigate from there. Feel free to copy anything you want including any of the diagrams. (click on a diagram and it will take you to a description page titles image:image_name.png, copy the title of the description page into the page you want and put double square brackets around it like this [[Image:image name.png]]. Preview and you should see the image appear on the page. Theresa knott 12:54, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Do we need any permission to use content from Wikipedia?

No. Anything from Wikipedia is copyleft, and can be used as long as the same freedoms are provided. However, you '''must''' comply with the site license which includes providing attribution. This is usually done by requesting a history import at [[WB:RFI]].

I'm guessing this includes images.

No it does not include images. Images hosted on Wikipedia may be subject to copyright and used under fair use criteria that do not necessarily apply here.

Anyone want to look at this license to see if we can use the electronics book?

==Klunky==

&quot;The web page is written in HTML and Javascript. Because of that the source code is wide open and available to all. Radio amateurs are encourged to take the code, modify it, and create something even more useful to the ham community. The way the web page operates does not have to be limited to schematics. It could be extended to other uses such as printed circuit board layout.&quot;

&quot;These things imply that it's ideal for amateur radio. It can be shared all over the world, which is where hams are. It can be used with diverse equipment, which hams have. It it can be modified, which hams love to do. And hams need simple, albiet clunky, schematics.

So, Klunky is my gift to amateur radio. If some ham, somewhere, can get some use out of it, he's welcome to it.&quot;

I am sure he wouldn't mind if we use it.  He says the code is open.  I have written him to ask specifically, but he hasn't responded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Magnetic Field: B==

A magnetic field is generated due to:
# Magnetic moment.
# Moving charge.

* Magnets have two poles, a north and a south. 
* Like poles repel, unlike poles attract.

* Magnets will try to align their poles.

* North and south pole: pole of earth is reversed; geographic north is magnetic south and vice versa.

* Polarity: the alignment of the magnetic field.
* Magnetic monopole: the idea that a single independent pole can exist

* Pauli-exclusion principle: Two electrons cannot occupy the same state. 

* Spin: quantum property of electrons, which gives them intrinsic angular momentum. This means, they act as if they were perpetually spinning around their own axis.

*  Permanent dipoles: These occur when 2 atoms in a molecule have substantially different electronegativity - one atom attracts electrons more than another becoming more negative, while the other atom becomes more positive. See dipole-dipole attractions. 

* Instantaneous dipoles: These occur due to chance when electrons happen to be more concentrated in one place than another in a molecule, creating a temporary dipole. See Instantaneous dipole attraction. 

* Induced dipoles: These occur when one molecule with a permanent dipole repels another molecule's electrons, &quot;inducing&quot; a dipole moment in that molecule. See induced-dipole attraction. 

* magnetic dipole: Analogous to electric dipole. It refers to a magnetic field that looks as if it came from a pair of north and south monopoles, infintesimally close together.

* magnetic moment (u): The tendency of an object to align itself with a magnetic field. This alignment creates a PE (U). A current carrying loop has a magnetic moment. Electrons and many nuclei have intrinsic magnetic moments due to their quantum spin. The electrons generally come in pairs, whose intrinsic magnetic moments cancel, but they may still produce a magnetic dipole because they rotate (have orbital angular momentum), or produce a magnetic quadropole because of incomplete cancellation.  These intrinsic magnetic moments create some of the macroscopic effects of magnetism, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.&lt;br&gt; ''An object with a magnetic moment creates an magnetic dipole''

* intrinsic magnetic moment: The moment which a thing has. Due to intrinsic angular momentum.

&lt;math&gt;F = qV x B&lt;/math&gt;

==Permeability: &amp;mu;==

* Permeability: (&amp;mu;) How much a material becomes magnetized in response to a magnetic field.

* Permeability of vacuum: (μ0): 4π × 10-7 N·A&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (exactly).

* Relative Permeability: (μ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) Permeability of materials compared to that of the vacuum.

: &lt;math&gt; \mu_r = {\mu \over \mu_o} &lt;/math&gt;

* Absolute magnetic permeability (μ): = μ0(1 + χ). henry / meter.

* Magnetic susceptibility (χ): the fractional part of the relative permeability. 
If χ is positive the magnetic field increase and the material is paramagnetic and if χ is negative the magnetic field decreases and the material is diamagnetic.

:&lt;math&gt;
\chi = \frac {M} {H},
&lt;/math&gt;

===Paramagnetism===

Paramagnetism: (with magnetism) tendency of a magnetic dipoles to align itself with an external magnetic field due to the effects of spin. By aligning themselves the dipoles strengthen the external magnetic field. (relative magnetic permeability &gt; 1, magnetic susceptibility 10-3 to 10-5) When the magnetic field is removed thermal motion will quickly disrupt magnetic alignment. Paramagnetism acts on each dipole of an atom separately with no interactions between the dipoles. Behaves like a bar magnet when subject to an external magnetic field. 

&lt;math&gt;M = C {B \over T}&lt;/math&gt;

M magnetisation, B magnetic flux, T is absolute temperature (Kelvin), and C is a material-specific Curie constant. Increasing the magnetic field makes paramagnetic materials more magnetic, decreasing the temperature reverses this. Curie's is accurate when saturation is low and stops working as the material becomes saturated. 

&lt;!--
Superparamagnetism is a phenomenon by which magnetic materials may exhibit a behavior similar to paramagnetism at temperatures below the Curie or the Neel temperature.

Normally, coupling forces in magnetic materials cause the magnetic moments of neighboring atoms to align, resulting in very large internal magnetic fields. At temperatures above the Curie temperature (or the Neel temperature for antiferromagnetic materials), the thermal energy is sufficient to overcome the coupling forces, causing the atomic magnetic moments to fluctuate randomly. Because there is no longer any magnetic order, the internal magnetic field no longer exists and the material exhibits paramagnetic behavior.

Superparamagnetism occurs when the material is composed of very small crystallites (1-10 nm). In this case even though the temperature is below the Curie or Neel temperature and the thermal energy is not sufficient to overcome the coupling forces between neighboring atoms, the thermal energy is sufficient to change the direction of magnetization of the entire crystallite. The resulting fluctuations in the direction of magnetization cause the magnetic field to average to zero. The material behaves in a manner similar to paramagnetism, except that instead of each individual atom being independently influenced by an external magnetic field, the magnetic moment of the entire crystallite tends to align with the magnetic field.

The energy required to change the direction of magnetization of a crystallite is called the Crystalline anisotropy energy and depends both on the material properties and the crystallite size. As the crystallite size decreases, so does the Crystalline anisotropy energy, resulting in a decrease in the temperature at which the material becomes superparamagnetic. 
--&gt;

===Diamagnetism===

* Diamagnetism: (against magnetism) The orbital motion of electrons forms a microscopic current loop that has a magnetic dipole moment. A purely diamagnetic material is a superconductor, which is a phase transition that has no magnetic field and no resistance. 

* Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect: the exclusion of a magnetic field from the inside of a superconductor. Also called '''perfect diamagnetism'''.

&lt;!--
The Meissner effect is sometimes confused with the &quot;perfect diamagnetism&quot; one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to Lenz's law, when a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electrical current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.

The phenomenon where a magnet's lines of force (called flux) become trapped or &quot;pinned&quot; inside a superconducting material. This pinning binds the superconductor to the magnet at a fixed distance. Flux-pinning is only possible when there are defects in the crystalline structure of the superconductor usually resulting from grain boundaries or impurities). Flux-pinning is desirable in high-temperature ceramic superconductors in order to prevent &quot;flux-creep&quot;, which can create a pseudo-resistance and depress critical current density and critical field.
--&gt;

* cooper pairs: When electrons of opposite spin become paired due to low energy. Like atoms bonding. Being in a cooper pair binds electrons together so they are not scattered from the ions in the material. This causes the resistance of the material to become zero.

* High-temperature superconductivity: superconductivity at temperatures high enough to use liquid nitrogen rather than liquid helium as a coolant.(Important because liquid nitrogen is cheap and easy to obtain)

&lt;!--
An electron moving through a conductor will cause a slight increase in concentration of positive charges in the lattice around it; this increase in turn can attract another electron. In effect, the two electrons are then held together with a certain binding energy. If this binding energy is higher than the energy provided by kicks from oscillating atoms in the conductor (which is true at low temperatures), then the electron pair will stick together and resist all kicks, thus not experiencing resistance.

The exclusion of magnetic flux is brought about by electrical &quot;screening currents&quot; that flow at the surface of the superconducting metal and which generate a magnetic field that exactly cancels the externally applied field inside the superconductor. These screening currents are generated whenever a superconducting metal is brought inside a magnetic field. This may be understood from the fact that a superconductor has zero electrical resistance (so the &quot;eddy currents&quot; induced by motion of the metal inside a magnetic field will not decay). However, the screening currents also appear in a situation where an initially normal conducting metal is placed inside a magnetic field, as soon as the metal is cooled below the transition temperature (such that it becomes superconducting). This expulsion of magnetic field on cooling down the metal cannot be explained any more by merely assuming zero resistance. It shows that the superconducting state does not depend on the history of preparation (only on the present values of temperature, pressure and magnetic field), and therefore is a true thermodynamic state.

Superconducting magnetic levitation is due to the Meissner effect (which repels a permanent magnet) and flux pinning, which stops the magnet from sliding away. 
--&gt;

* superfluidity: When atoms are cooper paired due to spin. Turns a solid into a gas. A state of matter characterized by the complete absence of viscosity. Thus superfluids, placed in a closed loop, can flow endlessly without friction.

* phonon: thermal energy in a solid. Takes the form of vibrations. As a solid gets cold it stops vibrating and forms cooper pairs. Responsible for electron pairing and electrical conductivity, how well a material conducts charge. 

:copper, bismuth

===Ferromagnetism===

* magnetization: zero above Curie temperature.

* spontaneous magnetization: the tendency of spins to align without an applied magnetic field.

* Ferromagnetism: (iron magnetism) Phenomenon by which materials exhibit spontaneous magnetization. Most common and one of the strongest forms of magnetism. Found in bar magnets and permanent magnets. Magnetic moments are partially aligned in magnetic domains. Increasing temperature causes thermal fluctuations and destroys alignment. Above Curie temperature ferromagnetic domains melt away (no net spontaneous magnetization) if there is no external magnetic field, and the material become purely paramagnetic. The Pauli Exclusion principle causes magnetic dipoles to align in the same direction with lower energy known as '''exchange energy'''. Over distance dipoles repel each other. This is the principle behind magnetic domains. A '''Block Wall''' is the transition between magnetic regions. A strong magnet will align the domains. 

: iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, and some alloys and ceramics.

* Curie temperature: Temperature at which a ferromagnetic material undergoes a phase transition and becomes paramagnetic. At this temperature magnetic susceptibility is theoretically infinite. Phase transition.

* Curie point: Above which material becomes paramagnetic. When combined with ferromagnetism follows hysteresis curve with applied field. Used as temperature control in soldering irons.

* Curie points: dysprosium -188 °C gadolinium 16 °C nickel 358 °C iron 770 °C cobalt 1131 °C

* Antiferromagnetism: The spins of electrons align an a regular pattern.

* Neel temperature: The temperature at which antiferromagnetic materials undergo a phase transition and become paramagnetic due to thermal energy.

* spin glass: exhibits high magnetic frustration.

* magnetic frustration: Its magnetic structure is disordered even at low temperatures.

&lt;!--
In materials that exhibit antiferromagnetism, the spins of magnetic electrons align in a regular pattern with neighboring spins pointing in opposite directions. This is the opposite of ferromagnetism. Generally, antiferromagnetic materials exhibit antiferromagnetism at a low temperature, and become disordered above a certain temperature; the transition temperature is called the Neel temperature. Above the Neel temperature, the material is typically paramagnetic.

The magnetic susceptibility of an antiferromagnetic material will appear to go through a maximum as the temperature is lowered; in contrast, that of a paramagnet will continually increase with decreasing temperature.

Antiferromagnetic materials have a negative coupling between adjacent moments and low frustration.

Antiferromagnetic materials are relatively uncommon. An example is the heavy-fermion superconductor URu2Si2. 
--&gt;

====Permanent Magnets====
[[Image:Domains_in_soft_iron.png]]

Ferromagnetic materials make up permanent magnets.

To understand how a permanent magnet is made and destroyed it is necessary to look at the microscopic structure of a magnetic material such as iron. A piece of iron is made up of lots and lots of tiny little magnets called domains. In unmagnetised iron these domains have their north poles pointing all over the place in a random way, but when the iron is put in a strong magnetic field the domains line up with the field. The iron becomes magnetised.

Once it has become magnetised, the magnet's own field is strong enough to keep itself magnetised even after it is removed from the external field.

''Picture Hysteris Curve''

Hysteris curve. heat destroys magnetism if the material is heated above its ''Curie'' point.

* Remanence: (Bd, Mr) The amount of magnetism remaining after a magnetic field is removed. Less than the applied magnetic field.

* Residual induction:

* Retentivity: retains some residual magnetism.

* Saturation: The maximum amount of alignment that can occur in a magnet due to a magnetic field. When the majority of dipoles in a material are aligned with an external magnetic field.

* Coercivity: The strength of the magnetic field needed to reduce to magnet from saturation to zero.

* Magnetic flux density: in tesla (T)

* Magnetic field strength: Ampere / meter.

* '''Compass:''' A small bar magnet that aligns itself with an external magnetic field. Talk about earth's magnetic field, how its south pole is our north pole, how it keeps switching and is weak.

* Molecular Magnets:

* hysteresis: when an external magnetic field is applied, the ferromagnet takes up some of the field 

and becomes more aligned. When the field is removed the magnet retains some of the field and is magnetized. 

* hysteresis loop: when an alternating magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material. The material is less magnetized than the magnetic field. 

* electrical hysteresis: occurs in ferroelectric material, where domains of polarisation contribute to the total polarisation. Polarisation is the electrical dipole moment (either C·m-2 or C·m).

* electrical dipole moment:

&lt;!--
We need to get the domains to stop lining up. We can heat it, hit it with a hammer, or put it into a solenoid that has an alternating current and slowly decrease the voltage.
--&gt;

===Low Temperature Magnetism===

==Moving Charge==

[[Image:Magnetic_field_of_a_current_carrying_wire.png]]

When a negatively charged particle such as an electron moves through space or a wire it generates a magnetic field that circles counterclockwise in a plane perpendicular to it. This is part of Ampere's law. For a positively charged particle the magnetic field is clockwise. The faster the charged particle moves the larger the magnetic field. 

===Inductance===
&lt;!--
''Picture of a magnetic field for a ring of wire''

If the wire is bent into the shape of a ring, its magnetic field aligns. So the magnetic field enters in one end and leaves through the other.
--&gt;
[[Image:Electromagnet_with_an_air_core.png]]

Self inductance
This is what happens when you turn on DC in an inductor.

# The voltage increases very rapidly ( in a matter of ms) as you turn on the switch.
# This causes a very rapidly changing current to flow.
# This current has an associated magnetic field which also changes very rapidly.
# The rapidly changing field induces an e.m.f. (Faraday’s Law) that tends to oppose the increase of current (Lenz’s Law). However it cannot stop it increasing completely, just slow it down.
# Once the current reaches it's maximum (determined by the voltage and the ordinary resistance of the wire) it ceases to change, the magnetic field becomes constant and the back EMF goes to zero. 

All remains calm until you try to turn the thing off

# The field collapses very suddenly
# The changing magnetic field induces a back EMF which tries to oppose the collapse of the field (Lenz’s Law again) 

For large coils the EMF can be huge, sparks can fly!

Isn't really an issue for DC though except when turning on and off. But for AC the current is varying all the time, so things never settle into a steady state. The higher the frequency, the faster things are changing and so the greater the inductance. I hope all this is reasonably clear now. Theresa knott 13:49, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC) 
&lt;!--
As more rings are added the wire becomes '''Solenoid''' shaped and looks like a slinky. As the slinky becomes longer the magnetic field outside it fades away and the slinky looks and behaves like a magnetic fire hose. 

The hose works like a hose. It starts in a neutral position with no magnetic field. As the current increases the magnetic field through the hose increases, and as the current decreases the magnetic field through the hose decreases. Magnetic hoses have the neat property that if current starts flowing in the other direction than the hose will act in reverse like a vacuum and the magnetic field will also reverse direction. &lt;-reverse polarity-&gt;
--&gt;
====Electromagnet====
A magnetic hose that acts like a bar magnet. As the current increases the magnet becomes more repulsive to other magnets. Used as a 
switch for magnetic materials and to pick up magnetic material such as cars at scrapyards.

To make a good electromagnet we use a 'soft iron' core. Soft iron has the property of being easy to magnetise. It also loses its magnetism very easily once the electric current is turned off. Steel can also be used as the core of an electromagnet, but steel does not lose its magnetism once the electric current is turned off. It stays magnetised.

&lt;!--
# When the inductor current is turned on it creates a magnetic field that compresses the nearby space. The space resists by applying a counter magnetic field. When the inductor current is turned off the magnetic field disappears and the space resists being expanded and applies a counter magnetic field.
--&gt;

When a current is switched on, or off, it creates a changing magnetic field, which in turn creates voltages that oppose the current. This is the basis for inductance.

By coiling the wire up we can make a solenoid. The magnetic field of a solenoid looks like the field of an ordinary bar magnet.

A solenoíd makes a pretty weak bar magnet on its own but if a piece of iron is put inside the solenoid the field becomes much much stronger. Try the following experiment:

*Wrap a piece of plastic coated wire around a pencil.Remove the pencil then connect to a power supply set at 1V DC current. sprinkle iron filings around thwe coil of wire. Put a plotting compass near the wire. Try to pick up a paper clip. 
*Wrap a piece of plastic coated wire around a large nail. Repeat all of the above experiments

You will find that the solenoid with the iron core is very much stronger than the one with the air core.

'''Q1)''' Why is it important to use plastic coated wire?

===Mutual Inductance===

* induced current: magnetic field creates current.

* eddy current: a current induced by electromagnetic waves.

Mutual inductance is just like inductance except that the magnetic field from the current in one solenoid is creating voltage in a ''different'' solenoid, as well as in itself. 

* transformer: [[Electronics/Transformers|Transformers]] and transformer design: [[Electronics/Transformer Design|Transformer Design]]

===Toroid===

''Picture of a toroid''

A toroid is a solenoid that wraps around on itself.

toroid: A donut shaped inductor where the magnetic fields stay contained within it. Has an air gap.

A Toroid is a doughnut-shaped object enclosed by a torus. It has a ring-shaped surface generated by rotating a circle around an axis that does not intersect the circle. Usually, a toroid is composed of a coil of insulated wire in a donut shape (and is usually composed of iron or similar metals).

Toroids are inductors in circuits. They are primarily used in low frequencies transception for the inductance properties needed. Toroids possess greater inductance properties and carry greater current than similarly constructed solenoids. Toroidal coils reduce resistance, due to diameter and number. In a toroid, magnetic fluxes are confined in the toroid's core. 

a toroid magnifies current.

==Magnetic Fields and Electric Fields==

Notice the similarity between magnetism and electricity. Electricity attracts neutral material (recall a rubbed balloon picking up small bits of paper). Electricity comes in two forms: positive and negative. Like charges repel unlike, charges attract. Physicists long ago realised that these similarities were important. It is now realised that electrcity and magnetism are closely related forces. They are really two different aspects of the same force! We call that force electromagnetism. This next section of the electrcity module is probably the hardest, but it is also the most interesting. Work out the problems in the text as you go along and you ''will'' be able to cope.

A ''changing'' electric field creates a magnetic field. Conversely, a ''changing'' magnetic field creates an electric field.

used to create photon / radio waves

This means that electric currents produce magnetic fields and changing or moving magnetic fields produce electric currents. This module looks at this property of electric and magnetic fields in detail. You will learn about the magnetic fields generated by a wire and a solenoid, then go on to look at motors, generators, and transformers. 

Any charged particle in a magnetic field feels a force perpendicular to both the field and its own velocity.

So far we have looked at the effect of putting a current in a magnetic field and seeing that there is a force on the wire that carries the current. On this page we will look at a related effect known as ''induction''.

Talk about straight magnetic fields and electrons moving in circular path.

Talk about how magnetic fields alter the paths of charged particles.

For a more math oriented explanation of Electric and Magnetic Fields consult [[Electrodynamics]].

==Notes==
* Spot galvanometer: (mirror galvanometer) A very sensitive ammeter that can measure ''tiny'' currents. 

===Experimental results===

{|
|-
| The magnet is moved ''into'' the coil.
| The spot deflects to the left indicating that a small current is flowing.
|-
|-
| The magnet is left inside the coil.
| The spot comes back to the middle showing the that no current is flowing.
|-
| The magnet is pulled out of the coil.
| The spot deflects to the right indicating that there is a current flowing again but this time in the opposite direction.
|-
| The experiment is repeated except this time the magnet is inserted into the coil very slowly.
| There is still a deflection but this time it's much less than before indicating a smaller current is flowing.
|-
| The magnet is turned around.
| The results are the same as above except the deflections are reversed.
|-
| The magnet is kept still but the coil is moved.
| The results are as above.
|}

===Conclusions===
#If there is relative ''movement'' between a coil of wire and a magnet, there will be a current induced in the coil.
#The faster the movement the bigger the current.
#Reversing the magnet, or the direction of movement reverses the direction of the induced current.

==Theoretical explanation of what's going on (Advanced)==
So now we know what happens we have to come up with an explanation. Look at the diagram below.

In this diagram the green line represents a wire that is going into the screen or page. It is at right angles to the magnetic field between the two bar magnets. The wire is moved downwards so that it &quot;cuts&quot; the field lines. This induces an e.m.f. (voltage) along the wire. It is this e.m.f. that causes a current to flow if a complete circuit is made. So now we know why you get a current. It's caused by the induced voltage, but why do you get a voltage?

This is a close up of the wire seen end-on. The blue circles represent where the magnetic field lines stick out of the screen or page. They are coming straight out of the screen. 

The wire is made of a metal and so has many free electrons. As the wire moves downwards each individual electron travels downwards too. They effectively form loads of little current flowing down. From the motor effect we know that if a current flows in a magnetic field there will be a force. In this case the force pushes the electrons to the right. It is the electrons all moving up to the right end of the wire that causes the voltage difference.

So, the motor effect can induce an e.m.f. This is one of two ways magnetic fields can induce an e.m.f

'''Q3)''' Imagine more than one loop of wire cutting through the magnetic field.Each loop of wire has its own e.m.f. induced on it. If the wires are joined up, it's as if they are little cells in series. Fill in the blanks &quot;&lt;font color=aa22aa&quot;&gt; '''As the number of windings on the solenoid ''increases'' the value of the induced voltage ______________.'''&lt;/font&gt;

When a current flows down a wire it creates a magnetic field. To see this place a small plotting compass near the wire and turn the current on.The compass needle will deflect. The shape of the magnetic field around a wire is circular. look at the diagram on the right. The wire is coming straight out of the screen so you only see it's cross section (the red circle) The plotting compasses show how the field wraps around the wire.

===Making the field stronger===
To make the field stronger we can:
*Use a soft iron core
*Increase the amount of current flowing in the wire

*Increase the number of turns on the solenoid.

===Reversing the field===
To make the north pole and south pole swap positions we can
*reverse the direction of the current by swapping the positive and negative leads on the power pack.
*Wind the wire the other way round. {So if you wound it clockwise, take it off and wind it anticlockwise.

Talking of north and south poles, there is a little trick to find out which end will be the north pole and which end will be the south.

Look down the solenoid and work out which way the current is flowing. Remember current flows from the positive to the negative terminals on the power pack. If the current is flowing clockwise the end will be a south pole. If it looks like it's going anticlockwise the end will be a north pole. The easy way to remember this is to put arrows on the end of a capital N and S like this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electrons posses a quantum mechanical property called spin.  It is responsible for magnetism.  It works when charge is moving.  When charge does not flow there is no magnetic field.  Magnetic fields work in a direction perpendicular to the flow of charge.

(should this even be in here?)

Sure, it's the easiest way to understand magnetism.  We don't need to talk about the formulas associated with spin, we just need to give an overview of how it works.

(okay, perhaps we should lump this into an article about magnetism? Things are getting crowded in the main page)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two atoms are walking down the street. The first atom says to the second atom &quot;I think I lost an electron!&quot; The second says &quot;Are you sure?&quot; To which the first states &quot;I'm '''positive'''!&quot;

==Balance of Charge==

Atoms, the smallest particles of matter, are made of protons, electrons, and neutrons. '''Protons''' have a positive charge, '''Electrons''' have a negative charge that cancels the proton's positive charge. '''Neutrons''' are particles that are similar to a proton but have a neutral charge. There are no differences between positive and negative charges except that particles with the same charge '''repel''' each other and particles with opposite charge '''attract''' each other. If a solitary positive proton and negative electron are placed near each other they will come together to form a hydrogen atom. This repulsion and attraction (force between stationary charged particles) is known as '''Electrostatic Force''' and extends theoretically to infinity, but is diluted with distance. 

Both atoms and the universe have a '''neutral''' charge overall and come with the same number of protons and electrons. When an atom has one or more missing electrons it is left with a '''positive''' charge, and when an atom has at least one extra electron it has a '''negative''' charge. Having a positive or a negative charge makes an atom an '''ion'''. Atoms only gain and lose protons and neutrons through fusion, fission, and being radioactive. Although atoms are made of many particles and objects are made of many atoms, they behave similar to charged particles in terms of how they repel and attract.

In an '''atom''' the protons and neutrons combine to form a tightly bound nucleus. This nucleus is surrounded by a vast cloud of electrons circling it at great distance held near the protons by electromagnetic attraction. The cloud exists as a series of overlapping '''shells / bands''' in which the inner '''valence''' bands are filled with electrons and are tightly bound to the atom. The outer '''conduction''' bands contain no electrons except those that have accelerated to the conduction bands by gaining energy. With enough energy an electron will escape an atom. When an electron in the conduction band decelerates and falls to another conduction band or the valence band emitting an photon, is known as the '''photoelectric effect'''.

* '''laser:''' When electrons travel back and forth between conduction bands emitting synchronized photons.

# When the conduction and valence bands overlap, the atom is a '''conductor''' and allows for the free movement of electrons. Conductors are metals and can be thought of as a bunch of atomic nuclei surrounded by a churning &quot;sea of electrons&quot;.
# When there is a large gap between the conduction and valence bands, the atom is an '''insulator''' and trap electrons. Insulators are non-metals and are good at stopping the flow of electrons.
# When there is a small gap between the conduction and valence bands, the atom is a '''semiconductor'''. Semiconductors behave like conductors and insulators, and work using the conduction and valence bands. The electrons in the outer valence band are known as '''holes'''. They behave like positive charges because of how they flow. In semiconductors electrons collide with the material and their progress is halted. This makes the electrons have an '''effective mass''' that is less than their normal mass. In some semiconductors holes have a larger effective mass than the conduction electrons.

Electronic devices are based on the idea of exploiting the differences between conductors, insulators, and semiconductors.

==Conductors==

In a conductor the electrons of an object are free to move. Due to their repulsive nature the valence electrons leave the center of the object and spread out evenly across its surface in order to be as far apart as possible. This '''cavity''' of empty space is known as a '''Faraday Cage''' and stops '''radiation''', such as charge, radio waves, and [[Electronics/Signal Propagation|'''EMP''']]s (Electro-Magnetic Pulses) from entering and leaving the object. If there are holes in the Faraday Cage than radiation can pass.

One of the interesting things to do with conductors is the transfer of charge between metal spheres. At the start the spheres are neutral. The first step involves putting sphere 1 next to but not touching sphere 2. This causes all the electrons in sphere 2 to travel away from sphere 1 to the far end of sphere 2. So sphere 2 now has a negative end filled with electrons and a positive end lacking electrons. Next sphere 2 is '''grounded''' by contact with a conductor connected with the earth and the earth takes its electrons leaving sphere 2 with a positive charge. The positive charge (absence of electrons) spreads evenly across the surface due to its lack of electrons. 

==Insulators==

In an insulator the electrons of an object are stuck. This allows charge to build up on the surface of the object by way of the triboelectric effect. The '''triboelectric effect''' (rubbing electricity effect) involves the exchange of electrons when two different insulators such as glass, hard rubber, amber, or even the seat of one's pants, come into contact. The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the material composition and its surface smoothness. For example, glass rubbed with silk will build up a charge, as will hard rubber rubbed with fur. The effect is greatly enhanced by rubbing materials together. 

* '''Van de Graaff Generator:''' A '''charge pump''' (pump for electrons) that generates static electricity. In a Van de Graaff generator, a conveyor belt uses  rubbing to pick up electrons, which are then deposited on metal brushes. The end result is a charge difference.

Because the material being rubbed is now charged, contact with an uncharged object or an object with the opposite charge may cause a discharge of the built-up '''static electricity''' by way of a spark. A person simply walking across a carpet may build up enough charge to cause a spark to travel over a centimeter. The spark is powerful enough to attract dust particles to cloth, destroy electrical equipment, ignite gas fumes, and create lightning. In extreme cases the spark can destroy factories that deal with gunpowder and explosives. The best way to remove static electricity is by discharging it through grounding. Humid air will also slowly discharge static electricity. This is one reason why [[Electronics/Cells|cells]] and [[Electronics/Capacitors|capacitors]] lose charge over time. 

[[File:Multiple Lightning Strikes.jpg]]

==Quantity of Charge==


Protons and electrons have opposite but equal charge.  Because in almost all cases, the charge on protons or electrons is the smallest amount of charge commonly discussed, the quantity of charge of one proton is considered one positive '''elementary charge''' and the charge of one electron is one negative '''elementary charge'''.  Because atoms and such particles are so small, and charge in amounts of multi-trillions of elementary charges are usually discussed, a much larger unit of charge is typically used.  The '''Coulomb''' is a unit of charge, which can be expressed as a positive or negative number, which is equal to approximately 6.2415×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; elementary charges.  Accordingly, an elementary charge is equal to approximately 1.602 ×10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; coulombs.  The commonly used abbreviation for the Coulomb is a capital '''C'''.  The [[w:SI|SI]] definition of a Coulomb is the quantity of charge which passes a point over a period of 
1 second ( s ) when a current of 1 [[Electronics/Voltage, Current, and Power|Ampere]] ( A ) flows past that point, i. e., C = A s  or  A = C/s.  An [[Wikipedia:ampere|ampere]] is one of the fundamental units in physics from which various other units are defined, such as the coulomb.

==Properties of Waves==
* A wave is an oscillation, if represented in the plane using a Cartesian coordinate system looks like a sine wave, being the x axis time and the y axis amplitude. Amplitude is the variation of the wave across a given period being the peak the highest point of a wave. The difference between two peaks is a wavelength. Period is the time it takes a wavelength to pass by a point in space. Frequency is the number of waves that pass by in a second.  

* Black bodies - A cavity that absorbs all radiation and emits radiation at a specific frequency.  

* Resonant cavities - A cavity that allows standing waves of a specific frequency.

==Sound==
Sound is heard when there are two that things collide with each other . Sound wave is a longitude wave . Sound waves are affected by temperature and atmosphere's pressure

In water sound waves travel faster due to particles being more compressed. In Air, Sound wave pressure creates rare-fraction and rare-compression columns of air

Infrasound appears to heighten emotions and make people nervous and thus has an association with the supernatural such as haunted houses.  Since people are emotionally attached to the deceased and go to where they died, when you combine it with infrasound which is associated with chills, is this an explanation for ghosts?  

One of the stranger uses of infrasound involves combining an ancient chamber that resonates infrasound with mind altering drugs to induce visions and out of body experiences.

===Candela===
Unit of intensity

===Radio Waves &lt; 3 GHz===
====(ELF) Extremely low frequency: &lt; 300 Hz====
: ELF is used by the US Navy to communicate with submerged submarines. The extremely high electrical conductivity of seawater shields submarines from most electromagnetic communications. Signals in the ELF frequency range, however, can penetrate much more deeply. The low transmission rate of most ELF communications limits their use as communications channels; generally an ELF signal serves to request that a submarine surface and initiate some other form of contact.

: One of the difficulties posed when broadcasting in the ELF frequency range is antenna size. In order to transmit internationally using ELF frequencies, an extremely large antenna is required. The US maintains two sites, in Wisconsin and Michigan. Both sites use long power lines as antennae, in multiple strands ranging from 14 to 28 miles long. Considerable amounts of power are generated and emitted by ELF, and there have been some concerns over the possible ecological impact of such signals. 

: See also: TACAMO, HAARP, List of initialisms, 

: Starting at 7.8 Hz there is the Schumann resonance, which is due to the space between the surface of the Earth and the ionosphere.  It acts as a resonant cavity fueled by energy from lightning strikes.  Serial Experiments Lain had the idea that the Schumann resonance could be a carrier for a collective consciousness.

====(VF) Voice frequency: 300-3000 Hz====
:Voice band. Used to transmit speech. Allocated for telephone. Voice frequency varies from 300-3400 Hz. 4 kHz allocated for for a single voice-frequency including guard bands.

====(VLF) Very Low Frequency: 3-30 kHz====

: Very Low Frequency or VLF refers to Radio Frequencies (RF) in the range of 3 - 30 kHz. Since there is not much space in this band of the spectrum, only the very simplest signals are used, such as for radionavigation. Many natural radio emissions, such as whistlers, can be heard in this band.

: Because VLF can penetrate water to a depth of 20 meters, they are used to communicate with submarines. 

: Lightning generates low frequency radio waves called whistlers.  Whistlers have been recieved from Jupiter showing the presence of lightning there.

: The dawn chorus is an unexplained electromagnetic phenomenon that occurs most often at sunrise or shortly after, that (with the proper radio equipment) resembles the sound of a massive flock of birds. It is thought to be caused by high-energy electrons that get caught in the Van Allen radiation belts of the Earth's magnetosphere and fall to the Earth's surface in the form of audible radio waves. Dawn choruses occur more frequently during magnetic storms.

: This phenomenon also occurs during aurorae, when it is termed an auroral chorus.

====(LF) Low Frequency: 30-300 kHz====

: Low Frequency or LF (sometimes called longwave) refers to Radio Frequencies (RF) in the range of 30-300 kHz. In Europe, part of the LF spectrum is used for AM broadcast service. In the western hemisphere, its main use is for aircraft beacon, navigation, information, and weather systems.

: pass through ionosphere
: can penetrate oceans to 200 meters

: Long wave is 144 - 351 kHz in Europe, Africa, and Asia. In the Americas, this band is reserved for aeronautical navigation.

: Longwave radio frequencies are those below 500 kHz, which correspond to wavelengths longer than 600 meters. They have the property of following the curvature of the earth, making them ideal for continuous, continental communications. Unlike shortwave radio, longwave signals do not reflect nor refract using the ionosphere, so there are fewer phase-caused fadeouts.

: In Europe, North Africa and Asia, longwave radio frequencies between 153 and 281 kHz are used for domestic and international broadcasting. In the Americas, frequencies between 200 and 430 kHz are used for non-directional radio beacons.

: The frequency of 60 kHz is used by several nations, such as the United States, Germany, England, and Japan, for extremely accurate time and precision frequency signals. Many commercial appliances sold since approximately 2000 have a VLF receiver capable of receiving these signals, which penetrate indoors more effectively than mediumwave or shortwave signals.

: Radio signals below 50 kHz are capable of penetrating ocean depths to approximately 200 meters. The United States, Russian, British, Swedish, and Indian navies communicate with submarines on these frequencies.

: Longwave transmitting antennas take up large amounts of space, and have been the cause of controversy in the United States and Europe due to fears over proximity to high-power radio waves.

====(MF) Medium Frequency: 300-3000 kHz====

: (AM) Amplitude Modulation radio if from 530 - 1,700 kHz.  Also known as medium wave.  Was big from 1900's-1960's

: AM radio technology is simpler than other types of radio, such as FM radio and DAB. An AM receiver detects the power of the radio wave, and amplifies changes in the power measurement to drive a speaker or earphones. The earliest crystal radio receivers used this principle.

: AM radio was used for small scale voice and music broadcasts before World War I. The great increase in the use of AM radio came the following decade. The first commercial radio services began on AM in the 1920s. Radio programming boomed during the &quot;Golden Age of Radio.&quot; Dramas, comedy and all other forms of entertainment were produced, as well as broadcasts of news and music.

: Medium wave is by far the most used for commercial radio broadcasting; this is the &quot;AM radio&quot; that most people are familiar with.

: For the long and medium wave bands, the wavelength is long enough that the wave diffracts around the curve of the Earth by ground wave propagation, giving AM radio, in particular long wave and medium wave at night, a long range.

: Short wave is used by radio services intended to be heard great distances away from the transmitting station; the far range of short wave broadcasts comes at the expense of lower audio fidelity. The mode of propagation for short wave is different, see High frequency. AM is used mostly for broadcast uses - other shortwave users may use a modified version of AM such as SSB or an AM-compatible version of SSB such as SSB with carrier reinserted.

: Frequencies between the broadcast bands are used for other forms of radio communication, such as baby monitors, walkie talkies, cordless telephones, radio control, amateur radio etc.

====(HF) High Frequency: 3-30 MHz====
: High frequency (HF) radio frequencies are between 3 and 30 MHz. This range is often called shortwave.

: Short wave is 1,700 - 30,000 kHz, divided into 14/15 &quot;broadcast bands&quot;. 

: Since the ionosphere often reflects HF radio waves quite well, this range is extensively used for medium and long range terrestrial radio communication. However, suitability of this portion of the spectrum for such communication varies greatly with a complex combination of factors:

    * Sunlight/darkness at site of transmission and reception
    * Transmitter/receiver proximity to terminator
    * Season
    * Sunspot cycle
    * Solar activity
    * Polar aurora
    * Maximum usable frequency
    * Lowest usable frequency
    * Frequency of operation within the HF range 

: HF is often used for continuous wave morse code transmissions.

: See also: VHF, AM radio, Radio propagation 

: Shortwave radio operates between the frequencies of 3000 kHz and 30 MHz (30,000 kHz) and came to be referred to as such in the early days of radio because the wavelengths associated with this frequency range were shorter than those commonly in use at that time. An alternate name is HF, or high frequency.

: Short wavelengths are associated with high frequencies because there is an inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength.

: Shortwave frequencies are capable of reaching the other side of the planet by bouncing a signal off the ionosphere. The selection of a frequency to use to reach a target area depends on several factors:

    * The distance from the transmitter to the target receiver
    * Time of day. During the day, higher shortwave frequencies (&gt; 10 MHz) can travel longer distances than lower; at night, this : property is reversed.
    * Season of the year.
    * Solar conditions, including the number of sunspots, solar flares, and overall solar activity. Solar flares can prevent the : ionosphere from reflecting or refracting radio waves. 

: Some major users of the shortwave radio band include:

    * Domestic broadcasting in countries with a widely-dispersed population with few longwave, mediumwave or FM stations serving them
    * International broadcasting to foreign audiences
    * Utility stations transmitting messages not intended for a general public, such as aircraft flying between continents, encoded or ciphered diplomatic messages, weather reporting, or ships at sea
    * Amateur radio operators
    * Time signal stations 

: The Asia-Pacific Telecommunity estimates that there are approximately 600,000,000 shortwave radio receivers in use in 2002.

: The World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organized under the auspices of the International Telecommunications Union, allocates bands for various services in conferences every few years. The next WRC is scheduled to take place in 2007. At the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) in 1997, the following bands were allocated to international broadcasters:

    5,900-5,950 kHz 
    7,300-7,350 kHz (7,100-7,350 kHz outside of the Americas) 
    9,400-9,500 kHz 
    11,600-11,650 kHz 
    12,050-12,100 kHz 
    13,570-13,600 kHz 
    13,800-13,870 kHz 
    15,600-15,800 kHz 
    17,480-17,550 kHz 
    18,900-19,020 kHz 

: Shortwave broadcasting channels are allocated with a 5 kHz separation. International broadcasters, however, may operate outside the normal WARC-allocated bands or use off-channel frequencies to attract attention in crowded bands.

: The power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental transmissions to 500 kilowatts and highter for intercontinental broadcasters. Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized antenna designs to concentrate radio energy on a bearing aimed at the target area.

International broadcasting

See International broadcasting for details on the history and practice of broadcasting to foreign audiences.

Amateur radio

The privilege of operating shortwave radio transmitters for non-commercial purposes is open to licensed amateurs. In the USA, they are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). U.S. citizens do not need licenses to own or operate shortwave receivers. Recently the FCC has added an amateur radio license which requires no knowledge of Morse code, making it easier for beginners to get involved; however, a working knowledge of Morse code is required to operate on shortwave bands.

Amateur radio operators have made numerous technical advancements in the field of radio and make themselves available to transmit emergency communications when normal communications channels fail. Some amateurs practice operating off the power grid so as to be prepared for power loss.

Shortwave listening

Many hobbyists listen to shortwave broadcasters without operating transmitters. In many cases, the goal is to obtain as many stations from as many countries as possible (DXing); others listen to specialized shortwave utility, or &quot;ute&quot;, transmissions such as maritime, naval, aviation, or military signals. Others focus on intelligence signals.

Shortwave listeners, or SWLs, can obtain &quot;QSL&quot; cards from broadcasters or utility stations as trophies of the hobby.

Numbers Stations

Numbers stations are shortwave radio stations of uncertain origin that broadcast streams of numbers, words, or phonetic sounds. Although officially there is no indication of their origin, radio hobbyists have determined that many of them are used by intelligence services as one-way communication to agents in other countries.

Shortwave radio: the future

The development of direct broadcasts from satellites has reduced the demand for shortwave receivers, but there are still a great number of shortwave broadcasters. A new digital radio technology, Digital Radio Mondiale, is expected to improve the quality of shortwave audio from very poor to standards comparable to the FM broadcast band. The future of shortwave radio is threatened by the uprise of power line communication (PLC), where a data stream is transmitted over unshielded power lines. As the frequencies used overlap with the shortwave bands severe distortions make listening to shortwave radio near power lines difficult or impossible.

Shortwave Broadcasts and Music

Some musicians have been attracted to the unique aural qualities of shortwave radio. John Cage employed shortwave radios as live instruments in a number of pieces, and other musicians have sampled broadcasts, used tape loops of broadcasts, or drawn inspiration from the unusual sounds on some frequencies. Karlheinz Stockhausen used shortwave radio in works including Telemusik (1966), Hymnen (1966-67) and Spiral (1968), and Holger Czukay, Pat Metheny, Aphex Twin, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Wilco have also used broadcasts.

====(VHF) Very High Frequency: 30-300 MHz/10-1 m====

: Common uses for VHF are FM radio broadcast at 88-108 MHz and television broadcast (together with UHF). VHF is also commonly used for terrestrial navigation systems (VOR in particular) and aircraft communications.

: UHF and VHF are the most common frequency bands for television.

: VHF frequencies' propagation characteristics are ideal for short-distance terrestrial communication. Unlike HF frequencies, the ionosphere does not usually reflect VHF radio and thus transmissions are restricted to the local area (and can't interfere with transmissions thousands of kilometres away) It is also less affected by atmospheric noise and interference from electrical equipment than low frequencies. Whilst it is more easily blocked by land features than HF and lower frequencies, it is less bothered by buildings and other less substantial objects than higher frequencies. It was also easier to construct efficient transmitters, receivers, and antennas for it in the earlier days of radio. In most countries, the VHF spectrum is used for broadcast audio and television, as well as commercial two-way radios (such as that operated by taxis and police), marine two-way audio communications, and aircraft radios.

: The large slice of technically and commercially valuable slice of the VHF spectrum taken up by television transmission has attracted the attention of many companies and governments recently, with the development of more efficient digital television broadcasting standards. In some countries much of this spectrum will likely become available (probably for sale) in the next decade or so (currently scheduled for 2008 in the United States).

: In the United Kingdom, the authorities chose to develop colour television exclusively on UHF, beginning in the late 1960s. The last British VHF TV transmitters closed down in 1986. VHF band III is now used in the UK for digital audio broadcasting. 

FM been around since 1940

88-106 MHz Post WWII allocation of FM 1945

FM stereo technology

: New technology was added to FM radio in the early 1960s to allow FM stereo transmissions, where the frequency modulated radio signal is used to carry stereophonic sound, using the pilot-tone multiplex system.

: This multiplexes the left and right audio signal channels in a manner that is compatible with mono sound, using a sum-and-difference technique to produce a single &quot;mono-compatible&quot; signal, which has a baseband part that is equal to the sum of the left and right channels (L+R), and a higher-frequency part that is the difference of the left and right channels (L-R) amplitude modulated on a 38 kHz subcarrier. A 19 kHz pilot tone is then added, to allow allow receivers to detect the presence of a stereo-encoded signal.

: This signal can then be passed through the FM modulation and demodulation process as if it was a monophonic signal, and the stereo signals extracted from the demodulated FM signal by reversing the multiplexing process.

: Simple mono FM receivers will not extract the left and right signals, but simply reproduce the baseband part of the &quot;mono-compatible&quot; signal. (This relies on the fact that the subcarrier-modulated part of the mono-compatible signal is in a part of the audio spectrum that is inaudible to people, and the pilot tone is a low-intensity tone in a part of the audio spectrum that is inaudible to most people).

: This backwards compatibility was important, as when the FM stereo system was introduced in the U.S. in the 1960s, mono FM transmissions had been in service since the 1940s, and there was a large installed base of mono receivers that needed to be able to receive stereo broadcasts without any modification.

: Stereo receivers could automatically switch between &quot;mono&quot; and &quot;stereo&quot; modes based on the presence of the pilot tone. They were also equipped with a notch filter to remove the pilot tone. In poor signal conditions, stereo receivers could also fall back to mono mode, even on a stereo signal, allowing improved signal-to-noise performance in these conditions.

: The stereo multiplexing system has been further extended to add an extra, even higher frequency, 57 kHz subcarrier, which is used to carry low-bandwidth digital Radio Data System information, allowing digitally controlled radios to provide extra features.

: FM radio channel assignments in the US

: In the United States, frequency-modulated broadcasting stations operate in a frequency band extending from 87.8 MHz to 108.0 MHz, for a total of 20.2 MHz. It is divided into 100 channels, each 0.2 MHz wide, designated &quot;channel 200&quot; through &quot;channel 300.&quot;

: To receive a station, an FM receiver is tuned to the center frequency of the station's channel. The lowest channel, channel 200, extends from 87.8 MHz to 88.0 MHz; thus its center frequency is 87.9 MHz. Channel 201 has a center frequency of 88.1 MHz, and so on, up to channel 300, which extends from 107.8 to 108.0 MHz and has a center frequency of 107.9 MHz.

: Because each channel is 0.2 MHz wide, the center frequencies of adjacent channels differ by 0.2 MHz. Because the lowest channel is centered on 87.9 MHz the tenths digit of the center frequency of any FM station in the United States is always an odd number. FM audio for television channel 6 is broadcast at a carrier frequency of 87.75 MHz, and many radios can tune down this low; a few low-power television stations licensed for channel 6 are operated solely for their right to use this frequency and broadcast only nominal video programming. For the same reason, assignment restrictions between TV stations on channel 6 and nearby FM stations are stringent: there are only two stations in the United States (KSFH and translator K200AA) licensed to operate on 87.9 MHz.

: FM stations in a market are generally spaced four channels (800 kHz) apart. This spacing was developed in response to problems perceived on the original FM band, mostly due to deficiencies in receiver technology of the time. With modern equipment, this is widely understood to be unnecessary, and in many countries shorter spacings are used. Other spacing restrictions relate to mixing products with nearby television, air-traffic control, and two-way radio systems as well as other FM broadcast stations. The most significant such taboo restricts the allocation of stations 10.6 and 10.8 MHz apart, to protect against mixing products which will interfere with an FM receiver's standard 10.7 MHz intermediate frequency stage.

: Commercial broadcasting is licensed only on channels 221 through 300, with 200 through 220 being reserved for noncommercial educational broadcasting. In some markets close to the Canadian or Mexican border, such as Detroit, Michigan and San Diego, California, commercial stations operating from those countries target U.S. audiences on &quot;reserved band&quot; channels, as neither Canada nor Mexico has such a reservation.

====(UHF) Ultra High Frequency: 300-3000 MHz/100-10 cm====

UHF and VHF are the most common frequency bands for television.

UHF frequencies have higher attenuation from atmospheric moisture and benefit less from 'bounce', or the reflection of signals off the ionosphere back to earth, when compared to VHF frequencies. The frequencies of 300-3000 MHz are always at least an order of magnitude above the MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency). The MUF for most of the earth is generally between 25-35 MHz. Higher frequencies also benefit less from ground mode transmission. However, the short wavelengths of UHF frequencies allow compact receiving antennas with narrow elements; many people consider them less ugly than VHF-receiving models

In the United States, UHF stations (broadcast channels above 13) originally gained a reputation for being more locally owned, less polished, less professional, less popular, and for having a weaker signal than their VHF counterparts (channels 2-13). The movie UHF, starring Weird Al Yankovic, parodies this phenomenon. Recently, with the emergence of eight major broadcast television networks, that notion has changed as bigger and bigger media companies seek a bigger slice of the television pie. Many Fox, UPN, WB, and Pax network affiliates broadcast in the UHF band.

As cable television, digital television, and DSS have penetrated the television market, the distinction between VHF and UHF stations has dissipated.

In Australia, UHF was first anticipated in the mid 1970's with channels 28 to 69. The first UHF TV broadcasts in Australia were operated by Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) on channel 28 in Sydney and Melbourne starting in 1980, and translator stations for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The UHF band is now used extensively as ABC, SBS, commercial and community (public access) television services have expanded particularly through regional areas. 

Ultra High Frequency
A band reserved for television.

===Microwave 3-300 GHz/100-1 mm===
====(SHF) Super High Frequency: 3-30 GHz/10-1 cm====

[[Electronics/Microwave|Microwave]]

Note: above 300 GHz, the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by Earth's atmosphere is so great that the atmosphere is effectively opaque to higher frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, until the atmosphere becomes transparent again in the so-called infrared and optical window frequency ranges.

Uses

A microwave oven uses a magnetron microwave generator to produce microwaves at a frequency of approximately 2.4 GHz for the purpose of cooking food. Microwaves cook food by causing molecules of water and other compounds to vibrate. The vibration creates heat which warms the food. Since organic matter is made up primarily of water, food is easily cooked by this method.

A maser is a device similar to a laser, except that it works at microwave frequencies. Microwaves are also used in satellite transmissions because this frequency passes easily through the Earth's atmosphere with less interference than higher wavelengths.

Radar also uses microwave radiation to detect the range, speed, and other characteristics of remote objects.

Wireless LAN communication protocols such as IEEE 802.11 and bluetooth also use microwaves in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, although some variants use a 5 GHz band for communication.

Cable TV and Internet access on coax cable as well as broadcast television use some of the lower microwave frequencies.

Microwaves can be used to transmit power over long distances, create a solar array to beam power to earth.

The microwave spectrum is defined as electromagnetic energy ranging from approximately 300 MHz to 1000 GHz in frequency. Most common applications are within the 1 to 40 GHz range.

Microwave Frequency Bands are defined in the table below:

L Band	1 to 2 GHz
S Band	2 to 4 GHz
C Band	4 to 8 GHz
X Band	8 to 12 GHz
Ku Band	12 to 18 GHz
K Band	18 to 26 GHz
Ka Band	26 to 40 GHz
Q Band	30 to 50 GHz
U Band	40 to 60 GHz
V Band	46 to 56 GHz
W Band	56 to 100 GHz

The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation that fills the whole of the universe. It has the characteristics of black body radiation at a temperature of 2.726 kelvins. It has a frequency in the microwave range.

CMR and the Big Bang

This radiation is regarded as the best available evidence of the Big Bang (BB) theory and its discovery in the mid-1960s marked the end of general interest for alternatives such as the steady state theory. The CMR gives a snapshot of the Universe when, according to standard cosmology, the temperature dropped enough to allow electrons and protons to form hydrogen atoms, thus making the universe transparent to radiation. When it originated some 300,000 years after the Big Bang -- this point in time is generally known as the &quot;last scattering surface&quot; -- the temperature of the Universe was about 6000 K. Since then it has dropped because of the expansion of the Universe, which cools radiation inversely proportional to the fourth power of the Universe's scale length.

Features

One of the microwave background's most salient features is a high degree of isotropy. There are some anisotropies, the most pronounced of which is the dipole anisotropy at a level of about 10-4 at a scale of 180 degrees of arc. It is due to the motion of the observer against the CBR, which is some 700 km/s for the Earth.

Variations due to external physics also exist; the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect is one of the major factors here, in which an cloud of high energy electrons scatters the radiation transferring some energy to the CMB photons.

Even more interesting are anisotropies at a level of roughly 1/100000 and on a scale of a few arc minutes. Those very small variations correspond to the density fluctuations at the last scattering surface and give valuable information about the seeds for the large scale structures we observe now. These density fluctations arise because different parts of the universe are not in contact with each other.

In addition, the Sachs-Wolfe effect causes photons from the Cosmic microwave background to be gravitationally redshifted. These small-scale variations give observational constraints on the properties of universe, and are therefore one important test for cosmological models.

Detection, Prediction and Discovery

The CBR was predicted by George Gamow, Ralph Alpher, and Robert Hermann in the 1940s and was accidentally discovered in 1964 by Penzias and Wilson, who received a Nobel Prize for this discovery. The CBR had, however, been detected and its temperature deduced in 1941, seven years before Gamow's prediction. Based on the study of narrow absorption line features in the spectra of stars, the astronomer Andrew McKellar wrote: &quot;It can be calculated that the 'rotational' temperature of interstellar space is 2 K.&quot;

Because water absorbs microwave radiation, a fact that is used to build microwave ovens, it is rather difficult to observe the CMB with ground-based instruments. CMB research therefore makes increasing use of air and space-borne experiments.

Experiments

Of these experiments, the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite that was flown in 1989-1996 is probably the most famous and which made the first detection of the large scale anisotropies (other than the dipole). In June 2001, NASA launched a second CBR space mission, WMAP, to make detailed measurements of the anisotropies over the full sky. Results from this mission provide a detailed measurement of the angular power spectrum down to degree scales, giving detailed constraints on various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from cosmic inflation as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data center for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [ed. see links below],

A third space mission, Planck, is to be launched in 2007. Unlike the previous two space missions, Planck is a collaboration between NASA and ESA (the European Space Agency).

CBR and Non-Standard Cosmologies

During the mid-1990's, the lack of detection of anisotropies in the CBR led to some interest in nonstandard cosmologies (such as plasma cosmology) mostly as a backup in case detectors failed to find anisotropy in the CBR. The discovery of these anisotropies combined with a large amount of new data coming in has greatly reduced interest in these alternative theories.

Some supporters of non-standard cosmology argue that the primodorial background radiation is uniform (which is inconsistent with the big bang) and that the variations in the CBR are due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect mentioned above (among other effects).

====(EHF) Extremely High Frequency: 30-300 GHz/10-1 mm====

===(IR) Infared 1 mm-700 nm===
Note: above 100 GHz, the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by Earth's atmosphere is so great that the atmosphere is effectively opaque to higher frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, until the atmosphere becomes transparent again in the so-called infrared and optical window frequency ranges.

Infra-red means below red, where red is the color with the longest wavelength.  

(FIR) far-IR (30-1000 µm)

(MIR/IIR) mid-IR (5-30 µm) - Infrared radiation is often linked to heat, since objects at room temperature or above will emit radiation mostly concentrated in the mid-infrared band (see black body).

(NIR) near-IR (0.7-5 µm)

However, these terms are not precise, and are used differently in various studies. 

Uses
Infrared is used in night-vision equipment, when there is insufficient visible light to see an object. The radiation is detected and turned into an image on a screen, hotter objects showing up brighter, enabling the police and military to chase targets.  &quot;Night vision&quot;

Smoke is more transparent to infrared than to visible light, so fire fighters use infrared imaging equipment when working in smoke-filled areas. Fire fighters also use this equipment in wood-frame buildings after a fire has been extinguished to look for hot spots behind the walls, where a fire can break out again.

A more common use of IR is in television remote controls. In this case it is used in preference to radio waves because it does not interfere with the television signal. IR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants. These devices usually conform to standards published by IrDA, the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation which is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam. The beam is modulated, i.e. switched on and off, to encode the data. The receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from sunlight, people and other warm objects.

The light used in fiber optic communication is typically infrared.

''not really''.  EM waves are constantly being emitted by objects, black-body radiation, but the frequency depends on temperature.  for room temperature objects and humans, it is mostly below light in the infrared, but for things like fires and red hot iron, it is in the light spectrum more, and for colder and hotter objects it is at different frequencies.''

how about this, anything that has at least as much energy as infared will warm things up.  Anything that has less will not warm atoms up.

Global Warming
Carbon Dioxide absorbs certain wavlengths of infared light.  This is thought to cause global warming.

===Visible===
1 PetaHz 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Hz

Visible light exists on the tip end of infared and just below it is UV.  Basically you can almost get a sunburn from visible light.

The optical spectrum (visible light or visible spectrum) is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. The optical spectrum is a composite, or mixture, of the various colors.

There are no exact bounds to the optical spectrum ; a light-adapted eye typically has a maximum sensitivity of ~555 nm (in the green). Commonly the response of the eye is considered to cover 380 nm to 780 nm although a range of 400 nm to 700 nm range is more common. The eye may, however, have some visual response at even wider wavelength ranges.

Wavelengths in the range visible to the eye occupy most of the &quot;optical window&quot;, a range of wavelengths that are easily transmitted through the Earth's atmosphere.

Note: Ultraviolet and Infrared are often considered to be &quot;light&quot; but are generally not visible to the human eye.

Visible Light

Visible light is electromagnetic radiation that is made of colors of light that the eye can see. This light has wavelengths that are generally expressed in nanometers.

See Rydberg formula. 

Vision
Rods and cones

People see red, yellow, green, blue and purple

People don't notice the difference because red and purple both have a low intensity.

purple is cut off because the atmosphere absorbs it.

===(UV) UltraViolet===
Ultra-Violet means beyond violet, where violet is the color with the shortest wavelength.  

It is colloquially called black light, as it is invisible to the human eye.

The sun emits ultraviolet light in the UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C bands

Ordinary glass is transparent to UV-A but is opaque to shorter wavelengths. This is why people don't get sunburns in cars.  During the first nuclear blast, Feynman was the only person who saw it because he looked through a window.
 
Quartz glass, depending on quality, can be transparent even to vacuum UV wavelengths.

Health effects

In general, UV-A is the least harmful, but can contribute to the aging of skin, DNA damage and possibly skin cancer. It penetrates deeply and does not cause sun burn. Because it does not cause reddenning of the skin (erythema) it can not be measured in the SPF testing. There is no good clinical measurement of the blocking of UVA radiation, but it is important that your sunscreen block both UVA and UVB.

High intensities of UV-B light are hazardous to the eyes, and exposure can cause welder's flash (photokeratitis or arc eye).

UVA, UV-B and UV-C all can damage collagen fibers and thereby accelerate aging of the skin.

Tungsten-Halogen lamps have bulbs made of quartz, not of ordinary glass. Tungsten-Halogen lamps that are not filtered by an additional layer of ordinary glass are a common, useful, and possibly dangerous, source of UV-B light.

UV-A light is known as &quot;dark-light&quot; and, because of its longer wavelength, can penetrate most windows. It also penetrates deeper into the skin than UV-B light and is thought to be a prime cause of wrinkles.

UV-B light in particular has been linked to skin cancers such as melanoma. The radiation ionizes DNA molecules in skin cells, causing covalent bonds to form between adjacent thymine bases, producing thymidine dimers. Thymidine dimers do not base pair normally, which can cause distortion of the DNA helix, stalled replication, gaps, and misincorporation. These can lead to mutations, which can result in cancerous growths. The mutagenicity of UV radiation can be easily observed in bacteria cultures.

This cancer connection is the reason for concern about ozone depletion and the ozone hole.

UV-C rays are the strongest, most dangerous type of ultraviolet light. Little attention has been given to UV-C rays in the past since they are normally filtered out by the ozone layer and do not reach the Earth. Thinning of the ozone layer and holes in the ozone layer are causing increased concern about the potential for UVC light exposure, however.

As a defense against UV light, the body tans when exposed to moderate (depending on skin type) levels of radiation by releasing the brown pigment melanin. This helps to block UV penetration and prevent damage to the vulnerable skin tissues deeper down. Suntan lotion that partly blocks UV is widely available (often referred to as &quot;sun block&quot; or &quot;sunscreen&quot;). Most of these products contain an &quot;SPF rating&quot; that describes the amount of protection given. This protection applies only to UV-B light. In any case, most dermatologists recommend against prolonged sunbathing.

A positive effect of UV light is that it induces the production of vitamin D in the skin. Grant (2002) claims tens of thousands of premature deaths occur in the U.S. annually from cancer due to insufficient UV-B exposures (apparently via vitamin D deficiency).

Astronomy

In astronomy, very hot objects preferentially emit UV light (see Wien's law). However, the same ozone layer that protects us causes difficulties for astronomers observing from the earth, so most UV observations are made from space. (See UV astronomy, space observatory).

Uses
UV light has many various uses:

Fluorescent lamps
Fluorescent lamps produce UV light by the emission of low-pressure mercury gas. A phosphorescent coating on the inside of the tubes absorbs the UV and turns it into visible light.

The main mercury emission wavelength is in the UV-C range. Unshielded exposure of the skin or eyes to mercury arc lamps that do not have a conversion phosphor is quite dangerous.

The light from a mercury lamp is predominantly at discrete wavelengths. Other practical UV light sources with more continuous emission spectra include xenon arc lamps (commonly used as sunlight simulators), deuterium arc lamps, mercury-xenon arc lamps, metal-halide arc lamps, and tungsten-halogen incandescent lamps.

Disinfecting drinking water
Ultraviolet light is increasingly being used to disinfect drinking water and in waste water treatment plants. Dr. James R. Bolton discovered that ultraviolet light could treat Cryptosporidium, previously unknown. The findings resulted in two US patents and the use of UV light as a viable method to treat drinking water.

Analyzing minerals
Ultraviolet lamps are also used in analyzing minerals, gems, and in other detective work including authentication of various collectibles. Materials may look the same under visible light, but fluoresce to different degrees under ultraviolet light; or may fluoresce differently under short wave ultraviolet versus long wave ultra violet. UV fluorescent dyes are used in many applications (for example, biochemistry and forensics). The fluorescent protein Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is often used in genetics as a marker. Many substances, proteins for instance, have significant light absorption bands in the ultraviolet that are of use and interest in biochemistry and related fields. UV-capable spectrophotometers are common in such laboratories.

Sterilization
Ultraviolet lamps are used to sterilize workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities. Since microorganisms can be shielded from ultraviolet light in small cracks and other shaded areas, however, these lamps are used only as a supplement to other sterilization techniques.

Resolution
Ultraviolet light is used for very fine resolution photolithography, as required for manufacture of semiconductors.

Spectroscopy
UV light is often used in UV-visible spectroscopy

Photolithography
UV light is used extensively in the electronics industry in a procedure known as photolithography, where a chemical known as a photoresist is exposed to UV light which has passed through a mask. The light allows chemical reactions to take place in the photoresist, and after development (a step that either removes the exposed or unexposed photoresist), a geometric pattern which is determined by the mask remains on the sample. Further steps may then be taken to &quot;etch&quot; away parts of the sample with no photoresist remaining.

It is photolithography which is primarily used to create integrated circuit components and printed circuit boards.

Other
The onset of vacuum UV, 200 nm, is defined by the fact that ordinary air is opaque below this wavelength. This opacity is due to the strong absorption of light of these wavelengths by oxygen in the air. Pure nitrogen (less than about 10 ppm oxygen) is transparent to wavelengths in the range of about 150-200 nm. This has wide practical significance now that semiconductor manufacturing processes are using wavelengths shorter than 200 nm. By working in oxygen-free gas, the equipment does not have to be built to withstand the pressure differences required to work in a vacuum. Some other scientific instruments, such as Circular Dichroism spectrometers, are also commonly nitrogen purged and operate in this spectral region.

It is advisable to use protective eyewear when working with ultraviolet light, especially short wave ultraviolet. Ordinary eyeglasses give some protection. Most plastic lenses give more protection than glass lenses. Some plastic lens materials, such as polycarbonate, block most UV. There are protective treatments available for eyeglass lenses that need it to give better protection. The most important reason that ordinary eyeglasses only give limited protection, however, is that light can reach the eye without going through the lens. Full coverage is important if the risk from exposure is high. Full coverage eye protection is usually recommended for high altitude mountaineering, for instance. Mountaineers are exposed to higher than ordinary levels of UV light, both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice.

Some insects, such as bees, can see into the near ultraviolet, and flowers often have markings visible to such pollinators.

===X-Ray: 30 PetaHz - 60 ExaHz/10 nanometer - 5 picometer===
(German:  Röntgenstrahlen)

Soft X-ray: (10-0.1 nm)

Hard X-ray: (100-5 pm)Low energy gamma rays

X-rays are generated by electron collisons.

X-rays are primarily used for diagnostic medical imaging and crystallography.


Physicist Johann Hittorf observed tubes with energy rays extending from a negative electrode. These rays produced a fluorescence when they hit the glass walls of the tubes. In 1876 the effect was named &quot;cathode rays&quot; by Eugene Goldstein. Later, English physicist William Crookes investigated the effects of energy discharges on rare gases. He constructed what is called the Crookes tube. It is a glass vacuum cylinder, containing electrodes for discharges of a high voltage electric current. He found, when he placed unexposed photographic plates near the tube, that some of them were flawed by shadows, though he did not investigate this effect. In 1892, Heinrich Hertz began experimenting and demonstrated that cathode rays could penetrate very thin metal foil (such as aluminum). Philip Lenard, a student of Heinrich Hertz, further researched this effect. He developed a version of the cathode tube and studied the penetration of X-rays through various materials. Philip Lenard, though, did not realize that he was producing X-rays.

In April 1887, Nikola Tesla began to investigate X-rays using his own devices as well as Crookes tubes. Tesla did this by experimenting with high voltages and vacuum tubes. From Nikola Tesla's technical publications, it is indicated that he invented and developed a special single-electrode X-ray tube. Tesla's tubes differ from other X-ray tubes in that they have no target electrode. He stated these facts in his 1897 X-ray lecture before the New York Academy of Sciences. The modern term for this process is the bremsstrahlung process, in which a high-energy secondary X-ray emission is produced when charged particles (such as electrons) pass through matter. By 1892, Tesla performed several such experiments; however, he did not categorize the emissions as what was later called X-rays (generalizing the phenonomena as radiant energy). Tesla did not publicly declare his findings nor did he make them widely known. His subsequent X-ray experimentation by vacuum high field emissions led him to alert the scientific community to the biological hazards associated with X-ray exposure.

Hermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before Roentgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light (Wiedmann's Annalen, Vol. XLVIII); however, he did not work with actual X-rays.

On November 8, 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen, a German scientist, began observing and further documenting X-rays while experimenting with vacuum tubes. Röntgen, on December 28, 1895, wrote a preliminary report &quot;On a new kind of ray: A preliminary communication&quot;. He submitted it to the Würzburg's Physical-Medical Society journal. This was the first formal and public recognition of the categorization of X-rays. Röntgen referred to the radiation as &quot;X&quot;, to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over Röntgen's great objections), many of his colleagues suggested calling them Röntgen rays. They are still referred to as Röntgen rays in some countries. Roentgen received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.

In 1895, Thomas Edison investigated materials' ability to fluoresce when exposed to X-rays. He found that calcium tungstate was the most effective substance. Around March 1896, the fluoroscope he developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped x-ray research around 1903 after the death of Clarence Madison Dally, one of his glassblowers. Dally had a habit of testing X-ray tubes on his hands, and acquired a cancer in them so tenacious that both arms were amputated in a futile attempt to save his life.[1]

In 1906, physicist Charles Barkla discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic X-ray. He won the 1917 Nobel prize for this discovery.

The use of X-rays for medical purposes was pioneered by Major John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England. In 1908, he had to have his left arm amputated owing to the spread of X-ray dermatitis.

Detectors

The detection of X-rays is based on various methods. Most commonly known is the photographic plate as we know them from hospitals. Initially, most common detection was based on the ionisation of gasses. One of the most simple examples is the Geiger counter. Since the 1990-ies, new detectors were developed based on semiconductors. In the semiconductor, the X-ray photon was converted to electron-hole pairs which were collected to detect the X-ray

===Gamma: Above 60 exahertz/Below 5 picometers===
Gamma rays (often denoted by the Greek letter gamma, γ) are an energetic form of electromagnetic radiation (see Electromagnetic spectrum) produced by radioactivity or other nuclear or subatomic processes such as electron-positron annihilation. Gamma rays are more penetrating than either alpha or beta radiation, but less ionizing. Gamma rays are distinguished from X rays by their origin. Gamma rays are produced by nuclear transitions while X-rays are produced by energy transitions due to accelerating electrons. Because it is possible for some electron transitions to be of higher energy than nuclear transition, there is an overlap between low energy gamma rays and high energy X-rays.

Shielding for γ rays requires large amounts of mass. Shields that reduce gamma ray intensity by 50% include 1 cm (0.4 inches) of lead, 6 cm (2.4 inches) of concrete or 9 cm (3.6 inches) of packed dirt.

Gamma rays from nuclear fallout would probably cause the largest number of casualties in the event of the use of nuclear weapons in a nuclear war. An effective fallout shelter reduces human exposure at least 1000 times.

Gamma rays are less ionising than either alpha or beta rays. However, reducing human danger requires thicker shielding. They produce damage similar to that caused by X-rays such as burns, cancer, and genetic mutations.

In terms of ionization, gamma radiation interacts with matter via three main processes: the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and pair production.

Photoelectric Effect: This describes the case in which a gamma photon interacts with and transfers all of its energy to an orbital electron, ejecting that electron from the atom. The kinetic energy of the resulting photoelectron is equal to the energy of the incident gamma photon minus the binding energy of the electron. The photoelectric effect is thought to be the dominant energy transfer mechanism for x-ray and gamma ray photons with energies below 50 keV (thousand electronvolts), but it is much less important at higher energies.

Compton Scattering: This is an interaction in which an incident gamma photon loses enough energy to an orbital electron to cause its ejection, with the remainder of the original photon's energy being emitted as a new, lower energy gamma photon with an emission direction different from that of the incident gamma photon. The probability of Compton scatter decreases with increasing photon energy. Compton scattering is thought to be the principal absorption mechanism for gamma rays in the intermediate energy range 100 keV to 10 MeV (million electronvolts), an energy spectrum which includes most gamma radiation present in a nuclear explosion. Compton scattering is relatively independent of the atomic number of the absorbing material.

Pair Production: By interaction in the vicinity of the coulomb force of the nucleus, the energy of the incident photon is spontaneously converted into the mass of an electron-positron pair. A positron is a positively charged electron. Energy in excess of the equivalent rest mass of the two particles (1.02 MeV) appears as the kinetic energy of the pair and the recoil nucleus. The electron of the pair, frequently referred to as the secondary electron, is densely ionizing. The positron has a very short lifetime. It combines within 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;8&lt;/sup&gt; second with a free electron. The entire mass of these two particles is then converted into two gamma photons of 0.51 MeV energy each.

Gamma rays are often produced alongside other forms of radiation such as alpha or beta. When a nucleus emits an α or β particle, the daughter nucleus is sometimes left in an excited state. It can then jump down to a lower level by emitting a gamma ray in much the same way that an atomic electron can jump to a lower level by emitting ultraviolet radiation.

Gamma rays, x-rays, visible light, and UV rays are all forms of electromagnetic radiation. The only difference is the frequency and hence the energy of the photons. Gamma rays are the most energetic. An example of gamma ray production follows.

First cobalt-60 decays to excited nickel-60 by beta decay:

Then the nickel-60 drops down to the ground state (see nuclear shell model) by emitting a gamma ray:

Uses:

The powerful nature of gamma-rays have made them useful in the sterilising of medical equipment by killing bacteria. They are also used to kill bacteria in foodstuffs to keep them fresher for longer.

In spite of their cancer-causing properties, gamma rays are also used to treat some types of cancer. In the procedure called gamma-knife surgery, multiple concentrated beams of gamma rays are directed on the growth in order to kill the cancerous cells. The beams are aimed from different angles to focus the radiation on the growth while minimising damage to the surrounding tissues.

I see you've started working with the practical inductor circuits and the like! Nice going so far, keep up the good work yes!

Welcome Wanderer, your work on the [[Electronics]] book looks great! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

As I said on the electronics [[talk:Electronics|talk]] page:

Sound, Brief History of the Universe, The Solar System, Evolution of the Earth's Atmosphere, Earthquakes and natural disasters, and Global Warming?

As sections in the chapter Analog Circuits?

Stick to the topic, please!

Saying &quot;the earth behaves like a conductor&quot;, &quot;the ionosphere behaves like a conductor and can reflect radio waves&quot; is plenty.  There is no need at ''allllll'' to go into the details like this.  That should be in a radio book anyway, not a basic electronics book.  This is supposed to be a book about electronic circuits for beginners, not about life, the universe, and everything.

I think you are doing most of this.  What do you think?

- [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 21:14, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

As I replied in the talk section.

Ok, I will admit that my writing does suffer a bit from feature creep.  I like to be through, and there are certain subjects that are not taught in school.  I have moved the offending sections to the Expanded Edition.  If you see anything else that seems excessive I will move it to the Expanded Edition.

[[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

I can't agree more with Omegatron. I think me being a student and him being an engineer, see things a bit differently as a 'student of everything'. The thing I really wanted to do was cover a lot of electronics design and ultimately CONDENSE things. I wish to have a book on electronics that can go from 0-60 in about an hour or two. Explain series, parallel circuits, voltage dividers, op-amps and other analog electronics. What I personally don't care about is the science of these things. For that people are better off visiting sites like 4hv.org or something.

I love to read about all the details behind how things work, too.  BUT...  This is an electronics book, and should focus on electronics.  Wikipedia is for providing details of everything about everything.  If wikipedia and wikibooks both cover the same material, then why bother?  Why is a book on electronics different from Wikipedia articles about electronics?  Because it is focused.  It should teach enough theory and physics that you understand the basics of what you are manipulating (charge and electron flow), because these are really necessary knowledge to understand what you are building.  And it should move from easier topics to more complicated topics in an orderly way.  But otherwise we should leave a lot of that stuff out and simply allow people to look it up on their own (band gaps, quantum mechanics, tunneling diodes, heavy electromagnetics, history of the universe, etc.) - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:44, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Thank you for your comments!  I wanted to make it a section in the [[Electronics]] book, but I see that the power section deals with DSP.  The document I am working on deals mainly with applications in the home, so it can probably become an applications section in one of the latter chapters of the [[Electronics]] book when it is done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a '''superconductor''', [[GCSE Science/Current, voltage resistance and Ohm's law|resistance]] drops to zero and current flows as a short without attenuating.  

Until recently most superconductors operated at very low temperatures close to absolute zero.  Recently there have been higher temperature superconductors.  

Superconductors all for floating magnets.

Superconductors have a great promise for reducing electricity bills.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most electrical motors are induction based.  

They work either through the flow of electricity or turing a magnet.

Waterfalls and windmills work by turning a magnet.  Waterfalls tend to have even power, but windmills have odd erratic  power based on the wind.

The driving force that turns the rotor containing the magnets is called the &quot;Prime Mover&quot;

Generators work by supplying current that drives a turbine.

Induction based motors work on AC and spinning magnets.

One of the problems of induction based motors is most of their power is reactive (caught in a magnetic field).  Capacitors are required to make the power real.  It is common in induction based generators to have a bank of variable capacitors to try to keep the power as real as possible.

'''Sesame seeds''' are small oily seeds, off-white or black colored, and a few [[Cookbook:mm|mm]] across at most. They are a common food allergen. They taste vaguely like [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanuts]] and [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashews]].

Sesame seeds can be added to [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]] for an extra 'nutty' texture. Sesame seeds are commonly sprinkled over [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] cooking.
Sesame seeds can be added to almost any [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] recipe by sprinkling or rolling the [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]] in the seeds before baking it, much as one might do for [[Cookbook:Poppy Seed|poppy seeds]].

Ground sesame seeds are called [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]]. 

Sesame seeds may be &quot;toasted&quot; ([[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] actually) to bring out more flavor.

The flavor of sesame seeds can be had via the use of [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]], commonly available as a dark liquid.

==Ohm's Law==
Ohm's law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.Voltage and current are proportional to the potential difference and inversely proportional to the resistance  of the circuit

:&lt;math&gt;
V = I \cdot R
&lt;/math&gt;

: Voltage (''V'') is measured in volts (V); Current (''I'') in amperes (A); and resistance (''R'') in ohms (&amp;Omega;).&lt;br/&gt;  

[[Image:Ohms law voltage source.svg|150px]]

In this example, the current going through any point in the circuit, ''I'', will be equal to the voltage ''V'' divided by the resistance ''R''.

[[Image:Ohms law current source.svg|150px]]

In this example, the voltage across the resistor, ''V'', will be equal to the supplied current, ''I'', times the resistance ''R''.

If two of the values (''V'', ''I'', or ''R'') are known, the other can be calculated using this formula.

Any more complicated circuit has an equivalent resistance that will allow us to calculate the current draw from the voltage source.  Equivalent resistance is worked out using the fact that all resistors are either in parallel or series.  Similarly, if the circuit only has a current source, the equivalent resistance can be used to calculate the voltage dropped across the current source.

== Kirchoff's Voltage Law ==

Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL):
: The sum of voltage drops around any loop in the circuit that starts and ends at the same place must be zero.

== Voltage as a Physical Quantity ==
# Voltage is the potential difference between two charged objects.
# Potentials can be added or subtracted  in series to make larger or smaller potentials as is commonly done in batteries.
# Positive charge flow from areas of high potential to lower potential.
# All the components of a circuit have resistance that acts as a potential drop.

==Kirchoff's Current Law==

Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL):
: The sum of all current entering a node must equal the sum of all currents leaving the node.

=== KCL Example ===

[[Image:Electronics_KCL.PNG]]

-''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 &amp;harr; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Electronics_KCL_1.PNG]]

''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - ''I''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 &amp;harr; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I_1 = I_2  + I_3 + \cdots + I_n \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

Here is more about [[wikipedia:Kirchhoff's laws|Kirchhoff's laws]], which can be integrated here

==Consequences of KVL and KCL==

====Voltage Dividers====
If two circuit elements are in series, there is a voltage drop across each element, but the current through both must be the same.  The voltage at any point in the chain divides according to the resistances.  A simple circuit with two (or more) resistors in series with a source is called a [[Electronics/Voltage Dividers|voltage divider]].

:[[Image:PotentialDivider.png|120px]]

Figure A: Voltage Divider circuit.

Consider the circuit in Figure A.  According to KVL the voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is dropped across resistors &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;.  If a current i flows through the two series resistors then by Ohm's Law.

:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac{V_{in}}{R_1+R_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

So
:&lt;math&gt; V_{out}=iR_2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore
:&lt;math&gt; V_{out}=\frac{V_{in}R_2}{R_1+R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Similary if &lt;math&gt;V_{R1}&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt; V_{R1}=\frac{V_{in}R_1}{R_1+R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

In general for n series resistors the voltage dropped across one of them say &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;V_{Ri}=\frac{V_{in}R_i}{R_{eq}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where 
:&lt;math&gt;R_{eq}=R_1+\cdots+R_n&lt;/math&gt;

=====Voltage Dividers as References=====

Clearly voltage dividers can be used as references. If you have a 9 volt battery and you want 4.5 volts, then connect two equal valued resistors in series and take the reference across the second and ground. There are clearly other concerns though, the first concern is current draw and the effect of the source impedance. Clearly connecting two 100 ohm resistors is a bad idea if the source impedance is, say, 50 ohms.  Then the current draw would be 0.036 mA which is quite large if the battery is rated, say, 200 milliampere hours.  The loading is more annoying with that source impedance too, the reference voltage with that source impedance is  &lt;math&gt;\frac {9(100)}{250}=3.6\mbox{ V}&lt;/math&gt;. So clearly, increasing the order of the resistor to at least 1 k&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the way to go to reduce the current draw and the effect of loading.  The other problem with these voltage divider references is that the reference cannot be loaded if we put a 100 &amp;Omega; resistor in parallel with a 10 k&amp;Omega; resistor. When the voltage divider is made of two 10 k&amp;Omega; resistors, then the resistance of the reference resistor becomes somewhere near 100 &amp;Omega;.  This clearly means a terrible reference.  If a 10 M&amp;Omega; resistor is used for the reference resistor will still be some where around 10 k&amp;Omega; but still probably less.  The effect of tolerances is also a problem; if the resistors are rated 5% then the resistance of 10 k&amp;Omega; resistors can vary by &amp;plusmn;500 &amp;Omega;.  This means more inaccuracy with this sort of reference.

====Current Dividers====

If two elements are in parallel, the voltage across them must be the same, but the current divides according to the resistances.  A simple circuit with two (or more) resistors in parallel with a source is called a [[Electronics/Current Dividers|current divider]].

[[Image:Resistorsparallel.png]]

Figure B: Parallel Resistors.

If a voltage V appears across the resistors in Figure B with only &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; for the moment then the current flowing in the circuit, before the division, i is according to Ohms Law.
:&lt;math&gt;i=\frac{V}{R_{eq}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the equivalent resistance for a parallel combination of resistors is
:&lt;math&gt;i=\frac{V(R_1+R_2)}{R_1R_2}&lt;/math&gt;           (1)

The current through &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; according to Ohms Law is
:&lt;math&gt;i_1=\frac{V}{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;            (2)

Dividing equation (2) by (1)
:&lt;math&gt;i_1=\frac{iR_2}{R_2+R_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly
:&lt;math&gt;i_2=\frac{iR_1}{R_2+R_1}&lt;/math&gt;

In general with n Resistors the current &lt;math&gt;i_x&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;i_x=\frac{iR_1R_2\cdots R_n}{ (R_2\cdots R_n+\cdots+ R_1\cdots R_{n-1}) R_x}&lt;/math&gt;

Or possibly more simply
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{i_x}{i}=\frac{R_{eq}}{R_x}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;R_{eq}=\frac{R_1\cdots R_n}{R_2\cdots R_n+\cdots+ R_1\cdots R_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship between Voltage and Current==

===Resistor===

In a resistor, the current is in phase with the voltage always. This means that the peaks and valleys of the two waveforms occur at the same times.  Resistors can simply be defined as devices that perform the sole function of inhibiting the flow of current through an electrical circuit.  Resistors are commercially available having various standard values, nevertheless variable resistors are also made called potentiometers, or pots for short. In theory electricity is a method used to harness myriad numbers including symbols to give the notion on how circuits function on a schematic drawing

===Capacitor===

The capacitor is different from the resistor in several ways.  First, it consumes no real power.  It does however, supply reactive power to the circuit.  In a capacitor, as voltage is increasing the capacitor is charging.  Thus a large initial current.  As the voltage peaks the capacitor is saturated and the current falls to zero.  Following the peak the circuit reverses and the charge leaves the capacitor.  The next half of the cycle the circuit runs mirroring the first half.

The relationship between voltage and current in a capacitor is: &lt;math&gt;i(t)=C{d(v(t)) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;. This is valid not only in AC but for any function v(t). As a direct consequence we can state that in the real world, the voltage across a capacitor is always a continuous function of the time.

If we apply the above formula to a AC voltage (i.e. &lt;math&gt;v(t)=V \cdot sin(\omega t + \Phi)&lt;/math&gt;), we get for the current a 90° phase shift: &lt;math&gt;i(t)=V \cdot \omega \cdot cos(\omega t + \Phi)&lt;/math&gt;.

In an AC circuit, current leads voltage by a quarter phase or 90 degrees. Note that while in DC circuits after the initial charge or discharge no current can flow, in AC circuits a current flows all the time into and out of the capacitor, depending on the [[Wikipedia:impedance|impedance]] in the circuit. This is similar to the [[Wikipedia:resistance|resistance]] in DC circuits, except that the impedance has 2 parts; the resistance included in the circuit, and also the [[reactance]] of the capacitor, which depends not only on the size of the capacitor, but also on the [[Wikipedia:frequency|frequency]] of the applied voltage. In a circuit that has DC applied plus a [[Wikipedia:signal|signal]], a capacitor can be used to block the DC, while letting the signal continue.

===Inductor===

In inductors, current is the negative derivative of voltage, meaning that however the voltage changes the current tries to oppose that change.  When the voltage is not changing there is no current and no magnetic field.  

In an AC Circuit, voltage leads current by a quarter phase or 90 degrees.

Voltage Defined as the derivative of the flux linkage:

&lt;math&gt;V(t)={d(Ni(t)) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

==Resonance==
A circuit containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors is said to be in resonance when the reactance of the inductor cancels that of the capacitor to leave the resulting total resistance of the circuit to be equal to the value of the component resistor. The resonance state is achieved by fine tuning the frequency of the circuit to a value where the resulting impedance of the capacitor cancels that of the inductor, resulting in a circuit that appears entirely resistive.

==See also==
AC Voltage:

When the Voltage between two points is changing continuously with time then the voltage is called AC Voltage.
For AC Voltages there will be no constant value so we define it by the average value called RMS value RMS means Root Means Square. In retrospect on AC the power that is used to theoretically determine by an unkown which we assume to be a steady flow, this is also what technicians label the fluctuation of current that determines how electricity moves in a diagram.</text>

== Problems ==

This page falsely implied all series have finite radii of convergence. Corrected and expanded. Also, series aren't always expanded around x=0, notably ln x. More work is needed, maybe including quote of full Taylor-Mclaurin expansion. - Robert 2/4/4

== convergence ==

after find the convergence radius need to test the extremities. 

eg: if the radius is 5 and the center is -3 the extremities is -8 and +2, so you need to test if the series converge with -8 and +2.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Engineering mechanics''' is the application of mechanics to solve problems involving common engineering elements.

The goal of this Engineering Mechanics course is to expose students to problems in mechanics as applied to plausibly real-world scenarios.  Problems of particular types are explored in detail in the hopes that students will gain an inductive understanding of the underlying principles at work; students should then be able to recognize problems of this sort in real-world situations and respond accordingly.

Further, this text aims to support the learning of Engineering Mechanics with theoretical material, general key techniques, and a sufficient number of solved sample problems to satisfy the first objective as outlined above.

===Distinction between branches of physics===
[[Image:Tree_of_Mechanics.svg|thumb|Most applied branches of classic physics in engineering|500px]]

As you see in the diagram mechanics is the first and most fundamental branch of physics, supporting Thermodynamics and Electricity, and including Statics, Dynamics(=Kinematics+kinetics); all which are all highly applicable in engineering. but the most important part of them is statics (study of body at rest) which is not only a base for all others, but also have the highest engineering application. physics also involve optics, waves, quantum, and relativity theory, which have no fundamental engineering application yet.

===Prerequisites===
This book assumes familiarity with high school physics and calculus, although the mathematics used is fairly elementary.

== Statics ==

We describe the motion of bodies using Newton's second law of motion

  \mathbf{f} = m~\mathbf{a} \, 
&lt;/math&gt;

Statics deals with the situation where the acceleration (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\,&lt;/math&gt;) is zero - which happens when a body is at rest, or moving with constant velocity.  That means that the total force on a body at rest or with constant velocity must be zero.  In other words, the sum of the forces on the body must equal zero.

:&lt;math&gt;
 \text{Sum of Forces = 0} \qquad \text{or} \qquad  \sum \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{0}
&lt;/math&gt;

Engineers typically draw what is called a &quot;[[w:Free body diagram|free body diagram]]&quot; to show all forces on a body at rest.  These forces are then broken down into vectors consistent with a useful coordinate system and summed in sets (components parallel to each basis vector) which are then set to zero to meet the static constraint of no acceleration being present.

This typically results in sets of equations which can be solved using simple linear algebra techniques or even simple algebra and substitution.

&lt;!-- Insert a png example freebody diagram and calculations here. --&gt;

=== Truss ===
Forces act along the members, and there are no shear forces or moments. A truss is therefore defined as a system composed entirely of two-force members, which only carry axial loads.
The ends of a truss are pinned, so that they don't carry moments.
The only reactions at the ends of a truss member are forces.
External forces on trusses act only on the end points.
Truss problems are solved by the method of sections, where an imaginary cut is made through the member(s) of interest, and global equilibrium of forces and moments are used to determine the forces in the members, or by the method of joints, in which a single joint is isolated and analyzed and the resulting forces (not necessarily with a numerical value) are transferred to adjacent joints, where the process is repeated. The resulting set of equations can then be solved by linear algebra, or substitution.

=== Chains and Cables ===

Chains and cables are attached at end points and have a continuous load on them due to their own weight (body forces) or external loads.
Let a cable of length &lt;math&gt;L\,&lt;/math&gt; have a load of &lt;math&gt;w\,&lt;/math&gt; acting per unit distance between the supports.
If the tension in the cable at any point is &lt;math&gt;T(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;, then we have, for an infinitesimal length of the cable making an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; with the horizontal,

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \cfrac{d}{dx}[T~\cos\theta] = 0 \\
    \cfrac{d}{dx}[T~\sin\theta] = w 
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have,

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    T~\cos\theta = \text{constant} = K \\
    T~\sin\theta = \int w~dx + C_1
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
   \tan\theta = \cfrac{1}{K}~\left[\int w~dx + C_1 \right]
 &lt;/math&gt;

Now

:&lt;math&gt;
   \tan\theta = \cfrac{dy}{dx} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

So we have a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{dy}{dx} = \cfrac{1}{K}~\left[\int w~dx + C_1 \right]
 &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
  y = \cfrac{1}{K}~\left[\int \left(\int w~dx\right)~dx + C_1~x + C_2 \right]
 &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;w\,&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, then we have,

:&lt;math&gt;
  y = \cfrac{1}{K}~\left[\cfrac{w~x^2}{2} + C_1~x + C_2 \right]
 &lt;/math&gt;

which is the equation of a parabola.

For a rope where the loading is given in terms of the length of the rope (much more common), i.e., &lt;math&gt; T \equiv T(s) &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; \theta \equiv \theta(s) &lt;/math&gt;, we have, 

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \cfrac{d}{ds}[T~\cos\theta] &amp; = 0 \\
    \cfrac{d}{ds}[T~\sin\theta] &amp; = w(s)
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;
  ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Dynamics ==

While statics deal with the part of mechanics where all objects are stationary, dynamics deals with objects or structures with a non-zero acceleration. 
Dynamics may be broken down into kinematics and kinetics. Kinematics deal with displacement, velocities and accelerations without concern for the forces involved. Kinetics deal with the forces and moments involved in making the body move.

This section builds upon and expands the theory covered in the previous chapter on groups. The reader is strongly advised to master the material presented in the sections up to and including Products and Free Groups before continuing.

== Motivation ==

The standard motivation for the study of rings is as a generalization of the set of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; with addition and multiplication, in order to study integer-like structures in a more general and less restrictive setting. However, we will also present the following motivation for the study of rings, based on the theory of Abelian groups.

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be Abelian groups. Then the set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G,H)&lt;/math&gt; (Please don't pay much attention to the subscript for now.) of group homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; naturally forms an abelian group in the following way. If &lt;math&gt;\phi,\psi\in \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G,H)&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;(\phi+\psi)(g)=\phi(g)+\psi(g)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. It should be obvious where each addition is taking place. In particular, we can consider the set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G)=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G,G)&lt;/math&gt; of endomorphisms of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the set of homomorphisms from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to itself. This set is obviously a group from the above discussion, but it is also closed under composition. By endowing the set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G)&lt;/math&gt; with the operations of addition, &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;, and composition, &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;, we note that it has the following properties:

:i) It is an Abelian group under addition.

:ii) It is a monoid under multiplication.

:iii) Addition distributes over composition.

Indeed, for the third property, note that if &lt;math&gt;\phi,\psi,\xi\in\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{Ab}}(G)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi\circ(\psi+\xi)(g)=(\phi\circ\psi+\phi\circ\xi)(g)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\phi+\psi)\circ\xi(g)=(\phi\circ\xi+\psi\circ\xi)(g)&lt;/math&gt;. The following material is a generalization of this situation.

== Introduction to Rings ==

'''Definition 1:''' A ''ring'' &lt;math&gt;(R,+,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with two binary operations &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the following properties:

For all &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in R,&lt;/math&gt;

:i) &lt;math&gt;(R,+)&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group.

:ii) &lt;math&gt;(R,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid.
The definition of ring homomorphism does not include the existence of 1.

:iii) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is distributive over &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;:
::1) &lt;math&gt;a\cdot(b+c)=(a\cdot b)+(a\cdot c)&lt;/math&gt;
::2) &lt;math&gt;(a+b)\cdot c=(a\cdot c)+(b\cdot c)&lt;/math&gt;

We will denote the additive identity in a ring by &lt;math&gt;0_R&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if the ring is understood. Similarily, we denote the multiplicative identity by &lt;math&gt;1_R&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; when the ring is understood. We'll often use juxtaposition in place of &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;ab\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a\cdot b&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 2:''' Some authors do not require their rings to have a multiplicative identity element. We will call a ring without an idenitity a ''rng''. ''Pseudo-rings'' is another term used for rings without unity. Authors who do not require a multiplicative identity usually call a ring a ''ring with unity''. Unless otherwise stated, we will assume that &lt;math&gt;0\neq 1&lt;/math&gt; in our rings. A major part of noncommutaive ring theory was developed without assuming every ring has an identity element.

'''Example 3:''' The reader is already familiar with several examples of rings. For instance &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; with the usual addition and multiplication operations. We have a familiy of finite rings given by the sets &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; for integer &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2&lt;/math&gt; with addition and multiplication defined modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Finally we have an example of a ''rng'' given by the sets &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; for integer &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2&lt;/math&gt; with the usual addition and multiplication. The reader is invited to confirm the ring axioms for these examples.


Let us now prove some very basic properties about rings. This is analogous to what we did for groups when we first introduced them.


'''Theorem 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a ring, and let &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in R&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following are true:
# If &lt;math&gt;a + b = a + c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;b = c&lt;/math&gt;.
# The equation &lt;math&gt;a + x = b&lt;/math&gt; has a unique solution.
# &lt;math&gt;-(-a) = a&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;0a = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(-a)b = -(ab)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; (-a)(-b) = ab&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof:'' (1), (2), and (3) all strictly concern addition, and are all previous results from &lt;math&gt;(R,+)&lt;/math&gt; being a group. The other three parts all concern both addition and multiplication (since 0 and - are additive concepts), so as a proof strategy we expect to use the distributive law in some way to link the two operations. For (4), observe that &lt;math&gt;0a + 0a = (0 + 0)a = 0a = 0a + 0&lt;/math&gt;. But then by (1), 0a=0. For (5), Note that &lt;math&gt;(-a)b + ab = (-a + a)b = 0b = 0&lt;/math&gt;. For (6) note that &lt;math&gt;(-a)(-b) + -(ab) = (-a)(-b) + (-a)b = -a(-b + b) = -a0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Remark 5:''' Take another look at the examples in Example 3. Notice that for all those rings, multiplication is a commutative opration. However, the axioms say nothing about this. Thus we should expect to find counter-examples to this.


'''Definition 6:''' A ring is called ''commutative'' if multiplication is commutative.


'''Example 7:''' An example of a non-commutative ring is the set &lt;math&gt;{M}_n(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; square matrices with real coefficients under standard addition and multiplication of matrices, where &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. The reader can easily check this for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; and conclude that it holds for all other &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (why?).


'''Theorem 8:''' A ring has a unique multiplicative identity.

''Proof'': During our brief discussion of monoids earlier, we showed that in any monoid the identity is unique. Since a ring sans addition is a monoid, this applies here. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Example 9:''' The singleton set &lt;math&gt;\{*\}&lt;/math&gt; with addition and multiplication defined by &lt;math&gt;*+*=*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*\cdot *=*&lt;/math&gt; is a ring, called the ''trivial ring'' or the ''zero ring''. Note that in the trivial ring, &lt;math&gt;0=1&lt;/math&gt;. The reader is invited to show that &lt;math&gt;0=1&lt;/math&gt; in a ring if and only if it is the trivial ring.


If the reader has tried to construct some of the rings &lt;math&gt;=\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, he/she may have realised that certain non-zero elements have product zero. We formalize this concept as follows.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a ring and &lt;math&gt;a\in R \setminus \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''left(resp.right)-zero-divisor'' if there exists a &lt;math&gt;b\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab=0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(ba=0)&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a ring with &lt;math&gt;a\in R&lt;/math&gt;. Define the function &lt;math&gt;\rho_a\,:\, R\rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\rho_a(r)=ar&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;r\in R&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is injective if and only if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is not a left-zero-divisor.

''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is not a left-zero-divisor, and assume we have &lt;math&gt;ab=\rho_a(b)=\rho_a(c)=ac&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;b,c\in R&lt;/math&gt;. This implies &lt;math&gt;ab-ac=a(b-c)=0&lt;/math&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt;b=c&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is not a left-zero-divisor, so &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is injective. Conversely, assume &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a left-zero-divisor. Then there exists a &lt;math&gt;b\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;b\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_a(b)=ab=0=a0=\rho_a(0)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is not injective. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Remark 12:''' Thus, multiplication by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is left-cancellative if and only if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is not a zero-divisor. The reader is invited to state and prove the equivalent lemma for right-zero-divisors.


'''Example 13:''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; are all examples of commutative rings without zero divisors. These rings motivate the next definition.


'''Definition 14:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a commutative ring without zero divisors. Then &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''integral domain''.


Just like Definition 14, the majority of special types of rings will be motivated by properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example 15:'''
# The set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Set}}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; of functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with pointwise addition and multiplication is a ring.
# More generally, if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a ring, the set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Set}}(R,R)&lt;/math&gt; of functions from &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to itself is also a ring.
# The set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Set}}(R,R)&lt;/math&gt; with function composition for multiplication is '''not''' a ring since the statement &lt;math&gt;f\circ(g+h) = f\circ g + f\circ h&lt;/math&gt; is not true in general.
# The set of integrable functions on the real numbers, &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;, is a rng under pointwise addition and multiplication given by ''convolution'': &lt;math&gt;(f*g)(t) = \int_\mathbb{R} f(\tau)g(t-\tau) d\tau&lt;/math&gt;. This rng is important to the study of linear systems and differential equations. If the reader has enough calculus under his/her belt, he/she reader is invited to show that it does not have an identity, and that it is commutative.
# The set of Gaussian integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}\left[i\right]=\left\{a+bi|a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; with standard addition and multiplication is a ring.


'''Definition 16:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a ring. An element &lt;math&gt;a \in R&lt;/math&gt; is a ''unit'' and is ''invertible'' if there is an element &lt;math&gt;b \in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab=ba = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all units is denoted by &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise 17:''' Prove that &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; is a group under multiplication.

'''Exercise 18:''': Show that a zero-divisor is not a unit.

'''Theorem 19:''' (Cancellation Law for Integral Domains): Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be an integral domain, and let &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in R&lt;/math&gt; be nonzero. Then &lt;math&gt;ab = ac&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;b = c&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof:'' Evidently &lt;math&gt;ab = ac&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;b=c&lt;/math&gt;. To see the other direction, we rearrange the equality as &lt;math&gt;ab - ac = 0&lt;/math&gt;. But then &lt;math&gt;a(b-c) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; contains no zero divisors, it must be the case that &lt;math&gt;b-c = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is to say that &lt;math&gt;b=c&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition 20:''' A ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a ''division ring'' or ''skew field'' if all non-zero elements are units, i.e. if it forms a group under multiplication with its nonzero elements.

'''Definition 21:''' A field is a commutative division ring. Alternatively, a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a ring where &lt;math&gt;(F - {0},\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group under multiplication. As another alternative, a field is an integral domain where all non-zero elements are invertible.

As stated before, integral domains are easy to work with because they are so close to being fields. In fact, the next theorem shows just how close the two are:

'''Theorem 22:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a finite integral domain. Then &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a field.

''Proof:'' Let &lt;math&gt;a\in R&lt;/math&gt; be nonzero and let &lt;math&gt;S = \left\{ab| b\in R\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. From the cancellation law, we can see that &lt;math&gt;|S| = |R|&lt;/math&gt; (since if two elements &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ac&lt;/math&gt; are equal, then &lt;math&gt;b=c&lt;/math&gt;). But then &lt;math&gt;S=R&lt;/math&gt;. So then there must be some &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab=1&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a unit.

Of course proving that a set with two operations satisfy all of the ring axioms can be tedious.  So, just as we did for groups, we note that if we're considering a subset of something that's already a ring, then our job is easier.

'''Definition 23:''' A ''subring'' &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; that is also a ring (under the same two operations as for &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;1_S=1_R&lt;/math&gt;. We denote &quot;&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;&quot; by &lt;math&gt;S\leq R&lt;/math&gt;. Note many mathematicians do not require rings or subrings to have an identity.

'''Theorem 24:''' Let &lt;math&gt;S\neq\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; be a subset of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;S\leq R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in S&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;a-b\in S&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;ab\in S&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;1\in S&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example 25:'''
# &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \leq \mathbb{Q} \leq \mathbb{R} \leq \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
# The trivial ring &lt;math&gt;\left\{0\right\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of every ring.
# The set of Gaussian integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}\left[i\right]&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of the complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Castor sugar''' is known as [[Cookbook:Superfine Sugar|superfine sugar]] in the United States. Because it dissolves more quickly than standard granulated sugar, it is used mainly in applications where this is desirable. It is most useful in  making meringue, sweetening cut fruit and the like, where no heat is applied, and therefore the larger granules of standard granulated sugar may be undesirable. In most cases granulated sugar may be substituted, and occasionally powdered sugar is also a suitable substitute.

Castor sugar is sometimes spelled '''caster sugar''' but the Oxford English Dictionary gives preference to the former.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;I.0: Introduction&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

Welcome to Level I German!

Level I is aimed at junior high and high school students. However, it can also be used by others just beginning to learn to speak or read German. 

The goal of Level I German is to introduce the basics of the German language without overwhelming students. Therefore, the vocabulary is formatted for translating from English (which the students know) into German.

Although Level II is aimed at students and people who are a bit proficient after Level I, still, English translation will be used, so as to ease the learning. It helps because, at times while learning a new language, even with basic understanding, the words are above normal understanding level, and thus require a &quot;sub&quot; assistance.

==German and English==
German and English are quite close to each other, and are called language sisters or, more formally, ''cognate languages''. Both belong to the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.  Here are some major similarities:
* Both languages use the Latin alphabet.
* Normally, sentences follow Subject-Verb-Object order.
* Questions have Verb-Subject-Object order or Adverb-Verb-Subject-Object order.
* There are contractions (e.g., ''isn't'') in both German and English.
* Many words share the same roots, such as ''word'' and ''Wort'', or ''house'' and ''Haus''.
* Many words are spelled almost the same way in English and German; for example, ''Text'', ''Zoo'', ''Handball'', ''Motor'', ''Bus'', ''Park'', ''Position'', or ''Garage''.
* ''Kindergarten'' (early school grade) is an English word borrowed directly from German, with a slight change of meaning from its original sense of daycare or nursery school.

As you can see, German is quite similar to English. There are, however,  differences:
* German has more letters than and different pronunciations from English.
* In German the verb is sometimes the last word of a sentence.
* German has more verb forms than English.
* German is the only known written language where ''every'' noun is capitalized, whether or not it is a proper noun.
* The word ''ich'' (''I'') is only capitalized if it is the first word of the sentence.
* German has three different words for ''you''.
* Adjectives have different endings based on the noun they are modifying in German.
* German does not have any Present Continuous tense, only Present tense.

However, German is still one of the easiest languages for English speakers to learn. The differences will be tackled over the course of the lessons.

==How to Use this Level of the German Textbook==

The lessons are meant to be taken in order. You should read and review the German dialogs as often as possible. Many of the dialogs come with audio recordings by native speakers. These recordings are invaluable to learn the German pronunciation. If there is a recording, you can do several kinds of exercises:
* Read the German dialog and translate it to English with the help of the vocabulary list.
* Listen to the dialog while you read it and try to understand as much as possible.
* Listen to the dialog without reading it, pause the playback after each sentence and translate it to English.
* Listen to the dialog without reading it, pause the playback after each sentence, and write it down in German.
* Listen to the dialog while reading it, stop after each sentence and repeat the pronunciation.

At the reviews, after every third lesson, you go back to look at the previous lessons.

===Layout of the Lessons===

* Every lesson has a title at the top.
* The lesson will introduce several topics, more and more as the lessons progress.
* Topics are usually introduced by dialogs, which are accompanied by vocabulary lists.
* Each lesson features several problems and a test at the end. You should write down your answers (either electronically or on paper) before looking at the suggested answers. The act of writing down your answers will help you to learn the spelling.
* Level I uses a &quot;more than enough&quot; system for the problems. You don't have to do all of the problems if you think you know the material. However, the test may require knowing certain vocabulary, so you need to make sure you know it.
&lt;!-- 
Level I is not intended to precede Level II; rather, it is a completely different course as explained in the first paragraph of the [[German/Introduction|Foreword]].
Comment: I don't think this is true any longer.
--&gt;

===Levels of Completion===

On the contents page, you will see filled-in boxes next to each lesson. The number of boxes corresponds to the completeness of the lesson as follows:

:[[Image:25%.svg]] - The lesson is started, with a lesson overview at least.
:[[Image:50%.svg]] - At least half of the sections are complete.
:[[Image:75%.svg]] - Most of the lesson is complete.
:[[File:100%.svg]] - The entire lesson is complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Triangle Identities==
In addition to the [[Trigonometry/Law of Sines|Law of Sines]], the [[Trigonometry/Law of Cosines|Law of Cosines]], and the [[Trigonometry/Law of Tangents|Law of Tangents]], there are numerous other identities that apply to the three angles A, B, and C of any triangle (where A+B+C=180° and each of A, B, and C is greater than zero).  Some of the most notable ones follow:

#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos^2A+\cos^2B+\cos^2C+2\cos A \cos B \cos C=1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin A + \sin B + \sin C = 4\cos\frac{A}{2}\cos\frac{B}{2}\cos\frac{C}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \tan A \tan B \tan C&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{A}{2}\tan\frac{B}{2} + \tan\frac{B}{2}\tan\frac{C}{2} + \tan\frac{C}{2}\tan\frac{A}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cot A \cot B + \cot B \cot C + \cot C \cot A = 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cot\frac{A}{2}\cot\frac{B}{2}\cot\frac{C}{2} = \cot\frac{A}{2} + \cot\frac{B}{2} + \cot\frac{C}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin A \sin B \sin C = \frac{1}{(\cot A + \cot B)(\cot B + \cot C)(\cot C + \cot A)}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin A + \sin B - \sin C}{\sin A + \sin B + \sin C} = \tan \frac{A}{2}\tan \frac{B}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Pythagoras==

#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1+\tan^2(x)=\sec^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1+\cot^2(x)=\csc^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;
These are all direct consequences of Pythagoras's theorem.

==Sum/Difference of angles==

#&lt;math&gt;\cos(x\pm y)=\cos(x)\cos(y) \mp \sin(x)\sin(y)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin(x\pm y)=\sin(x)\cos(y) \pm \sin(y)\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\tan(x\pm y)=\frac{\tan(x) \pm \tan(y)}{1 \mp \tan(x) \tan(y)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Product to Sum==

#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2 \sin(x) \sin(y) = \cos(x-y)-\cos(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2 \cos(x) \cos(y) = \cos(x-y)+\cos(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2 \sin(x) \cos(y) = \sin(x-y)+\sin(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;

==Sum and difference to product==
#&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle A \sin(x)+B\cos(x)= C \sin(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C=\sqrt{A^2+B^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=\pm\arctan(B/A)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- please describe how to select + or -.    --&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha+\sin\beta=2\sin\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}\cos\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha-\sin\beta=2\cos\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}\sin\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha+\cos\beta=2\cos\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}\cos\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha-\cos\beta=-2\sin\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}\sin\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Multiple angle==

#&lt;math&gt;\cos(2x)=\cos^2(x)- \sin^2(x)=2\cos^2(x)-1=1-2\sin^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin(2x)=2\sin(x)\cos(x) &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\tan(2x)=\frac{2\tan(x)}{1- \tan^2(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cot(2x)=\frac{1}{2}[\cot(x)-\tan(x)]&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\csc(2x)=\frac{1}{2}[\cot(x)+\tan(x)]&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos(3x)=4\cos^{3}(x)-3\cos(x) &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin(3x)=-4\sin^{3}(x)+3\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\tan(3x)=\frac{3\tan(x)-\tan^{3}(x)}{1-3\tan^{2}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos(4x)=8\cos^{4}(x)-8\cos^{2}(x)+1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin(4x)=4\sin(x)\cos^{3}(x)-4\sin^{3}(x)\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin^{2}(4x)=16[\sin^{2}(x)-5\sin^{4}(x)+8\sin^{6}(x)-4\sin^{8}(x)]&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\tan(4x)=\frac{4\tan(x)-4\tan^{3}(x)}{1-6\tan^{2}(x)+\tan^{4}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos(5x)=16\cos^{5}(x)-20\cos^{3}(x)+5\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin(5x)=16\sin^{5}(x)-20\sin^{3}(x)+5\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\tan(5x)=\frac{5\tan(x)-10\tan^{3}(x)+\tan^{5}(x)}{1-10\tan^{2}(x)+5\tan^{4}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos(6x)=32\cos^{6}(x)-48\cos^{4}(x)+18\cos^{2}(x)-1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos(7x)=64\cos^{7}(x)-112\cos^{5}(x)+56\cos^{3}(x)-7\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin(7x)=-64\sin^{7}(x)+112\sin^{5}(x)-56\sin^{3}(x)+7\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos(8x)=128\cos^{8}(x)-256\cos^{6}(x)+160\cos^{4}(x)-32\cos^{2}(x)+1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos(nx)=2\cos(x)\cos[(n-1)x]-\cos[(n-2)x]&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin(nx)=2\cos(x)\sin[(n-1)x]-\sin[(n-2)x]&lt;/math&gt;

These are all direct consequences of the sum/difference formulae

==Half angle==

#&lt;math&gt;\cos(\frac{x}{2})=\pm\sqrt{\frac{1+\cos(x)}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin(\frac{x}{2})=\pm\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos(x)}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\tan(\frac{x}{2})=\frac{1-\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}=\frac{\sin(x)}{1+\cos(x)}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos(x)}{1+\cos(x)}}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos^{2}(\frac{3}{2}x)=2\cos^{3}(x)-\frac{3}{2}\cos(x)+\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
In cases with &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt;, the sign of the result must be determined from the value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  These derive from the &lt;math&gt;\cos(2x)&lt;/math&gt; formulae.

==Power Reduction==
#&lt;math&gt;\sin^2\theta=\frac{1-\cos2\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos^2\theta=\frac{1+\cos2\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\tan^2\theta=\frac{1-\cos2\theta}{1+\cos2\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

==Even/Odd==
#&lt;math&gt;\sin(-\theta)=-\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cos(-\theta)=\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\tan(-\theta)=-\tan(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\csc(-\theta)=-\csc(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sec(-\theta)=\sec(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\cot(-\theta)=-\cot(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

==Calculus==

#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[\sin x] = \cos x&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[\cos x] = -\sin x&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[\tan x] = \sec^{2} x&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[\sec x] = \sec x \tan x&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[\csc x] = -\csc x \cot x&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}[\cot x] = -\csc^{2} x&lt;/math&gt;

Electrolysis involves an electric field and the motion of electrons through a liquid. 

[[GCSE Science/Electricity]]
----

Electrolysis is the decomposition of certain types of substance using electricity. The types of substance that can be split are '''ionic''' substances. This just means that they are made of  charged ions rather than neutral atoms. {Remember that an ion is just an atom that has either a positive or negative charge}. An example of an ionic substance is common table salt—sodium chloride. The sodium ion has a positive charge, the chlorine ion has a negative charge. It is usually written as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Q1)''' Check in a periodic table, what is the symbol for sodium—Na or Cl?

As you may already know if you've studied the [[GCSE Science/Metals|Metals]] module, a salt is any substance made by combining an acid with an alkali. Acids, alkalis, and therefore all salts are ionic.

'''Q2)''' Which of the following substances can be broken up by electricity Sodium chloride, iron sulphate, copper nitrate?

==Basic Experimental Setup==
{{mergeto|Electronics/Cells}}

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| 
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;ccddff&quot; |  The liquid electrolyte is connected&lt;br&gt; to a battery or power supply.&lt;br&gt;The electrodes must not touch!
|}

Most ionic compounds are not liquid at room temperature. This is a problem because the ions need to be able to move for the electric current to be able to flow. This can be achieved by melting. Look at the electrical setup shown on the right. The electrodes are just two carbon rods connected to a battery. The one connected to the positive electrode is called the anode. The one connected to the negative electrode is called the cathode.

Consider for example the compound lead bromide. This compound is a solid at room temperature but can be molten over a Bunsen flame. So what you would do is put some lead bromide into a beaker. Put the beaker on a tripod over a Bunsen flame. Melt the lead bromide, then put in the electrodes and turn the power supply on at a setting of say 2V. What you would see happening is the anode, is a silvery coating of pure lead forming, and bromine forming at the cathode. The current would continue to flow until all the lead bromide was turned into lead and bromine.

'''Q3)''' It takes energy to split up a compound like lead bromide. Where does this energy come from ?  
   
'''Q4)''' Predict what products you would get at the anode and cathode if copper chloride was the electrolyte.

==What happens at the anode==

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Electrolysis anode.png]]
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;ccddff&quot; |  The bromine atoms (blue)&lt;br&gt; give up  2 electrons each (green) to the anode.
|}
The anode is the positive electrode. It attracts  negatively charged ions, because unlike charges attract. The bromine ions move through the melt until they reach the anode. Once they get there, they give up their  two extra electrons to become bromine atoms.

Br&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; Br + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The electrons flow up the anode to the positive terminal of the battery.

==What happens at the cathode==
The cathode is the negative electrode. It attracts the positively charged ions. Metal ions are always positive and so the lead ions flow through the melt until they get to the cathode. Once they get there they take two electrons each from the cathode. The electrons flow down the cathode from the negatively terminal of the battery and onto the lead ions.

Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; Pb

'''Q5)''' Solid ionic substances do not conduct electricity and are not split up by it. Why do you think that is?

==Quantity calculations (higher tier only)==
[[Image:Electrolysis copper sulphate.png]]

In the experiment with lead bromide, you saw that lead was deposited at the cathode. If you actually do the experiment you will see that the lead coats the cathode. In this section we will look at how much metal will coat a cathode in a given time.

A scientist performed the following experiment.
*A copper cathode was carefully cleaned and accurately weighed.
*It was placed along with an abnode into a solution of copper sulphate.
*It was connected via a ammeter to a variable power supply.
*A current was left to run for a given time then the cathode was removed and weighed again.

His results were:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;  bgcolor= &quot;ffdddd&quot;
|-
| Current /A || Time /s || Mass of copper deposited /g
|-
| 1 || 3000 || 1.0
|-
| 2 || 3000 || 2.0
|-
| 2 || 1500 || 1.0
|-
| 1 || 1500 || 1.0
|}

You can see from the results that the total amount of copper deposited depends on both the current and the time it flows. This is because the number of copper atoms that can be made from ions depends on the total amount of '''charge''' that flows. The unit of charge is the coulomb.

One coulomb is the amount of charge when one Amp flows for one second (see [[GCSE Science/Measuring electricity]]

'''Q6)'''Look at the results table above. How much copper is deposited when 1A flows for 3000 seconds?

'''Q7)'''How much copper do you predict would be doposited if 1A were to flow for 6000 seconds.

'''Q8)'''What about if 2A were to flow for 12000 seconds ?

==Electrolysis of Aqueos solutions (Advanced)==
''Before studying this section check with your teacher to see if you need to''.

Earlier on in this module you've learned that ions must be able to move in order for electrolysis to work. If the ions are held rigid {such as in a solid}, they can't move and no electricity will flow. We've looked at how the frreing up of ions can occur by melting the electrolyte. Another way to achieve this is by dissolving th electrolyte in water. The trouble with this method is, there will be mor than one type of ion present.

water partially splits up into ions {this is why it's such a good solvent for ionic compounds}.It splits into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O --&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

So at the cathode there will be two ions present. The Metal ion and the hydrogen ion from the water. Which element is actually produced at the cathode depends on how reactive the metal is. If the metal is very reactive, such as potassium, or sodium, then hydrogen will be produced. If the metal is unreactive such as silver, the metal will be produced.{I hope you learned your displacement reactions in lower school}. To work out which ion wins, the metal or the hydrogen, compare their reactivities in a the reactivity series. The one that is most reactive, will '''not''' be produced at the cathode.

A similar situation occurs at the anode. Hydroxide ions {from the water} are usually discharged at the anode ultimately producing oxygen.

OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; OH + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

4OH --&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

This is true for most things but if the ions are bromine, chlorine, or fluorine {i.e. a halogen} then the halogen will be produced. {You are unlikely to need to remember this, only ''understand it''}

'''Q9)''' Sodium chloride is dissolved in water and subjected to electrolysis. Explain what you see at each of the electrodes.

{| bgcolor=&quot;ffeeaa&quot;
|-
| '''Summary'''
|-
| Only ionic substances can be split up by electrolysis
|-
| The ionic compounds need to be melted or dissolved in water so the ions can move
|-
| Positive ions are attracted to the cathode, where they pick up electrons from the electrode
|-
| Negative ions are attracted to the anode where they give electrons to the electrode

A '''fuel cell''' is an electrochemical device similar to a battery, but differing from the latter in that it is designed for continuous replenishment of the reactants consumed; i.e. it produces electricity from an external fuel supply as opposed to the limited internal energy storage capacity of a battery.

Typical reactants are hydrogen on the anode side and oxygen on the cathode side. In contrast, conventional batteries consume solid reactants and, once these reactants are depleted, must be discarded, recharged with electricity by running the chemical reaction backwards, or, at least in theory, having their electrodes replaced. Typically in fuel cells, reactants flow in and reaction products flow out, and continuous long-term operation is feasible virtually as long as these flows are maintained.

Fuel cells are also attractive in some applications for their high efficiency and low pollution. Some applications that have been suggested include
* baseload utility power plants,
* emergency backup power,
* off-grid power storage,
* portable electronics, and
* electrically-powered vehicles.

== Types of fuel cells ==

There are five generally recognised types of fuel cells, of which two are the main subject of intensive research.

=== PEM ===

'''PEM''' fuel cells have a disputed acronym, meaning either '''proton-exchange membrane''' or '''polymer-electrolyte membrane''', which both are in fact a good description. In this fuel cell, hydrogen is split at the membrane surface in protons, that travel through the membrane, and electrons, that travel through our external electric circuit, and provide our power. The hydrogen ions travel through the water that is entrained in the membrane to the other side, where they are combined with oxygen to form water. Unfortunately, while the splitting of the hydrogen molecule is relatively easy, splitting the stronger oxygen molecule is more difficult, and this causes significant losses that result in a sharp decrease of performance of the fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell is a prime candidate for vehicle and other mobile applications of all sizes down to mobile phones, because of its compactness. However, the water-entraining membrane is crucial to performance: too much water will flood the membrane, too little will dry it; in both cases, power output will drop; water management is a very difficult subject in PEM fuel cells. Furthermore, the platinum catalyst on the membrane is easily poisoned by CO.

PEM systems that use reformed methanol were proposed, as in Daimler Chrysler Necar 5; reforming methanol, i.e. making it react to obtain hydrogen, is however a very complicated process, that requires also purification from the CO the reaction produces. A platinum-ruthenium catalyst is necessary as some CO will unavoidably reach the membrane. The level should not exceed 10 parts per million.

=== DMFC ===

A subcategory of PEM is the '''DMFC''', or '''direct methanol fuel cell'''; here, the methanol is not reformed, but fed directly to the fuel cell. One does not need complicated reforming, and storage of methanol is much easier than that of hydrogen. However, efficiency is low, due to the high permeation of methanol through the membrane, and the dynamic behaviour is sluggish.

The main manufacturer of PEM is Ballard Power Systems of Vancouver, Canada. Efficiencies of PEM are in the range of 40-50%.

=== SOFC ===

'''Solid oxide fuel cells''', or '''SOFC''', are intended mainly for stationary applications (power plants). They work at very high temperatures (some at 1000°C), and their off-gases can be used to fire a secondary gas turbine to improve efficiency. Efficiency could reach as much as 70% in these hybrid systems. This time, it's oxygen being transferred through a solid oxide at high temperature to react with hydrogen on the other side. SOFC have such a high temperature that they can be fed (provided some modifications) with natural gas, that will react to give hydrogen in the fuel cell itself. SOFC are very resistant to poisoning, and can indeed be run on CO, which is a poison for PEM.

Since SOFC are made of ceramic materials, they tend to be brittle; they are therefore unsuited for mobile applications. Furthermore, thermal expansion demands a uniform and slow heating process at startup, that will cause very long startup times: typically, 8 hours are to be expected. Research is going now in the direction of lower-temperature SOFC (600°C), which will enable the use of metallic materials with better mechanical properties and heat conductivity.

=== MCFC ===

'''Molten-carbonate fuel cells''' ('''MCFC''') are also high-temperature, but in the range of 600°C. Their main problem is corrosion, and the need to operate a high-temperature liquid rather than a solid as in the SOFC.

=== PAFC ===

'''Phosphoric-acid fuel cells''' ('''PAFC''') are a mature technology that is commercially available. Unfortunately, the phosphoric acid solidifies under 40°C, making startup very difficult. They have been used for stationary applications with an efficiency of about 40%, and many believe they do not offer much potential for further development.

=== AFC ===

The '''alkaline fuel cell''' ('''AFC''') is the cell that brought the Man to the Moon. Used in Apollo-series missions and on the Space Shuttle, it is a very good fuel cell but for the fact that it is poisoned by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This means that the cell will require pure oxygen, or at least purified air. As this process is relatively expensive, not much development is being done on AFC. NASA has decided they will shift to PEM for the next generation of Space Shuttles.

== Science ==

Fuel cells are electrochemical devices, so they are not constrained by the maximum thermal (Carnot) efficiency as combustion engines are. Consequently, they can have very high efficiencies in converting chemical energy to electrical energy.

In the archetypal example of a hydrogen/oxygen polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell, a proton-conducting polymer membrane separates the anode (&quot;fuel&quot;) and cathode sides. Each side has an electrode, typically carbon paper coated with platinum catalyst.

On the anode side, hydrogen diffuses to the anode catalyst where it dissociates into protons and electrons. The protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode, but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit (supplying power) because the membrane is electronically insulating.

On the cathode catalyst, oxygen molecules react with the electrons (which have travelled through the external circuit) and protons to form water.

In this example, the only waste product is water vapor.

Also, there is the possible use of fuel cells at home, to store energy at the cheap off-peak electricity rates and used at peak-use hours. It may even be profitable to sell back some of the energy to the power company, like they do with windmill electric power. Peak power production reaches twice the normal level, which means that the very expensive powerplant capacity is sized for levels used for a short period of time. Also, power plants are most efficient at only one production rate and their efficiency drops off significantly at off-peak rates.

== History ==

The first fuel cell was developed in the 19th century by British scientist Sir William Grove.  A sketch was published in 1843.  But fuel cells did not see practical application until the 1960s, where they were used in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks). Extremely expensive materials were used and the fuel cells required very pure hydrogen and oxygen.  Early fuel cells tended to require inconveniently high operating temperatures that were a problem in many applications.

Further technological advances in the 1980s and 1990s, like the use of Nafion as the electrolyte, and reductions in the quantity of expensive platinum catalyst required, have made the prospect of fuel cells in consumer applications such as automobiles more realistic.

== The fuel cell industry ==

Ballard Power Systems is a major manufacturer of fuel cells and leads the world in automotive fuel cell technology. Ford Motor Company and Chrysler are major investors in Ballard. As of 2003, the only major automobile companies pursuing internal development of fuel cells for automotive use are General Motors and Toyota; most others are customers of Ballard.

United Technologies (UTX) is a major manufacturer of large, stationary fuel cells used as co-generation power plants in hospitals and large office buildings.  The company has also developed bus fleets that are powered by fuel cells.

==Pros and cons of fuel cells in various applications==

Their use is controversial in some applications.  The hydrogen typically used as a fuel isn't a primary source of energy.  It is usually only a source of stored energy that must be manufactured using energy from other sources. Some critics of the current stages of this technology argue that the energy needed to create the fuel in the first place may reduce the ultimate energy efficiency of the system to below that of highly efficient gasoline internal-combustion engines; this is especially true if the hydrogen is generated from electrolysis of water by electricity. On the other hand, hydrogen can be generated from [[Organic Chemistry/Alkanes/Methane|methane]] (the primary component of natural gas) with approximately 80% efficiency. The methane conversion method releases greenhouse gases, however, and the ideal environmental system would be to use renewable energy sources to generate hydrogen through electrolysis.  Other types of fuel cells don't face this problem.  For example, biological fuel cells take glucose and methanol from food scraps and convert it into hydrogen and food for the bacteria.

There are practical problems to be overcome as well.  Although the use of fuel cells for consumer products is probable in the near future, most current designs won't work if oriented upside down.  They currently cannot be scaled to the small size needed by portable devices such as cell phones.  Current designs require venting and therefore cannot operate under water.  They may not be usable on aircraft because of the risk of fuel leaks through the vents.  Technologies for safe refueling of consumer fuel cells are not yet in place.

Among the controversies in the use of hydrogen are: First, the energy used to produce the hydrogen is comparable to the energy in the hydrogen, it is inefficient therefore too expensive. If conventional powerplants were used to produce the hydrogen, at best, there would be no gains in current pollution rates. Second, some have suggested that this is a &quot;stalking horse&quot; to bring back nuclear power, which may be the only commercially viable way to make hydrogen and reduce pollution. Finally, the need to provide the very long, costly and vulnerable thousands of miles of gas lines makes hydrogen too costly without government help.

There are several advantages to hydrogen as well. Clean, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are non-continuous and unreliable through the course of a day. So power from these sources is not always available at the time it is needed. The electricity produced from solar panels or wind generators could be stored in large battery complexes but this can be expensive and batteries have a limited storage capacity and lifetime. If the electricity is used to produce hydrogen however, the energy can be stored more easily. As a gas hydrogen is not hard to store until it is needed.

==Electroplating==
==What is a battery?==
[[File:Battery symbol1.svg]]

==Batteries in circuits==
Batteries in series can increase or decrease the combined voltage.

Toys use batteries, for example, and it is important to note from the associated drawing(s) which way the batteries are to be inserted into the toy because their voltages can add or subtract as the case may be. To add voltages the + of one battery is connected to the - of the next battery. Some damage may be caused by inserting batteries in the wrong direction.

Batteries in parallel are not usually used; at a given rated voltage each battery is able to provide only a certain maximum current, but to increase the maximum available output current several batteries could be connected in parallel, meaning that all the + terminals are connected together, and so are all of the - terminals.

The life of a battery depends approximately on the value of (current times time), but the chemistry involved can permit a battery that seems to have been finished its lifetime to regain some of its life after some time, after the chemistry was able to do its work.

Many different kinds of batteries exist. They are used for different purposes, using different materials, sizes, rated voltages.

==Types of batteries==

Reversible, rechargeable, irreversible.

===Alkaline = Basic===
AA&lt;br&gt;
AAA&lt;br&gt;
C&lt;br&gt;
D&lt;br&gt;
9V&lt;br&gt;
All batteries, except the 9V variety, are 1.5V.  As alkaline batteries lose their charge, or in Layman's terms &quot;juice&quot;, the voltage outputted slowly decreases. This is what causes flashlights to dim and remote controls to lose their effectiveness whilst using the last of the power left in the battery.

===Rechargeable===
====Lithium====
Lithium batteries are available in rechargeable and &quot;normal&quot; forms.  Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are typically found in small to medium electronics, such as laptops, music players, some cordless mice etc.  Lithium batteries have little/no proven research of memory effect.  Lithium batteries are also available as single decharge cycle batteries.  These batteries are marketed as using lithium to increase life span but offer little/no fiscal advantage over standard alkaline batteries.

====Nickel Cadmium (NiCd)====
Nickel Cadmium batteries are typically not used in the present but were one of the first easily obtainable cheap rechargeable batteries besides the battery.  Nickel Cadmium (AKA NiCd) batteries can typically be found in radio controlled cars, older rechargeable &quot;standard&quot; batteries (AA,AAA, etc.), some wireless mice and many other applications. There is a myth that Nickel-Cadmium batteries have a memory effect, where if they are recharged when still somewhat full, they will lose capacity. laboratory research has proven this false in modern batteries (it does happen, to a small extent in old (pre-1950) sintered-plate NiCds). NiCds do suffer from voltage depression, which is similar to the memory effect, but only occurs when the batteries are overcharged.

====Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH)====
NiMH batteries can be looked at as a newer version of NiCd batteries.  NiMH batteries are often used in the same applications as NiCd batteries.  However, they last longer and don't have voltage depression as severe as NiCd batteries.

====Lead Acid====
Car and boat batteries are the most common forms of lead acid batteries.  In both uses they are typically rated for 12V.  They have a high current output and can severely injure a person who was to short the circuit.
===Memory effect===
The memory effect is a myth that states when the battery is not fully charged before it is recharged, it loses capacity, it &quot;forgets&quot; that it has the capacity.  The myth also states that the memory effect can sometimes be reversed by using a conditioner.  A battery conditioner almost completely discharges a battery (down to 1 volt in NiCds) and are designed to reverse voltage depression, not memory effect. the memory effect does not exist except in very old (1950 or earlier) sintered plate NiCds. There is no need to use a battery conditioner on any battery to reverse memory effect.

__NOEDITSECTION__

This is the CAT (cycle adjustment technique) method used by some.

== The CAT Method ==
By Daniel Love. &amp;copy;2004 '''Free for distribution in its entirety for non-profit groups'''. 

This technique is DEPENDANT upon a regular sleep-wake cycle and hence is perfect for those who have a fixed daily routine in the sense that bedtime and wake time fit a consistent structure. 

=== Stage 1 ===
The Cycle adjustment and intensive habit formation period.

Duration - 1 Week. 

The function of this stage is 3 fold: 
a) To develop a habitual response triggered by and focused in a specific time period.

b) To adjust the mind-body cycle to promote an increased biochemical tendency towards awareness at a specific time. 

c) Preparation for stage 2 of the technique. 

'''For the success of this method it is vital a strict adherence to the regime is followed.'''

Stage 1 is to last 7 days and in these 7 days you are to do the following: 

# Clearly define your regular bedtime (BT) and wake time (WT) and alter these only in accordance to these instructions.&lt;br /&gt;
# Adjust your regular wake time so that you shall be awakening 90 minutes earlier, this new time shall be referred to as the adjusted wake time (AWT.) Set your alarm to awaken you at the AWT for the duration of STAGE 1.&lt;br /&gt;
# Each night at BT clearly set the intention to awaken at the AWT and follow the task set for this period:&lt;br /&gt;
# Upon being awoken by your alarm at the AWT you are to get up and do whatever you wish for the next 90 minutes (you will NOT be returning to bed) HOWEVER whilst going about your business in these 90 minutes you shall perform a REALITY TEST every 2 to 5 minutes (use a reminder such as an electronic egg timer if this helps.)&lt;br /&gt;
# Once the 90 minutes are up (this is your regular WT) proceed with your day as usual. You can if you wish REALITY TEST throughout the day but this is entirely optional(but no doubt beneficial.)&lt;br /&gt;
# Repeat this task for the seven day period and then move to stage 2.&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see you are developing time specific reality tests and adjusting the time at which your body-mind &quot;gears up&quot; (increasing activity/chemicals in the various awareness centers to promote the required awareness for awakening.) 

Now we are ready for STAGE 2

{{Toplink}}
=== Stage 2 ===
Lucid dream induction period.&lt;br /&gt;
Duration: ongoing. 

The function of this stage is 8 fold.

d) Continue the time specific habitual response development.

e) Create a mild REM rebound effect to increase the Strength, Length and Clarity etc.. of the used REM period.

f) Induce lucid dreams.

g) Focus lucid dreams to occur in the longest REM period.

h) Fluctuate the sleep wake cycle.

i) Promote a bio-chemical tendency towards awareness within a specific REM period.

j) Perform the time specific habitual reality tests within REM.

k) Increase the likelihood of awakening directly from and remembering the Lucid Dream.

Stage 2 is an ongoing process, to be repeated daily. It is important not to miss any days practice. If the technique is to be used over long periods (several months) the occasional 'top up' of a repeat of Stage 1 may be required. If the technique is stopped for any reason, it is important upon re instigation to start again from stage 1.

Stage 2 is in two parts. Each day you are to alternate between Part A and Part B. That is to say: &lt;br /&gt;
On monday:part a - Tuesday:part b - wednesday part:a - Thursday part:b etc. etc. ad infinitum

==== Part A ====
This is simplicity in itself.

At bedtime clearly state the intention to follow your time specific habitual reality tests at the AWT.&lt;br /&gt;
HOWEVER set your alarm clock to awaken you at your REGULAR WT.

As far as your mind is concerned you have set the intention to awake at AWT and intensively reality test. You will however not be awoken by your alarm (as it is set for your regular WT) &lt;br /&gt;
Hopefully the following should occur:&lt;br /&gt;
The AWT arrives, your mind has geared up for awakening but receives no external cue (the alarm) so remains asleep - however, your body-mind clock is primed to increase awareness and perform its intensive reality tests at the AWT. This coupled with a mild REM rebound (from the earlier wake time of previous night) should result in a long period of REM in which your mind is set at increased activity AND in a time period that you have designated and installed as the habitual intensive reality test period.&lt;br /&gt;
A PRIME ENVIRONMENT FOR LUCIDITY TO OCCUR!

Alternatively you may awaken naturally at the AWT - if this occurs remain still, remind yourself of your intention to intensively reality test and attempt to induce a WILD with your preferred method.

==== Part B ====
This is identical in all respects the method outlined in stage 1. Simply awaken at the AWT perform intensive (every 2 to 5 minutes) reality tests for 90 minutes. The only difference is you only perform this on the 1day rather than the 7 - as tomorrow you shall return to stage 2 part A.

'''each day henceforth alternate between [[Lucid Dreaming/Appendices/CAT#Part A|Stage 2, Part A]] and [[Lucid Dreaming/Appendices/CAT#Part B|Stage 2, Part B]]'''

Due to the odd number of days in the week you will find that each consecutive week part a and part b shall fall on different days (one week Monday is A next week B etc..) Also you will notice within each fortnight one week shall contain 3 potential lucid dream periods whilst the other shall have 4.

And that's it. the CAT method. I do hope it is as useful to you as it has been for me. 

{{Toplink}}
=== One last thing ===
Occasionally you may like to extended your regular WT (such as at the weekend) and have a longer sleep. &lt;br /&gt;
Of course this is not possible if this falls on a PART B day (and potentially negative for the whole method) &lt;br /&gt;
However the occasional WT extension on a PART A day may allow for longer REM/Lucid dream periods. Even so it should still be kept to a minimum as to not upset the sleep wake cycle too often.

'''Vitamins''' are essential nutrients that must either be ingested or synthesised to maintain health. There are two main varieties: water-soluble and fat-soluble. Because some vitamins are only soluble in fat, a totally fat-free diet can be unhealthy.

*'''Vitamin A''' (also known as retinol) is a fat-soluble vitamin found in [[Cookbook:Dairy|dairy]] products and in [[Cookbook:Liver|liver]]. Excessive vitamin A can poison you. The body can create vitamin A as needed from beta-carotine , which is water-soluble and not dangerous (large amounts can turn your skin and eyes orange, though). You can get plenty of beta-carotine from [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]], and [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]. Vitamin A deficiency can affect the eyesight, so the popular belief that carrots help you see in the dark is not wholly false.
* The '''Vitamin B''' group of water-soluble vitamins contains a number of separate vitamins. An excess of these vitamins is not harmful.
** '''Vitamin B1''' (or thiamine) can be found in beef, pork, legumes, yeast, egg yolks, milk, green leafy vegetables, and many grains, nuts, and seeds. Deficiency can cause beriberi.
**'''Vitamin B2''' (or riboflavin) can be found in beef, dairy products, nuts, and green, leafy vegetables.
**'''Vitamnin B3''' (or niacin) can be found in fish and poultry meats, liver, nuts, seeds, legumes, and green, leafy vegetables. Deficiency can lead to pellagra.
*'''[[Metabolomics/Nutrition/Vitamin C|Vitamin C]]''' (or ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin found in [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] fruits and green vegetables. A deficiency can lead to scurvy. 
*'''Vitamin D''' (or calciferol) is a fat-soluble vitamin found in oily [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]].  With sufficient exposure to sunlight, most of the requirement can be met through the synthesis of vitamin D by the skin. 
*'''Vitamin E''' (or tocopherol) is a fat-soluble vitamin found in vegetable oils, nuts and green leafy vegetables.

Okay, so now you at least know how to read Indonesian. That's a great start!

Indonesian/Malay has a rhymic quality akin to Italian. And for long, native poets, scribes, and orators have had a penchant of creating sentences that rhyme with each other. Just like in English poetry, the rhyming makes extensive use of the many similar final-sounds of words. To prove my point, let me bring you the Rhyme Game.

== Rhyme Game ==

'''Objective''': 
# To practice your pronunciation of Indonesian through the rhyming pattern in the words
# To build up your vocabulary, obviously!

=== Kuku-kukuku kaku (My nails are stiff) ===

-ku (pronounced -COO) is not very common, but it does contain some important words!


{| border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''Word''
! ''Pronunciation''
! ''Meaning''
|-
| aku || uh-coo || I, me, my
|-
| buku || boo-coo || book
|-
| siku || see-coo || elbow
|}

Now that I've established the pattern, can you guess how to pronounce these words?


{| border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''Word''
! ''Meaning
|-
| baku || formal, conforming to the norm
|-
| duku
| a sweet, small indigenous fruit. Here's what it looks like! [http://www.sabah.gov.my/tani/bm/duku.htm]
|-
| kaku || stiff
|-
| kuku || nail (i.e. fingernail)
|-
| paku || nail (i.e. hammer the nail!)
|-
| pangku
| to lap (esp. placing sth over one's thighs)
|-
| saku || pocket
|-
| suku || tribe
|-
| tungku || stove
|}

=== Cinta itu buta (Love is blind) ===

Words ending with -ta (-TUH) are often related to love, and to umm... many other things!


{| border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''Word''
! ''Pronunciation''
! ''Meaning''
|-
| cinta || chin-tuh || ''n.'' love
|-
| buta || boo-tuh || blind
|-
| genta || gEn-tuh || bell
|-
| renta || rurn-tuh* || elderly (and frail)
|}

(*)the vowel sound in ren- is essentially a schwa, in contrast to gEn- in genta

Can you guess, based on what you've learned?


{| border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''Word''
! ''Meaning
|-
| bata || brick
|-
| beta || I, me, my (esp. in poetry)
|-
| cita || desire, obsession
|-
| data || data, duh!
|-
| dusta || ''n.'' lie
|-
| gita || song
|-
| harta || wealth, fortune
|-
| kata || word
|-
| kita || we, us, our (inclusive)
|-
| kusta || leprosy
|-
| lunta || to neglect
|-
| mata || eye
|-
| pita || ribbon
|-
| peta || map
|-
| pinta || to ask for sth, to request
|-
| rata || flat, plain, equal
|-
| sengketa || ''n.'' dispute
|-
| senjata || weapon
|-
| tata || to put things in order
|-
| unta || camel
|}

=== Tangkap ikan kakap! (Catch the Barramundi fish!) ===

When you catch and hold onto something, you say -kap (-CUP)! And when you let something be known, you should also say -kap!


{| border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''Word''
! ''Pronunciation''
! ''Meaning''
|-
| tangkap || tung-cup || to catch
|-
| dekap || dur-cup* || to hug, to embrace
|-
| ungkap || oong-cup || to tell (esp. to expose the truth)
|}

Here we go again!


{| border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''Word''
! ''Meaning
|-
| bekap
| to forcefully prevent so from speaking
|-
| cakap
| (1)''v.'' to talk, (2)''adj.'' skillful
|-
| kakap
| (1)''n.'' Barramundi fish, (2) ''adj.'' big, gargantuan
|-

|-
| perangkap || trap
|-
| rangkap || double
|-
| sekap || to detain
|-
| sikap || behavior
|-

|}

=== Other Tongue Twisters ===

If you're feeling especially game after your Indonesian phonetics lesson, have a go at the following tongue twisters:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''Indonesian''
! ''English''
|-
| Ular melingkar-lingkar di atas pagar bundar
| the snake does circles on top of the circular fence
|-
| Kuku-kuku kaki-kaki kakak-kakakku kaku-kaku
| the toe-nails of my older siblings are stiff
|}

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dolohov. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dolohov~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction to Nouns=

A noun in Latin is exactly like a noun in English - it is a person, place, thing, or idea.  For more information on what a noun is and what words are nouns look at &quot;[[Wikipedia:noun|noun]]&quot; at Wikipedia.  If something is a noun in English, then it is also a noun in Latin.

=Nouns in Latin=

Okay, now that we know that nouns are essentially the same part of speech in both English and Latin, what makes Latin nouns work?  Anytime that you see a noun in Latin, you will be able to tell a lot about the noun.  For example, if you were to see the noun ''mensam'' in a Latin text, you would know a number of things about it immediately.  We'll go into how you can tell these things in just a bit, but here's what you can learn from seeing the word.  First, the word is almost certainly feminine.  Second, it's probably the direct object of a sentence.  Third, its singular.

To compare that to English, let's look at the English word &quot;table&quot; (because that's what ''mensam'' means!)  We can see that it is singular, because the plural is &quot;tables.&quot;  But what else can we learn about the word?  It isn't necessarily a direct object--it could be a subject (The table is large), indirect object (I walked to the table), or direct object (He kicked the table).  Also, we don't know its gender because English doesn't use a gender system for nouns.  So, why are we able to see these things about Latin words?  We know them because Latin nouns &quot;decline&quot; - they change their endings to fit their usage.  ''Mensam'' and ''mensa'' both mean table, but they are used very differently. The difference in the '''form''' of a noun gives us information about the word.

When we talk about the form a word in Latin takes, we talk about its &quot;incidents&quot;.   English nouns typically only have one incident - number (singular vs plural). However, Latin nouns have three:

==Gender==

All nouns in Latin have gender.  This includes not only things which physically have gender (man, woman, boy, girl, mother, husband, etc.) but also inanimate objects like tables.  ''Mensa'' (table), for example, is feminine just like ''puella'' (girl).  Sometimes a thing (usually animals or words for people like &quot;student&quot; will have two different nouns, with one masculine and the other feminine.  ''Lupus'' is a male wolf while ''lupa'' is a female wolf.  ''Discipula'' is a female student while ''discipulus'' is a male student.

What really throws a wrench into this is that Latin does not have two genders.  It has three.  In addition to masculine and feminine, Latin also has the neuter gender (interestingly enough, this comes from the Latin ''neuter'' which means &quot;neither&quot;).  ''Crustulum'', a cookie, is a good example of a neuter noun.  One might ask, why is a table feminine while a cookie is neuter?  The simplest answer is:  because that's just the way it is.  Sometimes the gender of Latin nouns will make absolutely no sense.  At other times, it will.  It is best, however, to '''memorize the gender of each noun you learn'''.

==Case==

The next step in analyzing a Latin noun is its case.  The case of a noun determines its usage in a sentence.  Each noun can be put into any of the cases.   If you look above, you can see that you have already seen two different forms of the Latin word for &quot;table&quot;.  They are in different cases.  English for the most part does not use cases, but some pronouns show vestiges of a case system (&quot;who&quot; vs. &quot;whom&quot; vs. &quot;whose&quot; and &quot;they&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot; vs. &quot;their&quot;).   We take a fairly intuitive approach to learning those words in English, which is perhaps why so many people have problems with &quot;whom&quot;.  But in Latin, the case of a noun is extremely important.

The number of cases in Latin is generally considered to be six.  This leaves out the locative, which is used very rarely and only for a very limited number of nouns, so we'll leave it out for now as well.  We'll start off with the standard six - nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative.

{| border=1 bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| '''Case''' || '''Major Use''' || '''Latin Example''' || '''English Equivalent'''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Nominative || Subject || ''mensa'' || table
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Accusative || Direct Object || ''mensam'' || table
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Genitive || Possessive || ''mensae'' || of the table
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Dative || Indirect Object || ''mensae'' || to/for the table
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Ablative || Means or Manner || ''mensa'' || by/with the table
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Vocative || Direct address || ''mensa'' || o table!
|}

Note that all forms in the above chart are singular (we'll talk about number in just a bit).  You can see that sometimes a couple different cases will look the same.  This happens.  It is usually possible to determine the appropriate case from the context of a sentence (for instance, you could say &quot;I walked '''to''' the table&quot; but wouldn't say &quot;I walked '''of''' the table&quot;).

Each noun belongs to a group called a &quot;declension&quot; - all of the nouns in a declension have similar sets of endings.  For example, ''mensa'' is a first declension noun.  All of the other first declension nouns are going to have similar endings.  Let's take a look at ''mensa'' alongside ''puella''.

{| border=1 bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| '''Case''' || '''&quot;Table&quot;''' || '''&quot;Girl&quot;'''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Nominative || ''mensa'' || ''puella''
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Vocative || ''mensam'' || ''puellam''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
 Accusative|| ''mensae'' || ''puellae''
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBBGenetive || ''mensae'' || ''puellae''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
Dative || ''mensa'' || ''puella''
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Ablative || ''mensa'' || ''puella''
|}

We'll explore each of the cases and each of the declensions later.

==Number==

This should be fairly familiar to everyone (well, except perhaps speakers of Japanese and some other languages, whose nouns do not distinguish between singular and plural).  Number refers only to whether a noun is singular (there's only one of it) or plural (there's more than one).  Let's take a look at our table again.  In English, we can easily see the difference between &quot;table&quot; and &quot;tables&quot; by the ending.  Latin is the same.  In the accusative case, ''mensam'' is singular (&quot;table&quot;) while ''mensas'' is plural (tables).  The ending is determined by the number.  However, this can create even more confusion.  For example, you can see by the chart above (which shows singular forms) that ''mensae'' can be either the genitive singular or dative singular.  But guess what?  ''Mensae'' can also be the nominative or vocative plural!  

Obviously, we need a new chart that covers number as well as case.

{| border=1 bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| '''Case''' || '''Singular''' || '''Plural'''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Nominative || ''mensa'' || ''mensae''
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Accusative || ''mensam'' || ''mensas''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Genitive || ''mensae'' || ''mensarum''
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Dative || ''mensae'' || ''mensis''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Ablative || ''mensa'' || ''mensis''
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Vocative || ''mensa'' || ''mensae''
|}

You can see that ''mensae'' appears four times, ''mensa'' appears three times, and ''mensis'' appears twice.  Again, context is necessary in determining which case and number a noun will be in.

==Dictionary form of a noun==

The dictionary form of a noun includes three things.
# Nominative singular - This is basically the name of a noun - &quot;nominative&quot; derives from the Latin word ''nomen'' which means &quot;name&quot; (''nomen'', by the way, is in the nominative singular!)
# Genitive singular - The genitive singular is often the easiest to find the stem of the noun from.  The stem is the base from which endings are added.
# Gender - Because nouns are always a certain gender, this is something that does not change.  Gender is especially important when adjectives are used (more on adjectives later).  It is usually abbreviated (m/f/n)

So, if we wanted to look up &quot;table&quot; in our handy Latin-to-English dictionary, we would look under:

'''mensa''', '''mensae''', ''f''.

=Summary=

Now you have a working knowledge of what constitutes a Latin noun.  You know that each noun belongs to one the five declensions and one of the three genders.  You know what the six cases are.  You're ready to go onto the next chapter and learn about the first declension and the nominative and accusative cases.

[[Image:Pfeffer-Gewürz.jpg|thumb|right|Green, white and black peppercorns]]

This article pertains to black, green and white pepper berries (''Piper nigrum''), also known as peppercorns when dried. Other plants/ingredients commonly known as '''pepper''' include:
*the [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]] (including the [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]), and
*several Asian spices including 'pink' peppercorns and [[Cookbook:Szechuan Pepper|Szechuan pepper]].

The black, white and green peppers are actually the same berries harvested and processed at different stages of ripeness. They are very similar in flavour and texture, with the main difference being the colour. They are commonly used in Western cooking as seasoning.

The pepper berry is one of the most common spices in European cuisine, having been known and prized since antiquity due to its strong flavour. It is said that Alaric the Visigoth demanded from Rome a ransom of gold, silver, and pepper.

==Black Pepper==

Black pepper is a seasoning produced from the [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]], dried, unripe red berries of the plant Piper nigrum. (The same fruit, when unripe green, can be dried, or preserved in brine or vinegar, to make green peppercorns; or when ripe, dried and dehusked to make white peppercorns.)

Ground black pepper may be found on nearly every dinner table in some parts of the world, accompanied by its constant companion salt.

==Cooking with Pepper==

Black pepper is generally used when you want it to show up in the dish (especially in a whole or 'cracked' form) and white pepper when you do not want it visible in the finished product.

Pepper added at the beginning of a recipe makes the whole recipe taste peppery. When added at the end of a recipe parts of the recipe taste peppery and other parts don't because the pepper won't be evenly distributed among the food.

Grinding pepper releases flavorful volatile oils that evaporate after time, so the full flavor of pepper is obtained when it freshly ground onto food at the end of cooking or after serving.

In previous chapters, we have learned how to generate HTML documents from XML documents and XSL stylesheets. In this chapter, we will learn how to convert those HTML documents into valid XHTML. We will discuss why XHTML has evolved as a standard and when it should be used.

==The Evolution of XHTML==
Originally, Web pages were designed in HTML. Unfortunately most implementations of this markup language allow all sorts of mistakes and bad formatting. Major browsers were designed to be forgiving, and poor code would display with few problems in most cases. This poor code was often not portable between browsers, e.g. a page would render in Netscape but not Internet Explorer or vice versa. The accounting for human error and bad formatting takes an amount of processing power that small handheld devices might not have. Thus when displaying data on handhelds, a tiny mistake can crash the device. 

XHTML partially mitigates these problems. The processing burden is reduced by requiring XHTML documents to conform to the much stricter rules defined in XML. Aside from the stricter rules, HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 are functionally equivalent. If a document breaks XML's well-formedness rules, an XHTML-compliant browser must not render the page. If a document is well-formed but invalid, an XHTML-compliant browser may render the page, so a significant number of mistakes still slip through.

In this chapter, we will examine in detail how to create an XHTML document.

The biggest problem with HTML from a design standpoint is that it was never meant to be a graphical design language. The original version of HTML was intended to structure human readable content (e.g. marking a section of text as a paragraph), not to format it (e.g. this paragraph should be displayed in 14pt Arial). HTML has evolved far past its original purpose and is being stretched and manipulated to cover cases that the original HTML designers never imagined.

The recommended solution is to use a separate language to describe the presentation of a group of documents. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used for describing presentation. From version 1.1 of XHTML upwards web pages must be formatted using CSS or a language with equivalent capabilites such as XSLT (XSL Transformations). The use of CSS or XSLT is optional in XHTML 1.0 unless the strict variant is used. HTML 4.01 supports CSS but not XSLT.

==So What is XHTML?==
As you might have guessed, XHTML stands for eXtensible HyperText Markup Language. It is a cross between HTML and XML. It fulfills two major purposes that were ignored by HTML:
# XHTML is a stricter standard than HTML. XHTML documents must be well-formed just like regular XML. This reduces vagaries and inconsistency between browsers, because browsers do not have to decide how to display a badly-formed page. Malformed XHTML is not allowed.&lt;br&gt;'''Note 1:''' Browsers only enforce well-formedness if the [[#MIME Types|MIME type]] is set to &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt;. If the MIME type is set to &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;, the browser will allow badly-formed documents. There are a large number of 'XHTML' documents on the web that are badly-formed and get away with it because their MIME type is &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;'''Note 2:''' Browsers are not required to check for validity. See [[#Invalid XHTML|Invalid XHTML]] below for an example.
# XHTML allows for modularization (''m12n''). For different environments different element and attribute subsets can be defined.

The best thing about XHTML is that it is almost the same as HTML! If you know how to write an HTML document, it will be very simple for you to create an XHTML document without too much trouble. The biggest thing that you must keep in mind is that unlike with HTML, where simple errors like missing a closing tag are ignored by the browser, XHTML code must be written according to an exact specification. We will see later that adhering to these strict specifications actually allows XHTML to be more flexible than HTML.

== XHTML Document Structure ==
At a minimum, an XHTML document must contain a DOCTYPE declaration and four elements: html, head, title, and body:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE ... &gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The opening &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; tag of an XHTML document must include a namespace declaration for the XHTML namespace.

The DOCTYPE declaration should appear immediately before the html tag in an XHTML document. It can follow one of three formats.
===XHTML 1.0 Strict===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html
 PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The Strict declaration is the least forgiving. This is the preferred DOCTYPE for new documents. Strict documents tend to be streamlined and clean. All formatting will appear in [[../CSS|Cascading Style Sheets]] rather than the document itself. Elements that should be included in the Cascading Style Sheet and not the document itself include, but are not limited to: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;, &lt;u&gt;nderline&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;b&gt;old&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;talics&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;font color=&quot;#9900FF&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

There are also certain instances where your code needs to be nested within block elements. 
'''Incorrect Example:''' &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that you enjoy&lt;/p&gt; your stay.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
'''Correct Example:''' &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that you enjoy your stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

===XHTML 1.0 Transitional===
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html
 PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This declaration is intended as a halfway house for migrating legacy HTML documents to XHTML 1.0 Strict. 
The [http://w3.org/ W3C] encourages authors to use the Strict DOCTYPE for new documents. (The [http://www.w3.org/TR/html/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD] refers readers to the relevant note in the [http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/loosedtd.html HTML4.01 Transitional DTD].)

This DOCTYPE does not require CSS for formatting; although, it is recommended. It generally tolerates inline elements found where block-level elements are expected.

There are a couple of reasons why you might choose this DOCTYPE for new documents.
* You require backwards compatibility with browsers that support the formatting elements of XHTML but do not support CSS. This is a very small fraction of general users (less than 1%). Many browsers that don't support CSS don't support HTML 4.0 or XHTML either. However, it may be useful on a corporate intranet that has a larger than normal fraction of very old (pre-2000) browsers.
* You need to link to frames. Using frames is discouraged as they work badly in many browsers.

===XHTML 1.0 Frameset===
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html
 PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN&quot;
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
If you are creating a page with frames, this declaration is appropriate. However, since frames are generally discouraged when designing Web pages, this declaration should be used rarely.

===XML Prolog===
Additionally, XHTML authors are encouraged by the W3C to include the following processing instruction as the first line of each document: 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Although it is recommended by the standard, this processing instruction may cause errors in older Web browsers including Internet Explorer version 6. It is up to the individual author to decide whether to include the prolog.

==Language==
It is good practice to include the optional &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; attribute [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-lang-tag] on the html element to describe the document's primary language. For compatibility with HTML the &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; attribute should also be specified with the same value. For an English language document use:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; attributes can also be specified on other elements to indicate changes of language within the document, e.g. a French quotation in an English document.

== Converting HTML to XHTML ==
In this section, we will discover how to transform an HTML document into an XHTML document. We will examine each of the following rules:
* Documents must be well-formed 
** Tags must be properly nested
** Elements must be closed
* Tags must be lowercase
* Attribute names must be lowercase
* Attribute values must be quoted
* Attributes cannot be minimized
* The name attribute is replaced with the id attribute (in XHTML 1.0 both name and id should be used with the same value to maintain backwards-compatibility).
* Plain ampersands are not allowed
* Scripts and CSS must be escaped(enclose them within the tags &lt;![CDATA[ and ]]&gt;) or preferably moved into external files.

===Documents must be well-formed===
Because XHTML conforms to all XML standards, an XHTML document must be well-formed according to the W3C's recommendations for an XML document. Several of the rules here reemphasize this point. We will consider both incorrect and correct examples.

====Tags must be properly nested====
Browsers widely tolerate badly nested tags in HTML documents.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;
This text is probably bold and underlined, but inside incorrectly nested tags.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The text above would display as bold and underlined, even though the end tags are not in the proper order. An XHTML page will not display if the tags are improperly nested, because it would not be considered a valid XML document. The problem can be easily fixed. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;
This text is bold and underlined and inside properly nested tags.
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Elements must be closed====
Again, XHTML documents must be considered valid XML documents. For this reason, all tags must be closed. HTML specifications listed some tags as having &quot;optional&quot; end tags, such as the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list:
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Item 1
   &lt;li&gt;Item 2
   &lt;li&gt;Item 3
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In XHTML, the end tags must be included. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
What should we do about HTML tags that do not have a closing tag? Some special tags do not require or imply a closing tag. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;titlebar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Title&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my web page!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In XHTML, the XML rule of including a closing slash within the tag must be followed. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;titlebar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;title&quot; /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my Web page!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Note that some of today's browsers will incorrectly render a page if the closing slash does not have a space before it (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;). Although it is not part of the official recommendation, you should always include the space (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) for compatibility purposes.

Here are the common empty tags in HTML:
* area
* base
* basefont
* br
* hr
* img 
* input
* link
* meta
* param

===Tags must be lowercase===
In HTML, tags could be written in either lowercase or uppercase. In fact, some Web authors preferred to write tags in uppercase to make them easier to read. XHTML requires that all tags be lowercase.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;This is an example of bad case.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This difference is necessary because XML differentiates between cases. XML would read &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;H1&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; as different tags, causing problems in the above example. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is an example of good case.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The problem can be easily fixed by changing all tags to lowercase.

===Attribute names must be lowercase===
Following the pattern of writing all tags in lowercase, all attribute names must also be in lowercase. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;p CLASS=&quot;specialText&quot;&gt;Important Notice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The correct tags are easy to create. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;specialText&quot;&gt;Important Notice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Attribute values must be quoted===
Some HTML values do not require quotation marks around them. They are understood by browsers. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;table border=1 width=100%&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
XHTML requires all attributes to be quoted. Even numeric, percentage, and hexadecimal values must appear in quotations for them to be considered part of a proper XHTML document. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;  width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Attributes cannot be minimized===
HTML allowed some attributes to be written in shorthand, such as selected or noresize. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
   &lt;input checked ... /&gt;
   &lt;input disabled ... /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
When using XHTML, attribute minimization is forbidden. Instead, use the syntax &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;x=&quot;x&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, where x is the attribute that was formerly minimized. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
   &lt;input checked=&quot;checked&quot;  .../&gt;
   &lt;input disabled=&quot;disabled&quot;  .../&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
A complete list of minimized attributes follows:
*checked
*compact
*declare
*defer
*disabled
*ismap
*nohref
*noresize
*noshade
*nowrap
*readonly
*selected
*multiple

===The &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute is replaced with the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attribute===
HTML 4.01 standards define a name attribute for the tags &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;a, applet, frame, iframe, img,&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;map&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;banner.gif&quot; name=&quot;mybanner&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
XHTML has deprecated the name attribute. Instead, the id attribute is used. However, to ensure backwards compatibility with today's browsers, it is best to use both the name and id attributes.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;anchor&quot; id=&quot;anchor&quot; &gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;banner.gif&quot; name=&quot;mybanner&quot; id=&quot;mybanner&quot;  /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
As technology advances, it will eventually be unnecessary to use both attributes and XHTML 1.1 removed name altogether.

===Ampersands are not supported===
Ampersands are illegal in XHTML. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;home.aspx?status=done&amp;amp;itWorked=false&quot;&gt;Home &amp;amp; Garden&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
They must instead be replaced with the equivalent character code &amp;amp;amp;. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;home.aspx?status=done&amp;amp;amp;itWorked=false&quot;&gt;Home &amp;amp;amp; Garden&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Image alt attributes are mandatory===
Because XHTML is designed to be viewed on different types of devices, some of which are not image-capable, alt attributes must be included for all images. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;titlebar.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Remember that the img tag must include a closing slash in XHTML! 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;titlebar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;title&quot;  /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Scripts and CSS must be escaped===
Internal scripts and CSS often include characters like the ampersand and less-than characters. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
   &lt;!--
      document.write('Hello World!'); 
   //--&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
If you are using internal scripts or CSS, enclose them within the tags &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. This will mark them as character data that should not be parsed. If you do not use these tags, characters like &amp;amp; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; will be treated as start-of-character entities (like &amp;amp;nbsp;) and tags (like &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) respectively. This will cause your page to behave unpredictably, and it may invalidate your code.

Additionally, the type attribute is mandatory for scripts. The comment tags &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; that have traditionally been used to hide JavaScript from noncompliant browsers should not be included. The XML standard states that text enclosed in comment tags may be completely excluded from rendered documents, which would lose all script enclosed in the tags. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
/*&lt;![CDATA[*/
   document.write('Hello World!');
/*]]&gt;*/
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Also &lt;code&gt;document.write();&lt;/code&gt; is not permitted in XHTML documents. You must used node creation methods such as &lt;code&gt;document.createElementNS();&lt;/code&gt; instead. Confusingly, &lt;code&gt;document.write();&lt;/code&gt; will appear to work as expected if the document is incorrectly served with a MIME type of &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; (the type for HTML documents), instead of &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt; (the type for XHTML documents). If the MIME type is &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; the document will be parsed as HTML which allows &lt;code&gt;document.write();&lt;/code&gt;. Parsing the document as HTML defeats the purpose of writing it in XHTML.

Similar changes must be made for internal stylesheets. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
&lt;!--
   .SpecialClass {
      color: #000000;
   }
--&gt;
&lt;/style&gt; 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The type attribute must be included, and the CDATA tags should be used. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
/*&lt;![CDATA[*/
   .SpecialClass {
      color: #000000;
   }
/*]]&gt;*/
&lt;/style&gt; 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Because scripts and CSS may complicate an XHTML document, it is strongly recommended that they be placed in external .js and .css files, respectively. They can then be linked to from your XHTML document. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;myscript.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; /&gt;

&lt;link href=&quot;styles.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Some elements may not be nested===
The W3C recommendations state that certain elements may not be contained within others in an XHTML document, even when no XML rules are violated by the inclusion. Elements affected are listed below.
{|align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!Element!!Cannot contain ...
|-
|a||a
|-
|pre||big, img, object, small, sub, sup
|-
|button||button, fieldset, form, iframe, input, isindex, label, select, textarea
|-
|label||label
|-
|form||form
|}

== When to convert ==

By now, it probably sounds as though converting an HTML document into XHTML is easy, but tedious. When would you want to convert your existing pages into XHTML? Before deciding to change your entire Web site, consider these questions.

* '''Do you want your pages to be easily viewed over a nontraditional Internet-capable device, such as a PDA or Web-enabled telephone? Will this be a goal of your site in the future?''' XHTML is the language of choice for Web-enabled portable devices. Now may be a good time for you to commit to creating an all-XHTML site.
* '''Do you plan to work with XML in the future?''' If so, XHTML may be a logical place to begin. If you head up a team of designers who are accustomed to using HTML, XHTML is a small step away. It may be less intimidating for beginners to learn XHTML than it is to try teaching them all about XML from scratch.
* '''Is it important that your site be current with the most recent W3C standards?''' Staying on top of current standards will make your site more stable and help you stay updated in the future, as you will only have to make small changes to upgrade your site to the newest versions of XHTML as they are approved by the W3C.
* '''Will you need to convert your documents to another format?''' As a valid XML document, XHTML can utilize XSL to be converted into text, plain HTML, another XHTML document, or another XML document. HTML cannot be used for this purpose.

If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then you should probably convert your Web site to XHTML.

=== MIME Types ===

XHTML 1.0 documents should be served with a [[wikipedia:MIME#Content-Type|MIME Type]] of &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt; to Web browsers that can accept this type. XHTML 1.0 may be served with the MIME type &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; to clients that cannot accept &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt; provided that the XHTML complies with the additional constraints in [[http://www.w3.org/TR/html/#guidelines Appendix C]] of the XHTML 1.0 specification. If you cannot configure your Web server to serve documents as different MIME types, you probably should not convert your Web site to XHTML.

You should check that your XHTML documents are served correctly to browsers that support &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. Mozilla Firefox. Use 'Page Info' to verify that the type is correct.

XHTML 1.1 documents are often not backwards compatible with HTML and should not be served with a MIME type of &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;.[http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/#summary]

=== HTML Tidy ===

When creating HTML, it's very easy to make a mistake by leaving out an end tag or not properly nesting tags.  HTML Tidy is a wonderful application that can be used to correct a number of errors with poorly formed HTML documents and convert it into XHTML.  Tidy can also format ugly code to be more readable, including code generated by WYSIWYG editors.  HTML Tidy can't generate clean code when it encounters problems it isn't sure of how to fix.  In these cases, it will generate an error to let you know where the mistake is located in your document.

A few examples of problems that HTML Tidy can remedy:
* Missing or mismatched end tags.
* Improperly nested elements.
* Mixed up tags.
* Add a missing &quot;/&quot; to properly close tags.
* Insert missing tags into lists.
* Add missing quotes around attribute values.
* Ability to insert the correct DOCTYPE value based on your code (can also recognize and report proprietary elements).

HTML Tidy can also be customized at runtime using a wide array of command line arguments.  It is capable of indenting code to make it more readable as well as replacing FONT, NOBR, and CENTER tags with style tags and rules using CSS.  Tidy can also be taught new tags by declaring them in the configuration file.

You can read more about HTML Tidy at the W3C's [http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ HTML Tidy] site, as well as download the application as a binary or get the source code.  There are several sites that offer HTML Tidy as an online service including the [http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy W3C] and [http://valet.htmlhelp.com/tidy/ Site Valet].

You can also validate your page using the validator available at http://validator.w3.org/.

== When not to convert ==

You shouldn't convert your Web pages if they will always be served with a MIME type of &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt;. Make sure you know how to configure your server or server-side script to perform HTTP content negotiation so that XHTML capable browsers receive XHTML marked as &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt;. If you can't set up content negotiation, stick to HTML 4.01. People viewing your Web pages with mainstream browsers will be unable to tell the difference between a '''valid''' HTML 4.01 web page and a '''valid''' XHTML 1.0 Web page.

Make sure the automated tests you run on your site simulate connections from both XHTML-compatible browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox, and non&amp;#8211;XHTML-compatiable browsers, e.g. Internet Explorer 6.0. This is particularly important if you use Javascript on your Web site. If maintaining two copies of your test suite is too time consuming, don't convert.

Bear in mind that valid HTML 4.01 Strict documents generally require less effort to convert to XHTML 1.1 than valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional documents. A valid HTML 4.01 Strict document can only contain elements that are valid in XHTML 1.1, although a few attributes may need changing. XHTML 1.0 Transitional documents on the other hand can contain ten element types and more than a dozen attributes that are not valid in XHTML 1.1. The XHTML 1.0 Transitional &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element alone has six atrributes that are not supported in XHTML 1.1.

Don't be pressured into using XHTML by people talking vaguely about ''bad practice''. Pin them down to what they mean by ''bad practice''. If they start talking about separation of content and presentation, they have confused the differences between HTML and XHTML with the differences between the Transitional and Strict doctypes. Both XHTML 1.0 Transitional and HTML 4.01 Transitional allow you to mix presentation and content in the same document, i.e. they allow this type of bad practice. Both HTML 4.01 Strict and XHTML 1.0 Strict force you to move the bulk of the presentation (but not all of it) in to CSS or an equivalent language. All four doctypes allow you to use embedded stylesheets, whereas, true separation requires that all CSS and Javascript be moved to external files.

== XHTML 1.1  ==

XHTML 1.0 is a suitable markup language for most purposes. It provides the option to separate content and presentation, which fits the needs of most Web authors. XHTML 1.1 enforces the separation of content and presentation. All deprecated elements and attributes have been removed. It also removes two attributes that were retained in XHTML 1.0 purely for backwards-compatibility. The &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; attribute is replaced by &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is replaced by &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;. Finally it adds support for ruby text found in East Asian documents.

=== DOCTYPE ===

The DOCTYPE for XHTML 1.1 is:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Modularization ===

The modularization of XHTML, or XHTML m12n, provides suggestions for customizing XHTML, either by integrating subsets of XHTML into other XML applications or extending the XHTML element set. The framework defines two proceses:

* How to group elements and attributes into &quot;modules&quot;
* How to combine modules to create new markup languages

The resulting languages, which the W3C calls &quot;XHTML Host Languages&quot;, are based on the familiar XHTML structure but specialized for specific purposes. XHTML 1.1 is an example of a host language. It was created by grouping the different elements available to XHTML.

XHTML variations, while possible in theory, have not been widely adopted. There is continuing work being done to develop host languages, but their details are beyond the scope of this discussion.

== Invalid XHTML ==

XHTML-compliant browsers are allowed to render invalid XHTML documents provded that the documents are well-formed. A simple example is given below:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; 
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Invalid XHTML&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt; 
  &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;This sentence contains a &lt;p&gt;nested paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Save the example as &lt;code&gt;invalid.xhtml&lt;/code&gt; (the .xhtml extension is important) and open the page with Mozilla Firefox. The page will render even though it is invalid.

 

==Summary==
{| style=&quot;background:linen; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 100%;&quot;

| 
XHTML stands for eXtensible HyperText Markup Language. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but it is stricter and easier to parse. XHTML documents must be well-formed just like regular XML. XHTML allows for modularization. XHTML code must be written according to an exact specification unlike with HTML, where simple errors like missing a closing tag are ignored by the browser.  Adhering to these strict specifications actually allows XHTML to be more flexible than HTML. The benefits described in this summary are only gained if the MIME type of the document is &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt;. XHTML documents can be validated but most browsers choose not to.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=First Declension=

The first declension is a group of Latin nouns with the same endings.  It is the most regular of the five declensions, in that the twelve endings (6 cases X 2 numbers) are always exactly the same.  All you need to do is find the stem.  Most first declension nouns are feminine, though a few notable exceptions are masculine.

==Case Endings==

We've already seen the first declension in the charts in the introduction to nouns, but let's take a closer look now.

First, the singular:

{| border=1 bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| '''Case''' || '''&quot;Table&quot;''' || '''&quot;Girl&quot;''' || '''Ending'''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Nominative || ''mensa'' || ''puella'' || -a
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Genitive || ''mensae'' || ''puellae'' || -ae
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Dative || ''mensae'' || ''puellae'' || -ae
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Accusative || ''mensam'' || ''puellam'' || -am
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Ablative || ''mensa'' || ''puella'' || -a
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Vocative || ''mensa'' || ''puella'' || -a
|}

Now, the plural:

{| border=1 bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| '''Case''' || '''&quot;Table&quot;''' || '''&quot;Girl&quot;''' || '''Ending'''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Nominative || ''mensae'' || ''puellae'' || -ae
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Genitive || ''mensarum'' || ''puellarum'' || -arum
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Dative || ''mensis'' || ''puellis'' || -is
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB 
| Accusative || ''mensas'' || ''puellas'' || -as
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Ablative || ''mensis'' || ''puellis'' || -is
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Vocative || ''mensae'' || ''puellae'' || -ae
|}

You will have to memorize these endings; you should do this now.  Memorize all twelve endings even though this lesson will only use four (nominative singular, nominative plural, accusative singular, accusative plural).

==Finding the Stem==

How do we determine what the stem (i.e., the part before the ending that remains the same in each case) is and what the ending is?  Well, we go back to the dictionary entry that we learn for each word.  First, we need to check to see if we have a first declension noun.  If the nominative singular ends in ''-a'' and the genitive singular ends in ''-ae'', we have a first declension noun.  

: '''mensa, mensae''', ''f''.  Table.
: '''puella, puellae''', ''f''.  Girl.

Note how both of those words have the endings that we just said were marks of the first declension nouns.  Knowing that ''-ae'' is the ending for the genitive singular, all we need to do is delete that ending from the word.  So, ''mensae'' loses the ''-ae'' and becomes ''mens-''.  That is what is known as the stem of the word.  You can add the necessary ending for whatever case and number is needed to that stem.  So, if you want an ablative plural (case ending ''-is''), you would just add that ending to ''mens-'' to get ''mensis''.

==Dictionary Convention==

Often, dictionaries will shorten the entry by just printing the genitive singular '''ending''' instead of the entire genitive singular.  So, &quot;table&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; will appear as:

: '''mensa, -ae''', ''f''.  Table.
: '''puella, -ae''', ''f''.  Girl.

If you see the ''-ae'' notation in an entry, it is clear that the word is a first declension noun.

=Nominative Case=

The nominative, or &quot;name&quot; from the Latin ''nomen'', case is almost always used for the subject of a sentence.  For instance, in the sentence &quot;Julia gives&quot; the subject is Julia &lt;small&gt;(what she gives and to whom she's giving it, we don't know)&lt;/small&gt;.  She's the one doing the action.  So, if the sentence were in Latin, Julia would have to be in the nominative case.  Even in a more complex sentence such as &quot;Julia hesitantly decided that it would be a wonderful idea to destroy the table by repeatedly kicking it&quot;, we can still find the subject fairly easily.  It's still Julia doing the action.

Now, we're not even going to try translating that second sentence into Latin quite yet.  But, we know most of what we need to know to translate the first one.  First, we need to know how to say Julia in Latin.  Luckily for us, many women's names were treated as first declension nouns in Latin, so:

: '''Julia, -ae''', ''f''.  Julia.

Julia has a stem of ''Juli-'' and in the nominative singular (nominative because Julia's the subject, singular because there's only one Julia) the ending is ''-a''.  Therefore, we have ''Julia''.  

==&quot;Julia gives&quot;==

We haven't learned any verbs yet and there is a lot to learn about verbs before they can be used well, but for our purpose right now we will just say that '''dat''' means &quot;gives&quot;.  So, if we want to say &quot;Julia gives&quot;, the sentence in Latin is:

: ''Julia dat''.

Your first Latin sentence!  Pretty simple, huh?  Well, let's add on to it.

=Accusative Case=

The accusative case is often the direct object of a sentence.  Take this sentence:  &quot;The boy reads a book.&quot;  We know from our discussion on the nominative case that &quot;the boy&quot; is the subject.  &quot;Reads&quot; is our verb, so the boy is reading something.  The answer to the question &quot;What is the boy reading?&quot; is the direct object.  In this case, the boy is reading a &quot;book&quot;.  &quot;Book&quot;, then, is our direct object and would be in the accusative case in Latin.

==&quot;Julia gives a table&quot;==

So, going back to our earlier sentence with Julia, let's pick something for Julia to give.  Maybe Julia has a lot of tables and wants to get rid of one.  We still don't know who is going to get this table, but we can say &quot;Julia gives a table.&quot;  Recall that table is:

: '''mensa, -ae''', ''f''.  Table.

So, knowing that the stem of the word is ''mens-'' and the accusative single ending is ''-am'', the table that Julia gives would be '''mensam'''.  Because the article &quot;a&quot; from &quot;'''a''' table&quot; does not translate into Latin, we know all three of the words we need for our short sentence (''dat'', ''Julia'', and ''mensam'').  But what order do they go in?  In all actuality, the words could go in any order and you would be able to translate the sentence, because the case of each of the nouns tells you what its usage is.  So, even if we said, &quot;''Mensam dat Julia.''&quot;, you would know that the table cannot be the subject.

In actual Latin, the most common sentence structure is nominative-accusative-verb.  Compare this to English subject-verb-object.  So, if we use the Latin word order, we get:

: ''Julia mensam dat''.  
: Julia gives a table.

Note that if we decide Julia has to get rid of more than one table, we could say:

: ''Julia mensas dat''.  
: Julia gives tables.

The Accusative Case is:
:Singular  Plural
 f.-am     -as
  m.-us    -os
  n.-um    -a

==&quot;The table gives Julia&quot;==

If we wanted to turn the tables (excuse the pun) and say that the table gives Julia (completely nonsensical, I know, but grammatically correct), we would have to put &quot;Julia&quot; in the accusative (''Juli-am'') and &quot;table&quot; in the nominative (''mens-a'').  Then, we would get:

''Mensa Juliam dat''.  The table gives Julia.

=Vocab=

So far we've learned:

: '''mensa, -ae''', ''f''.  table
: '''puella, -ae''', ''f''.  girl
: '''Julia, -ae''', ''f''.  Julia

Let's add a couple more.  Make sure you memorize the three above as well as these two following.

: '''sapientia, -ae''', ''f''.  wisdom
: '''poeta, -ae''', ''m''.  poet

Wait a minute!  Take a look at &quot;poet&quot; again.  See something odd?  It's not feminine!  Poet is one of the few first declension nouns that are '''masculine'''.  You don't really need to worry about that too much quite yet, because it does not affect how the noun is used.  Later, when we get into adjectives and other things, you will need to know what each noun's gender is.  For now, use ''poeta'' like you would any of the others and just keep its masculinity in the back of your mind.

=Exercises=

With those vocab words and translating ''dat'' as &quot;gives&quot; and ''amat'' as &quot;loves&quot;, translate the following sentences.

# ''Poeta sapientiam dat''.
# ''Poeta puellas amat''.
# ''Julia poetas amat''.
# ''Sapientia mensas dat''.
# ''Puella Juliam amat''.

=Summary=

Congratulations!  You now know four common nouns and one name!  You know the case endings for '''every single''' first declension word, so that even if you come across one that you've never seen before, you will know what case and number it has. You know how to use the nominative as the subject of a sentence, and how to use the accusative as the direct object.

In other words, you're ready to start learning some verbs.  The next chapter, an introduction to verbs, will teach you the basics of Latin verbs.

&lt;/center&gt;

==Answer==

1.Change the HTML document below into an XHTML document conforming to the W3C's ''transitional'' standard. Validate your page using the validator available at http://validator.w3.org/.
&lt;br&gt;
== Exercise 1 ==

Below is an example of an invalid HTML document that contains a number of deprecated features. It is also badly structured. The document needs converting to XHTML with the content separated from the presentation.

=== Exercise 1.a. ===

a. Change the HTML document into a valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional document. Validate your page using the validator available at http://validator.w3.org/.

The XHTML 1.0 Transitional document:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; 
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Convert HTML to XHTML&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;XHTML page&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is important for your site to be current with the
        most recent W3C standards.&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;u&gt;Welcome&lt;/u&gt; to my &lt;b&gt;page&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
    I hope that you &lt;i&gt;enjoy&lt;/i&gt; your stay.
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;font color=&quot;#9900FF&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;
        XHTML is similar to HTML
      &lt;/font&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org&quot;&gt;Validator&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Exercise 1.b. ===

b. Starting with the model answer for question 1.a. identify all deprecated elements and attributes in the document and replace them with CSS in a linked external stylesheet. See [[HyperText Markup Language/Tag List]] for details of deprecated elements.

The deprecated features are:
* the &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element;
* the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; element; and
* the &lt;code&gt;font&lt;/code&gt;.

A possible stylesheet is:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
body {
  color:blue
}

span#welcome {
  text-decoration:underline
 /* It is generally a bad idea to underline anything other than hyperlinks. */
}

p.highlight {
  color:#9900FF;
  font-size:150%;
  font-family:Arial,sans-serif
  /* It is good practice to include one as the CSS generic font families,
     e.g. sans-serif, as an alternative.
  */
}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The document with deprecated features removed &amp;#8211; note the use of the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; attributes to provide hooks for the CSS selectors.
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; 
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Convert HTML to XHTML&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;XHTML page&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is important for your site to be current with the
        most recent W3C standards.&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;span id=&quot;welcome&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt; to my &lt;b&gt;page&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
    I hope that you &lt;i&gt;enjoy&lt;/i&gt; your stay.
    &lt;p class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;XHTML is similar to HTML&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org&quot;&gt;Validator&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Exercise 1.c. ===

c. Starting with the model answer for question 1.b. replace all presentational markup with semantic markup and ensure that all inline elements are contained in block-level elements. Change the DOCTYPE to XHTML 1.0 Strict and validate the page with the W3C Markup Validation Service.

The presentational elements are:
* &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt;

The 'paragraph' beginning with a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; element is a mixture of inline elements and text and so should be contained in a block-level element such as &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; (paragraph).

The &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; (anchor) element is inline and needs enclosing in a block-level element.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; 
 &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Convert HTML to XHTML&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;XHTML page&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is important for your site to be current
        with the most recent W3C standards.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;welcome&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt; to my &lt;strong&gt;page&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope that you &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; your stay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;XHTML is similar to HTML&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org&quot;&gt;Validator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm a PhD mathematician with some teacher training under my belt, and I'm very frustrated with the Maths textbook area on this site - there appears to be no focus for contributions.

Answer this:  Are we trying to create a seminal work on mathematics that has usefuls tidbits of the basis on arithmetics that university professors would find insightful, or are we instead trying to teach basic arithmetic to an 11 year old?

It seems that the current pages are achieving neither.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fields==
You are probably already familiar with many different sets of numbers from your past experience.  Some of the commonly used sets of numbers are
*Natural numbers, usually denoted with an '''N''', are the numbers 0,1,2,3,...
*Integers, usually denoted with a '''Z''', are the positive and negative natural numbers: ...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3...
*Rational numbers, denoted with a '''Q''', are fractions of integers (excluding division by zero): -1/3, 5/1, 0, 2/7. etc.
*Real numbers, denoted with a '''R''', are constructed and discussed below.

Note that different sets of numbers have different properties.  In the set integers for example, any number always has an ''additive inverse'': for any integer ''x'', there is another integer ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;x+t=0&lt;/math&gt;
This should not be terribly surprising: from basic arithmetic we know that &lt;math&gt;t=-x&lt;/math&gt;.  Try to prove to yourself that not all natural numbers have an additive inverse.

In mathematics, it is useful to note the important properties of each of these sets of numbers.  The rational numbers, which will be of primary concern in constructing the real numbers, have the following properties:
:There exists a number 0 such that for any other number ''a'', 0+''a''=''a''+0=''a''
:For any two numbers ''a'' and ''b'', ''a''+''b'' is another number
:For any three numbers ''a,b'', and ''c'', ''a''+(''b''+''c'')=(''a''+''b'')+''c''
:For any number ''a'' there is another number ''-a'' such that ''a''+(''-a'')=0
:For any two numbers ''a'' and ''b'', ''a''+''b''=''b''+''a''
:For any two numbers ''a'' and ''b'',''a*b'' is another number
:There is a number 1 such that for any number ''a'', ''a''*1=1*''a''=''a''
:For any two numbers ''a'' and ''b'', ''a*b''=''b*a''
:For any three numbers ''a,b'' and ''c'', ''a''(''bc'')=(''ab'')''c''
:For any three numbers ''a,b'' and ''c,'' ''a''(''b''+''c'')=''ab''+''ac''
:For every number ''a'' there is another number ''a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; such that aa&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=1

As presented above, these may seem quite intimidating.  However, these properties are nothing more than basic facts from arithmetic.  Any collection of numbers (and operations + and * on those numbers) which satisfies the above properties is called a ''field.''  The properties above are usually called ''field axioms.''  As an exercise, determine if the integers form a field, and if not, which field axiom(s) they violate.  

Even though the list of field axioms is quite extensive, it does not fully explore the properties of rational numbers.  Rational numbers also have an ''ordering.'''  A ''total ordering'' must satisfy several properties: for any numbers ''a,'' ''b,'' and ''c''
: if ''a'' &amp;le; ''b'' and ''b'' &amp;le; ''a'' then ''a'' = ''b''  (antisymmetry)
: if ''a'' &amp;le; ''b'' and ''b'' &amp;le; ''c'' then ''a'' &amp;le; ''c''  (transitivity)
: ''a'' &amp;le; ''b'' or ''b'' &amp;le; ''a''  (totality)

To familiarize yourself with these properties, try to show that (a) natural numbers, integers and rational numbers are all totally ordered and more generally (b) convince yourself that any collection of rational numbers are totally ordered (note that the integers and natural numbers are both collections of rational numbers).

Finally, it is useful to recognize one more characterization of the rational numbers: every rational number has a decimal expansion which is either repeating or terminating.  The proof of this fact is omitted, however it follows from the definition of each rational number as a fraction. When performing long division, the remainder at any stage can only take on positive integer values smaller than the denominator, of which there are finitely many.

==Constructing the Real Numbers==
There are two additional tools which are needed for the construction of the real numbers: the upper bound and the least upper bound.
'''Definition'''
A collection of numbers ''E'' is bounded above if there exists a number ''m'' such that for all ''x'' in ''E'' ''x&amp;le;m''. Any number ''m'' which satisfies this condition is called an upper bound of the set ''E.''

'''Definition'''
If a collection of numbers ''E'' is bounded above with ''m'' as an upper bound of ''E'', and all other upper bounds of ''E'' are bigger than ''m'', we call ''m'' the ''least upper bound'' or ''supremum'' of ''E'', denoted by sup ''E.'' 

Many collections of rational numbers do not have a least upper bound which is also rational, although some do.  Suppose the numbers 5 and 10/3 are, together, taken to be ''E.''  The number 5 is not only an upper bound of ''E,'' it is a least upper bound. In general, there are many upper bounds (12, for instance, is an upper bound of the collection above), but there can be at most one least upper bound.  

Consider the collection of numbers &lt;math&gt;\{3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, \dots\}&lt;/math&gt;: You may recognize these decimals as the first few digits of pi.  Since each decimal terminates, each number in this collection is a rational number.  This collection has infinitely many upper bounds.  The number 4, for instance, is an upper bound.  There is no least upper bound, at least not in the rational numbers.  Try to convince yourself of this fact by attempting to construct such a least upper bound: (a) why does pi not work as a least upper bound (hint: pi does not have a repeating or terminating decimal expansion), (b) what happens if the proposed supremum is equal to pi up to some decimal place, and zeros after (c) if the proposed supremum is bigger than pi, can you find a smaller upper bound which will work?

In fact, there are infinitely many collections of rational numbers which do not have a rational least upper bound. We define a real number to be any number that is the least upper bound of some collection of rational numbers.

==Properties of Real Numbers==
The reals are totally ordered.
:For all reals; ''a'', ''b'', ''c''
:Either ''b&gt;a'', ''b=a'', or ''b&lt;a''.
:If ''a&lt;b'' and ''b&lt;c'' then ''a&lt;c''
Also &lt;!-- check name of these properties --&gt;
:''b&gt;a'' implies ''b+c&gt;a+c''
:''b&gt;a'' and ''c&gt;0'' implies ''bc&gt;ac''
:''b&gt;a'' implies ''-a&gt;-b''

'''Upper bound axiom'''
:Every non-empty set of real numbers which is bounded above has a supremum.

The upper bound axiom is necessary for calculus. It is not true for rational numbers.

We can also define lower bounds in the same way.

'''Definition'''
A set ''E'' is bounded below if there exists a real M such that for all ''x''&amp;isin;''E'' ''x&amp;ge;M''
Any ''M'' which satisfies this condition is called an lower bound of the set ''E''

'''Definition'''
If a set, ''E'', is bounded below, ''M'' is an lower bound of ''E'', and all other lower bounds of ''E'' are less than ''M'', we call ''M'' the ''greatest lower bound'' or ''inifimum'' of ''E'', denoted by inf ''E''

The supremum and infimum of finite sets are the same as their maximum and minimum.

'''Theorem'''
:Every  non-empty set of real numbers which is bounded below  has an infimum.
''Proof:''
:Let E be a non-empty set of real numbers, bounded below
:Let L be the set of all lower bounds of E
:L is not empty, by definition of bounded below
:Every element of E is an upper bound to the set L, by definition
:Therefore, L is a non empty set which is bounded above
:L has a supremum, by the upper bound axiom
:1/ Every lower bound of E is &amp;le;sup L, by definition of supremum
:Suppose there were an ''e''&amp;isin;E such that e&lt;sup L
:Every element of L is &amp;le;e, by definition
:Therefore e is an upper bound of L and e&lt;sup L
:This contradicts the definition of supremum, so there can be no such e.
:If e&amp;isin;E then e&amp;ge;sup L, proved by contradiction
:2/ Therefore, sup L is a lower bound of E
:'''inf E exists, and is equal to sup L''', on comparing definition of infinum to lines 1 &amp; 2

Bounds and inequalities, theorems: 
&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \Rightarrow \sup A \le \sup B&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \Rightarrow \inf A \ge \inf B&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \sup A \cup B = \max (\sup A, \sup B)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \inf A \cup B = \min (\inf A, \inf B)&lt;/math&gt;


'''Theorem: ''' ''(The triangle inequality)''
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c \in \R \quad |a-b| \le |a-c|+|c-b|&lt;/math&gt;
''Proof'' by considering cases

If a&amp;le;b&amp;le;c then ''|a-c|+|c-b| =  ''(c-a)+(c-b)'' = ''2(c-b)+(b-a)&amp;gt;b-a'' = ''|b-a|''

''Exercise:'' Prove the other five cases.

This theorem is a special case of the triangle inequality theorem from geometry:
The sum of two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the third side.
It is useful whenever we need to manipulate inequalities and absolute values.

==Importance of Electronics==
Electronics is the study and use of devices that control the flow of electrons (or other charged particles).  These devices can be used to process information or perform tasks using electromagnetic power.

Electronic circuits can be found in numerous household products, including such items as telephones, computers, and CD players.  Electronic devices have also allowed greatly increased precision in scientific measurements.

Interest in the field of electronics increased around 1900 and the advent of radio.  Interest reached an all-time high in the 1940s, 50s, 60s, with the invention of transistor radios, the launch of Sputnik, and the science and math educational push to win the space race.  Interest in electronics as a hobby in the 1970s led to the advent of the personal computer (PC).

Electronics have since seen a decline in hobbyist interest.  Electronics is now generally studied as part of a college-level program in electrical engineering.

This book is an attempt at reviving the hobbyist mentality that made electronics so big in the first place, by making electronics concepts more accessible and giving practical knowledge, as well as providing technical information for the student.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction to Verbs=

Verbs in Latin, like verbs in English, are the &quot;action words&quot;.  &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;throw&quot;, &quot;kick&quot;, &quot;fly&quot;, &quot;think&quot;, and &quot;be&quot; are all examples of verbs.  

==Verbs in Latin==

Just like nouns, we can tell a lot about a Latin verb by looking at its ending.  This is because verbs '''conjugate''' (remember, nouns '''decline''').  There are four groupings of verbs, called &quot;conjugations&quot;.  Like the declensions for nouns, each verb conjugation contains a group of verbs with similar endings.  

We saw that nouns have three incidents.  Verbs, however, have '''five'''.  As a result, there is a vast number of forms that each verb can take.  We'll start slow, of course.  First, before we get into talking about verbs themselves, we should talk about what those five incidents are.

===Mood===

Verbs have three different '''moods''' - the indicative, the imperative, and the subjunctive.  The '''indicative''', from the word &quot;indicate&quot;, is the mood that shows action happening.  When Bob kicks a ball, &quot;kicks&quot; is a verb in the indicative because it tells us that something is actually happening.  The '''imperative''' is a command.  If I say to Bob, &quot;Kick the ball&quot;, &quot;kick&quot; is in the imperative - I'm telling Bob to kick the ball, the ball isn't actually being kicked yet.  Finally, Latin verbs have a '''subjunctive''' mood.  This usually represents hypothetical action.  &quot;Bob might kick the ball&quot; uses &quot;kick&quot; in the subjunctive mood.

We'll learn more about the indicative mood later in this lesson.

===Voice===

Just as in English, there are two '''voices''' that verbs can take.  The '''active''' voice is used when the subject of a sentence (the '''nominative''' case noun[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_case]) is doing the action.  Such as &quot;Bob kicked the ball&quot; - Bob is the subject and he is doing the kicking.  But when we say &quot;The ball was kicked by Bob&quot;, the '''ball''' is the subject of the sentence.  The ball isn't doing anything though!  In this case, the verb &quot;was kicked&quot; is '''passive''' - the subject has something done to it.  Note that in English we need to use the auxiliary (helping) verb &quot;was&quot; along with our main verb &quot;kick&quot; to show the passive voice.  In Latin, a form of &quot;kick&quot; is used that shows passive voice without needing an auxiliary.

We'll start off by focusing on the active voice.

===Tense===

We're familiar with tense in English - we can tell the difference between &quot;Bob kicks the ball&quot;, &quot;Bob kicked the ball&quot;, and &quot;Bob will kick the ball&quot;.  Those are just a few of the tenses that we use in English - the present, the past, and the future.  Latin has a total of six tenses.  We'll go into each of the tenses later (starting with the '''present''' in this lesson), but for now just know that there are six.

===Person===

&quot;I kick the ball&quot;.  &quot;You kick the ball&quot;.  &quot;Bob kicks the ball&quot;.  What's the difference in these three sentences?  The '''person''' of the verb.  We all remember from our English classes the different points-of-view that can be used in writing.  '''First person''' is the use of words that refer to the person speaking (I, me, we, us).  '''Second person''' refers to the person being spoken to (you).  '''Third person''' talks about someone else entirely (Julia, Bob, the girl, the poet).  Note in the three sentences above the first and second person in English use &quot;kick&quot; while third person uses &quot;kicks&quot; - this is a vestige of the Latin conjugation system.  In Latin, each of those three sentences would use a different form of &quot;kick&quot;.  The person of a verb is determined by the subject of a sentence.

===Number===

Just like nouns, verbs have number.  They can be singular or plural.  The number of the verb is determined by the number of the subject of the sentence - if you have a singular subject, you need to use a singular verb.  Multiple subjects require a plural verb.  In English, we really only see this in the third person (&quot;Bob kicks the ball&quot; vs. &quot;Bob and Julia kick the ball&quot;).  However, Latin has two different forms for each person.

=First Conjugation=

The '''first conjugation''' is the most regular of the four groupings of verbs.  Both of the verbs we used in our last lesson belong to the first conjugation.  Can you tell from the sentences what '''person''' and '''number''' those verbs were?  How about '''tense''', '''voice''', and '''mood'''?

If you decided that they were '''third-person singular''', you're right.  Bonus points for '''present active indicative'''.  Let's stay with the '''present active indicative''' for right now, and take a look at the different endings for person and number.

==Present Active Indicative==

Present active indicatives are forms of verbs that show a '''subject doing an action now'''.  They can be translated into English either as simple presents (something '''happens''') or as progressive presents (something '''is happening''').

{| border=1 bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| '''Person''' || '''Number''' || '''Latin Example''' || '''English Equivalent'''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| First || Singular || ''do'' || I give, am giving
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Second || Singular || ''das'' || you give, are giving
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Third || Singular || ''dat'' || he/she/it gives, is giving
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| First || Plural || ''damus'' || we give, are giving
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Second || Plural || ''datis'' || y'all give, are giving
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Third || Plural || ''dant'' || they give, are giving
|}

Note that &quot;you&quot; in English can be singular or plural, so we will distinguish it here as follows:  &quot;you&quot; - singular, &quot;y'all&quot; - plural.

The ''dat'' should look familiar because we used it in the last lesson.  We also used ''amat''.  From looking at the chart above, can you guess what the other forms of ''amat'' are?  

{| border=1 bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| '''Person''' || '''Number''' || '''Latin Example''' || '''English Equivalent'''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| First || Singular || ''amo'' || I love, am loving
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Second || Singular || ''amas'' || you love, are loving
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Third || Singular || ''amat'' || he/she/it loves, is loving
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| First || Plural || ''amamus'' || we love, are loving
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Second || Plural || ''amatis'' || y'all love, are loving
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Third || Plural || ''amant'' || they love, are loving
|}

If that's what you came up with, you did well.

==Dictionary Entries==

The dictionary entry for a Latin verb has four &quot;principle parts&quot;.  Once we get into the later lessons, you will need all four parts to be able to fully conjugate (i.e., list all the forms of) a verb.  For now, only the first two are important.  They are the '''first-person singular present active indicative''' and the '''present active infinitive'''.  We'll talk more about infinitives, and why they don't have person or number, later.  The dictionary entries for the two verbs we've used so far are:

: '''do, dare, --, --'''  To give.&lt;br&gt;
: '''amo, amare, --, --''' To love.

The &quot;--&quot;s will be filled in later when we learn the rest of the principle parts.

==Stem==

Notice anything similar about the two entries?  The second part (the infinitive) of each ends in ''-are''.  Any time that you see that ending for the infinitive, you will know that the verb is first conjugation.  To find the stem of the verb, you simply slash off the ''-re'' from the infinitive.  This holds true for '''all four''' conjugations.  What are the stems of our two verbs?

''dare'' --&gt; ''da-''&lt;br&gt;
''amare'' --&gt; ''ama-''

==Personal Endings==

What can we do with this stems?  Well, to get each of the person/number combinations we simply add a &quot;personal ending&quot; to the verb's stem.  The endings are:

{| border=1 bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| '''Person''' || '''Number''' || '''Personal Ending'''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| First || Singular || ''-o''
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Second || Singular || ''-s'' 
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Third || Singular || ''-t'' 
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| First || Plural || ''-mus'' 
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Second || Plural || ''-tis''  
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Third || Plural || ''-nt''  
|}

One issue you might notice is in the first-person singular.  Take a look at the stem of ''amare''.  It is ''ama-''.  If we were to add the first-person singular ending to that, we would get ''ama-'' + ''-o'' = ''amao''.  But we know from our dictionary entry that the first-person singular is ''amo''.  What's up?  In Latin, sometimes certain vowels get &quot;consumed&quot; by other vowels that are stronger.  This is what has happened in this case:  the ''-o'' is a strong enough sound that it simply obliterates the &quot;a&quot; in the stem.  Because all first conjugation verbs have stems that end in &quot;a&quot; (remember that for a verb to be first conjugation, the infinitive must end in ''-are'' and so cutting the ''-re'' will always leave ''-a-''), every first conjugation verb will exhibit this change.  

===Missing Subjects===

Often in Latin, you will see sentences that have '''no''' noun in the nominative case.  Don't panic; there is still a subject for that sentence.  Let's take a look at an example.  The sentence &quot;''Sapientiam amo''&quot; has an accusative (''sapientiam'') and a verb (''amo''), but no nominative.  You can find the subject by looking at the verb - ''amo'' is the first-person singular.  There is really only one option for who subject is.  It has to be &quot;I&quot; because &quot;I&quot; is the only subject that will use a first-person singular verb (&quot;we&quot; uses a first-person plural&quot;).  Therefore, the sentence translates to &quot;I love wisdom&quot;.  You can use the same logic easily with second-person verbs as well.  Third-person is a bit trickier because it has more options, but the singular is &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, or &quot;it&quot; and the plural is &quot;they&quot;.

==Practice==

Let's learn a new verb now.  How about this one:

: '''laudo, laudare, --, --'''  To praise.

What is the stem?  What is the third-person singular?  The second-person plural?

{| border=1 bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| '''Person''' || '''Number''' || '''Stem + Ending''' || '''Form''' || '''English'''
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| First || Singular || ''lauda-o'' || ''laudo'' || I praise, am praising
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Second || Singular || ''lauda-s'' || ''laudas'' || you praise, are praising
|- bgcolor=#CCBBCC
| Third || Singular || ''lauda-t'' || ''laudat'' || he/she/it praises, is praising
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| First || Plural || ''lauda-mus'' || ''laudamus'' || we praise, are praising
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Second || Plural || ''lauda-tis'' || ''laudatis'' || y'all praise, are praising
|- bgcolor=#BBCCBB
| Third || Plural || ''lauda-nt'' || ''laudant'' || they praise, are praising
|}

=Vocab=

In addition to the three verbs you learned earlier in this lesson, add this one to your memory:

: '''culpo, culpare, --, --'''  To blame

Let's add another couple of nouns as well.  How about the proper nouns &quot;Rome&quot; and &quot;Italy&quot;?

: '''Roma, -ae''', ''f''.  Rome
: '''Italia, -ae''', ''f''.  Italy

=Exercises=

# ''Romam amo.''
# ''Puellae poetas culpant.''
# ''Julia sapientiam dat.''
# ''Italiam amas.''
# ''Poetam amatis.''
# ''Juliam laudamus.''

[[Latin/L3/Answers|Answers]]

=Summary=

You now know what a verb is, what conjugation means, and how to conjugate the '''present active indicative''' forms of '''first conjugation''' verbs.  Your noun vocab is expanding, and you've learned your first four verbs.  You can translate sentences with subjects, direct objects, and present tense verbs.  You can even fill in gaps when the subject of a sentence is missing by looking at the verb.

In the next lesson, we'll learn about the dative case and indirect objects.  We'll finally discover to whom Julia is giving those tables!

==Using a Shadow to Find Directions==

1. Find a straight stick, preferably one about a meter long.

2. Find an area to place your stick. This area ahould be as open as possible, free of brush or trees. It should also be as level as possible.

3. Place the stick in the ground sticking up.

4. Mark the tip of the shadow cast by the stick. 

5. Wait for fifteen or twenty minutes until the shadow has moved noticeably.

6. Mark the tip of the shadow again.

7. Draw a line between these two marks. The first mark is west and the second is east.

8. If you stand with the first mark directly to the left of the second mark you will be facing north.

== Before you go ==
* Be ready. Tell people where you are going and how long you will be there before you leave.
* Bring a survival kit. 

==In an outdoor survival emergency==
* Do not panic — This can lead to making very bad choices. Sit down and relax or hug a tree. All is not lost — human beings are very resourceful, and many people have survived despite impossible odds. Think of home, family, and loved ones. Calmly take stock of your resources. (Even things like the stuffing in your car seat can save your life by helping to insulate your clothes.
* Deal with immediate first aid issues.
* Find a phone — Your next priority is to use a phone if you know for sure where one is.
* Keep warm — The most important priority in surviving outdoors is keeping warm. Thirst and hunger may kill you over the course of several days, but hypothermia can kill you in minutes. Furthermore, a low body temperature can severely impair your judgment, one of the worst things that can happen in a survival situation.
* If you are lost and have no idea where to go, stay where you are! The farther you move without knowing where you're going, the harder it will be for searchers to find you. If you must leave the area, leave a note about your plans or at least leave a sign indicating the direction you are traveling. If you don't know which way to go, walk downhill until you find water and then follow the water.
* Your next order of priorities is shelter, water, signals, and food. (note: fire when possible may be part of keeping warm, purifying water, and signaling)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pmaccabe. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pmaccabe~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

So what is the relationship between spin and magnetism?  The only spin-0 particle I know of is the Higgs Boson, so does that mean Higgs Bosons create a magnetic field? Also are there any other E&amp;M like waves besides photons? 

[[User:Wanderer]]

All charged particles produce magnetic fields, irrespective of spin, if they are moving relative to the observer.

Maxwell's equations are classical, they don't depend on the spin of the charge, and they accurately describe the behaviour of EM fields under classical conditions. Maxwell didn't need spin to explain EM, so neither do we.

Normally, the effects of spin are only visible on a quantum scale. The only exception is permament magnets. In these, every atom has spin 1/2, and they are all pointing in the same direction, producing a magnetic field. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

Ok. I have been studying E&amp;M for a while and am having trouble understanding the relationship between an Electric Field and a Magnetic Field. From looking at E&amp;M waves as far as I can tell they are the same thing only having gone through some strange rotation transformation. [[User:Wanderer]]


Electricty and magnetism ''are'' different aspects of the same thing. In relativity, the two 3-d vectors, E and M, turn out to be the 6 spatial and temporal components of an antisymmetric tensor. If you are moving this tensor gets rotated through an imaginary angle, just like velocities do, so what looks like a pure electric field to one person can look like a mixed EM field to someone else.

E.g If you stood still next to an (hypothetical) charged particle with zero magnetic moment, you'd see an inverse square electic field and no magnetic field.

Someone else, running past you, would see the charge moving relative to them, ''and a moving charge is a current'', so they'd see a magnetic field as well as the electric field. The equations for the transformation are similar to those for time dilation and length contraction.

While E and B both depend on the observer, the scalars &lt;math&gt;E^2-c^2B^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are observer independent. If one person sees electric and magnetic fields at right angles, everyone will. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

:In fact, it was Maxwell's equations that lead Einstein to formulate special relitivity in the first place. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:57, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)

==Minor edits==
Hi, just a quick note about marking edits as minor. This feature is for correcting typos and spelling mistakes, changes to formatting, slight changes in wording for readability or good grammar, that sort of thing. Small changes in content should not be marked as minor. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:57, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)


==GR Page==
Hi Carandol, I've noticed that you've posted on the GR page.  I've written what little there is so far, and today I noticed some text was added to the documents.  Was that you?  If so, I really appreciate the help, as when I first found the page it was ''completely blank''.  Stop by my page ([[User:Lathem|Lathem]]) if you wanna chat.  Also, I'm adding a section to the GR discussion page (about the order of the Tensor section).  Have a good evening.

== Vector pictures, Figures 1 - 4 ==

Thanks for putting the pictures of vectors in Figures 1 - 4 in module [[Modern Physics:Math:Vectors]].  They look quite nice.   I am wondering why a gray background was used for the second two pictures.

:I just copied them from the base text.

I am thinking of moving the scalar discussion to the beginning of the module someday and inserting a few simple un-numbered pictures showing the effect of scalars multiplied by vectors.  In particular, I'm interested in showing reversal of direction when multiplying a vector by a negative scalar.  Also, maybe a picture showing a vector consisting of &lt;br&gt;x and y components.  It may take me some time to get this done.  If you plan to do this, let me know, so there's no duplication of effort.  

:I've got no such plans. For now, I'm not likely to be many diagrams at all.[[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 13:24, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Mathematically, the order of operation probably doesn't really matter for scalar and vector, but traditionally the scalar quantities seem to be shown in front of the vector when multiplied by it, like a coefficient.  [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 06:54, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Analog-to-Analog Conversion is the conversion of a continuous electrical signal from one form to another.

An example would be converting between the 60 Hz current of the US into the 50 Hz current of Europe.

==ADC==
Analog to digital

Used in power supplies

involves a transformer to change the voltage and diodes to recitfy the voltage.

(What?)

Analog to Digital Conversion is the process of making a computerized representation of some physical attribute in the real world. Turning a voltage into binary numbers is the handiest way to do this, the voltage could be manipulated by a microphone transducer, a potentiometer wiper, or the conductivity of prevarication.

==DAC==
Digital to analog

==DDC==
digital to digital

Originally people thought that radio waves propagate through the ether.

The ether was disproved by showing that it did not flow.

EM waves are photons that travel through free space.

* Each state has many life insurance sales people, and each region (North, South, East, West) of the state has one regional head salesperson.   A salesperson can only sell in one region and can only have one head salesperson he/she is working under. Create a schema to describe this relationship. Create an XML document and populate it with data for two states. Make sure the XML document is well formed and valid. Each state should have data for at least two regions, and each region should have at least three salesman, including the region head. Each salesperson should be uniquely identified by a number. Each state shoud be uniquely identified by its two letter abbreviation. Create an XSL stylesheet to display this data, with a separate table for each state. If the salesperson is a regional head, it should say so. Create an entity named doublespace in the stylesheet that is the equivalent to two carriage returns. Use the new entity to create two blank lines between the two tables.

* A restaurant has many appetizers on its menu. A restaurant may also create a sampler dish which is a conglomeration of smaller portions of select appetizers. Create a schema to describe this relationship. Create an XML document and populate it with enough appetizers to create at least two sampler groups. Make sure the XML document is well formed and valid.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Let us start with a quick minimum example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;turtleneck-sweater.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

And let us also have a look at more extended example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;turtleneck-sweater.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Photograph of a Turtleneck Sweater&quot;
     title=&quot;Photograph of a Turtleneck Sweater&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Images are normally stored in external files. To place an image into an HTML source, use the &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; tag with the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute containing the URL of the image file. To support browsers that cannot render images, you can provide the &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attribute with a textual description of the image. To provide a tooltip to the image, use the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

The space before the &lt;code&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the examples is there on purpose. Some older browsers behave strangely if the space is omitted.

==Placement==

Per default, images are placed ''inline'' to their surroundings. To place the image as a ''block'' or ''float'' instead, you can use [[Cascading Style Sheets]].
{{todo|Show how to place images using CSS.}}

==Alternative text and tooltip==
The HTML specification requires that all images have an &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attribute. This is commonly known as ''alt text''. Images can be split in to two categories:
*those that add to the content of the page;
*those that are purely decorative, e.g. spacers, fancy borders and bullets.

Decorative images should have empty alt text, i.e. &lt;code&gt;alt=&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Images used as bullets may use an asterisk, &lt;code&gt;alt=&quot;*&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.

All other images should have meaningful alt text. Alt text is not a description of the image, use the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute for short descriptions. Alt text is something that will be read instead of the image. For example,
&lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;img src=&quot;company_logo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;???&quot;&amp;gt; makes the best widgets in the world.
&lt;/pre&gt;
The alt text should be the company's name not the ever popular 'Our logo', which would give the sentence 'Our logo makes the best widgets in the world.' when read in a text only browser.

The &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attribute stands for ''alternate'' which non-graphic-capable browsers (such as Lynx) may use to better enable its user to understand the purpose of the image. Some older browsers incorrectly use the &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attribute' tag to produce image tooltips. However, the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute should actually be used for this.

==Width and height==
To have an image appear smaller than it is in the external file, use the attributes &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;. When only one or the other is specified, images will scale to keep the same overall ratio.

An excellent source of info is the various Robotics Societies, including Seattle Robotics Society and Dallas Personal Robotics Group.  There is a lot of info on these groups websites, especially in the archived pages of The Encoder, published by SRS.

To begin, an excellent source would be the Wikipedia pages on Robotics ([[w:Robotics]]) or the [[Robotics|Robotics Wikibook]].

==Chapter 16: Spacecraft==

Telemetry - Measurement at a distance.  Critical in the success of early spacecraft.  This technology allowed an incredible pyramid of resources to be applied to monitoring and safely operating the machine and human occupied spacecraft of the pre-space era of human development.  Modern development efforts are focusing on a new generation of space based grid technologies that are hopefully sustainable independently from the mother planet with only occasional unnoticed intervention from the Lord Almighty but which when prematurely, suddenly or unexpectedly exposed to an adverse probability surge from outside the locally anticipated systems or universes can survive long enough to request and receive assistance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electrolysis involves an electric field and the motion of electrons through a liquid.  

[[GCSE Science/Electricity]]
---- 

Electrolysis is the decomposition of certain types of substance using electricity.The types of substance that can be split are '''ionic''' substances.This just means that they are made of  charged ions rather than neutral atoms.{Remember that an ion is just an atom that has either a positive or negative charge}. An example of an ionic substance is common table salt sodium chloride. The sodium atom has a positive charge, the chlorine atom has a negtive charge. It is usually written as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Q1)''' Check in a periodic table, what is the symbol for sodium Na or Cl?

As you may already know if you've studied the [[GCSE Science/Metals|Metals]] module, a salt is any substance made by combining an acid with an alkali. Acids, alkalis, and therefore all salts are ionic.

'''Q2)''' Which of the following substances can be broken up by electrcity Sodium chloride, iron sulphate, copper nitrate?

==Basic Experimental Setup==

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Simple electrolysis setup.png]]
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;ccddff&quot; |  The liquid electrolyte is connected&lt;br&gt; to a battery or power supply.&lt;br&gt;The electrodes must not touch!
|}

Most ionic compounds are not liquid at room temperature. This is a problem because the ions need to be able to move for the electric current to be able to flow. This can be achieved by melting. Look at the electrical setup shown on the right.  The electrodes are just tqwo carbon rods connected to a battery. The one connected to the positive electrode is called the anode. The one connected to the negative electrode is called the cathode.

Consider for example the compound lead bromide. This compound is a solid at room temperature but can be molten over a Bunsen flame. So what you would do is put some lead bromide into a beaker. Put the beaker on a tripod over a bunsen flame. Melt the lead bromide, then put in the electrodes and turn the power supply on at a setting of say 2V. What you would see happening is the anode, is a silvery coating of pure lead forming, and bromine forming at the cathode. The current would continue to flow until all the lead bromide was turned into lead and bromine.

'''Q3)''' It takes energy to split uo a compound like lead bromide. Where does this energy come from ?   
    
'''Q4)''' Predict what products you would get at the anode and cathode if copper chloride was the electrolyte. 

==What happens at the anode==

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Electrolysis anode.png]]
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;ccddff&quot; |  The bromine atoms (blue)&lt;br&gt; give up  2 electrons each (green) to the anode.
|}
The anode is the positive electrode. It attracts  negatively charged ions, because unlike charges attract. The bromine ions move through the melt until they reach the anode. Once they get there, they give up their  two extra electrons to become bromine atoms.

Br&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; Br + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The electrons flow up the anode to the positive terminal of the battery.

==What happens at the cathode==
The cathode is the negative electrode. It attracts the positively charged ions. Metal ions are always positive and so the lead ions flow through the melt until they get to the cathode. Once they get there they take two electrons each from the cathode. The electrons flow down the cathode from the negatively terminal of the battery and onto the lead ions.

Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; Pb

'''Q5)''' Solid ionic substances do not conduct electricity and are not split up by it. Why do you think that is?

==Quantity calculations (higher tier only)==
[[Image:Electrolysis copper sulphate.png]]

In the experiment with lead bromide, you saw that lead was deposited at the cathode. If you actually do the experiment you will see that the lead coats the cathode. In this section we will look at how much metal will coat a cathode in a given time.

A scientist performed the following experiment.
*A copper cathode was carefully cleaned and accurately weighed.
*It was placed along with an abnode into a solution of copper sulphate.
*It was connected via a ammeter to a variable power supply.
*A current was left to run for a given time then the cathode was removed and weighed again.

His results were:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;  bgcolor= &quot;ffdddd&quot;
|-
| Current /A || Time /s || Mass of copper deposited /g
|-
| 1 || 3000 || 1.0
|-
| 2 || 3000 || 2.0
|-
| 2 || 1500 || 1.0
|-
| 1 || 1500 || 1.0
|}

You can see from the results that the total amount of copper deposited depends on both the current and the time it flows. This is because the number of copper atoms that can be made from ions depends on the total amount of '''charge''' that flows. The unit of charge is the coulomb.

One coulomb is the amount of charge when one Amp flows for one second (see [[GCSE Science/Measuring electricity]]

'''Q6)'''Look at the results table above. How much copper is deposited when 1A flows for 3000 seconds?

'''Q7)'''How much copper do you predict would be doposited if 1A were to flow for 6000 seconds.

'''Q8)'''What about if 2A were to flow for 12000 seconds ?

==Electrolysis of Aqueos solutions (Advanced)==
''Before studying this section check with your teacher to see if you need to''.

Earlier on in this module you've learned that ions must be able to move in order for electrolysis to work. If the ions are held rigid {such as in a solid}, they can't move and no electricity will flow. We've looked at how the frreing up of ions can occur by melting the electrolyte. Another way to achieve this is by dissolving th electrolyte in water. The trouble with this method is, there will be mor than one type of ion present.

water partially splits up into ions {this is why it's such a good solvent for ionic compounds}.It splits into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O --&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

So at the cathode there will be two ions present. The Metal ion and the hydrogen ion from the water. Which element is actually produced at the cathode depends on how reactive the metal is. If the metal is very reactive, such as potassium, or sodium, then hydrogen will be produced. If the metal is unreactive such as silver, the metal will be produced.{I hope you learned your displacement reactions in lower school}. To work out which ion wins, the metal or the hydrogen, compare their reactivities in a the reactivity series. The one that is most reactive, will '''not''' be produced at the cathode.

A similar situation occurs at the anode. Hydroxide ions {from the water} are usually discharged at the anode ultimately producing oxygen.

OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; OH + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

4OH --&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

This is true for most things but if the ions are bromine, chlorine, or fluorine {i.e. a halogen} then the halogen will be produced. {You are unlikely to need to remember this, only ''understand it''}

'''Q9)''' Sodium chloride is dissolved in water and subjected to electrolysis. Explain what you see at each of the electrodes.

{| bgcolor=&quot;ffeeaa&quot;
|-
| '''Summary'''
|-
| Only ionic substances can be split up by electrolysis
|-
| The ionic compounds need to be melted or dissolved in water so the ions can move
|-
| Positive ions are attracted to the cathode, where they pick up electrons from the electrode
|-
| Negative ions are attracted to the anode where they give electrons to the electrode

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A single statistic tells only part of a dataset’s story. The mean is one perspective; the median yet another. And when we explore relationships between multiple variables, even more statistics arise. The coefficient estimates in a regression model, the Cochran-Maentel-Haenszel test statistic in partial contingency tables; a multitude of statistics are available to summarize and test data.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But our ultimate goal in statistics is not to summarize the data, it is to fully understand their complex relationships. A well designed statistical graphic helps us explore, and perhaps understand, these relationships.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This section will help you let the data speak, so that the world may know its story.

[[Image:Paprika-spice.jpg|right|thumb|Paprika]]

'''Paprika''' is a sweet-to-mildly hot cultivar of the [[Cookbook:Chilli Pepper|chilli pepper]] (''Capsicum annuum'', of the family Solanaceae). Paprika peppers are a bright red elongated or round fruit.

Hungary is probably the world's leading producer of paprika; in the United States, California and Texas are the main producers.

Paprika is often eaten ground as a powder and sometimes as a fresh vegetable. It is commonly used in Hungarian, Balkan, Middle Eastern, and Central Asian cuisines. The round type can be stuffed with [[Cookbook:cottage cheese|cottage cheese]] or salad to make a portable lunch. 

Some specialty varieties of paprika are hot but the generally available ground preparation is quite mild. 

Smoked paprika has an extra strong smoky flavour. It is very strong and needs to be used in moderation, but it adds a distinctive touch to dishes such as [[Cookbook:Chicken Paprikash|Chicken Paprikash]] and [[Cookbook:Paprika Chicken|Paprika Chicken]].

__NOTOC__
Makes up to 6 large portions.

==Ingredients==

===For the stew===
*4 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*4-5 large [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
*2 medium sized [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*1 (or more) cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*4-5 sticks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
*1 large green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]
*1 large red bell pepper
*2 Tablespoons [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
*1 tin (400 g) tomatoes, chopped
*1 tin (260 g) [[Cookbook:Butter Bean|butter beans]] or [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpeas]] (or a mix of both)
*1/2 cup (200 g) frozen or fresh garden [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]]
*2 teaspoons vegan [[Cookbook:Stock|vegetable stock]]
*1 dessert spoon (2.5 teaspoons) yeast extract spread ([[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]])
*2 level Tablespoons [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] or [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] (or a mixture of both)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] to taste

===For the dumplings===
*110g (4oz) [[Cookbook:flour|self-raising flour]]
*50g (2oz) margarine
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] (optional)
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] (optional)
*pinch of salt and ground black pepper (to taste)

==Procedure==

#Peel the potatoes and chop them into roughly 4cm (1 and 1/2 inch) chunks.  Peel and slice the carrots.  Roughly chop both the peppers and the remaining vegetables.   
#On a low heat, melt the margarine or heat the olive oil in a large saucepan.  
#Add all the chopped vegetables and stir, making sure all vegetables get a good coating of the oil.  
#Gently fry/sweat the vegetables for 3 minutes and season well, then add the flour and continue to stir and coat all the vegetables. 
#Add the tin of chopped tomatoes, stir in tomato paste and then add enough water to cover all the ingredients in the pan. 
#Simmer gently for a further 3 minutes, occasionally stirring.
#Add the stock/bouillon and the yeast extract.
#Crush the clove of garlic and gently stir in.  
#Place a lid on (with a slight gap to allow some of the steam to escape) and gently simmer on a low heat for 35-50 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning.
#Now make the dumpling mixture.  Begin by sifting the self- raising flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda (for extra fluffy and light dumplings) into a large bowl.  
#Chop the margarine into the flour, and add a pinch of salt and fresh ground pepper
#Add a very small quantity of cold water and pinch-mix with your fingers (you can always add more later), just enough to make a strong, sticky dough.

#Test the main stew to see if it's ready for adding the dumpling dough. Take a carrot from the pan and if it feels semi-cooked, but still firm, then it is the perfect time to add the butter beans, peas and dumplings.  
#Taste and add more seasoning if necessary.  
#Distribute walnut-sized lumps of dough, evenly spaced, on top of the simmering stew. 
#Replace the lid and cook for a further 20-25 minutes, at which time you should have large, light and fluffy dumplings.

Serve the stew and dumplings piping hot straight from the pan with fresh crusty bread and yellow mustard on the side.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

This recipe produces '''gingerbread''', not gingerbread cookies. Gingerbread is a type of spice cake. '''Parkin''', a variation listed at the bottom, is partially [[Cookbook:Oats|oat]]-based.

==Ingredients==
* 4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 4 oz (110g) [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 8 oz (220g) [[Cookbook:Golden Syrup|golden syrup]]
* 8 oz (220g) all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|level teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 level teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mixed Spice|mixed spice]]
* 2 level teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid oz]] (120ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
#Put the butter, sugar, and syrup in a pan. Heat gently until the butter melts.
#Place the dry ingredients in a bowl. Pour the melted butter mixture into the bowl, and beat thoroughly.
#Warm the milk in a pan (so it will dissolve the syrup).
#Add the milk to the bowl, and beat thoroughly.
#Beat the eggs, and then stir them in to the mixture.
#Pour the mixture into an 8-inch (20cm) greased square cake tin.
#Cook at [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|170°C (325°F)]] for one hour.
#Cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then remove.

Leave at least 1 day before cutting into squares.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

*Variant: Parkin
**Instead of 8 oz (220g) (flour, use 4 oz flour (110g) and 4 oz (110g) [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|medium oatmeal]] (likely meaning coarse oat flour, not rolled oats).
**Parkin is traditionally eaten in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|England]] around Bonfire Night.

==Presentation==

With the &quot;light switches&quot; reality check, you check if light switches work normally.

This is one of the less reliable reality checks, but for some people it works perfectly.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I was in my bedroom but it was dark. I tried to switch on the light, but nothing happened. I kept trying for a minute until I realised I was dreaming.

* I dreamed I was working on my computer. I decided to quit and go to bed, so I shut off the computer. As I was walking to my room, I couldn't see anything, so I tried to put on the light by pushing the switch, but the switch didn't work. I ignored this and eventually found the way to my bed. In my bed, I thought: &quot;Wait a minute, the light switch didn't work, I must be dreaming!&quot; However, this excitement caused me to wake up.

* I was dreaming and woke up in my room. I tried to turn on my light switch, but it melted off the wall. It turned into a liquidy substance, like the oily butter you get at most movie theaters.

* (Note that this is not quite the same, but still similar). I was working on the computer at night, when I had been told to go to sleep. Not wanting to bother my room-mate/parents/spouse, who gets annoyed at me working late, I was working with the lights off. When I heard a noise, I thought it might be them waking up, so I quickly tried turning off my computer monitor. However, the button did not work. Even when I tried unplugging the monitor or forcing the computer to shut off, the monitor would not turn off, so I realized I was dreaming.

* I just woke from a nightmare-turned-amusement where the light switch didn't work in my bedroom, leaving me immersed in a frightening darkness... but when I opened my bedroom door, looked out into the hallway, and flipped the switch a few more times, it started changing night to day and day to night outside! Well, okay, then! That got my attention.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I flicked the switch and my light immediately turned on. Luckily though, I always use back up reality checks. So I got lucid anyways. Yay!

* Half the time when I try this, the dream supplies some mundane reason why the switch didn't work. There's a short. A storm has knocked down the power lines. Wait, when was the last time I paid the electric bill?...

Gage of wire.  The larger the gage the smaller the wire if you are using AWG.  Metric sizes go the other way.

==Cables==
Component video and audio.

===Coaxial===

Coaxial cable is an electrical cable consisting of a round, insulated conducting wire surrounded by a round, conducting sheath, usually surrounded by a final insulating layer.

The cable is designed to carry a high-frequency or broadband signal, usually at radio frequencies. Sometimes DC power (called bias) is added to the signal to supply the equipment at the other end, such in direct broadcast satellite receivers. Because the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists (ideally) only in the space between the inner and outer conductors, it cannot interfere with or suffer interference from external electromagnetic fields.

Coaxial cables may be rigid or flexible. Rigid types have a solid sheath, while flexible types have a braided sheath, both usually of copper. The inner insulator, also called the dielectric, has a significant effect on the cable's properties, such as its characteristic impedance and its attenuation. The dielectric may be solid or perforated with air spaces. Coaxial cables are usually terminated with RF connectors.

==Electromagnetics==

Open wire transmission lines have the property that the electromagnetic wave propagating down the line extends into the space surrounding the parallel wires. These lines are low loss, however they have undesirable characteristics. They cannot be bent, twisted or otherwised shaped without changing their characteristing impedance. They also cannot be run along or attached to anything conductive, as the extended fields will induce currents in the nearby conductors causing unwanted radiation and detuning of the line.

Coaxial lines solve this problem by confining the electromagnetic wave to the area inside the cable, between the center conductor and the shield. The line itself forms a coaxial waveguide, and the tranmission of energy in the line occurs totally through the wave that propagates inside the cable between the conductors. Coaxial lines can therefore be bent and twisted without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents on them.

Coaxial lines are filled with a dielectric material that maintains the spacing between the center conductor and shield. Unfortunately, all dielectrics have loss associated with them, which causes most coaxial lines to be lossier than open wire lines.

==Important parameters==
{{wikipedia|surge impedance}}
* The surge impedance, also called the characteristic impedance, can be directly measured with an impedance meter in ohms (Ω) or calculated from the ratio of the inner and outer diameters (ø). Assuming the dielectric properties of the material inside the cable does not vary appreciably over the operating range of the cable, this impedance is frequency independent. The surge impedance does not depend on the length of the cable.
* Capacitance, in farads per metre.
* Resistance, in ohms per metre, can be directly measured with an ohmmeter.
* Attenuation or loss, in decibels per metre. This is dependent on the loss in the dielectric material filling the cable, and resistive losses in the center conductor and shield. These losses are frequency dependent, the losses becoming higher as the frequency increases. In designing a system, engineers must consider not only the loss in the actual cable itself, but also the insertion loss in the connectors.
* Outside diameter ''&amp;phi;'', which dictates which connectors must be used to terminate the cable.

==Standard cable types==
Most coaxial cables have a characteristic impedance of either 50 or 75 ohms. The RF industry uses standard type-names for coaxial cables. The U.S. military uses the RG-# or RG-#/U format (probably for &quot;radio grade, universal&quot;, but other interpretations exist). For example:

* RG-6/U: 75 Ω, low loss at high frequency for satellite television
* RG-11:
* RG-58: 50 Ω,  ''&amp;phi;'' = 0.2 in (5 mm)
* RG-59/U: 75 Ω, ''&amp;phi;'' = 0.25 in (6.5 mm)
* RG-178:
* RG-179: 75 Ω, ''&amp;phi;'' = 2.8 mm

(''&amp;phi;'' = diameter, &amp;Omega;Ω = ohms) 

==Uses of coaxial cable==
Short coaxial cables are commonly used to connect home video equipment, or in ham radio setups.

Long distance coaxial cable is used to connect radio networks and television networks, though this has largely been superseded by other more high-tech methods (fibre optics, T1/E1, satellite).

In broadcasting and other forms of radio communication, hard line is a very heavy-duty coaxial cable, where the outside shielding is a rigid or semi-rigid pipe, rather than flexible and braided wire. Hard line is very thick, typically at least a half inch or 13mm and up to several times that, and has low loss even at high power. It is almost always used in the connection between a transmitter on the ground and the antenna or aerial on the tower. Hard lines are often made to be pressurised with nitrogen or desiccated air, which provide an excellent dielectric even at the high temperatures generated by thousands of watts of RF energy, especially during intense summer heat and sunshine. Physical separation between the inner conductor and outer shielding is maintained by spacers, usually made out of tough solid plastics like nylon.

Triaxial cable also exists, in which a third layer of insulation and sheathing is included. This allows a nearly perfect signal which is both shielded and balanced/differential to pass through. Multi-conductor coaxial cable is also used sometimes.

Biaxial cable or biax is a figure-8 configuration of two 50 ohm coaxial cables, used in some proprietry computer networks.

==Cable Configurations==

===Twisted Pair===

Twisted pair cabling is a common form of wiring where two conductors are wound around each other for the purposes of cancelling out electromagnetic interference known as crosstalk. The number of twists per meter make up part of the specification for a given type of cable. The greater the number of twists, the more crosstalk is reduced.

Shielded twisted pair (STP) has an outer conductive casing similar to coaxial cable and theoretically offers the best protection from interference. It was commonly used for token ring networks.

UTP or unshielded twisted pair is not surrounded by shielding. It is the primary wire type for telephone usage and is very common for computer networking.

UTP is standardized into various categories by number, which indicate signal integrity attributes. Category 5 cable is commonly used for Ethernet with 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX.

In telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard 25 pair color code originally developed by AT&amp;T. A typical subset of these colors (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables.

Audio cables that are twisted are often referred to as balanced. 

==Connectors==

#RJ14 = 6 Double Phone lines
#RJ45 = 8 Ethernet

Everyone knows mains is potentially dangerous. There are however safety features included in plugs. This module looks at how to correctly wire a plug.

===The three pin plug ===
Nowadays most appliances are sold with moulded plugs already fitted. Nevertheless it is still important to understand the correct wiring of a plug because enough of the old plugs still exist. You are very likely to need to change a plug at some time in your life. In the UK mains electricity is 230V. if you were to touch the live wire a current would flow through your body to the ground. This current may be enough to kill you. 

The cable from the appliance usually consist of three wires. The wires are made of copper surrounded by a plastic sheath. The sheath is made of plastic and is coloured:

*The live wire is &lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;'''brown'''&lt;/font&gt;
*The neutral wire is &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/font&gt;
*The earth wire is &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''green'''&lt;/font&gt; &amp; &lt;font color=&quot;eedd00&quot;&gt;'''yellow'''&lt;/font&gt;

The three wires are covered by an outer sheath made of plastic.

'''Q1)'''Use you knowledge of insulators and conductors to explain
:Why are the wires made of copper
:Why are the sheaths made of plastic


[[Image:Plug_diagram.png]]

The plug has the following features:
*A cable grip, to grip the cable and prevent it being pulled out of the plug
*Three pins made of brass. One of which is the earth pin.
*A fuse
*A case made of plastic

'''Q2)''' Why are the pins made of brass and why is the case plastic?

===The purpose of the parts of a plug===
===The live  and neutral wires===
They carry the current around the circuit. Mains current is AC this means that it is going backward and forwards in cycles. (clockwise and anticlockwise around the circuit). The frequency of the cycle is 50 times a second (50 Hertz) This cycling of current is achieved by varying the voltage on the live wire from +230V to -230V and back again. The voltage on the neutral wire does not vary. It stays close to zero ( hence the term neutral). In contrast the voltage of  a battery does not cycle. It says constant. This is known as D.C. (direct current)

The live and neutral pins of a plug often have the half nearest the case surrounded by a plastic shroud. This is to prevent your fingers from touching them if you curl them around the plug as you push the plug into the socket.

'''Q3)'''Why is only the part nearest the cases sheathed. Why not the whole pin?

===The earth wire===
This wire is there to protect you . Many appliances have metal cases. For example kettles, toasters, dishwashers and washing machines. If the live wire were  to become loose inside the appliance and touch the case the whole case would become live. If you were then to touch it a current would flow through you to the earth. The earth wire is just a wire connected to the case of the appliance. It goes down the flex into the socket. In side the wiring of your house it travels down to the earth. It is often connected to a metal plumbing pipe. If the live wire were to touch the case a huge current would flow through the earth wire. This would probably blow the fuse and break the circuit {see next section} but even if the fuse doesn't blow the current would still prefer to flow through a nice low resistance wire than a high resistance human body.

The earth pin on a plug is longer than the live and neutral pins. This ensures that the earth pin always connects with the socket first.

===The fuse===
A fuse is simply a very thin wire. The wire has a low melting point. As current flows through the wire it heats up. If too large a current flows it melts. This breaks the circuit. Fuses are used to protect appliance. If too large a current flows through an appliance it may damage it. It may even cause a fire!

Fuses are rated according to how much current they can carry before melting. In plugs fuses are usually 3A , 5A, or 13A. The correct fuse for an appliance is one that is just above the normal working current for that appliance.

'''Q4)''' A table lamp usually carries a current of 0.5 A what fuse should be put in the plug 3 A, 5A, or 13A?


'''Q5)''' An iron usually carries a current of 5.2 A what fuse should be put in the plug 3 A, 5 A, or 13 A?

'''Q6)'''  A kettle is protected by an earth wire and a 13 A fuse. The live wire comes loose and touches the side of the kettle. The fuse blows. Explain why.
The unit is designed to break the circuit if the current spikes above 13A.

==Summary==
:The ''live wire'' is brown, and has AC voltage of 230 V
:The ''neutral wire'' is blue  and has AC voltage of approximately zero
:The ''earth wire'' is green &amp; yellow and is a safety device designed to protect people from shocks. 
:The ''fuse'' is a device that melts and breaks the circuit when the current gets too high
:The case is made of plastic (an insulator) for safety

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bar Charts ==
The Bar Chart (or Bar Graph) is one of the most common ways of displaying catagorical/qualitative data. Bar Graphs consist of 2 variables, one response (sometimes called &quot;dependent&quot;) and one predictor (sometimes called &quot;independent&quot;), arranged on the horizontal and vertical axis of a graph. The relationship of the predictor and response variables is shown by a mark of some sort (usually a rectangular box) from one variable's value to the other's.

To demonstrate we will use the following data(tbl. 3.1.1) representing a hypothetical relationship between a qualitative predictor variable, &quot;Graph Type&quot;, and a quantitative response variable, &quot;Votes&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

From this data we can now construct an appropriate graphical representation which, in this case will be a Bar Chart. The graph may be orientated in several ways, of which the vertical chart (fig. 3.1.1) is most common, with the horizontal chart(fig. 3.1.2) also being used often&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font size=1&gt;fig. 3.1.1 - vertical chart&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:BarChartExampleVertical.PNG|Vertical Bar Chart Example]]&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font size=1&gt;fig. 3.1.2 - horizontal chart&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:BarChartExampleHorizontal.PNG|Horizontal Bar Chart Example]]&lt;br&gt;

Take note that the height and width of the bars, in the vertical and horizontal Charts, respectfully, are equal to the response variable's corresponding value - &quot;Bar Chart&quot; bar equals the number of votes that  the Bar Chart type received in tbl. 3.1.1

Also take note that there is a pronounced amount of space between the individual bars in each of the graphs, this is important in that it help differentiate the Bar Chart graph type from the Histogram graph type discussed in a later section.

Tenstrokes®
Graphic Alphabet™
Internet-Chinese® SCRIPT 

 TENSTROKES® ALPHABET &amp;
THE INTERNET-CHINESE SCRIPT™

 ABSTRACT: The Internet-Chinese script evolved from the TENSTROKES® Graphic Alphabet. It is both a graphic and a phonic Alphabet, with only 10 Stroke-letters. This Tenstrokes® can spell both Latin Letters, Chinese characters and symbols. 

INTRODUCTION: TENSTROKES® Alphabet is the standardized Transcode™ of multilingual scripts, including the 10 Indo-Arabic Numerals, 26 Latin alphabet Letters and the 60 thousands or more of Chinese graphic characters, and innumerable multicultural graphic symbols. In short, all letters, numbers and graphics can be unified into one set of alphabetic code. In 1961, Dr. Tien discovered the TENSTROKES® Transcode©. By 1999, China Standardization Association had certified TiENSTROKES™ script as standardized Internet-Chinese®, an alternative script to Chinese characters and English, in sending e-mails.

TiENSTROKES©

For example, A,  0 and  Ä¾ can all be spelled with the same set of TiENSTROKES letters. That is, 

The fact that TENSTROKES® Alphabet can spell English letters and symbols as well as Chinese characters, and modernized Internet-Chinese script, heralds new steps in global education and world trade, East-West, across WWW.

Internet-Chinese script is now a Web reality. It is being used to e-mail like English. Internet-Chinese is plainly readable to all who are using the Latin Alphabet. In our Information Age of communication tools and digital literary education, it will connect East and West more closely and efficiently.

  Chinese can now learn English faster, and Americans can learn the Internet-Chinese faster. And at the same time, any English-speaking person can acquire the ability in reading and spelling &quot;Ideograms=Haanzii’ and, at the touch of button, converting Internet-Chinese words to &quot;ºº ×Ö = ºº ×Ö &quot;, the beautiful Chinese characters as easily as our ancient or modern calligraphers, using TiENSTROKES™ software tools and Internet-Chinese Spellcheckers. Cogently, today learning Internet-Chinese is as easy as learning French or any other latinized language script.

What first step should I take, if I am interested in TiENSTROKES®?  

Take 3 steps:

[] FIRST STEP. Begin with TiENSTROKES! It only takes 10 minutes to learn TiENSTROKES™ Alphabet. (See table above).

[] THE SECOND STEP: After the TiENSTROKES™,  learn a little Internet-Chinese.  This will add fun, understanding and  friendship, to learn about the other side of the world. An Introductory INTERNET-CHINESE© Lesson is in the table  below.

For further lessons, and much, much more, see:  
CHINESE FOR EVERYONE™ 

[] THE THIRD STEP:  Plan a trip to China. See  the other side of the world. Visit  the Great Wall. See the Three Gorges. Visit Terra Cotta Warriors in XiAn.  Learn a new culture, a new language, and try new food. Lots and lots of fun!

Above all, ENJOY LIFE.

Bon Voyage! A safe trip! Yih Luu Pinng An! Ò» Â• Æ½ °²!

Questions and Answers on PINXXIEE

A Peking-born Michigan Doctor has discovered a Tenstrokes alphabet of only 10 letters, that can teach anybody in the world (who already knows the English Alphabet) within an hour to decode any Chinese character independently. No prior knowledge of Chinese is required.  With the Tenstrokes alphabet, Dr H. C. Tien has created a computer-compatible Chinese script (PINXXIEE), an alphabetic touch-typeable language, like English, which is a perfect tool for English-Chinese communication and creates a new way of processing Chinese language on computer.  With this PINXXIEE script and today's computer technology, it is now practical and profitable to touch-type on a standard computer keyboard. Dr. Tien has received patents on his technology in China and in United States, 1n 1992 and 1993, respectively.

  Q.  What are PINXXIEE's general features?
   A.  PINXXIEE is a general language technology that has both phonetics-&amp;-graphics(x) in its script (containing both alphabet and icons). The common features are: 1. The phonetic scripts are for the &quot;ear&quot;, whereas the graphic scripts are for the &quot;eye&quot;. For example, the English letters of &quot;ABC...&quot; are used to transcribe and decipher sounds; and the Chinese strokes of &quot;- | /...&quot; are used to transcribe and decipher shapes. Pinxxiee spellings combine both basic phonetic and graphic information of Chinese characters into a unique and unified PX spelling for each Chinese character. For example: MAXX.
MAXX = MA(sound of ma) + XX(shape for female) =&gt; maxx(mother)

   Q. What is the basic discovery of PINXXIEE language technology?
   A. The Chinese Tenstrokes Global Alphabet.

   Q.  What are its unique features?
   A.  The Tenstrokes Alphabet has only 10 letters: V H L J I T G N C Z, associated with 10 strokes: 
` - | / \ / \ ) ( z, to form the Global Alphabet or Tenstrokes Transcode(TM):
V` H- L| J/ I\ T/ G\ N) C( Zz.

   Q.  What is the nature of this Transcode(TM)?
   A.  Tenstrokes are the elementary &quot;particles&quot; of linguistics, analogous to those in physics; and the letter are &quot;atoms&quot;. For instance, the English letter 'A' can be split into 3 strokes JIH: / \ - =&gt; A; or the Chinese character THREE can also be split into 3 different strokes HHH: - - - =&gt; = =_(3); (you need a Chinese character word processor to see the nature of the graphics more accurately).

   Q.  What are the benefits of using this product to user?
   A.  Pinxxiee Language Technology empowers the users to utilize the existing keyboards, software and hardware on the international market for multilingual word processing and data transfer, including Chinese, Japanese or English getting prepared for the multilingual Information Superhighway.

   Q.  Who are some of the major clients of this technology?
   A.  Purdue University, CBS, EDS, Encyclopaedia Britannica, 6 Peking schools; Peking University, Peking Normal College, Huiwen and Chongwen elementary and middle schools in China, Chinese Consulate in Chicago, and other corporate translators and academic centers have acquired the PX2001 language software.

   Q.  What products have these centers acquired from PINXXIEE Corporation?
   A.  Pinyin+Plus ChineseStar for Windows 3.1
              Pinyin+Plus Input Diskette
              Pinyin+Plus Dictionary (hard copy)
              Pinyin+PX2001 Tutor 1.1
              ChineseStar 2.0 for windows 3.1

    Q.  Is this technology patented, copyrighted and/or trademarked?
    A.  Yes. PINXXIEE Technology has received copyrights and trademarks since 1961. And PINXXIEE obtained both China patent (1992) and US patent (1993). An article by Washington Post (1985) gave the history and an article by Chicago Chinese Times (1994) gave more recent details.

    Q.  What is PX2001 software?
    A.  It is a tutor that teaches the Pinxxiee Language Technology.
PX2001 1.1 is a basic Chinese language learning and word processing software program, and it has broad applications and implications for users interested in R&amp;D with multilingual technology for the information industry the near future (1-5 years).

   Q.  What will Pinxxiee do for me?
   A.  Because Pinxxiee is inherently multi/translingual, it will assist 

   Q. Why would I use Pinxxiee over Pinyin?
    A.  The alphabet is very effective in the development of pronunciation and the learning process in general, which is why Pinyin  was developed. A natural alphabetic language assists in pronunciation and provides meaning. The Pinxxiee alphabet does this, whereas the Pinyin alphabet only assists in pronunciation.

   Q.  Chinese has been talked about though out most of this book, but Pinxxiee is referred to as a multilingual language. Can Pinxxiee do other languages?
   A.  Yes. Most ideographic languages derive from Chinese, which is why it is referred to as a multilingual language. 

   Q.  If I learn Pinxxiee, can it help me with other language?
    A.  Yes. In a basic sense you can always revert back to TiENSTROKES to represent any letter or character. But in a practical sense once you have bridged the gap between alphabetic and ideographic languages, your ability to learn and use any language is greatly increased. For instance, this is especially useful for programmers interested in developing multilingual computer systems.

PINXXIEE HISTORY CAIS'99

Back Side of the Rosetta Stone

    Today in 1999, one-fifth of the world's population is Chinese. And the remaining four-fifths can't read Chinese characters. How do we improve communication between China and the rest of the world, for example with the United States? Since 1873, the American invention of typewriter by Sholes &amp; Remington motivated countless attempts to adapt the ideographic script into a touch typable format like English; and up to now, over a thousand encoding methods have been devised to input ancient Chinese ideographs into the modern computer. so far, none has achieved the efficiency and flexibility to match the Latin phonetic script. The Chinese bottleneck remains. There may exist a historical missing link to be discovered, comparable to the Rosetta Stone of Egypt. 

    H. C. Tien, M.D., a practicing physician working with children, discovered such a scientific link between the tow major languages of the world, Roman letters and Chinese characters. After more than 25 years of research and development, he perfected the Tenstrokes Pinxxiee script (pin-shay, meaning phonics-graphics), with a Tenstrokes language theory and technology, linking to the Egyptian Rosetta Stone(196 BC, in the reign of Ptolemy V).

    The Rosetta Stone helped French linguist Jean-Francois Champollion(1790-1832), with the aid of English physician-physicist Thomas Young(1773-1829) and his insight of reading Hieroglyphic graphic signs as alphabetic phonic letters, thus deciphering the inscrutable Egyptian Hieroglyphics, linking to Demotic and Greek. Thence to French and to English.

     In 1961, Dr. Tien gained insight into children's dyslexia and reversed the reading of English phonetic letters back to Chinese ideographic signs. He thus discovered and created a basic Tenstrokes Alphabet as if it were on the &quot;Back side of Rosetta Stone&quot;. It now enable anyone in the world to learn Chinese Characters more easily. This discovery attracted scientists and scholars, East &amp; west, because Tenstrokes turned out to be a phonographic alphabet underpinning all the world's languages. This global alphabet similarly deciphers the inscrutable Chinese Ideographics, linking to Pinxxiee and English, completing the circle. In fact, this alphabetic Transcode actually serves as the missing link between the various linguistic cultures of the world.

      CAIS'99(ComputerChinese Auto Input System)™ is the embodiment of the e-Chinese translingual tool now available in personal computer and palm computers. TiENSTROKES can be used at once as a central switch to multilingual translations amongst all the languages on the Web.

     TiENSTROKES will help build electronic Chinese links with English and Indo-European languages as well as with other Sino-Asian languages on the Multilingual Information Superhighway( MISH™) for current Internet applications, and for the expansion of the World Wide Web. 

     The discovery of Tenstrokes Alphabet truly bridges East &amp; West in the global Information Age.

THE TREE MODEL OF LANGUAGE CONVERTER
Multilingual Information Super-Highway (MISH):

By H. C. Tien, M.D. 
An Introduction to PINXXIEE Translingual Dictionary, 
World Journal Press, 1990

In 1947, Warren Weaver, Director of the Natural Sciences Division of the Rockefeller Foundation, wrote to Professor Norbert Wiener at MIT, a memo that launched machine translation (MT). By 1955, Weaver was seeking &quot;a system of prelinguistic symbols (that) underlies all human languages, like a shared source code of thought. If such a system could be discovered, or created, it could be used as medium for converting ideas from one language into another. By translating the words in an original text into this code, and then translating back into the desired language, the code could be used as a universal interface between languages.&quot;

In 1961, unbeknownst of Warren Weaver’s search, Dr. Tien, indeed, researching with Rorschach inkblots and Chinese characters, discovered the first fragment of a code for his language converter linking to the ancient Rosetta Stone. And by 1999, he perfected precisely such a basic system of prelinguistic symbols, named Tenstrokes Transcode[ . TiENSTROKES® also provided the long-sought solution to the Chinese Homophone Puzzle. Defying the dire predictions of nearly all world classical linguists, Dr. Tien’s Transcode made it possible to transform traditional Chinese characters into the modernized and linearized Internet-Chinese script, directly readable like English and learnable like French.

And so, the alphabetic spelling of an ideographic character like ‘ Ä¾ ’ is ‘ HLJY ’ or in its prelinguistic symbols 
‘ Ò» Ø­ Ø¯«£ ’ , which is same for all languages. But, of course, the pronunciation or its phonetic spelling of

 Ä¾ ó Ò» Ø­ Ø¯«£ ó HLJY ó Tree

for any language is uniquely different for each and every one, that is, for example, ‘Tree’ in English, ‘Arbre’ in French, ‘Baum’ in German, and so on, or now ‘Muuh’ in the Internet-Chinese, a new lingua sinica on MISH . [See Tree Model]

This is a significant development for the world of education since students need only to learn the basic 10-letter Chinese stroke alphabet to map 10 English letters, in order to learn convert the entire language (see Global Alphabet Chart). Truly prophetic, in 1955 Warren Weaver, the foremost theoretician of MT (Machine Translation) actually wrote: &quot;It is very tempting to say that a book written in Chinese is simply a book written in English which was coded into ‘Chinese code.’ We have useful methods for solving almost any cryptographic problem, may it not be that with proper interpretation we already have useful methods for translation?&quot; The answer is &quot;Yes, and it’s all Chinese!&quot;

And again, Dr. Tien successfully published such a trilingual tutorial book, decoding &quot;Chinese For Everyone&quot;, using CCC’s TiENSTROKES® MarcoPolo Converter 2003.

[ Tenstrokes® Transcode is a system of prelinguistic symbols, because it is a motion alphabet of 10 directional strokes, according to Pinxxiee Theory (pron. pin-shay, meaning phonics+graphics). It can draw Chinese characters and it can even ‘spell’ English letters with the same stroke alphabet. Today, would colleagues of Prof. Weaver or Erwin Reifler recognize this example? The big English letter E is made of 4 stroke letters Ø­ Ò» Ò» Ò» ó E (phonic); however, the square Chinese character King,Íõ (graphic) is also made of the same 4 stroke letters Ò» Ò» Ø­ Ò» , except for their sequence. And so it is for all 26 English letters and for 2,500 basic Chinese characters, which Chinese elementary school children must all learn by rote memory in order to become literate.

Students take two or three years of Spanish or French and six months after their last class all they remember is how to count to ten and say hello and good-bye. Why will it be any different with Mandarin-Chinese? Because of TiENSTROKES, which is the key that unlocks the entire Mandarin-Chinese language. Students will learn to read, write, and decode the 100 most commonly used Chinese graphic characters. That beats hello or good-bye in Spanish or French.

Quick answer to that question that is going through your mind. Why won't they forget the hundred words of Mandarin-Chinese? The reason they won't forget the first 100 words, or the hundreds to follow as the program progresses, is that they need only to remember the TiENSTROKES (10 STROKES)! This is the link between English script, Internet-Chinese, and Chinese graphic characters.

Still wondering about how you will motivate your students to learn a new language, especially Chinese? Let them know that TiENSTROKES and Mandarin-Chinese is part art class! That's right. What other language do you know of where the characters of a tree actually look like a tree when you write (draw) them out using TiENSTROKES. Chinese is the most artistically creative language in the world and our students deserve the opportunity to learn it through the user-friendliest software on the market ... TiENSTROKES</text>

== '''Op-Amp''' (operational amplifier)==
Op-amp stands for operational amplifier. It is available in IC (Integrated Circuit) chip. It is an electronic circuit of many electronic components already connected and packaged inside a chip of many pins for external connection. Originally, op-amps were so named because they were used to model the basic mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, integration, differentiation, etc. in electronic analog computers.  In this sense a true operational amplifier is an ideal circuit element.

==741 Op-amp ==
===Symbol===
The 741 op-amp has a symbol as shown.
:[[image:opamppinouts.png|op-amp]]

Its terminals are:
*V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;: noninverting input
*V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;: inverting input
*V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;: output
*V&lt;sub&gt;S+&lt;/sub&gt;: positive power supply
*V&lt;sub&gt;S&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;: negative power supply

===Operation===
The 741 op-amp can be thought as Universal Voltage Difference Amplifier. The main function of the 747 op-amp is to amplify the difference of two input voltages which can be expressed mathematically like below
:&lt;math&gt;V_o = A(V_+ - V_-)&lt;/math&gt;

From
:&lt;math&gt;V_o = A(V_+ - V_-)&lt;/math&gt; . The op-amp acts as a voltage difference amplifier.

It can be shown that an op-amp can function as a noninverting voltage amplifier or inverting voltage amplifier.
: &lt;math&gt;V_o = A V_+&lt;/math&gt; .  &lt;math&gt;V_- = 0&lt;/math&gt; . The op-amp acts as a noninverting voltage amplifier.
: &lt;math&gt;V_o = - A V_-&lt;/math&gt; .  &lt;math&gt;V_+ = 0&lt;/math&gt; . The op-amp acts as an inverting voltage amplifier.

Also, it can be shown that an op-amp can function as a voltage comparator
: &lt;math&gt;V_o = 0 &lt;/math&gt; .  &lt;math&gt;V_- = V_+&lt;/math&gt; . No difference between the two input voltages
: V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;S+&lt;/sub&gt; .  &lt;math&gt;V_+ &gt; V_-&lt;/math&gt; . Non Inverting input voltage is greater than the Inverting input voltage
: V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;S-&lt;/sub&gt; .  &lt;math&gt;V_- &gt; V_+&lt;/math&gt;. Inverting input voltage is greater than the Non Inverting input voltage.

== Ideal Op-amps ==
The output voltage is the difference between the + and - inputs multiplied by the open-loop gain
: V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;) * A&lt;sub&gt;vo&lt;/sub&gt;.

The ideal op-amp has 
: an infinite open-loop gain, 
: infinite input impedances and 
: zero output impedance.  
: The input impedance is the impedance seen between the noninverting and inverting inputs. 
&lt;!--
You and I may know what you are talking about, but that's only because we already know about op-amps. If someone is trying to *learn* about op-amps,
they don't already know what &quot;input impedance&quot; or &quot;input offset&quot; is all about. Perhaps we could discuss these ideas *after* we introduce the ideal op-amp?

I agree to some degree but I'll explain input and output impedances.  Offsets, bandwidth, noise and thermal drift are unnecessary.
--&gt;

The model for the op-amp is shown in Figure 1. Where V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;; R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is the input impedance;  R&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is the output impedance; A&lt;sub&gt;vo&lt;/sub&gt; is the open loop gain; and R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the source impedance.

[[Image:Op_Amp_Model.PNG|300px]]
:Figure 1: The model of the op-amp.

Using voltage divider rule, we can determine the voltage v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;v_d=\frac {V_{in}R_{in}}{R_{in}+R_{s}}&lt;/math&gt; (1)
Since the dependent voltage source amplifies the voltage v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; by A&lt;sub&gt;vo&lt;/sub&gt;.  We can work out the output voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; once again using voltage divider rule.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{out}=\frac {A_{vo}v_dR_{L}}{R_{L}+R_{out}}&lt;/math&gt; (2)

Substituting equation 1 into 2.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{out}=\frac {A_{vo}V_{in}R_{in}R_{L}}{(R_{L}+R_{out})(R_{in}+R_{s})}&lt;/math&gt;

Now if the properties of an Ideal op-amp are applied.  The ideal properties of an op-amp are infinite input impedance and zero output impedance.  Since R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt;, much greater than, R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; 1.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{out}=A_{vo}V_{in} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Which is basically the definition of an op-amp.  But if the input impedance was not infinite and the output impedance nonzero then this would not be so.

==Real Op-amps==

Real op-amps are (normally) built as an [[wikipedia:Integrated Circuit|integrated circuit]], but occasionally with discrete transistors or vacuum tubes. A Real op-amp is an approximation of an Ideal op-amp.  A real op-amp does not have infinite open loop gain, infinite input impedance nor zero output impedance.  Real op-amps also create noise in the circuit, have an offset voltage, thermal drift and finite bandwidth.

An offset voltage 
: means that there exists a voltage v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; when both inputs are grounded.  This offset is called an input offset because the voltage v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is offset from its ideal value of zero volts.  The input offset voltage is multiplied by the open loop gain to create an output offset voltage.

Thermal drift 
: means that the characteristics of the op-amp change with temperature.  That is the open loop gain, input and output impedances, offset voltages and bandwidth change as the temperature changes.

Finite bandwidth
: Op-amps are made up of transistors.  Transistors can only respond at a certain rate because of certain capacitances that they have.  This means that the op-amps cannot respond fast enough to frequencies above a certain level.  This level is the bandwidth.

Modern integrated circuit MOSFET op-amps approximate closer and closer to these ideals in limited-bandwidth, large-signal applications at room temperature.  When the approximation is reasonably close, we go ahead and call the practical device an 'op-amp', forget its limitations and use the thinking and formulae given in this article.

=== DC Behaviour ===
Open-loop gain is defined as the amplification from input to output without any feedback applied. For most practical calculations, the open-loop gain is assumed to be infinite; in reality, however, it is limited by the amount of voltage applied to power the operational amplifier, i.e. Vs+ and Vs- in the above diagram. Typical devices exhibit open loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. This allows the gain in the application to be set simply and exactly by using negative feedback. Of course theory and practice differ, since op-amps have limits that the designer must keep in mind and sometimes work around.

=== AC Behaviour ===
The op-amp gain calculated at DC does not apply at higher frequencies.  This effect is due to limitations within the op-amp itself, such as its finite bandwidth, and to the AC characteristics of the circuit in which it is placed.  The best known stumbling-block in designing with op-amps is the tendency for the device to resonate at high frequencies, where negative feedback changes to positive feedback due to parasitic lowpasses.

Typical low cost, general purpose op-amps exhibit a gain bandwidth product of a few MHz. Specialty and high speed op-amps can achieve gain bandwidth products of 100s of MHz.

== Quick Design Process ==

Imagine we have a (weak) input signal, and we want to amplify it to generate a strong output signal; or we have several different voltages, and we want to add them together. For these purposes, we need op-amp amplifying and summing circuits. It seems that there is nothing new to say about these bare (usually single op-amp) circuits. Only, the innovator [http://dknollman.122mb.com/ Dieter Knollman] has suggested a new simpler design procedure in an [http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4341150/03-02-98-Designing-with-op-amps-Single-formula-technique-keeps-it-simple EDN's article] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4341150/03-02-98-Designing-with-op-amps-Single-formula-technique-keeps-it-simple Single-formula technique keeps it simple] - EDN's article by Dieter Knollman, PhD, Lucent Technologies&lt;/ref&gt;. He has also placed his [http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/index.htm work] on the web&lt;ref&gt;[http://dknollman.122mb.com/k9analysis/index.htm K9 analysis] make analog circuit design and analysis doggone simple&lt;/ref&gt; (see also a [[Circuit Idea/Simple Op-amp Summer Design|circuit story]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Circuit Idea/Simple Op-amp Summer Design|How to Simplify the Design of the Mixed Op-amp Voltage Summer]] (after EDN's [http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4341150/03-02-98-Designing-with-op-amps-Single-formula-technique-keeps-it-simple Single-formula technique keeps it simple)]&lt;/ref&gt; written after Dieter's work). 


We assume:

* All inputs are ideal voltage sources.
* Gain is defined as the gain from the ideal voltage source to the op-amp output.
* The feedback resistor, Rf, connects from the op-amp output to the inverting input.
* The input resistor, Ri, connects from the ideal voltage source input to the op-amp input. (This *includes* any source resistance).
** positive-gain inputs connect (through that resistor) to V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;
** negative-gain inputs connect (through that resistor) to V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;

Design procedure:

* First, specify the desired circuit gains for each input.
* Then calculate the ground gain, as follows:

: '''Daisy's theorem:'''
: ''The sum of the gains ='' +1 ''in a properly-designed op-amp circuit.''

Therefore, choose

: Ground gain = 1 -­ ( the sum of the desired positive and negative gains).

* Choose a feedback-resistor value. For example, let Rf=100 kiloOhms.

* Next, calculate the resistor values for each input, including the ground-gain resistor, using

: &lt;math&gt;Ri = \frac {Rf} { |gain| }&lt;/math&gt;.

:where |''gain''| is the [[:w:absolute value|absolute value]] of the desired gain.


Some op-amp circuits need a resistor to ground from the op-amp's inverting input.
Others need a resistor to ground on the noninverting input.
The sign of the ground gain determines where to place the ground resistor.

If the desired gains add up to one, a resistor to ground is unnecessary.

----

You will see below some examples that illustrate using the quick design procedure. First of all, answer the question, &quot;What's the highest and lowest output voltage you want?&quot; Make sure the power terminals of the op-amp are at least that high and low. (If you want it to swing from +5&amp;nbsp;V to -5&amp;nbsp;V, then an op-amp connected to 0&amp;nbsp;V and +10&amp;nbsp;V won't work).




The generic op-amp has two inputs and one output.  (Some are made with floating, differential outputs.)  The output voltage is a multiple of the difference between the two inputs:

''floating outputs? Are you perhaps misunderstanding &quot;fully differential amplifier&quot; ?''

:V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = G(V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;)

G is the open-loop gain of the op-amp.  The inputs are assumed to have very high impedance; negligible current will flow into or out of the inputs.  Op-amp outputs have very low source impedance.

If an Operational Amplifier is used with positive feedback it can act as an oscillator.

=== Other Notation ===

The power supply pins (V&lt;sub&gt;S+&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;S&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;) can be labeled many different ways.  For FET based op-amps, the positive, common drain supply is labeled V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; and the negative, common source supply is labeled V&lt;sub&gt;SS&lt;/sub&gt;.  For BJT based op-amps, the V&lt;sub&gt;S+&lt;/sub&gt; pin becomes V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;S&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt; becomes V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt;.  They are also sometimes labeled V&lt;sub&gt;CC+&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;CC&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;, or even V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;, in which case the inputs would be labeled differently.  The function remains the same.



== Fully Differential Amplifier ==

=== Basic Applications ===

''... insert drawings of basic FDA amplifying circuits here ...''


=== Fully Differential Amplifier versus Instrumentation Amplifier ===

An instrumentation amplifier has extremely high input impedance-- much higher than the input impedance of a fully differential amplifier (once all the feedback resistors are in place).
So an instrumentation amplifier is better for measuring voltage inputs with unknown (and possibly time-varying) output resistance.

A fully differential amplifier is better than an instrumentation amplifier for precisely generating differential output voltages, with good rejection of differential noise on the input, output, and power lines.

=== Applying a Quick Design Procedure ===

Can we apply Dieter's procedure to a fully differential amplifier? We can, if we revise it a little:

: '''Daisy's theorem revised:'''
: ''The sum of the gains ='' 0 ''in a properly-designed fully differential amplifier circuit.''


Here is the FDA quick design procedure: 

* Use equal feedback resistors Rf, one from the + output to the - input, and one from the - output to the + input. Connect the &quot;common&quot; input to the appropriate voltage source.
* The sum of the gains = zero in a properly-designed fully differential amplifier circuit (note that this new formulation differs from Daisy's theorem, which claims that the sum is always 1). 
* Calculate resistor values for each input, using Ri = Rf / |desired gain|.
* For inputs with positive gain, connect the calculated resistor value between that input and the + input on the amplifier.
* For inputs with negative gain, connect the calculated resistor value between that input and the - input on the amplifier.
* If all your inputs are differential pairs, then the sum of all the gains is now zero. Done. Otherwise add a ground resistor to bring the total gain to zero.

==Index Reorganization==
I'm new here but I'm studying this subject at the moment (on a fairly simple A-Level.. level) and I'm taking an exam on it within the next few months. I thought I might be able to make a contribution. Since this book is fairly skeltal at the moment I'd like to suggest an alternative structure, especially since most of the stuff in the introduction section at the moment doesn't seem very introductory:

* Introduction
* Macromolecular Structure
** Proteins
*** Structure
**** Primary Structure
**** ..etc
*** Denaturation
***Examples
**** Hemoglobin (since it's a protein, and all)
**** Myoglobin
** Carboyhydrates
*** Monosaccharides
*** Disaccharides
*** Polysaccharides
** Lipids
** DNA/RNA structure
*** Differences between the two
* Enzymes (following on from the protein thing)
** Catalysis
** Factors effecting enzyme activity
*** Temperature, concentration, all that stuff
*** Inhibition
* Metabolism
** Human
*** sugar metabolism - glycolysis
*** krebs cycle
*** lipid metabolism
*** mitochondrial metabolism
*** alcohol metabolism
** Plant
** Yeast / Bacterial
* Membranes
* Genetics - use the [[Genetics]] book?
** DNA
*** Replication
** RNA
*** Protein Synthesis
** transcription
*** RNA Processing
** translation
* Biochemical Methods
** Spectroscopy
** X-ray diffraction
** NMR
** Genetics
*** Western/Northern/Southern blotting
*** PCR
* Molecular Biology / Cellular Biochemisry
** dna damage and repair
** development
** cell cycle
** cell signalling
** Signal transduction
** immunology
* Biochemistry Dictionary ?? just a thought

However, it's most likely others know more than me, so I haven't made any changes yet.
[[User:Richard Brierley|Richard]] 15:33, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: I think it's time to reorganize the index dramatically. A good index with a good hierarchy would be an optimal startpoint to write articles. I'm beginning to add structure and materials in the Proteins section (since it's &quot;my field&quot;), but I'm not convinced of the actual structure of this WikiBook, both in the abstract and the practical sense. I'm still not so familiar with Wiki and I'm still new here,so I don't feel to redirect and rebuild indexes at my will. Anyway, the Richard catched the point. It's time to work on an index.
[[User:Cyclop|Cyclop]] 12.50, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)
:: Looking at the index it seems to be more focused on exploring each topic in depth, instead of covering a range as a lecture series might (a series of three lecture classes covering successive levels of content). My lecture series went through 
::* General macromolecular overview (the amino acids, proteins made from aa's, (deoxy)nucleotides, DNA/RNA structure, Lipids, carbohydrates), then onto enzymes, different metabolic functions (how enzymes do things faster), then going more in depth with carbs and into metabolism
::* In depth class on DNA, RNA, and the full processes in the central dogma (replication, transcription regulation, transcription, post transcriptional modification, nuclear export in eukaryotes, translational regulation, mRNA turnover, translation, post translational modification),biochemical techniques (both current and historical), and coverage of small non-coding RNA species (rRNA, tRNA, gRNA, snoRNA, siRNA, micro RNA, silencing, etc).
::* In depth class on proteins. Review of previous classes including amino acids, and primary through quaternary structure with added depth. Still in this course so I can't speak for all of the material yet.
::There's two use cases I think will be most common. A multiple course, in-depth coverage of what amounts to the entire book, or secondly an overview course that just takes bits and pieces out, mostly from the more introductory information.

== Biochem Bookshelf? ==

Biochemistry is a much bigger topic than I think wikibooks gives it credit for at the moment, can I suggest creating a whole bookshelf for Biochemistry. This would then be able to take advantage of the other books already (being) written such as genetics and immunology. this would then allow us to create books containing logical sections and peripheral subjects of biochemistry. we do seem to be lacking a metabolism, experimental methods, biophysics &amp; energetics, and macromolecular structure &amp; function sections which can be whole books in their own right. This would also stop any unnecessary repetition of the same info again and again, how many of the books in the biology category have genetics sections? Instead of writing a whole book from scratch, why don't we consolidate all the information on biochemistry (or rather the [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology|Molecular and Cellular Biology WikiProject]]) in wikipedia into a single consistent book.

== Pymol ==

I noticed the apparent lack of pictures (or content for that matter) and well I thought it might help to get a few pictures.  [http://pymol.sourceforge.net PyMOL] is a molecular imaging program.  It can be used to draw protein, DNA, and even water structure.  Best of all it's open source and takes images in PNG format.  Hope this helps.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 06:01, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: Thanks for mentioning this! I've spent the summer getting to grips with it and it's amazing. :) --[[User:81.178.101.159|81.178.101.159]] 21:10, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

== Hi I would like to work on this book as well ==

I think this is a really cool idea and I'm excited to work on this book! I am a third year biochemistry student at the University of Vermont, and I think this will be a great way for me to both at once learn and teach biochemistry. Since no one has started on the lipids section, I will start there if no one else is currently working on it. I have never used Wiki Books before, so if you notice any mistakes I may be making, feel free to tell me!

--[[User:Brandon|Brandon]] 13:12, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Combine Lipids and Membranes ==

I am going to combine the lipids and membranes chapters, since one naturaly leads into to the other.

== I'd like to help too ==

Like Brandon, I'd like to help out on this book and hoefully when I get some time (after my exams) i'll be able to get some stuff up. Does anyone else think the name of the book 'Biology Biochemistry' sounds a bit strange. Why not simply 'Biochemisty'?

--[[User:Donkey|Donkey]] 23:51, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
: I agree, &quot;Biology Biochemistry&quot; is redundant and should be changed to &quot;Biochemistry&quot;.  Any objections? [[User:Mike Kascel|Mike]] 07:22, August 9, 2005 (UTC)

==&quot;energy metabolism&quot; in detail ==

The chemistry of the main metabolic pathways (Glycolysis, TCA Cycle, NADH dehydrogenase and Electron Transport Chain) should be added.  I can volunteer to do this, but I would want to do it one chemical step at a time, which is A LOT of reactions to draw.. I haven't used the program mentioned above but will try it, if anyone has any other suggestions program-wise that would be great. [[User:Mike Kascel|Mike Kascel]] 07:27, August 9, 2005 (UTC)

: Hey Mike, if you're talking about PyMOL (as mentioned by Alsocal) then that's a great program for viewing 3D structures of molecules but wont be useful for drawing chemical reactions. For that you'd be better off using a program like ChemDraw or, i think, ISIS draw. I have access to those but don't really know the reactions that would be required. Could someone tell me what sort of things would be required? --[[User:81.178.101.159|81.178.101.159]] 21:10, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

:: ChemDraw or ISIS draw should be ok for drawing the 2D structures. Luciano

== Enzyme/Kinetics ==

&lt;strike&gt;Please be sure to include a section related to Enzyme Kinetics/Kinetics&lt;/strike&gt;, Michaelis Menton, Vmax, double reciprocal plots, etc.

I see this now, under the the Catalysis section, however it would be prudent to insert information (namely, equations/derivations) and how you get the respective Vmax and Km values. It is an integral part of biochemistry/enzyme catalysis and kinetics. Please include this as you edit your book.

I am involed with a current project in Wikipedia Chemistry, however some time during my studies and outside project I will find time to drop by and read and review your hard work :D

== The Sovereign ==

The role of head of state in the United Kingdom is held by the Sovereign; the present Sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II.


=== Succession to the throne ===

As a hereditary monarchy, the rules for succession to the throne are established by common law, as modified by statute.

In accordance with the ''Act of Settlement'' (1701), on the death of the Sovereign he or she is succeeded by his or her &quot;heir of the body&quot;; this operates in accordance with the principle of ''male-preference primogeniture''.  If the Sovereign has only one child, that child succeeds.  If there are more than one children, then the order of succession is determined first by sex, and then by age.  The oldest son always succeeds, even if he has a sister who is older than him.

If the Sovereign dies childless (&quot;without issue&quot;) then the order of succession is applied to their siblings: the oldest surviving brother then succeeds, even if he has a sister who is older than him.  If the Sovereign's siblings have died before he or she died, then the order of succession works through the sons and daughters of the next oldest deceased brother, and so on.

Only legitimate children are able to succeed.  The ''Royal Marriages Act 1772'' operates to restrict the capacity for a potential heir to marry without the Sovereign's approval: all descendants of King George II, other than women who have married into foreign families, are required to obtain the Sovereign's consent before marrying, unless they can otherwise obtain approval from both Houses of Parliament.

The ''Bill of Rights'' (1689) and ''Act of Settlement'' require all heirs to be descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover (d. 1714), and impose further requirements that an heir be a Protestant, that they may never have married a Roman Catholic, and that they be in full communion with the Church of England.  Heirs not meeting these conditions are skipped over as if &quot;naturally dead&quot;.


=== The role of the Sovereign beyond the United Kingdom ===

As Sovereign in right of the United Kingdom, the Sovereign is also head of state in the &quot;Crown dependencies&quot; of Jersey, Guernsey (and its dependencies), and the Isle of Man.  While the external relations of these islands is dealt with by the United Kingdom, however, they do not form part of the United Kingdom itself, and have their own constitutional arrangements.

Similarly, the United Kingdom has sovereignty over various territories around the world, known as the ''British overseas territories''.  As such, the Sovereign is also head of state in these territories, although again these do not form part of the United Kingdom itself, and have their own constitutional arrangements.

The British Sovereign is also the Sovereign of certain other ''Commonwealth Realms'': Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Each of these nations is a separate monarchy; the Sovereign therefore holds sixteen different crowns. In each nation, the Sovereign is represented by a Governor-General, who generally stands in relation to the local government in the same relation as the Sovereign does to the British government.

Finally, the Sovereign has the title ''Head of the Commonwealth''. The Commonwealth is a body of nations mostly made up of former colonial dependencies of the United Kingdom. The role of Head of the Commonwealth is a personal role of the present Queen, Elizabeth II, and is not formally attached to the monarchy itself (although the present Queen's father, King George VI, also held the title). The role is purely a ceremonial one.


=== Royal Family ===

While the members of the Sovereign's family do not have any role in government, they do exercise ceremonial functions on his or her behalf.

A male Sovereign has the title &quot;King&quot;, while a female Sovereign is the &quot;Queen&quot;.  The wife of a King is also known as a Queen; however, the husband of a female Sovereign has no specific title.

By convention, the Sovereign's eldest son is created &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Earl of Chester&quot; while still a boy; he also automatically gains the title of &quot;Duke of Cornwall&quot;.  Also by convention, the Sovereign's sons receive a peerage either upon reaching the age of twenty-one, or upon marrying.

The style of ''Prince'' or ''Princess'' extends to the children of the Sovereign, the children of the sons of the Sovereign, and the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. Furthermore, wives of Princes are styled Princesses, though husbands of Princesses do not automatically become Princes.

==Henry IV==
Henry of Bolingbroke deposed his weak cousin, Richard II, in 1399. Henry IV's reign was marked by widespread rebellion. These were put down thanks to the great military skill of the Henry IV's son, the future King Henry V. Henry IV died in 1413 while plagued by a severe skin disease (possibly leprosy).

==Henry V==
Henry V's reign was markedly different from his father's in that it involved little domestic turmoil. Overseas, Henry V's armies won several important victories in France. In 1415, the English defeated the French King Charles VI decisively at the Battle of Agincourt. About 100 English soldiers were killed, along with about 5000 Frenchmen.

For the next two years, Henry V conducted delicate diplomacy to improve England's chances of conquering France. He negotiated with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, who agreed to end the German alliance with France. In 1417, the war was renewed; by 1419, English troops were about to take Paris. The parties agreed to a treaty whereby Henry V was named heir of France. Henry V, however, died before he could succeed to the French throne, which therefore remained in the hands of the Frenchmen.

==Henry VI and Edward IV==

[[Image:EdwardIV.JPG|frame|Figure 3-1: Edward IV (left) and the future Edward V (centre)]]

Henry VI succeeded to the throne while still an infant. His uncles, the Dukes of Bedford and Gloucester, both functioned as Regents. During his reign, many French territories won during the Hundred Years War were lost.

Henry VI's reign was interrupted by Edward IV's due to the War of the Roses. Henry VI was a member of the House of Lancaster, while Edward IV was from the House of York. The former House descended from Henry of Bolingbroke, the fourth son of King Edward III; the latter House descended from Edmund of Langley, Edward III's fifth son. 

In 1461, the Lancastrians lost to the Yorkists at the Battle of Towton. The Yorkist claimant, Edward IV, ascended to the throne, with the support of the powerful nobleman Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, known by the nickname ''Warwick the Kingmaker''. In 1464, Lancastrian revolts were put down. In 1469, however, Warwick the Kingmaker switched his allegiance, and in 1470, Henry VI was restored to the throne. The exiled Edward, however, soon returned and defeated Henry's forces. At the Battle of Tewkesbury, the remaining Lancastrians were defeated; Henry VI was also murdered.

==Edward V and Richard III==
Edward IV was succeeded by his twelve year-old son in 1483. Edward IV's brother, Richard, was made guardian of Edward V and his brother, also named Richard. The young King's uncle usurped the throne and had Parliament declare the two brothers illegitimate. The two princes were then imprisoned in the Tower of London, where they might have been killed (their fate, however, is not certain).

In 1485, Richard III faced Henry Tudor, the Lancastrian claimant, at the Battle of Bosworth Field, during which Richard became the last English monarch to be killed during battle. Henry came to power as Henry VII, establishing the Tudor Dynasty.

==Henry VII==
Henry VII was one of the most successful monarchs in British history. He was the Lancastrian claimant to the throne and lived in France so as to remain safe from the designs of the Yorkist Kings. At the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, he defeated and killed the Yorkist Richard III. His claim was weak due to questions relating to the legitimacy of certain births, but he was nonetheless awarded the throne.

Henry reformed the nation's taxation system and refilled the nation's treasury, which had been bankrupted by the fiscal irresponsibility of his predecessors. He also made peace with France so that the resources of the nation would not be spent trying to regain territories won during the Hundred Years' War. Henry also created marital alliances with Spain and Scotland. Henry's son, Arthur, married Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. Furthermore, Henry's daughter Margaret married James IV, King of Scots.

When Henry's son Arthur died, he wished to protect the Anglo-Spanish alliance. Therefore, he obtained a dispensation from Pope Julius II allowing Henry's son, also named Henry, to marry Catherine. (Papal permission was necessary since Henry was marrying his brother's widow.) Upon Henry VII's death, Henry took the throne as Henry VIII.

==Henry VIII==
King Henry VIII is often remembered for his multiple marriages. In his quest to obtain a male heir to the throne, Henry married six different times. His first marriage, as noted above, was to his brother's widow, Catherine of Aragon. That marriage occurred in 1509 and was scarred by several tragedies involving their children. The couple's first child was stillborn, their second lived for just 52 days, the third pregnancy ended as a miscarriage and the product of the fourth pregnancy died soon after birth. In 1516, the couple had a daughter, named Mary, followed by another miscarriage. Henry was growing impatient with his wife and eagerly sought a male heir. 

Henry sought to annul his marriage to Catherine. Ecclesiastic law permitted a man to marry his brother's widow only if the previous marriage had not been consummated. Catherine had informed the Pope that her marriage was non-consummate, so the Pope agreed to grant a dispensation allowing her to marry Henry. Now, however, Henry alleged that Catherine had lied, thereby rendering her marriage to him invalid. In 1533, an Act of Parliament annulled his marriage to Catherine, enabling him to marry Anne Boleyn. It was felt by many, however, that the Church, and not Parliament, could govern marriages. Henry had asked Pope Clement VII to issue a divorce several times. Under pressure from Catherine's nephew, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, the Pope refused. Parliament therefore passed an Act denying appeals to Rome from certain decisions of English Archbishops. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, annulled Henry's marriage to Catherine. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry. Soon, the Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church. In 1534, all appeals to Rome from the decisions of the English clergy were stopped. An Act of Parliament passed in 1536 confirmed the King's position as ''Supreme Head of the Church of England'', thereby ending any ceremonial influence that the Pope still had.

Anne Boleyn, meanwhile, was Henry's Queen, and the only surviving child from the marriage to Catherine, Mary, was declared illegitimate. Anne's first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1533. The next three pregnancies, however, all resulted in stillbirth or miscarriage. A dissatisfied Henry accused Anne of using witchcraft to entice him to marry her and to have five men enter into adulterous affairs with her. Furthermore, Anne was accused of treason because she had supposedly committed adultery while she was Queen. Anne's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled and she was executed at the Tower of London in 1536.

Within two weeks of Anne's death, Henry married Jane Seymour. In 1537, Jane produced the male heir that Henry had long desired. The boy was named Edward and would later succeed Henry to the throne. Meanwhile, his half-sister Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Shortly after the birth of the child, Jane died. Jane was followed as Queen by Anne of Cleeves, whom Henry married in 1540. Anne was the daughter of John III, Duke of Cleeves. Henry did not actually see Anne until shortly before their marriage; the relationship was contracted to establish an alliance between Henry and the Duke of Cleeves, a major Protestant leader. After Anne married him, Henry found her physically displeasing and unattractive. Shortly thereafter, the marriage was annulled on the grounds that Anne had previously been engaged to the Duke of Lorraine. After her divorce, Anne was treated well. She was given the title of Princess and allowed to live in Hever Castle, the former home of Anne Boleyn's family.

Henry VIII's next marriage was to Catherine Howard, an Englishwoman of noble birth. In 1542, she was charged and convicted of high treason after having admitted to being engaged in an adulterous affair. In 1543, Henry contracted his final marriage, wedding Catherine Parr. The marriage lasted for the remainder of Henry's life, which ended in 1547.

==Edward VI and Lady Jane Grey==
When Edward VI, son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, came to the throne, he was just ten years old. His uncle, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset served as Lord Protector while the King was a minor. Several nobles attempted to take over Somerset's role. John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick was successful; he was later created Duke of Northumberland. 

Edward VI was the first Protestant King of England. His father had broken away from the Roman Catholic Church but had not yet embraced Protestantism. Edward, however, was brought up Protestant. He sought to exclude his Catholic half-sister Mary from the line of succession. As he was dying at the age of fifteen, he made a document barring his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth from the throne. He named the Lady Jane Grey, daughter-in-law of the Duke of Northumberland, his successor. Her claim to the throne was through her mother, who was a granddaughter of King Henry VII. Jane was proclaimed Queen upon Edward's death in 1553, but she served for only nine days before being deposed by Mary. Mary enjoyed far more popular support; the public also sympathised with the way her mother, Catherine of Aragon, had been treated. Jane was soon executed; she was seventeen years old at the time.

==Mary I==
Mary was deeply opposed to her father's break from the Church in Rome. She sought to reverse reforms instituted by her Protestant half-brother. Mary even resorted to violence in her attempt to restore Catholicism, earning her the nickname ''Bloody Mary''. She executed several Protestants, including the former Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer, on charges of heresy. 

In 1554, Mary married the Catholic King of Spain, Philip II. The marriage was unpopular in England, even with Catholic subjects. The couple were unable to produce a child before Mary's death from cancer in 1558.

==Elizabeth I==
Mary's successor, her half-sister Elizabeth, was one of the most successful and popular British monarchs. The Elizabethan era was associated with cultural development and the expansion of English territory through colonialism.

After coming to power, Elizabeth quickly reversed many of Mary's policies. Elizabeth reinstated the Church of England and had Parliament pass the Act of Supremacy, which confirmed the Sovereign's position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The Act also forced public and clerical officers to take the Oath of Supremacy recognising the Sovereign's position. Elizabeth, however, did practice limited toleration towards Catholics.

After Pope Pius V excommunicated Elizabeth in 1570, Elizabeth ended her policy of religious toleration. One of Elizabeth's chief Catholic enemies was the Queen of Scotland, Mary. Since Elizabeth neither married nor bore any children, her cousin Mary was a possible heir to the English throne. Another possible heir was Lady Jane Grey's sister, Catherine. However, when Lady Catherine Grey died in 1568, Elizabeth was forced to consider that Catholic Mary was the most likely heir. Mary, however, had earlier been deposed by Scottish nobles, putting her infant son James on the throne. Mary had fled to England, hoping Elizabeth would aid her efforts to regain the Scottish throne, but Elizabeth reconsidered after learning of the &quot;Ridolfi Plot&quot;, a scheme to assassinate Elizabeth and put the Roman Catholic Mary on the English throne. In 1572, Parliament passed a bill to exclude Mary from the line of succession, but Elizabeth refused to grant Royal Assent to it. Eventually, however, Mary proved to be too much of a liability due to her constant involvement in plots to murder Elizabeth. In 1587, she was executed after having been convicted of being involved in one such plot. 

Following Mary's execution, Philip II (widower of Mary I of England) sent a fleet of Spanish ships known as the ''Armada'' to invade England. England had supported a Protestant rebellion in the Netherlands and was seen as a threat to Catholicism. Furthermore, England had interfered with Spanish shipping and trade. Using Mary's execution as an excuse, Philip II obtained the Pope's authority to depose Elizabeth. In 1588, the Spanish Armada set sail for England. Harmed by bad weather, the Armada was defeated by Elizabeth's naval leaders, including Sir Francis Drake and the Lord Howard of Effingham. 

Towards the end of her life, Elizabeth still failed to name an heir. When she died, she was ironically succeeded by the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, James. James was already James VI, King of Scots; he became James I of England in 1603 and established the rule of the Stuart dynasty.

==James I==
[[Image:JamesIEngland.jpg|thumb|right|James I of England]]
With the death of Elizabeth in 1603, the Crowns of England and Scotland united under James I. In 1567, when he was just a year old, James' mother Mary was forced to abdicate, and James became King James VI. Despite his mother's Catholicism, James was brought up as a Protestant.

One of James' first acts as King was to conclude English involvment in the Eighty Years' War, also called the Dutch Revolt. Elizabeth had supported the Protestant Dutch rebels, providing one cause for Philip II's attack. In 1604, James signed the Treaty of London, thereby making peace with Spain. 

James had significant difficulty with the English Parliamentary structure. As King of Scots, he had not been accustomed to criticism from the Parliament. James firmly believed in the ''Divine Right of Kings''&amp;mdash;the right of Kings to rule that supposedly came from God&amp;mdash;so he did not easily react to critics in Parliament. Under English law, however, it was impossible for the King to levy taxes without Parliament's consent, so he had to tolerate Parliament for some time. 

King James died in 1625 and was succeeded by his son Charles.

==Charles I==
King Charles ruled at a time when Europe was moving toward domination by absolute monarchs. The French ruler, Louis XIV, epitomised this absolutism. Charles, sharing his father's belief in the Divine Right of Kings, also moved toward absolutist policies. 

Charles conflicted with Parliament over the issue of the Huguenots, French Protestants. Louis XIV had begun a persecution of the Huguenots; Charles sent an expedition to La Rochelle to provide aid to the Protestant residents. The effort, however, was disastrous, prompting Parliament to further criticise him. In 1628, the House of Commons issued the Petition of Right, which demanded that Charles cease his use of arbitrary power. Charles had persecuted individuals using the Court of the Star Chamber, a secret court that could impose any penalty, even torture, except for death. Charles had also imprisoned individuals without a trial and denied them the right to the writ of ''habeas corpus''. The Petition of Right, however, was not successful; in 1629, Charles dissolved Parliament. He ruled alone for the next eleven years, which is sometimes referred to as the ''eleven years of tyranny'' or ''personal rule''. Since Parliamentary approval was required to impose taxes, Charles had grave difficulty in keeping the government functional. Charles imposed several taxes himself; these were widely seen as unlawful.

During these eleven years, Charles began instituting religious reforms in Scotland, moving it towards the English model. He attempted to impose the Anglican Prayer Book on Scottish churches, leading to riots and violence. In 1638, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland abolished the office of bishop and established Presbyterianism (an ecclesiastic system without clerical officers such as bishops and archbishops). Charles sent his armies to Scotland, but was quickly forced to end the conflict, known as the First Bishops' War, because of a lack of funding. Charles granted Scotland certain parliamentary and ecclesiastic freedoms in 1639.

In 1640, Charles finally called a Parliament to authorise additional taxation. Since the Parliament was dissolved within weeks of its summoning, it was known as the ''Short Parliament''. Charles then sent a new military expedition to Scotland to fight the Second Bishops' War. Again, the Royal forces were defeated. Charles then summoned Parliament again, this Parliament becoming known as the ''Long Parliament'', in order to raise funds for making reparations to the Scots.

Tension between Charles and Parliament increased dramatically. Charles agreed to abolish the hated Star Chamber, but he refused to give up control of the army. In 1641, Charles entered the House of Commons with armed guards in order to arrest his Parliamentary enemies. They had already fled, however, and Parliament took the breach of their premises very seriously. (Since Charles, no English monarch has sought to set foot in the House of Commons.)

The unsafe monarch moved the Royal court to Oxford. Royal forces controlled north and west England, while Parliament controlled south and east England. A Civil War broke out, but was indecisive until 1644, when Parliamentary forces clearly gained the upper hand. In 1646, Charles was forced to escape to Scotland, but the Scottish army delivered him to Parliament in 1647. Charles was then imprisoned. Charles negotiated with the Scottish army, declaring that if it restored him to power, he would implement the Scottish Presbyterian ecclesiastic model in England. In 1648, the Scots invaded England, but were defeated. 

The House of Commons began to pass laws without the consent of either the Sovereign or the House of Lords, but many MPs still wished to come to terms with the king. Members of the army, however, felt that Charles had gone too far by sideing with the Scots against England and were determined to have him brought to trial. In December 1648 an army regiment, Colonel Pride's, used force to bar entry into the House of Commons, only allowing MPs who would support the army to remain. These MPs, the ''Rump Parliament'', established a commission of 135 to try Charles for treason. Charles, an ardent believer in the Divine Right of Kings, refused to accept the jurisdiction of any court over him. Therefore, he was by default considered guilty of high treason and was executed on January 30, 1649.

==Oliver and Richard Cromwell==
At first, Oliver Cromwell ruled along with the republican Parliament, the state being known as the ''Commonwealth of England''. After Charles' execution, however, Parliament became disunited. In 1653, he suspended Parliament, and as Charles had done earlier, began several years of rule as a dictator. Later, Parliament was recalled, and in 1657 offered to make Cromwell the King. Since he faced opposition from his own senior military officers, Cromwell declined. Instead, he was made a ''Lord Protector'', even being installed on the former King's throne. He was a King in all but name.

Cromwell died in 1658 and was succeeded by his son Richard, an extremely poor politician. Richard Cromwell was not interested in his position and abdicated quickly. The Protectorate was ended and the Commonwealth restored. Anarchy was the result. Quickly, Parliament chose to reestablish the monarchy by inviting Charles I's son to take the throne as Charles II.

==Charles II==
During the rule of Oliver Cromwell, Charles II remained King in Scotland. After an unsuccessful challenge to Cromwell's rule, Charles escaped to Europe. In 1660, when England was in anarchy, Charles issued the Declaration of Breda, outlining his conditions for returning to the Throne. The Long Parliament, which had been convened in 1640, finally dissolved itself. A new Parliament, called the ''Convention Parliament'', was elected; it was far more favourable to the Royalty than the Long Parliament. In May 1660, the Convention Parliament that Charles had been the lawful King of England since the death of his father in 1649. Charles soon arrived in London and was restored to actual power. Charles granted a general pardon to most of Cromwell's supporters. Those who had directly participated in his father's execution, however, were either executed or imprisoned for life. Cromwell himself suffered a posthumous execution: his body was exhumed, hung, drawn and quartered, his head cut off and displayed from a pole and the remainder of his body thrown into a common pit. The posthumous execution took place on the anniversary of Charles I's death.

Charles also dissolved the Convention Parliament. The next Parliament, called the ''Cavalier Parliament'' was soon elected. The Cavalier Parliament lasted for seventeen years without an election before being dissolved. During its long tenure, the Cavalier Parliament enacted several important laws, including many that suppressed religious dissent. The Act of Uniformity required the use of the Church of England's ''Book of Common Prayer'' in all Church services. The Conventicle Act prohibited religious assemblies of more than five members except under the Church of England. The Five Mile Act banned non-members of the Church of England from living in towns with a Royal Charter, instead forcing them into the country. In 1672, Charles mitigated these laws with the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, which provided for religious toleration. Parliament, however, suspected him of Catholicism and forced him to withdraw the Declaration. In 1673, Parliament passed the Test Act, which required civil servants to swear an oath against Catholicism.

Parliament's suspicions did turn out to be accurate. As Charles II lay dying in 1685, he converted to Catholicism. Charles did not have a single legitimate child, though he did have, while living in Europe, several illegitimate ones (over 300 by some estimates). He was succeeded, therefore, by his younger brother James, an open Catholic.

==James II==
James II (James VII in Scotland) was an extremely controversial monarch due to his Catholicism. Soon after he took power, a Protestant illegitimate son of Charles II, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, proclaimed himself King. James II defeated him within a few days and had him executed. 

James made himself highly unpopular by appointing Catholic officials, especially in Ireland. Later, he established a standing army in peacetime, alarming many Protestants. Rebellion, however, did not occur because people trusted James' daughter Mary, a Protestant. In 1688, however, James produced a son, who was brought up Catholic. Since Mary's place in the line of succession was lowered, and a Catholic Dynasty in England seemed ineveitable, the &quot;Immortal Seven&quot;&amp;mdash;the Duke of Devonshire, the Earl of Danby, the Earl of Shrewsbury, the Viscount Lumley, the Bishop of London, Edward Russell and Henry Sidney&amp;mdash;conspired to replace James and his son with Mary and her Dutch husband William of Orange. In 1688, William and Mary invaded England and James fled the country. The revolution was hailed as the ''Glorious Revolution'' or the ''Bloodless Revolution''. Though the latter term was innacurate, the revolution was not as violent as the War of the Roses or the English Civil War.

==William and Mary==
Parliament wished then to make Mary the sole Queen. She, however, refused and demanded that she be made co-Sovereign with her husband. In 1689, the Parliament of England declared in the English Bill of Rights, one of the most significant constitutional documents in British history, that James' flight constituted an abdication of the throne and that the throne should go jointly to William (William III) and Mary (Mary II). The Bill of Rights also required that the Sovereign cannot deny certain rights, such as freedom of speech in Parliament, freedom from taxation without Parliament's consent and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. In Scotland, the Estates General passed a similar Act, called the Claim of Right, which also made William and Mary joint rulers. In Ireland, power had to be won in battle. In 1690, the English won the Battle of the Boyne, thereby establishing William and Mary's rule over the entire British Isles.

For the early part of the reign, Mary administered the Government while William controlled the military. Unpopularly, William appointed people from his native Holland as officers in the English army and Royal Navy. Furthermore, he used English military resources to protect the Netherlands. In 1694, after the death of Queen Mary from smallpox, William continued to rule as the sole Sovereign. 

Since William and Mary did not have children, William's heir was Anne, who had seventeen pregnancies, most of which ended in stillbirth. In 1700, Anne's last surviving child, William, died at the age of eleven. Parliament was faced with a succession crisis, because after Anne, many in the line of succession were Catholic. Therefore, in 1701, the Act of Settlement was passed, allowing Sophia, Electress and Duchess Dowager of Hanover (a German state), and her Protestant heirs, to succeed if Anne had no further children. Sophia's claim stemmed from her great-grandfather, James I. Several lines that were more senior to Sophia's were bypassed under the act. Some of these had questionable legitimacy, while others were Catholic. The Act of Settlement also banned non-Protestants and those who married Catholics from the throne.

In 1702, William died, and his sister-in-law Anne became Queen.

==Anne==
Even following the passage of the Act of Settlement, Protestant succession to the throne was insecure in Scotland. In 1703, the Scottish Parliament, the Estates, passed a bill that required that, if Anne died without children, the Estates could appoint any Protestant descendant of Scottish monarchs as the King. The individual appointed could not be the same person who would, under the Act of Settlement, succeed to the English crown unless several economic conditions were met. The Queen's Commissioner refused Royal Assent on her behalf. The Scottish Estates then threatened to withdraw Scottish troops from the Queen's armies, which were then engaged in the War of the Spanish Succession in Europe and Queen Anne's War in North America. The Estates also threatened to refuse to levy taxes, so Anne relented and agreed to grant Royal Assent to the bill, which became the Act of Security.

The English Parliament feared the separation of the Crowns which had been united since the death of Elizabeth I. They therefore attempted to coerce Scotland, passing the Alien Act in 1705. The Alien Act provided for cutting off trade between England and Scotland. Scotland was already suffering from the failure of the Darién Scheme, a disastrous and expensive attempt to establish  Scottish colonies in America. Scotland quickly began to negotiate union with England. In 1707, the Act of Union was passed, despite mass protest in Scotland, by Parliament and the Scottish Estates. The Act combined England and Scotland into one Kingdom of Great Britain, terminated the Parliament and Estates, and replaced them with one Parliament of Great Britain. Scotland was entitled to elect a certain number of members of the House of Commons. Furthermore, it was permitted to send sixteen of its peers to sit along with all English peers in the House of Lords. The Act guaranteed Scotland the right to retain its distinct legal system. The Church of Scotland was also guaranteed independence from political interference. Ireland remained a separate country, though still governed by the British Sovereign.

Anne is often remembered as the last British monarch to deny Royal Assent to a bill, which she did in 1707 to a militia bill. Due to her poor health, made worse by her failed pregnancies, her government was run through her ministers. She died in 1714, to be succeeded by George, Elector of Hanover, whose mother Sophia had died a few weeks earlier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ich beschäftige mich derzeit sehr mit dem Gedanken, ein Lateinisches Lehrbuch zu gestalten.

&lt;b&gt;Mein Konzept dafür:&lt;/b&gt;

==Latein - wie soll's denn sein?==

===Grundsätzliches===

Ich würde ein Lateinisches Lehrbuch zum Selbststudium vorschlagen - das aber auch die Möglichkeit zum Lernen in Gruppen oder Kursen (z. B. Volkshochschule) bietet.
Und zwar mit der perfiden Zielrichtung, den Lerner zur Anwendung seiner Kenntnisse zu bringen.

===Anwendungsgebiete===

Wie kann man Latein heute anwenden - bzw. zu was kann das Erlernen der Lateinischen Sprache befähigen?
*Lesen antiker und mittelalterlicher (und weniger neuerer) Texte, darunter
**wissenschaftliche Texte aus allen Richtungen
**besonders interessant: philosophische und religiöse Texte
*Lesen kirchlicher Texte
*erheblich vereinfachtes Lernen moderner romanischer Sprachen
*Internationaler Austausch mit (leider nicht mehr allzuvielen) Gleichgesinnten über herkömmliche Sprachbarrieren hinweg auf einer gemeinsamen kulturhistorischen Grundlage
*Verständnis für zahlreiche aus dem Lateinischen stammende Fremdwörter und Wendungen

(Ich habe die sog. weichen Faktoren wie Förderung des logischen Denkvermögens und des Verständnisses der eigenen Sprache jetzt mal bewußt außer Acht gelassen)

===Das Publikum===

Dieses Buch ist in erster Linie für Idealisten. Es ist für Menschen, die Latein interessehalber lernen (oder wieder lernen), weil sie es für eine schöne Sprache halten, weil sie endlich Cicero oder Augustinus im Original lesen möchten, oder ein Verständnis für die römischen Grundlagen unserer Kultur erwerben möchten. Manch einer will womöglich seine schulischen Lateinkenntnisse so auszubauen, wie es einer jahrelang erlernten Fremdsprache zusteht. Vielleicht haben sie auch ganz andere Gründe. In den allermeisten Fällen aber werden es keine Studenten sein, die ihr Latinum nachholen müssen und auch keine Lehrer oder Schüler, die es als Schulbuch verwenden.

===Die Methoden===

Um das Lateinische aber fernab von reglementierten Abschlüssen zu erleben und zu erlernen gibt es weitaus schönere Modelle als die von den heutigen Schulbüchern und Latinumskursen gepflegten, die lediglich auf die passive Beherrschung des Lateinischen abzielen. 
So kann man Latein wie jede andere moderne Sprache auch unterrichten: Anhand von kleinen Dialogen, Übersetzungsübungen in beide Richtungen, Aufsätze in der Fremdsprache, Beantwortung von Fragen in der Fremdsprache, usw.
Die Themen müssen entsprechend der gewaltigen Zeitspanne, die die Geschichte der lateinischen Sprache umfaßt, vom alltäglichen zum philosophischen über das wirtschaftliche und politische bis hin zum künstlerischen und geschichtlichen reichen. Der erlernte Wortschatz soll dabei zum einen die Lektüre des klassischen Lateins und zum anderen die aktive Beherrschung des Lateinischen mit der Fähigkeit sich mit aktuellen Themen auseinanderzusetzen ermöglichen.

===Der Bedarf===

Es gibt für mich zwei Hauptgründe, warum ich diese Art eines Lateinischen Lehrbuches vorschlage:
#Ein solches Buch gibt es (meines Wissens) nicht. Es ist eine Marktlücke. Ich sähe keinen Sinn darin, die Xte Version eines Lehrbuches für den Latinumsstudenten anzubieten. Seit etwa einem Jahrhundert bereitet der Lateinunterricht auf die passive Beherrschung einer Sprache vor, die sich seit Jahrtausenden kaum mehr verändert hat. Da gibt es schon alles, wesentliche neue Ansätze lassen sich hier nicht mehr entwickeln. Außerdem ist die Konkurrenz gut positioniert und der Markt schrumpft.
#Ein solches Buch gibt es (meines Wissens) noch nicht. Es fehlt einfach. Wer sich aus Idealismus mit der Lateinischen Sprache beschäftigt, der will sie auch sprechen lernen - mir geht es zumindest so und ich teile mit all denen die mit mir das Abitur gemacht haben, das Bedauern darüber, 6, 7 oder 9 Jahre eine Sprache gelernt zu haben und sie nicht einmal sprechen zu können. Latein könnte eine sehr sehr ernsthafte Alternative für Esperanto oder auch für Englisch sein, sieht man sich mal an wieviele Schüler es heute noch in der Schule lernen, oder gar wieviele Erwachsene es mal gelernt haben - hätten sie es nur richtig gelernt. Das läßt sich ändern, und dazu braucht es einen Anstoß.

==Was heißt das für unser Buch?==

Es wird nicht einfach sein, ausreichend kompetente Autoren für eine derart ausgefallene Anwendung der lateinischen Sprache zu finden - wer lernt denn schon Latein so, daß er es aktiv beherrscht - noch dazu in modernem Kontext?
Ich schlage deshalb vor, daß wir zuerst das Grundgerüst konzipieren, Übungen und Beispieltexte erstmal auf Deutsch formulieren und dann unter Zuhilfenahme aller uns zur Verfügung stehenden Quellen diese in ein angemessenes Latein übertragen.
Nun hätte ich aber erstmal gern ein paar Rückmeldungen von Euch, wie Ihr dieses Konzept seht.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==George I==
[[Image:GeorgeIGreatBritain.jpg|frame|King George I]]
George, Duke and Elector of Hanover became King George I in 1714. His claim was opposed by the Jacobites, supporters of the deposed King James II. Since James II had died, his claim was taken over by his son, James Francis Edward Stewart, the &quot;Old Pretender.&quot; In 1715, there was a Jacobite rebellion, but an ill James could not lead it. By the time he recovered, it was too late, and the rebellion was supressed.

King George was not deeply involved in British politics; instead, he concentrated on matters in his home, Germany. The King could not even speak English, earning the ridicule of many of his subjects. George, furthermore, spent much time in his native land of Hanover. Meanwhile, a ministerial system developed in Great Britain. George appointed Sir Robert Walpole as ''First Lord of the Treasury''. Walpole was George's most powerful minister, but he was not termed &quot;Prime Minister&quot;; that term came into use in later years. Walpole's tenure began in 1721; other ministers held office at his, rather than the King's, pleasure. George's lack of involvement in politics contributed greatly to the development of the modern British political system.

George died in 1727 from a stroke while in Germany. He was succeeded by his son, who ruled as George II.

==George II==
George II was naturalised as a British citizen in 1705; his reign began in 1727. Like his father, George transferred political power to Sir Robert Walpole, who served until 1742. Walpole was succeeded by Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, who served until 1743, and then by Henry Pelham, who served until his death in 1754. During Pelham's service, the nation experienced a second Jacobite Rebellion, which was almost successful in putting Bonnie Prince Charlie&amp;mdash;son of the Old Pretender, himself called the Young Pretender&amp;mdash;on the throne. The rebellion began in 1745 and was ended in 1746 when the King's forces defeated the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden, the last battle ever to be fought on British soil.

Before George II's death in 1760, he was served by two other Prime Ministers: Henry Pelham's elder brother the Duke of Newcastle, and the Duke of Devonshire. George II's eldest son, Frederick, had predeceased him, so George was succeeded by his grandson, also named George.

==George III==
George III attempted to reverse the trend that his Hanoverian predecessors had set by reducing the influence of the Prime Minister. He appointed a variety of different people as his Prime Minister, on the basis of favouratism rather than ability. The Whig Party of Robert Walpole declared George an autocrat and compared him to Charles I.

George III's reign is notable for many important international events. In 1763, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, a global war that also involved Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands and was fought in Europe, America and India. As a result of the Treaty of Paris, New France (the French territory in North America, including Quebec and land east of the Mississippi) was ceded to Britain, as was Spanish Florida. Spain, however, took New Orleans and Louisiana, the vast French territory on the west of the Mississippi. Great Britain came to be recognised as the world's pre-eminent colonial power, displacing France. The nation, however, was left deeply in debt. To overcome it, British colonies in America were taxed, much to their distaste. Eventually, Britain lost its American colonies during the American War of Independence, which lasted from 1776 to 1783. Elsewhere, however, the British Empire continued to expand. In India, the British East India Company took control of many small nation-states nominally headed by their own princes. The island of Australia was also occupied, and Canada's population increased with the number of British Loyalists who left the newly formed United States of America.

In 1801, Parliament passed the Act of Union, uniting Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom. Ireland was allowed to elect 100 Members of Parliament to the House of Commons and 22 representative peers to the House of Lords. The Act originally provided for the removal of restrictions from Roman Catholics, but George III refused to agree to the proposal, arguing that doing so would violate his oath to maintain Protestantism.

George was the last British monarch to claim the Kingdom of France. He was persuaded to abandon the meaningless claim dating to the Plantagenet days in 1801 by the French ruler Napoleon.

In 1811, George III, who had previously suffered bouts of madness, went permanantly insane. His son George ruled the country as ''Prince Regent'', and became George IV when the King died in 1820.

==George IV==
George IV is often remembered as an unwise and extravagant monarch. During his Regency, London was redesigned, and funding for the arts was increased. As King, George was unable to govern effectively; he was overweight, possibly addicted to a form of opium and showing signs of his father's mental disease. While he ruled, George's ministers were once again able to regain the power that they had lost during his father's reign. 

George opposed several popular social reforms. As his father, he refused to lift several restrictions on Roman Catholics. Upon his death in 1830, his younger brother began to reign as William IV.

==William IV==
Early in William's reign, British politics was reformed by the Reform Act of 1832. At the time, the House of Commons was a disorganised and undemocratic body, unlike the modern House. The nation included several ''rotten boroughs'', which historically had the right to elect members of Parliament, but actually had very few residents. The rotten borough of Old Sarum, for instance, had seven voters, but could elect two MPs. An even more extreme example is of Dunwich, which could also elect two MPs despite having no residents, the entire borough having been eroded away into the North Sea. Other boroughs were called ''pocket boroughs'' because they were &quot;in the pocket&quot; of a wealthy landowner, whose son was normally elected to the seat. At the same time, entire cities such as Westminster (with about 20,000 voters) still had just two MPs. 

The House of Commons agreed to the Reform Bill, but it was rejected by the House of Lords, whose members controlled several pocket boroughs. The Tory Party, furthermore, opposed the bill actively. William IV agreed with his Prime Minister, the Earl Grey, to flood the House of Lords with pro-reform members by creating fifty new peerages; when the time came, he backed down. The Earl Grey and his Whig Party government then resigned, but returned to power when William finally agreed to co-operate. The Reform Act of 1832 gave urban areas increased political power, but allowed aristocrats to retain effective control of the rural areas. Over fifty rotten boroughs were abolished, while the representation of some other boroughs was reduced from two MPs to one. Though members of the middle class were granted the right to vote, the Reform Act did not do much to expand the electorate, which amounted after passage to just three percent of the population.

In 1834, William became the last British monarch to appoint a Prime Minister who did not have the confidence of Parliament. He replaced the Whig Prime Minister, the Viscount Melbourne, with a Tory, Sir Robert Peel. Peel, however, had a minority in the House of Commons, so he resigned in 1835, and Melbourne returned to power.

In 1837, William died and was succeeded on the British throne by his niece Victoria, who was just eighteen years old at the time. The union of the Crowns of Britain and Hanover was then dissolved, since Salic Law, which applied in Hanover, only allowed males to rule. Therefore, Hanover passed to William's brother Ernest.

==Victoria==
[[Image:Queen_Victoria_bw.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Victoria]]
A few years after taking power, Victoria married a German Prince, Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who was given the title of ''Prince Consort''. Albert originally wished to actively govern the United Kingdom, but he acquiesced to his wife's requests to the contrary. The extremely happy marriage ended with Albert's death in 1861, following which Victoria entered a period of semi-mourning that would last for the rest of her reign. She was often called ''the Widow of Windsor'', after Windsor Castle, a Royal home.

In 1867, Parliament passed another Reform Act. Like its predecessor, the Reform Act of 1832, true electoral reform was not achieved; the property qualifications limited the electorate to about eight percent of the population. Therafter, power was held by two Prime Ministers&amp;mdash;Benjamin Disraeli (a Tory and a favourite of Victoria) and William Ewart Gladstone (a Liberal whom Victoria disliked)&amp;mdash;from 1868 to 1885. In 1876, Disraeli convinced Victoria to take the title of Empress of India. 

Many of Victoria's daughters married into European Royal Houses, giving her the nickname ''Grandmother of Europe''. All of the current European monarchs descend from Victoria.

Victoria died in 1901, holding the record for longest serving British Sovereign. She was succeeded by her son Edward, who became King Edward VII. Edward was deemed to belong not to his mother's House of Hanover, but instead to his father's dynasty, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

==Edward VII==
Edward VII was the oldest person in British history to become King, beginning his reign at the age of fifty-nine. He participated actively in foreign affairs, visiting France in 1903. The visit led to the ''Entente Cordiale'' (Friendly Understanding), an informal agreement between France and the United Kingdom marking the end of centuries of Anglo-French rivalry. In the case of Germany, however, Edward VII exacerbated rivalry through his bad relations with his nephew, Kaiser Wilhelm II.

Towards the end of his life, Edward was faced with a constitutional crisis when the Liberal Government, led by Herbert Henry Asquith, proposed the ''People's Budget''. The Budget reformed the tax system by creating a land tax, which would adversely affect the aristocratic class. The Conservative landowning majority in the House of Lords broke convention by rejecting the budget. They argued that the Commons themselves had broken a convention by attacking the wealth of the Lords. Before the problem could be resolved, Edward VII died in 1910, allowing his son, George, to ascend to the throne.

==George V==
After George became King, the constitutional crisis was resolved after the Liberal Government resigned and Parliament was dissolved. The Liberals were reelected, in part due to the unpopularity of the House of Lords, and used the election as a mandate to force their Budget through, almost too late to save the nation's financial system from ruin.

The Lords paid a price for their opposition to the Liberals, who in the commons passed the Parliament Bill, which provided that a bill could be submitted for the King's Assent if the Commons passed it in three consecutive sessions, even if the Lords rejected it. The time would later be reduced to two sessions in 1949. When the House of Lords refused to pass the Parliament Bill, Prime Minister Asquith asked George V to create 250 new Liberal peers to erase the Conservative majority. George agreed, but the Lords acquiesced and passed the bill quickly.

World War I occurred during George's reign. Due to the family's German connections, the Royalty began to become unpopular; George's cousin, Wilhelm II, was especially despised. In 1917, to appease the public, George changed the Royal House's name from the German-sounding ''Saxe-Coburg-Gotha'' to the more English ''Windsor''.

In 1922, most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to form the Irish Free State following the Irish Civil War. The Irish Free State retained the British monarch as a Sovereign, but functioned as a Dominion of the Crown, with its own Government and Legislature. Six counties in the Irish province of Ulster remained in the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland. In 1927, the name of the country was changed from ''the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'' to ''the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''.

George V died in 1936 and was succeeded by his son, who ruled as Edward VIII.

==Edward VIII==
Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December. His reign was controversial because of his desire to marry the American Wallis Simpson. Simpson was already divorced once; she divorced her second husband so she could marry King Edward. A problem, however, existed because Edward was the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, which prohibited remarriage after divorce. The Government advised him that he could not marry while he was King, so he indicated a desire to abdicate and marry Simpson. The abdication was not unilateral, as the Act of Settlement provided that the Crown go to the heir of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, regardless of that person's willingness to rule. Therefore, Parliament had to pass a special Act in order to permit Edward to abdicate, which he did. 

Edward's brother, Albert Frederick Arthur George, became King. He chose to rule as George VI to create a link in the public's mind between him and the previous Kings of the same name during a time of crisis. Edward, meanwhile, was made Duke of Windsor and the issue of his marriage to Simpson were excluded from the line of succession.

==George VI==
When George took power in 1936, the popularity of the Royal Family had been damaged by the abdication crisis. It was, however, restored when George and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, led the nation and boosted morale during World War II. During the war, Britain was led by one of its most famous Prime Ministers, Sir Winston Churchill.

Following the War, the United Kingdom began to lose several of its overseas possessions. In 1947, India became independent and George lost the title of Emperor of India. Until 1950, however, he remained King of India while a constitution was being written. George was also the last King of Ireland; the Irish established a republic in 1949.

George died in 1952 from lung cancer. His daughter Elizabeth succeeded him.

==Elizabeth II==
During Elizabeth's reign, there have been several important constitutional developments. A notable one occurred in 1963, when Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan resigned. There was no clear leader of the Conservative Party, but many favoured Richard Austen Butler, the Deputy Prime Minister. Harold Macmillan advised the Queen, however, that senior politicians in the party preferred Alec Douglas-Home, 14th Earl of Home. Elizabeth accepted the advice and appointed the Earl of Home to the office of Prime Minister, marking the last time a member of the House of Lords would be so appointed. Home, taking advantage of the Peerage Act passed in 1963, &quot;disclaimed&quot; his peerage. A Conservative member of the House of Commons vacated his seat, allowing Home to contest the by-election for that constituency and become a member of the House of Commons.

There have also been many recent constitutional developments in the nation. The office of Prime Minister increased greatly in power under the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (the &quot;Iron Lady&quot;) and the Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair. Under Blair, many of Parliament's lawmaking functions were devolved to local administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In 1999, the House of Lords Act was passed, removing the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House. 

Elizabeth II continues to reign; her heir is Charles, Prince of Wales.

[[UK Constitution and Government/Parliament|Previous Chapter]] | [[UK Constitution and Government/Judiciary|Next Chapter]]
------
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
== Structure ==

''Her Majesty's Government'' is the executive political authority for the United Kingdom as a whole.  At its heart is the ''Cabinet'', a grouping of senior ''Ministers of the Crown'', headed by the ''Prime Minister''.  Members of the Government are political appointees, and are usually drawn from one of the two Houses of Parliament.  In addition to the heads of the ''Departments of State'' (most of whom carry the title of ''Secretary of State''), the Government also includes ''junior ministers'' (who bear the title of ''Under Secretary of State'', ''Minister of State'', or ''Parliamentary Secretary''), ''whips'' (responsible for enforcing party discipline within the two Houses), and ''Parliamentary Private Secretaries'' (political assistants to ministers).

When the Sovereign is the King, the Government is referred to as ''His'' Majesty's Government; likewise, when there are joint Sovereigns, the Government is known as ''Their Majesties''' Government.


== Prime Minister ==

The Prime Minister (or &quot;PM&quot;) is the head of the Government.  Since the early twentieth century the Prime Minister has held the office of ''First Lord of the Treasury'', and in recent decades has also held the office of ''Minister for the Civil Service''.

The Prime Minister is ''asked to form a Government'' by the Sovereign.  Usually this occurs after a general election has altered the balance of party political power within the House of Commons.  The Prime Minister is expected to ''have the confidence'' of the House of Commons; this usually means that he or she is the leader of the polical party holding the majority of the seats in the Commons.  Since at least the 1920s the Prime Minister himself is also expected to be a Member of Parliament (i.e. member of the House of Commons).  The Prime Minister retains office until he or she dies or resigns, or until someone else is appointed; this means that even when expecting to be defeated at a general election, the Prime Minister remains formally in power until his or her rival is returned as an MP and asked in turn to form a Government.

By convention, the Prime Minister and his or her Government is expected to resign if losing a vote in the House of Commons that has been asserted in advance by the Government as a matter of confidence; for example, if major legislation is rejected.  The same applies if the Government is defeated by an actual Commons vote of &quot;no confidence&quot;.  An alternative option for the Prime Minister in either of these circumstances is to ask the Sovereign for a dissolution of Parliament, in effect allowing the electorate itself to approve or disapprove of the Prime Minister's policy.  A request for dissolution is usually granted; however, in certain circumstances the request may be refused, in which case the Prime Minister would again be expected to resign.

The existence and basis of appointment of the office is a matter of constitutional convention rather than of law.  Because of this, there are no formal qualifications for the office.  However, a small number of Acts of Parliament do make reference to the Prime Minister, and since the 1930s office has carried a salary in its own right.

The Prime Minister is often an extremely powerful figure within the political system; the office has been said by some to be an &quot;elected dictatorship&quot;, and some Prime Ministers have been accused of being &quot;presidential&quot;.  A weak Prime Minister may be forced out of office (i.e. forced to resign) by his or her own party, particularly if there is an alternative figure within the party seen as a better choice.


== Cabinet and other ministers ==

Membership of the Cabinet is not defined by law, and is only loosely bound by convention.  The Prime Minister and (if there is one) the Deputy Prime Minister are always members, as are the three most senior ministerial heads of Departments of State: the ''Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'' (commonly known as the ''Foreign Secretary''), the ''Chancellor of the Exchequer'' (i.e. the minister responsible for finance), and the ''Secretary of State for the Home Department'' (commonly known as the ''Home Secretary'').  Most of the other heads of departments are usually members of the Cabinet, as well as a small number of junior ministers.

Ministers of the Crown are formally appointed by the Sovereign upon the &quot;advice&quot; of the Prime Minister.  Ministers are bound by the convention of ''collective responsibility'', by which they are expected to publicly support or defend the policy of the Government, or else resign.  They are also bound by the less clearly defined convention of ''individual responsibility'', by which they are responsible to Parliament for the acts of their department.  Ministers are often called upon to resign who either by their own actions, or by those of their department, are perceived in some manner to have failed in their duty; however, it usually takes sustained criticism over a period of time for both a minister to feel compelled to resign, and for the Prime Minister to accept that resignation.  Occasionally a minister offers his or her resignation, but the Prime Minister retains them in office.

Parliamentary Private Secretaries are also bound by the principle of ''collective responsibility'', even though they hold no ministerial responsibility and take no part in the formation of policy; the position is seen as an initial stepping-stone towards being offered ministerial office.


== Privy Council ==

''Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council'' is a ceremonial body of advisors to the Sovereign. The Privy Council is used as a mechanism for maintaining ministerial responsibility for the actions of the Crown; for example, royal proclamations are approved by the Privy Council before they are issued.  All senior members of the Government are appointed to be Privy Counsellors, as well as certain senior members of the Royal Family, leaders of the main political parties, the archbishops and senior bishops of the Church of England, and certain senior judges.

The Privy Council is headed by the ''Lord President of the Council'', a ministerial office usually held by a member of the Cabinet.  By convention the Lord President is also either the ''Leader of the House of Commons'', or the ''Leader of the House of Lords'', with responsibility for directing and negotiating the course of business in the respective House.

Meetings of the Privy Council are usually extremely short, and are rarely attended by more than a bare minimum of Privy Counsellors.

[[UK Constitution and Government/Government|Previous Chapter]] | [[UK Constitution and Government/Devolved Administrations|Next Chapter]]
------
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
== Structure ==

The United Kingdom is made up of three separate legal jurisdictions, each with a separate laws and hierarchy of courts: ''England and Wales'', ''Scotland'', and ''Northern Ireland''.


== England and Wales ==

England and Wales is a ''common law'' jurisdiction.

=== Lower courts ===

The lowest court in England and Wales is the ''Magistrates' Court''. Magistrates, also known as Justices of the Peace, are laypersons appointed by the Sovereign. The court hears &quot;summary&quot; offences (punishable by six months or less in prison). When hearing such cases, three magistrates sit together as a panel without a jury. In some metropolitan areas, such as London, there are no magistrates; instead, summary cases are tried by a single District Judge who is trained in law.

Serious criminal cases are tried before a ''Crown Court'' with a judge and a jury of twelve. The accused may also choose to have certain summary offences referred from the magistrates' court to the Crown Court, in order for their case to be tried before a jury; the Crown Court also hears appeals from magistrates' courts. Though the Crown Court is constituted as a single body for the whole of England and Wales, it sits permanently at multiple places throughout its area of jurisdiction.

The counterpart to the Crown and Magistrates' Courts in the civil justice system is the ''County Court''. There are over 200 County Courts throughout England and Wales.

=== High Court ===

The ''High Court of England and Wales'' takes appeals from the County Court, and also has an original jurisdiction in certain matters.

The High Court is constituted into three ''divisions'': the ''Family Division'', the ''Chancery Division'', and the ''Queen's Bench Division''.

The Family Division is presided over by the ''President of the Family Division'', and hears cases involving family matters such as matrimonial breakdown, child custody and welfare, and adoption.

The Chancery Division is presided over by the ''Chancellor of the High Court'' (formerly known as the ''Vice-Chancellor''), and hears cases involving land, companies, bankruptcy, and probate.

The Queen's Bench Division is presided over by the ''President of the Queen's Bench Division'', and hears cases involving torts (civil wrongs).  The Queen's Bench Division also includes four subordinate courts: the ''Admiralty Court'' (dealing with shipping), the ''Commercial Court'' (dealing with insurance, banking, and commerce), the ''Technology and Construction Court'' (dealing with complex technological matters), and the ''Administrative Court'' (exercising judicial review over the actions of local government).  The Queen's Bench Division also has oversight of the lower courts.


== Court of Appeal ==

Above the High Court in civil cases, and the Crown Court in criminal cases, is the Court of Appeal, headed by the ''Master of the Rolls'', and including 35 ''Lords Justices of Appeal'' as well as other judges.

The Court of Appeal is divided into a ''Civil Division'' (presided over by the Master of the Rolls) and a ''Criminal Division'' (presided over by the Lord Chief Justice). Generally speaking, appeals may only be heard &quot;by leave&quot;; that is, with the permission of the either the Court of Appeal or the judge whose decision is being contested. In some cases, it is possible to &quot;leapfrog&quot; the High Court and bring a case directly from a County Court.

Together, the Crown Court, the High Court, and Court of Appeal constitute the ''Senior Courts'' (formerly known as the ''Supreme Court of Judicature''). Thus, since they are theoretically one body, it is possible for judges of one court to sit in other courts. Appeals from the Senior Courts go to the Supreme Court; it is also possible to leapfrog from the High Court, but not from the Crown Court. Normally, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court is not granted unless the case is of great legal or constitutional importance.

== Northern Ireland ==

Northern Ireland's system is based on that used in England and Wales, with a similar hierarchy of magistrates' court, the Crown Court (for criminal trials), county courts (for civil trials), the High Court, and the Court of Appeal.

Appeals from Northern Ireland lie to the Supreme Court.

== Scotland ==

In contrast with the rest of the United Kingdom, Scotland uses a mixture of common law and civil law.  Its court system was developed independently of that in England. The ''Act of Union'' (1707) guarantees the continuance of Scotland's different legal system.

=== Lower courts ===

Summary jurisdiction is exercised by ''Justice of the Peace Courts'', held either by three ''Justices of the Peace'' (lay magistrates) sitting together, or by a Justice of the Peace sitting with a legally qualified clerk.  As in England and Wales, professional judges may sit in certain metropolitan areas.

Above the Justice of the Peace Courts are the ''Sheriff Courts'', of which there are around 50.  Sheriff Courts hear both criminal and civil cases, and are held before a judge known as a Sheriff, and have a jury of fifteen people.  Sheriff Courts are grouped into six different Sheriffdoms, headed by a Sheriff Principal who hears appeals from cases not decided by a jury.

=== High Court of Justiciary ===

The highest criminal court in Scotland is the ''High Court of Justiciary''.  The judges of the court are also the judges of the Court of Session (see below); as High Court judges they are known as ''Lords Commissioners of Justiciary''. The head of the court is the ''Lord Justice-General'' (also the Lord President of the Court of Session), with a deputy known as the ''Lord Justice Clerk'' (who holds the same office in the Court of Session).  Altogether the High Court has up to 32 individual judges.

The High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in serious crimes, such as murder or drug trafficking, in which case a single judge sits with a jury of fifteen.  The High Court also hears appeals from Justice of the Peace Courts, and hears appeals in criminal cases from Sheriff Courts.

Appeals against decisions by a High Court judge in criminal cases are heard by either two (in appeals against sentences) or three (in appeals against conviction) High Court judges.  No appeal lies beyond the High Court.

=== Court of Session ===

The highest civil court in Scotland is the ''Court of Session''.  Its judges also sit as judges of the High Court of Justiciary (see above); as Court of Session judges they are known as ''Lords and Ladies of Council and Session'', or ''Senators of the College of Justice''. The Court is headed by the ''Lord President'', with a ''Lord Justice Clerk'' as deputy.  Altogether the Court of Session has up to 32 individual judges.

The Court of Session is divided into the ''Outer House'' (made up of nineteen judges), and the ''Inner House'' (made up of the remaining judges). The Outer House has original jurisdiction, while the Inner House has appellate jurisdiction. The Inner House is further divided into the First and Second Divisions, headed by the Lord President and Lord Justice Clerk respectively. Sometimes, when many cases are before the court, an Extra Division may be appointed. Each Division may sit as a panel hearing an appeal from the Sheriff Court or from the Outer House.

Appeals from the Court of Session lie to the Supreme Court.

== Supreme Court ==

The ''Supreme Court of the United Kingdom'' is the ultimate court of appeal in all civil matters, as well as in criminal cases (other than from Scotland), and also has original jurisdiction in devolution cases.

The Supreme Court has replaced the jurisdiction previously exercised by the House of Lords in the latter's now-abolished judicial capacity.  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is not to be confused with the Supreme Court of Judicature, the name formerly held by (a) the Senior Courts, in England and Wales, and (b) the Court of Judicature, in Northern Ireland.

The Supreme Court is headed by a President, who has a Deputy President.  There are a further ten ''puisne'' judges.


== Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ==

The ''Judicial Committee of the Privy Council'' formerly held original jurisdiction in the United Kingdom in devolution cases, and continues to hold appellate jurisdiction over the ecclesiastical courts of the Church of England.  Appeals to the Privy Council as a court of last resort also lie from the Crown dependencies, the British overseas territories, and from certain Commonwealth countries.

Membership of the Judicial Committee is made up of Justices of the Supreme Court, Privy Counsellors who are or were Lord Justices of Appeal in either England and Wales or Northern Ireland, members of the Inner House of Scotland's Court of Session, and selected senior judges from certain other Commonwealth countries.  Members retire at the age of 75.

Appeals to ''Her Majesty in Council'' are referred to the Judicial Committee, which formally reports to the Queen in Council, who in turn formally confirms the report.  By agreement, appeals from certain Commonwealth countries lie directly to the Judicial Committee itself.

The Queen-in-Council also considers appeals from the disciplinary committees of certain medical bodies such as the Royal College of Surgeons. Also, cases against the Church Commissioners (who administer the Church of England's property estates) may be considered. Appeals may be heard from certain ecclesiastic courts (the Court of Arches in Canterbury, and the Chancery Court in York) in cases that do not involve Church doctrine. Appeals may also be heard from certain dormant courts, including Prize Courts (which hear cases relating to the capture of enemy ships at sea, and the ownership of property seized from captured ships) and the Court of Admiralty of the Cinque Ports. Finally, the Queen-in-Council determines if an individual is qualified to be elected to the House of Commons under the House of Commons Disqualification Act.

== ECHR and ECJ ==

In addition to the above domestic courts, there are two further courts which can be said to exercise a jurisdiction over the United Kingdom.

The ''European Court of Human Rights'' deals with cases concerning alleged infringements of the ''European Convention on Human Rights''.

The ''European Court of Justice'' deals with cases concerning alleged infringements of European Union law.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;The Constitution&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

[[UK Constitution and Government/Houses of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Windsor|Previous Chapter]] | [[UK Constitution and Government/Sovereign|Next Chapter]]
------
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Unlike most other sovereign states, the United Kingdom does not possess a document expressing itself to be the nation's fundamental or highest law. Instead, the British constitution is found in a number of sources. Because of this, the British constitution is often said to be an ''unwritten constitution''; however, many parts of the constitution are indeed in written form, so it would be more accurate to refer to the body of the British constitution as an ''uncodified constitution''.


The British constitution is spread across a number of sources:&lt;br /&gt;
[[#1. Statute law|1. Statute law]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[#2. Royal prerogative|2. Royal prerogative (executive powers usually exercised by Ministers of the Crown)]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[#3. Constitutional conventions|3. Constitutional conventions (accepted norms of political behaviour)]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[#4. Common law|4. Common law (decisions by senior courts that are binding on lower courts)]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[#5. EU Treaties|5. EU Treaties]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[#6. Authoritative statements|6. Statements made in books considered to have particular authority]]&lt;br /&gt;

Note that not all of these sources form part of the law of the land, and so the British constitution encompasses a wider variety of rules, etc. than that of (say) the United States.


Many important elements of the British constitution are to be found in Acts of Parliament.  In contrast with many other countries, legislation affecting the constitution is not subject to any special procedure, and is passed using the same procedures as for ordinary legislation.

The most important statute law still in force and affecting the constitution includes the following:
* The ''Habeas Corpus Act 1679''
* The ''Bill of Rights'' (1689)
* The ''Claim of Right'' (1689)
* The ''Act of Settlement'' (1701)
* The ''Acts of Union'' (1707)
* The ''Septennial Act 1715''
* The ''Acts of Union'' (1800)
* The ''Parliament Acts'' (1911 and 1949)
* The ''Regency Act 1953''
* The ''Life Peerages Act 1958''
* The ''Peerage Act 1963''
* The ''European Communities Act 1972''
* The ''British Nationality Act 1981''
* The ''Representation of the People Act 1983''
* The ''Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986''
* The ''Human Rights Act 1998''
* The ''Scotland Act 1998''
* The ''Northern Ireland Act 1998''
* The ''House of Lords Act 1999''
* The ''Civil Contingencies Act 2004''
* The ''Constitutional Reform Act 2005''
* The ''Government of Wales Act 2006''

== 2. Royal prerogative ==

Certain powers pre-dating the establishment of the present parliamentary system are still formally retained by the Queen.  In practice almost all of these powers are exercised only on the decision of Ministers of the Crown (the Cabinet).  These powers, known as the ''royal prerogative'', include the following:

* The appointment and dismissal of government ministers
* The summoning, opening, prorogation, and dissolution of Parliament
* The assenting to legislation
* The power to declare war, and to deploy the armed forces
* The power to conduct relations with foreign states, including the recognition of states or governments, and the making of treaties
* The issuing of passports

== 3. Constitutional conventions ==

Conventions are customs that operate as rules considered to bind the actions of the Queen or the Government.  Conventions are not part of the law, but nevertheless are often considered to be just as fundamental to the structure and working of the constitution as the contents of any statute.  Indeed, statute law affecting the constitution is often written in such a way that the existence of certain conventions is taken for granted, and some conventions are so fundamental that many people are unaware that they are in fact &quot;unwritten&quot; rules.

Examples of the more important constitutional conventions include:

* The Queen does not direct government policy, and leaves all decision-making to her Cabinet
* Cabinet members are bound by the principle of ''collective responsibility''; ministers who feel themselves unable to publicly support or defend the policy of the Government are expected to resign
* The Government is headed by a Prime Minister, appointed by the Queen from the House of Commons
* The Prime Minister is usually expected to be the leader of the political party with the most MPs (members of the House of Commons)
* When a Prime Minister's political party loses a general election (i.e. obtains less seats in the House of Commons than a rival party), he or she is expected to resign
* Government ministers are usually expected to be drawn entirely from the two Houses of Parliament, and most important office-holders are expected to be MPs
* A government that is unable to obtain the passage through Parliament of important legislation, including the annual Appropriation and Finance Acts, is expected to resign
* The (unelected) House of Lords does not obstruct the passage of legislation stated in the government party's election manifesto to be fundamental policy
* The Speaker of the House of Commons is expected to be impartial, even though originally elected as the representative of a political party

== 4. Common law ==

The common law is that part of the law which does not rest on statute.  Instead, it is the accumulation of specific judicial decisions set by senior courts as precedents binding on lesser courts.

Certain parts of the common law are also what is known as ''trite law'': examples of this include the fact that the United Kingdom is a monarchy, and the fact that brothers take precedence over sisters in the succession to the throne.

== 5. EU Treaties ==

As a member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom is bound by EU law.

== 6. Authoritative statements ==

Certain published works are usually considered to have particular authority.  In the first half of the twentieth century this was the case with A V Dicey's ''Law of the Constitution'', being cited with approval in judicial decisions.  A particularly important work is ''Erskine May'', which sets out the procedures and customs of the House of Commons.  Other important sources include certain ministerial statements.

However, none of these works have '''legal''' authority; at best, they are merely ''persuasive''.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
== Devolution ==

''Devolution'' refers to the transfer of administrative, executive, or legislative authority to new institutions operating only within a defined part of the United Kingdom.  Devolved institutions have been created for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales.

Devolution differs from federalism in formally being a unilateral process that can be reversed at will; formal sovereignty is still retained at the centre.  Thus, while the US Congress cannot reduce the powers of a state legislature, Parliament has the legal capacity to even go so far as to abolish the devolved legislatures.

Devolution in Wales was originally restricted to the executive/administrative sphere, whereas in Scotland and Northern Ireland devolution extended to wide powers to pass laws.

== Scotland ==

The Scottish legislative authority is the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Parliament is a unicameral body composed of 129 members (called Members of Scottish Parliament, or MSPs) elected for fixed four-year terms. Each of 73 members is elected by a constituency. The remaining are elected by eight regions, with each region electing seven members. Each voter has one constituency vote&amp;mdash;cast for a single individual&amp;mdash;and one regional vote&amp;mdash;cast either for a party or for an independent candidate. Regional members are allocated in such a way as to permit a party's share of the regional vote to be proportional to its share of seats in the Scottish Parliament. 

The Scottish Government is the executive authority of Scotland; it is led by the First Minister. Other members of the Scottish Cabinet are generally given the title of Minister. The First Minister must retain the confidence of the Scottish Parliament to remain in power.

Scotland has responsibility over several major areas, including taxation, criminal justice, health, education, transport, the environment, sport, culture and local government. The Parliament at Westminster, however, retains authority over a certain number of ''reserved matters''. Reserved matters include foreign affairs, defence, immigration, social security and welfare, employment, and general economic and fiscal policy.

==Wales==
The National Assembly for Wales is the Welsh legislative authority. It is, like the Scottish Parliament, a unicameral body; it also uses a similar electoral system. Forty of its sixty members are chosen from single-member constituencies, while the remaining twenty are regional members. (There are five regions.) The Welsh Government is led by the First Minister and includes other Ministers, who must retain the confidence of the Assembly.

The third Welsh Assembly can legislate using a system called &quot;Assembly Measures&quot;. This system is a lower form of Primary Legislation similar to Acts of Parliament. They can be used to repeal laws, create provision and amend laws. The difference with &quot;Assembly Measures&quot; and &quot;Acts of the Assembly&quot; is that Measures do not have a bulk of powers with them, each Measure will come with a LCO, or Legislative Competency Order, which transfers powers from the UK Parliament to the Welsh Assembly Government. Devolution in Wales has changed a lot since 1999.

In order for the National Assembly to have full legislative powers, they will need to trigger a referendum through both the Assembly and both houses of the United Kingdom parliament. Once done, Wales will for the first time ever, will be able to legislate and make their own Acts. (To be known as Acts of the Assembly, or Acts of the National Assembly for Wales).  In early 2011, a referendum held in Wales approved the transfer of full legislative competence to the National Assembly in all devolved matters.

== Northern Ireland ==

Northern Ireland was the first part of the United Kingdom to gain devolution, in 1921.  However, it has had a troubled history since then, caused by conflict between the main ''Unionist'' and ''Nationalist'' communities.  Because of this historical background, the present system of devolution requires power to be shared between political parties representing the different communities, and there are complex procedural checks in place to ensure cross-community support for legislation and executive action.

The Northern Ireland Assembly comprises 108 members elected to represent 18 six-member constituencies.

The Executive (government) is made up of members from the largest parties in the Assembly, with ministerial portfolios allocated in proportion to party strengths.  The Executive is headed jointly by a First Minister and Deputy First Minister, who are jointly elected by the Assembly.

The Assembly's legislative powers are broad, and are similar to those of the Scottish Parliament (with the notable exception of taxation).  The transfer from the United Kingdom's central government of responsibility for the criminal justice system has been highly contentious, and has only recently been carried out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Microwave==

Microwaves are defined to be waves having frequency greater than 1 GHz. While some books put the upper limit of 30 GHz to microwaves, some literature consider the upper limit to be up to 300 GHz. At such high frequencies, the behaviour of the devices used commonly is no longer predictable by general rules and new design issues need to be considered. Even short leads of devices act as inductances and may possess capacitances.

A magnetron emits microwaves at 2450 MHz &amp;lambda; = 12.24 cm
A microwave is a Faraday cage, so waves can't escape openings smaller than 6.12 cm.
Microwaves work by bombarding atoms from all sides with an electric field.  This causes the dipole to keep realigning itself and the food heats up.  Most effective on water, metal deflects microwaves.  Containers survive because they do not absorb many microwaves relative to the food.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Photocopier==
One example of the practical use of static electricity is a photocopier. A photocopier is a fairly complicated piece of equipment, but the basic principle of how it works is fairly simple. The best way to understand what is going on is to consider it as a stage by stage process.

{|
|-
| colspan=&quot;4&quot; | [[Image:Stages of how a photocopier works.png]]
|-
| Stage 1 || Stage 2 || Stage 3 || Stage 4
|}

===Stage one ===
Positive charge is sprayed onto a plate from a high voltage power supply. The plate is connected to the earth but the charge does not have quite enough energy to flow away. (The plate is not a good conductor of electricity)

===Stage two ===
Paper is placed over the plate and a light shone onto the paper. Where the paper is white the light is reflected onto the plate, where the paper is dark a shadow falls onto the plate. The light falling on the plate gives it just the extra energy needed to allow the  charge to escape to earth. The plate becomes neutral where the paper was white but keeps its charge where the paper is black. The plate is now a copy of the paper with charges taking the place of ink.

===Stage three ===
Toner particles are spayed through a negatively charged nozzle onto the plate. As the toner passes through the nozzle it picks up the charge so that each particle of toner becomes negatively charged. The now charged toner is attracted to the  areas of positive charge because '''unlike charges attract'''. More light then allows the positive charge to escape (However the negative charge on the toner remains)

===Stage four ===
A piece of paper is given a very strong positive charge, and then placed in contact with the plate. The paper attracts the toner. The paper is then removed from the plate and passed through a heating unit. The heat melts the toner and bonds it to the paper.

In a real photocopier, there is no plate, just a large drum. As the drum rotates it's surface goes through stages one to four. At the end of the sequence a scraper removes any toner left on the drum and the whole process is repeated with a new image. A good photocopier can process a page in less than a second.

===Questions on Photocopiers ===
''''Q1)''''If the black areas of the image leave a positive charge on the plate what charge do the white areas of the image leave? (''Be very careful, the answer may not be what you think!'')

'''Q2)''' How does the light shining onto the charged plate allow it to lose it's charge ?

'''Q3)''' Why is the toner given a negative charge ?

'''Q4)''' Why does the paper attract the toner ?

==Other uses of static electricity==
===Spray painting  car parts===
When paint is sprayed from a paint gun, the painter normally needs to use a fair amount of skill to ensure the paint goes on evenly. By connecting the spray nozzle to a negative electrode, it is possible to charge each droplet of paint. If the car part is then given the opposite charge, the paint droplets will be attracted to the car body part. This has several advantages. 
*Less mess- The paint goes to the body part and not to the electrically neutral floor.
*Less wastage - All the paint ends up on the body part, very little is wasted.
*Less skill needed - The paint wraps around the part, because the charges all over the part attract the paint. The paint even ends up on the back!

===Questions===
'''Q5)''' If the paint droplets are given a positive charge, what charge should the car part be given?

'''Q6)''' Why does less paint fall on the floor?

{| bgcolor=&quot;ffeeaa&quot;
|-
| '''Summary'''
|-
| A photocopier uses static electrcity image to attract ink
|-
| unlike charges attract, the image and the ink are oppositely charged
|-
| Unlike charges attracting is also used when spray painting cars
|-
| The body and the paint are oppositely charged.

== Alternate TOC's for different Application domains.. ==

Would it be possible to have a alternate TOC arrangment for different contexts?
Like for example 'First Aid in the Workplace' ?

I also note some topics are semmingly not covered in this book.

I am NOT First Aid Trained , but my general layout of a book on First Aid in the work place
would be something like the following


*Introduction
** What is First Aid?
** Training Organisations

* Ethical and Legal Issues
** Conduct
** Consent
** Liability
** Children and vulnerable groups.
** Suspicion of Abuse 

* Risk  Assessment
** Risk assessment
** Protective Equipment
** 'Safe' working
** Incident 'Stress'.

* Casualty Assessment
** How to asses a 'casulty'/patient
** A,B,C..
*** A - irway
*** B - reathing
*** C - Circulation/Compressions
*** D - Deadly Bleeding
** Head to toe
** History
** Vitals.

** Cuts and Punctures  (NB This is how to asses, the treatment would come in respect of handling bleeding)
** Falls

* Airway/Breathing
** Choking
** Airway Collapse
** Anaphylaxis 
** Asmatha/ Hyperventelation
** Oxygen starvation

* Circulation and Bleeding
** Internal Bleeding
** External Bleeding
*** Cuts
*** Punctures
** Cardiac issues (Heart Attack/Angina)
** Stroke

* Systemic injuries -
** Shock
** Electrocution (aka Electrical Shock)
** Fatigue / RSI.

* Tissue Injuries-
** Chest/Abdominal Injury
** Organs
** Eyes
** Mouth
** Burns

* Bones, Joint and Muscles -
** Breaks and Fractures
** Injuries to the Skull
** 'Back Pain'
** Spinal injuries
** Tears and Sprains

*Poisoning -
** Chemical
** 'Noxious' fumes (inc. Monoxide)
** Intoxication
** Overdose.
** Food 

* Medical Conditions -
** Diabeties
** Seizures (inc Epilepsy)
** 'Crisis' - (aka Mental Health Emergency)
** Spotting Fatigue

* Environmental Injury
** Caused by Heat
** Caused by Cold
** Caused by Depth 

Any comments?

== Foot Blisters ==

A page on foot blisters would be nice, the only information I can find is about burn blisters and it doesn't run into too much detail about dealing with them [[User:Gsp8181|Gsp8181]] ([[User talk:Gsp8181|talk]]) 18:50, 29 September 2010 (UTC)

== New CPR guidelines ==

Hello,

You may have noticed that new CPR guidelines have been issued just a few days ago. However, the full implications of those changes are not yet understood, and training agencies have not updated their materials or courses. I propose to update the textbook in January - by then, that sort of thing should be resolved, and we should have a more concrete basis to work from.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code style=&quot;color:#4B0082; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|mike]]@[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|en.wb]]:&amp;#126;$&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; 03:10, 23 October 2010 (UTC)


I'm working on an update to 2010 Guidelines. Also, there are a few first aid topics that I streamlining a bit, and trying to make sure the topics are covered at a level that is no higher than advanced first aid. 

I teach first aid and CPR on a regular basis, used to be an Emergency Medical Technical, and am currently a nurse. I have a pretty good working knowledge of the procedures. Feel free to let me know if there are any suggestions. In particular, I'm trying to maintain the international applicability of the book, while including the relevant information for first aid in the US.

== Non-survivable injuries ==

Should there be a section on non-survivable injuries (i.e. decapitation, being cut in half, etc.) so people know when they can't help someone? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:54, 27 February 2011 (UTC)

: I don't think a new section would be necessary, but perhaps incorporating it into the initial action steps (or somewhere in the ABCs) would be appropriate.  [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] ([[User talk:Mike6271|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mike6271|contribs]]) 05:26, 6 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Audio Files ==
I really appreciate all the work people have given to this project and I am happy that I can use this Wikibook to learn Geman (I have printed it!) but I hate to say that some audio files are iritating. &quot;Vocoded&quot; and filtered files sound unnatural and simply do not fit the purpose. Editing is fine, as long as the listeners cannot &quot;hear&quot; that the voice was modulated -marvin

== Gern vs Gerne ==

I had a bit of doubt on where to use gern and when to use gerne. Has it got anything to do with the cases?
I hope it's not too abusive to post a question here, hope it can improve the course somehow.

Both words can be used in the same situations, but &quot;gern&quot; is used more often. --[[User:Larzarus|LaRzarus]] 15:49, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

Really? I think I'm using &quot;gerne&quot; more often. Maybe a north-south difference? [[Special:Contributions/92.225.139.188|92.225.139.188]] ([[User talk:92.225.139.188|talk]]) 20:44, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

&quot;Gern&quot; is an shortend version of &quot;Gerne&quot;. You can use both, it doesn'T matter--[[Special:Contributions/93.232.218.115|93.232.218.115]] ([[User talk:93.232.218.115|talk]]) 19:47, 23 August 2010 (UTC)

== Saying when you do something ==
Does Time, Manner, Place not apply here?

''Ich spiele Football um halb Vier''  is that not ''Um halb vier spiele ich Football''
''In meiner Freizeit spiele ich Fussball'' etc


It's not clear to me at all how you're supposed to conjugate the verb &quot;lesen&quot;. The section should actually say this instead of leaving the student guessing. Specifically, I have no idea how to conjugate it for 'ich'. The book talks about not adding an extra 's'. '''What extra 's'???''' Where did that come from. Why would I hadd it and where would I put it?

I'm totally baffled by that comment. If the correct conjugation is ''ich lese'' then what's the point of talking about extra s's? Should the book also say not to add an extra w and two additional q's?

''Ich lese'' is correct indeed, and I can't see any sense in the extra-s comment, either. I'm taking the liberty to take it out. [[User:Epsilon|Epsilon]] 20:29, 13 March 2006 (UTC)
:Correcting myself:The extra-s comment refers to the du-form, where you'd normally use the ending -st. As the stem of lesen ends in s, ond of the s's is indeed dropped. ''Du liest'' rather than ''du liesst'' or - even worse - ''du lesst''. [[User:Epsilon|Epsilon]] 20:36, 13 March 2006 (UTC)
-------
How come all of the WikiBooks are messed up like this? Now you can't see the lesson.

Sorry, there are a couple of word-order mistakes in the German and the 'Likes and Dislikes' uses the wrong verb.

:Mag and other words will be introduced later, so please don't try to include them in this lesson. &quot;Gern&quot; will be left out when you use &quot;mag&quot;, of course, but for this lesson, please leave it in (used with haben and schwimmen, etc.) Thanks. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 13:22, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)
:Even if we were to introduce &quot;Mag&quot;, we would need to give them conjugations and an introduction to modals. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 17:42, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I intend to add example problems to this at [[German:Beginner Lesson 2P]] (P for problems), so I apologize if the explanations (especially for time) seem way too brief. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 17:50, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Thanks SamE for fixing the errors and making the lesson viewable again.
----

It is not explained what plural and what singular was.

Pl/sing ecc. can be illustrated by a picture/pictogram.

:It is assumed the reader already knows what plural and singular are, as it is taught as early as kindergarten and first grade. In lesson 1, the reader was introduced to the pronouns and their English equivalents. This should be enough. Actually, I was thinking about doing something defining the cases, as 1st person plural can include all three persons, for example. But it doesn't go here, rather in the [[German:Beginner Review 1|first review]]. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:03, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

In Austria 15:15 (and all other xx:15) is often called &quot;Viertel Vier&quot; (same use as the &quot;Dreiviertel&quot; mentioned in the text).

Also &quot;Viertel&quot;, &quot;Halb&quot; and &quot;Dreiviertel&quot; only apply to 1-12 hours (I think this is true for Germany too). So one should never say &quot;Viertel Dreizehn&quot; or &quot;Halb Fuenfzehn&quot;.

If somebody feels like reworking some lines, please consider these comments.

Hi, I do not understand the &quot;Das soll Spass sein&quot; in the dialogue. Perhaps it means &quot;That should be fun&quot;, but WHAT should be fun? To what does it aplly? In every case, I would translate &quot;That should/could be fun&quot; with &quot;Das soll/kann Spass MACHEN&quot;, because &quot;this is fun&quot; is translated with &quot;das macht spass&quot; -- [[User:84.130.185.235|84.130.185.235]] 20:39, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

by:
!Franz
|Wirklich? Ich spiele um drei Fußball .

&quot;Ich Spiele Fußbal um drei&quot; is correct, but unusual.

== Conflicting answers ==

The lesson says that &quot;In English one ''plays'' a sport, while in German one ''does'' a sport.&quot; so you should use the verb ''machen'', but in the section quiz answers it uses ''spielen'' as in ''spielen Football'' instead of ''machen Football''.  I'm no expert in German, but this seems to conflict with the lesson. [[User:68.211.46.194|68.211.46.194]] 22:36, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

Yes, in German one does a sport, but one plays soccer. If you do not understand I'll explain it it greater detail. --[[User:German Men92|Je suis]] 00:44, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

:I think I get it.  If you are naming a specific sport, one uses ''spielen'' but if you are referring to sports in general (''Sport'') one uses ''machen'', correct?  [[User:208.61.4.77|208.61.4.77]] 03:48, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

== Volunteer for speaking the audiofiles == 
Hi ! My name is Stefan and i like to volunteer for making the audiofiles in native german. I am speaking the &quot;high german&quot; with no dialect. I have equipment to do high quality recording. Nice greetings --[[User:SvonHalenbach|SvonHalenbach]] 11:10, 30 July 2006 (UTC)


Hi folks! I'd help too. but how can i convert wav files to ogg? Can anybody help me? Thanks! Christoph [[User:84.174.102.18|84.174.102.18]] 14:12, 13 February 2007 (UTC)


One program for media conversion that I've used and liked is [http://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html SUPER]. For recording audio, I suggest [http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ Audacity], which exports .ogg easily. --[[User:TheSpinningBrain|TheSpinningBrain]] 04:37, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

== Sentence Structure ==
Quotation: '
*''Ich spiele Basketball, und er spielt auch Basketball.''
:I play basketball, and he also plays basketball.

The new word, '''&quot;auch&quot;''', is very important and it means &quot;also&quot;. The one grammar rule about &quot;auch&quot; is that is always comes after the verb.'

I think you are a bit strict concerning the sentence structure: e. g. (see also previous unit) 'auch' can have many positions: to stress that _he_ also plays basketball, I could write 'und auch er spielt Basketball.', as well. I could even say '... und Basketball spielt er auch.'
Some positions are impossible, i. e.
'... Basketball auch spielt er.' and
'... er auch spielt Basketball.' and
'... er spielt Basketball auch.',
but every different structure (with verb in second position) is allowed!

&quot;auch&quot; doesn't neccessarily comes after a verb: &quot;ich spiele Fußball, auch spiele ich Tennis&quot;. However, this sounds a bit exalted. [[Special:Contributions/92.225.139.188|92.225.139.188]] ([[User talk:92.225.139.188|talk]]) 20:42, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

== Nicht ==

In the lesson, it says, &quot;To say 'not', use 'nicht'. 'Nicht' goes after the verb but before the sport.&quot; It can, but it's more common for nicht to be at the end of the sentence in this case, unless the direct object is followed by &quot;sondern,&quot; as in &quot;Ich spiele nicht Fußball, sondern Schach.&quot; Otherwise, I would say either &quot;Ich spiele Fußball nicht&quot; or &quot;Ich spiele keinen Fußball.&quot; --[[User:TheSpinningBrain|TheSpinningBrain]] 05:15, 23 August 2007 (UTC)
:&quot;Ich spiele Fußball nicht&quot; sounds wrong to me (native German). [[Special:Contributions/92.225.139.188|92.225.139.188]] ([[User talk:92.225.139.188|talk]]) 20:40, 7 June 2010 (UTC)
::The rules for the position of &quot;nicht&quot; in non-contrastive uses are quite difficult; see in [http://www.canoo.net/services/OnlineGrammar/Satz/Negation/Stellung/nichtkontrast.html?lang=en canoo.net]. They consider &quot;Ich spiele Gitarre nicht.&quot; as incorrect and &quot;Ich spiele nicht Gitarre.&quot; as correct. I think the same is true for the example with &quot;Fußball&quot;. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 23:58, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

== Sport Machen Versus Sport Treiben ==

When I was taught German, I mostly was exposed to using Treiben with Sport, and not Machen. Could someone please clarify if there's a difference in meaning, if one is more proper or more frequently used, and any other details that should be known? Thanks. --[[User:Silvorte|Silvorte]] 04:16, 07 June 2010 (UTC)

:to me &quot;treiben&quot; sounds more exalted and &quot;old school&quot;. However, &quot;treiben&quot; can also have a sexual connotation. [[Special:Contributions/92.225.139.188|92.225.139.188]] ([[User talk:92.225.139.188|talk]]) 20:39, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

::I think you can use &quot;treiben&quot; and &quot;machen&quot; with the word &quot;Sport&quot;. &quot;treiben&quot; is less colloquial and might be more common in written German. &quot;machen&quot; is more colloquial and probably more common in spoken German. E.g.: &quot;Treibst/Machst du Sport?&quot;, &quot;Ich treibe/mache (jeden Tag) Sport.&quot;, &quot;Welchen Sport treibst/machst du?&quot;. With a specific sport (e.g. &quot;Fußball&quot;, &quot;Handball&quot;, &quot;Basketball&quot;) you should use &quot;spielen&quot;. &quot;treiben&quot; sounds very strange in this case and &quot;machen&quot; very colloquial (and wrong if you speak with an accent). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 00:11, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

== Wrong sentences? ==

For me (German native speaker), the following sentences sound wrong or at least strange: &quot;Wer hat Hausaufgaben?&quot; (what does that mean? Maybe &quot;Wer hat die Hausaufgaben gemacht?&quot; or &quot;Wer hat Hausaufgaben auf?&quot;), &quot;Wer spielt nicht Fußball?&quot; (strange, correct: &quot;Wer (von Euch) spielt kein Fußball?&quot;), &quot;Wir spielen nicht Tennis.&quot; (strange, correct: &quot;Wir spielen kein Tennis.&quot;). [[Special:Contributions/92.225.139.188|92.225.139.188]] ([[User talk:92.225.139.188|talk]]) 20:37, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

:True, the meaning of &quot;Wer hat Hausaufgaben?&quot; depends on the context. Without context it's unclear. &quot;Wer spielt nicht Fußball?&quot; and &quot;Wir spielen nicht Tennis.&quot; sound correct to me (also native German speaker), although I would probably say &quot;Wir spielen kein Tennis.&quot; --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 00:18, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

== Page split ==

I suggest to split this very long lesson into two: Freizeit (currently lesson 2a) and Zeit (currently lesson 2b).--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 07:12, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

This one is a freak! 
In the example for the indefinite article at the end 'Wir spielen eine Stunde lang', the 'eine' is not an indefinite article at all. It is rather the 'eine' of counting; a contrast would be 'Wir spielen zwei Stunden lang'. It looks the same but it is not. That's German for you. 
Now, I am sure no student will notice, but then again ...
It could be corrected by giving Heinrich a different line in the dialogue 'Willst du spielen? Ich habe einen Ball.' Then 'Ich habe einen Ball' could be the example for the indefinite article at the end. [User:Floflei6|Floflei6]] 13:00, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:Oops! Missed that one! You are right &quot;one hour&quot; not &quot;an hour&quot; ! - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:50, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I changed &quot;minute&quot; to &quot;Minute&quot; wherever necessary. I propose to delete &quot;Es ist drei durch.&quot;, because I suppose that a vast majority of Germans doesn´t understand it. 
Finally I don´t know why Karl should say &quot;Dann ...&quot;. It would be more approbriate for Heinrich to say &quot;... Dann können wir (ja) eine Stunde (lang) spielen.&quot; (In this case Karl would say: &quot;Ich kann [leider nur] bis zwei [Uhr] spielen.&quot;) - fsd, 14 Dec 2006 (CET)</text>

September 26, 2004:

In my opinion, this book does not often venture beyond the obvious; and it seems not to be following the stated objectives. I do not want to sound overly critical of this work, but what should the reader come away from this book knowing? Some concrete strategies for learning and recalling information have been provided; but, in my opinion, the authors of this book have essentially made this assumption that its readers learn and think not so differently from themselves. If this book is to have a wider audience, this should not be the case.

:Please give an example! --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 00:24, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Not having english as my native language, I find it difficult to decide if the following sentence is well formed: &quot;Getting the Thinking Wagons Out of the Rut&quot;. The model of thoughts as wagons on the nerve circuits is nice in this context but should I write &quot;wagons of thought&quot; instead? Or something else? I'm afraid there will be a lot of Swinglish (Swedish-English) in everything I write :)

----

'''dataangel''': The biggest problem I see with this book is that the introduction claims to not be another one of those read-it-to-feel-better books, that it will be actual science, but studies and footnotes are completely absent in at least the first two chapters of the text (the ones I  read). The &quot;flock of birds&quot; analogy seems contrived, pulled right out of one of those books ;)

This might help:

http://www.hsdebate.com/archives/theory/old/Korcok--Speak_Fast.html

:I don't remember that I claimed it would be science. My intention with this book was not that it should be scientific, since that would result in a very thin book. However, I wanted the book to be concise and not repeating or full of sentences like &quot;this book will change your life&quot; or silly testimonials. Methods that by someones, and hopefully many peoples, experience has resulted in better ability of the organism should be clearly stated in a concise not too enthusiastic way. When I have time left, I'll read the book and remove everything which isn't true to the initial claim. If someone hasn't done that already by then! --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 17:51, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)

: Usually &quot;trains of thought&quot;. Trains go faster than wagons :) How about &quot;get your trains of thought back on track&quot;? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 20:11, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::The metaphor is this: Your thoughts are stuck in a certain rut (track). Creativity is now ''defined'' as the ability to make sudden changes of track. The difficulty is not getting the train back on track, but get it ''off track'' for a while, hoping it will continue somewhere else on another track. See what i mean? I'm really hoping for that picture to be drawn... :)

At the moment it seems like I'm the main author of the book. Without reflection, I've sometimes written &quot;I&quot;, as authors of books often do. Now, this wikibook is not intended to have one single author and maybe it becomes strange to read the book. Should I change all formulations using &quot;I&quot; referring to the author? Or should I keep the &quot;I&quot;'s and think of the wikibook as an entity in itself?

: That's up to you for now. :) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 21:05, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::I think you should just leave it as is and not worry about the particulars at this stage.  [[User:M.Welch|M.Welch]]

:::Good idea. The first step to a good book is something valuable to write about. The last step is to present the information in a nice fashion. --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 14:29, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)


----

The current organization of the book is far from perfect. What is really the difference between information sifting and information evaluation? Why is &quot;The Concept of Change&quot; under the headline Information Utilization instead of Information Grasping? Etc. Still, I believe there is something good about this new organization... New ideas are more than welcome.

----

Howdy! I'd take out &quot;I,&quot; and re-orient to talk more about &quot;you&quot; and the reader's experiences. In general, I like text that talks about &quot;you&quot; and &quot;I&quot;, but in a wiki book, I don't think it's a good idea. For myself, at least, it puts a barrier between me and editing the text.

Also: Can you work in http://www.ludism.org/mentat/WikiNode somehow? It's more of a hypertext / community than it is a ''book.'' It already links to this wiki.

I don't know how Wikibooks tend to work; Can you have extraneous &quot;pages&quot; that are wiki, but not part of the book? Ideally, there would be a WikiNode on this wiki. See http://wikinodes.wiki.taoriver.net/ to understand what this is all about.

----

Hmmm, yes, the first reaction directly hits what I think should be in the book: scientific proof. Well, you're right on the fact that many self-help books mostly contain feel-better text rather than the real material. Yet I think we should devote a chapter in explaining and giving the reader more indept information. A lot of things concerning can nowadays be called primitive. We people just know to little about the brain. Yet you should not give up with just that last fact. In fact, if people feel-better, they'll accomplish more. So see it as a placebo effect. It would help, even if science cannot prove it. Anyways, is this book going about improving or just to talk about intelligence intensification. I would like to the the main author's first inspirations and goals.
By the way, I was thinking. Should I add some student-skill? I mean like, how to discuss and give advise and how to solve exact issues. But I think that should belong to another wikibook. Anyways, I hope it helps giving this wikibook a more clear goal if it's not added.

== Psychonautics, Metaphysics, Psychology, Ethics ==

Hi there. To be frank, the information and text as currently created
is more off in the direction of Intelligence dampening.
This all needs a whole lot of work, and by people who actually have
expert knowledge on the subject. The Table of contents is even a headache. I think it is a worthy project, and I might be willing to contribute, but I'll need some honesty around here about how much
people actually know VS how much they are just winging it.

I am not sure what happened to my previous posts to this area.
Apparently, they were deleted, because My contributions and user
watchlist show nada.

I am an expert in the fields of Psychology, Sociology, Psychonautics,
World Religions, World Religious History, Ethics, and Metaphysics.

I am interested in writing an integrative eclectic text on all of those topics simultaneously. The main point of the whole process is
to create the first useful users manual for the human Brain.

To those ends, I have generated some materials.
Here are some of those.

the wikipedia article, which i am one contributor of;
{{dablink|This article is about psychonauts and related practices; for other uses, see [[Psychonaut (disambiguation)]].}}
A '''Psychonaut''' (literally, a sailor of the psyche) is a person who uses  [[trance]] technologies from any of the world's [[religion]]s, modern [[psychology]], and other assorted paradigms, to explore the [[psyche]], their own [[consciousness]], and potentially improve real performance of certain psychological tasks. The term is often associated with the use of [[psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogens]] or [[entheogen]]s as guides, or means, to achieve inward spiritual experiences. This is quite distinct from religious use, or social and leisure use of [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], although invariably these overlap.

According to [[Jonathan Ott]], the word Psychonaut was originally coined by the [[Germany|German]] author [[Ernst Jünger]].

==Use of the term==
Psychonaut is a modern term, used to describe one who uses trance technologies, and sometimes, more specifically, mind-altering substances more with a view to their ability to act as entheogens, than for their inebriating (or social) effect. In effect, they are used as a means to achieve states of mind in which different perceptions unhindered by everyday mental filters and processes can arise.  As such, psychonauts beleive that when used with this intent, their effects, can be life altering, and are not considered by their proponents to be mere hallucinations. An alternate description is that while some aspects of the experience may be hallucinatory, the realizations caused by those hallucinations, and the mental, emotional and long term impact of the experience, is real, usually positive, and enduring. 

The term is often associated with [[neoshamanism|neoshamanic]] practices; however, many distinguish between the mental exploration of the psychonaut and authentic, healing-oriented [[shamanism|shamanic]] practice.  Some prominent, self-proclaimed psychonauts such as [[Zoe7]] are somewhat controversial figures within the psychedelic scene, often accused of [[cultural appropriation]] and a disregard for the methods and purposes of traditional shamanic uses of psychedelics and other trance technologies.

==Associated concepts, technologies, and practices==
===Concepts===
====Brain function====
Psychonautics can be considered an attempt to generate a users manual for the human brain. Unlike its near cousin, [[psychology]], which is concerned with understanding other people, psychonauts are more concerned with understanding themselves, and the process of self exploration; accordingly, they engage in direct exploration of themselves and their own thought processes.

As such, psychonauts seek to understand mental process and functioning and employ such knowledge in their activities.  Key to this is auto-modification of [[Electroencephalography|brain wave]] frequenecies, which can lead to quite distinct perceptual states; a detailed examination and understanding of one's own thought processes, habits, and beliefs is also sought.

This is also ideally practically applied in bettering one's self through the knowledge of one's own thought processes; with this understanding and heightened perception of one's own internal dialogue, it is thought that one is more able to control their own [[ego]], and detach themselves from what is seen as a [[herd behavior|herd mentality]] common to modern culture.

====Mythical archetypes and concepts====
Psychonauts commonly place much emphasis on various mythical [[archetype]]s and concepts, believing that these are useful to coming to understand one's own thought patterns and the nature of existence.  As in shamanic practice, the [[Axis mundi]] is often employed, often overlayed with [[chakra]]s and other relevant concepts of bodily function.  The nature of [[karma]] is often explored in trying to understand one's own situation, actions, and relation to the outside world.

====Metaphysics====
Psychonauts are often interested in [[metaphysics]], the branch of philosophy dealing with the ultimate nature of reality or existance; it is thought that in coming to some understanding of how the universe functions and the nature of existance, one would be better able to govern themselves accordingly and integrate their life experiences.  

===Technologies and practices===
====Hallucinogens/entheogens====
The technology and practice most often associated with psychonauts is the use of psychedelic drugs for mental exploration.  The method of use varies widely; such usage is often (but not always) [[entheogen]]ic and informed by traditional shamanic uses of psychedelic drugs and rituals surrounding such usage.

Some hallucinogens commonly used by psychonauts include:
*[[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] 
*[[LSD]]
*[[Marijuana]]
*[[Psychedelic Mushrooms]]
*[[Mescaline]]
*[[Peyote]]
*[[Salvia Divinorum]]
*[[Ayahuasca]]

====Dreams====
As dreams are considered by psychonauts to be a window into thought processes, many keep [[dream journal]]s in order to better remember dreams and further their understanding of their own symbolic internal dialogue.  Many attempt to not only remember their dreams, but engage in [[lucid dreaming]], in which one learns to directly control their dreams and hopefully gain more control over their own thought process and hallucinogenic experiences.

====Ritual====
[[Ritual]] is often employed for purposes of grounding and centering one's self, to set one's focus and intentions, and to instill a conception of the significance and depth of psychonautical practice.  Repeated use of ritual may also train the brain to associate certain activities and states of consciousness with specific situations, creating deeper experiences and allowing one to more easily enter altered states of consciousness.

====Other====
Other technologies and practices employed include:
*Sleep deprivation
*[[Sensory deprivation]]
*Dark-room retreats
*Brain wave [[entrainment]] (used to induce different brain wave frequencies and altered modes of perception)
*[[Glossolalia]] (used in an attempt to get beyond verbal/analytic thought]]

==Notable psychonauts==
*[[Alan Watts]]
*[[Albert Hofmann]]
*[[Aldous Huxley]]
*[[Carlos Castaneda]]
*[[Jack Kerouac]]
*[[John Lilly]]
*[[Ken Kesey]]
*[[Peter Carroll]]
*[[Ram Dass]]
*[[Timothy Leary]]

== Missing details ==

There are a variety of details which i think would be fair to include here in some form or another. Heah did an Awesome job of cleaning up this wreck, and I am totally thankful. However, Some of the &quot;stubs&quot; that got deleted in that task are still very worthy,
and I think, worth discussing, and probably, could stand a paragraph
or so on them. I personally still think that the POV issues are complicated enough, (and that I am operating from enough of a bias)
That its wiser to talk about it first and let the group edit later, 
than to jump in and go editing, creating possibly more stress for the
group actually over the long run.

==Use of the term==

Psychonaut is a modern term, used to describe one who uses
[[Trance Technologies]], and sometimes, more specifically, mind-altering substances more with a view to their ability to act as entheogens, than for their inebriating (or social) effect. In effect, they are used as a means to achieve states of mind in which different perceptions unhindered by everyday mental filters and processes, can arise.

As such, their effects, used with this intent, can be life altering, and are not considered by their proponents to be mere hallucinations. An alternate description is that while some aspects of the experience may be hallucinatory, the realizations caused by those hallucinations, and the mental, emotional and long term impact of the experience, is real, usually positive, and enduring. 

==Shamanic Perspective of Hallucination==

The Shamanic Perspective of Hallucination is that there is no
such thing as something which is &quot;not real.&quot; Shamans choose to see
Visions, Hallucinations, and so forth as real communication from
other parts of the psyche, which are normally veiled from the conscious mind by brain hemisphere filters. (Without these filters,
the internal dialogue process would overwhelm the conscious mind,
as is possibly the case with [[Autism]] )

Shamans generate assorted cosmologies which include the Psychic realms, and thus from their perspective, a Hallucination is a real
event that happens on a different level of reality.


== PsychoNautica ==

==[[Brain Anatomy]]==
The most important Paradigm to the Serious PsychoNaut is Brain
Anatomy. PsychoNautics is the attempt to generate a Users manual
for the human Brain. Unlike its near cousin, [[psychology]]
which is concerned with understanding other people, PsychoNauts
are more concerned with understanding themselves, and the process
of self exploration.

==Hemispheres of Brain==

There are Several different areas of the Brain, Which are Known by Science to carry out specific functions. Science knows about this
mostly due to [[Electroencephalography]]And experiments where Brain
waves are monitored while a subject is given different kinds of problems to solve or subjected to different kinds of stimulus. 
( or, under the effect of a psychoactive substance.)

The Main Areas of the Brain are;
*1. The [[Brain Stem]]
*2. The [[Reptilian Brain]] [[Cerebellum]]

*3. The [[limbic system]]
*4. The [[Mammalian Brain]] [[extrastriate cortex]] 
*5. The [[Neo-Cortex]] [[Neopallium]] [[Frontal lobe]]

*6. The [[Occipital Lobe]]s
*7. The [[Left Hemisphere Lobes]]
*8. The [[Right Hemisphere Lobes]]
*9. The [[Parietal lobe]]

[[Brodmann_area]]

==Process Typing Functions==
The Brain deals with different kinds of tasks by devoting
small sections of itself to deal with those types of tasks.

There are thus different types of internal dialogue operating in different places in he mind. Verbal Linguistic Information is confined mostly to the Neo-Cortex and a smaller region called [[Wernickes area]]. Mathematical and Logical Types of operations seem
to be carried out predominantly in the left or right hemisphere, depending on whether the person is left or right &quot;handed&quot;.
Movement is mostly handled by the Reptilian Brain and the Brain Stem. (etc)

== Brainwaves==
By using an Electroencephalograph, Scientists can measure the Electrical outputs of the Brain. There are four main different
kinds of waves that they have found, and each corresponds roughly
to a different state of consciousness.

*a [[Beta wave ]] [[Brain]] [[Waves]] [[Brain Waves]]

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Brain+waves+Beta&amp;spell=1

*b [[Alpha wave]] [[Alpha Brain waves]]

*d [[Theta wave]] [[Theta Brain waves]]

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Brain+waves+Theta&amp;btnG=Search

== [[The Tree of Life]]==
Is A [[Qaballah]] or [[Esoteric]] [[Judaism]]
Reality model which describes essentially a bell curve, 
and potentials for [[phase]] alignment. The Tree can be used as a map
to place over the entire body, as a map to place over the Torso, or as a map of states of consciousness assuming state definitions for
the Neo-Cortex.

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Tree+of+Life+Qaballah&amp;btnG=Search

== [[Totemic]] [[Mythic]] [[Architecture]][[T.M.A.]]==
PsychoNauts attempt to understand Hallucinations as communication
from the psyche. To do this requires an elevated understanding
of subliminal symbolism, particularly the Imagerial/Dreamspeak code
of the Mammalian Brain and Occipital Lobes. 

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Totemism&amp;btnG=Search

== [[Dream Journals]]==
A very important tool for the Psychonaut, A dream Journal
acts as the starting point for the PsychoNaut to create a personal
encyclopedia of their own symbolic internal dialogue.

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Dream+Journal&amp;btnG=Search

==[[Lucid Dreaming]]==

Some might say that Entheogens are EASY, If you want something HARD
Try Lucid Dreaming. The Results are the same, but one has a very
different cost.

To a Psychonaut, Lucid Dreaming is a prequel to Psycho actives,
setting a stage for them to learn self/ trip control. A person who
is control of their dreams can similarly learn to control their
Hallucinations. 


== [[Sleep Deprivation]]==

Another very important tool of the PsychoNaut, Again, Entheogens
are EASY, if you want something HARD with the same results, Try
staying awake for 1 week. Sleep Deprivation teaches a Psychonaut
control over their own State of consciousness. When we sleep, we
go through the four brainwave patterns. Delta condition is deep rest,
and Theta Condition is Physiological upkeep, and healing.
Most people never experience a waking condition other than a Beta state. This is unfortunate, because Alpha, Delta, And Theta States
are difficult to be in while still awake, but if you can manage it,
you can use the mind in remarkable ways most people can't.

== [[Sensory Deprivation]]==

A very important Tool, especially for use with low Power Entheogens.
For some people, Total Darkness in a cave is more than enough to Alter their state of consciousness. Alpha condition is to some degree
a physiological response to darkness.

[[Trance Technologies]]

Come from any Religion, Any Culture, Many different Sciences, and Multiple perspectives. However, in the modern era, most people can't
escape the waking Beta condition except by sleep. This tells us that
Trance Technologies have not been transmitted to the general population. [[Herd Mentality]] [[Groupthink]] [[Propaganda]]
[[Politics]] [[Religion]]

== [[Instinct, Memory, Symbol]]==

Three areas of the brain have an interesting relationship with
each other. The Reptilian Brain stores instinct, which is very similar to [[Maslows' Hierarchy of Needs]] The instinct drives us to
act, which creates Memories in different regions of the Brain, but mostly in the Mammalian Brain. Symbols then form a Top Bar over that
up/down line, forming a figure T. The Neo-Cortex processes most verbal
Linguistic information, but the occipital Lobes process images. These
aspects of self end up relating within the Psyche, and PsychoNautics
primary concern is to increase the efficiency of that internal dialogue.

== [[motion, communication, fore thinker, planner]]==

Motion is primarily handled by the Brain Stem and the Reptilian
Brain, Communication is handled by the Neo-Cortex and the Mammalian
Brain, thinking ahead is handled in several places, but mostly in the neo-cortical region and in the [[Temporal Lobes]] this again
creates a set of relationships between areas of the brain.

==[[Egotism]]==

From the PsychoNauts perspective, the greatest sin of Egotism
is that over identification with the Ego mind eclipses other regions
of the brain.

==[[Ethnocentrism]]==
is the field function of Egotism; The Egoic principle projected into
ones group, culture, or society. Ethnocentrism is the logical fallacy, and rationale, behind [[Fascism]] and [[Totalitarianism]]
PsychoNauts are particularly interested in this because the [[Schema]] we have from any one [[paradigm]] are too weak standing
alone to make PsychoNautics possible. It is only by combining many
different points of view, and integrating many different perspectives
that one can become a successful PsychoNaut.

==[[Pack Psychology]]== 
Is important to PsychoNautics because [[Groupthink]] has a knee-jerk
reaction against [[Eclectic]] thinking, And PsychoNauts are thus forced in many situations to defend themselves from attack.

==[[Cogency]]==
Is important not only for defending what we do as PsychoNauts, but for creating a lucid handling of ones own personal paradigms. Think
of it this way; You get what you put into the software you probably didn't realize you wrote for your brain.
 
==[[Ethics]]==
PsychoNautics is very concerned with a variety of Ethical issues,
because the way that the Psyche ends up working, It is difficult or impossible to obtain waking Trance States until the issues of the Shadow are resolved. In this sense, PsychoNauts build the ultimate
Ethical system for themselves, and it might even be said that the defining characteristic of a Psychonaut is instead that they are
solving the [[Shadow]] of the [[Collective unconscious]] internally.

==[[Lucid Visualization]]==

AT high levels of Alpha State Performance, The mind is capable of generating better movies than Hollywood ever will,  (At a fraction
of the cost.) [[Simulation]] modeling and assorted Engineering feats
become possible as a person learns to use the &quot;Dreaming&quot; Facility while awake, and with the Neo-Cortex in control, instead of the Reptilian Brain or Limbic System.

PsychoNautics is concerned with Shadow Psychology because it is
difficult if not impossible to obtain waking Trance States if the
standard conflicts between areas of the mind have not been resolved.

==[[Psychonaut? Enter the Matrix]]
[[Enter the Matrix]]

PsychoNautics is a very Point of View charged field because it combines all of the most sensitive aspects of both Religion and Politics, and (in some people’s opinions) has better answers to life’s assorted questions than either or both. PsychoNautics is considered by some to be a [[Cult]] in competition with [[Religion]]. While this is true in some senses, the reverse is true in that any member of any Paradigm group can be A PsychoNaut; the term is actually inherently non-denominational. PsychoNautics is also considered by some to be [[Left]] [[Leftist]] [[Liberal]] And while this may be true of Some PsychoNauts, it is not True Of PsychoNauts or PsychoNautics, Because PsychoNautics is actually outside of the
Left-Right [[False Dilemma]] / [[False Duality]].

PsychoNautics actually delivers what most Paradigms only promise;
Real self help, evolutionary process, and personal Therapy.
For this reason, PsychoNautics is a field which many in the establishment would like to Silence.

==[[Sociology]]==

Sociology is the study of Human Behavior on the larger Social Scale.
PsychoNauts are interested in Sociology mostly because in order to make sense of the Psyche, one has to first make sense of ones biases,
and assorted social and cultural influences.

==[[Entheogenic Protocols]]==

The Rituals and practices used by real World Shamans, or, those
Rituals and Practices designed as Near Equivalents.




Opponents of the use of these substances tend to ignore their religious and spiritual use, and consider such claims as unsubstantiated fabrication, or mere justification of an inebriated and potentially dangerous state, and/or substance abuse.

==PsychoNautica==

The frequency of use and type of use is highly individual. Some PsychoNauts are also [[neoshaman]]s. Eventually, the individual often gains a sense or feeling of control over the entheogen they are taking.

Because their motive is primarily for personal growth by means of wider scope of mental perception, rather than social and leisure use, psychonauts usually resist over-use and respect the substances they take.  Many psychoactive substances used as entheogens are not physically addictive (but may be psychologically addictive if over-used), and unlike [[crack]] or other [[Drug of abuse|drug]]s, there is not normally any spiral of dependency and/or harm involved. Personal reports on websites suggest psychonauts might typically use such substances between once every few weeks, to once or twice a year.

== Naming conventions ==

I notice that this WikiBook has been cited as being possibly in violation of the Wikibooks Naming policy. The standard conventional
Term which covers this general batch of topics, and with the same basic stated intention, is PsychoNautics. My advice is that the book
be renamed as such.

==The need of yet another book on this subject==

All books on this subject I have come across have either one or both of the following disadvantages. Firstly, many books are filled with advertisements for useless products, workshops and so on. They are designed for personal development junkies who only want to feel the joy of reading books, listen to tapes and buy devices which ''could have'' helped them if only they were willing to work hard. The second disadvantage is that most books are thin on information—what could be explained in a couple of pages of text is explained in hundreds of pages. This book will be different. The information in the book is dense and only intended to inspire the reader's ''own'' thinking and experimentation.

I suppose the author's desire for yet 'another book on this subject' is more a result of the need to define his topic than a dearth of information.  A serious attempt at this endeavor would be better served by one with a little more education on the subject.  An introduction of this topic more than most others, would benefit from defining your goal and organizing an approach. As with any discussion of intelligence, definitions, frames of reference, processes, development (natural or guided), the relationships between original, developed, derived, summarized, or compiled knowledges, cultural variation, and scales of valuing would be some primary considerations for interactive descriptions.  Many references exist for each of these subtopics, and one anticipated problem will be debates on defining intelligence first, then (and possibly unnecessarily) discussion on measuring.  Post-graduate (as fair a starting point as another) studies of assessment deal with the evolution of the qualitative/quantitative measuring of intelligence (and primarily within educational or legal/social contexts). All of this would be logical to establish a platform from which one explores methods of intensification or development of intelligence.--[[User:Jeffyorns|Jeffyorns]] ([[User talk:Jeffyorns|talk]]) 17:24, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

I envision two directions for an introduction, one evolutionary and the other categorical, with a strong allowances for aristotlean vs. oriental processes of perceptualization/development of understanding.  --[[User:Jeffyorns|Jeffyorns]] ([[User talk:Jeffyorns|talk]]) 17:24, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

==Cut the Crap==

In keeping with the aim described in the preceding paragraph, this book will not contain affirmations that these techniques will work ''even for you'' and so on. No unscientific testimonials will be included. In a world with a lot of information it is of utmost importance that the information is compact, concise and to the point.

# Read table of contents of books FIRST to see if it mentions whatever topic you are looking for.  If it doesn't, you don't need to read it.  If it does, great!   
# Bibliographies, or sources cited at the end of white papers give you clues to other places you can direct your search.

==Spread the Word==

The title ''Intelligence Intensification'' establishes that the goal of this text is to intensify intelligent thought in the reader. Perhaps more importantly, the book aims at the greater goal of increasing intelligence all over the world&amp;mdash;for joy and for the benefit of all humanity. This book is inspired by [[w:Timothy Leary|Timothy Leary's]] 20th ­Century concept: &quot;Every citizen a Scientist&quot;.

==What's your vision?==

The following is a quotation from the book ''The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn'' by [[w:Richard Hamming|Richard Hamming]]. He models a life with or without a vision with [[w:Random walk|random walks]].

:&quot;It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; independent random steps will, on the average, end about &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, while no vision will get you only the distance &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.&quot;

Before or while reading this book and practicing its contents, try to grow a vision of your life.

==Visualization==

Have you ever seen or heard of a person with a super memory? Did he remember all the cards in a deck in perfect order? Maybe he claimed that he had a photographic memory. That, however, is probably not the case. Rather, he or she used simple techniques which you can master too, with little practice (say, 100 hours). After half an hour of practice, you will see fantastic results. The memorizing time is directly related to the number of things to memorize. If you need five minutes in order to remember ten foreign words, you'll need ten minutes in order to remember twenty.

It should be stressed that you will not get a photographic memory. You will be able to remember faces, foreign words, telephone numbers and much more. But you will not be able to look at a picture and then immediately remember every detail in your inner vision. Search the web for books on memory improvement and you will find lots of books claiming that they will give you a photographic memory. This is generally a lie. The systems you will learn on this page, however, are extremely practical and simple to use. And best of all, they work! 

The basic theory is that your brain associates everything you learn with what it already knows. Using the memory techniques to follow, you consciously make those associations (in addition to the ones made unconsciously).  The other cornerstone  used in the techniques is that the brain remembers strange things better than mundane things. This is the absolute essence of memory techniques. Lets see what comes out of it!

==Remembering a list of items==
The two basic methods used for remembering a list are linking and pegwords
===Linking===
After visualizing the first item on your list, visualize it associated with the next item, then visualize that item associated with the third, and so on.  For example, to remember a list like &quot;apple, fish, lady, star, stop sign, pencil ...&quot; imagine an apple. Now you shall link this apple with a fish by visualizing (for instance) an apple tree with fishes instead of apples-you could even imagine a fish falling on Newton's head or Eve handing Adam a fish. Remember that it should be weird. Next link the fish with lady by visualizing a mermaid.  Next item: Visualize a night sky with shining ladies in the sky instead of stars. Link to stop sign by visualizing a falling star landing on the ground-only instead of a star, when you get up close it's a stop sign, link &quot;stop sign&quot; with &quot;pencil&quot; by imagining a stop sign which is held up not by a metal post, but by a giant pencil.

===Pegwords===
Pegwords are used if remembering the position of each item is helpful; for example, if you would like to be able to recall the fifth U.S. president.  In this system, a list of pegwords is pre-memorized. The pegwords are designed to be easy to visualize, and to associate with a number. For example memorize this list of pegwords. Try to form a mental image of each one.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 | 1||       gun||associate your first item with a gun
 |-
 | 2||      zoo||form a mental image of a zoo
 |-
 | 3||      tree||Associate 3rd item with a tree
 |-
 | 4||      door||
 |-
 | 5||      hive||Associate with bees
 |-
 | 6||    bricks||
 |-
 | 7||    heaven||
 |-
 | 8||     plate||
 |-
 | 9||      wine||
 |-
 |10||       hen||
 |-
 |}
And then to remember any list of 10 items you associate the items to be remembered with their pegs.
To memorize the grocery list: apples, butter, razor blades, soap, bread, milk, cat food, bacon, batteries, and orange juice, 
#you visualize the first item (an apple) being fired from a cannon,
#Link the second item (butter) with zoo by imagining a gorilla stomping up and down on a stick of butter,
#Link third item (razor blades) with tree  by imagining a tree with razor blades for leaves, 
#a door made of soap
# a swarm of bees flying from a loaf of bread as if it is a hive
# a building which uses milk jugs in place of bricks
#an open can of cat food with angel wings and a halo (imagine its smell)
# bacon on a plate
#a wine glass filled with batteries
# a hen being squeezed and orange juice coming out.

Sound obscure? Close your eyes and try to remember the list.
===Writing The List Down===
Sometimes, writing down something you wish to remember may help to increase your retention. If you have the time and resources available, you may write down the entire list, maybe a few times, and be able to remember most, if not all of the items. You may also use this to remember paragraphs of text as needed.
===Method of Loci===
The [[w:Method of loci|Method of loci]] was used by the ancient Greeks for oration; that is, for memorizing speeches. It involves mentally transversing a familiar place, for them, a temple, stopping at certain points, and associating those points with sections of a speech.

==[[/Memorizing Numbers and Digits/]]==
A system known as the mnemonic major system used to convert numbers into words. See module for details.

==Techniques Which Combine Pegwords With the Number System==
&lt;!--- This section has yet to be written. For the moment its outline is a stub. The subsections will likely get their own modules once they are written---&gt;
===[[/A Longer Peglist/]]===
While rhyming peglists are simple to learn they are severely limited in the number of pegs that can be created. 7  rhymes with 11, 21 rhymes with 31 rhymes with 41, etc. Using the major system, rather than rhymes, you can create as many pegs as you want with no ambiguity. This module currently has 116 pegs- enough to accommodate the periodic table.

===[[/Memorizing Playing Cards/]]===
This module combines the major system with the pegword systems to do some pretty amazing things with cards. It does require a lot of practice, and requires you to be adept at both systems, but you will be surprised with what you can accomplish.

===[[/The Periodic Table/]]===
An example of just how powerful this system can be. Pegs for the atomic numbers linked to a pun on the element names or their symbols linked to a phrase describing the atomic mass. This module has yet to be written. You can help.

==Remembering foreign words==
In order to remember a foreign word, or a native word you don't know, all you need to do is to make it concrete in your native language, and then link it with its meaning (which maybe has to be made concrete too). To remember the French word for horse, cheval, make it concrete in english by thinking of the word chew (which is a concrete verb). Then link a horse with chew. Maybe you vividly visualize that you are watching a big, big horse chew some trees from the comfort of your hammock. Then he picks up the trees your hammock is swinging between. Your blood splashes in your face as your bones crunch and you are racked with pain. You curse the horse for chewing you up. So when you think of horse, you immediately think chew, which reminds you of cheval. 

In order to remember the Swedish word for luck, tur, you also need to make the native word luck concrete. One easy way is to think of winning a lottery. But emphasize the middle syllable of &quot;lottery&quot;: lot-TUR-ry. Think about how much TUR you need to win the lot-TUR-ry.


==Remembering faces, art works etc==

This is easy if you know any of the other techniques. To connect a face with a name, pick out something in the face and link whatever you picked out with the name. If you meet a girl whose face is shaped like a heart, link a heart with her name. So if her name is Angela, you can imagine an angel descending from heaven, who violently rips out her heart. Imagine her screaming, the blood spraying everywhere, and her squishy heart still beating while falling down to the muddy earth. If you meet somebody with a funny nose, it's easy. If you don't find anything special (but isn't everyone special in some way?) just pick something. What do the lips look like? The ears? The total impression? 

The technique to remember the author of a painting is analogous. Only by ''trying'' to find something special you are forced to really look, which helps remembering.

==How to remember whatever you want==
Combine the above and below techniques, use them as a basis to construct your own personal techniques and remember the essence: Use weird, vivid visualizations; use all your senses (taste, smell, etc); associate what you want to remember with as much as possible.  See Wikipedia's [[w:List_of_mnemonics|list of mnemonics]].

==Drugs and Vitamins==
Some diet supplements, vitamins, herbs and amino acids may also improve your memory and alertness, though very few if any have been scientifically studied for effects on memory. These include the B vitamins, caffeine, amino acids like phenylalanine, (though an overdose can be deadly) melatonin, ginseng, ginkgo biloba, and many others. 

There are also a number of prescription-strength drugs which might be legal, but may have side-effects although current studies show some of them to be safe to use. Some of these alleged &quot;smart drugs&quot; include Vasopressin, Hydergine, and Piracetam, and DHEA.

You should consult your physician before taking any drug or supplement, especially if you are taking any other medications.  Current research suggests the best ways to keep your memory healthy as you age are to use it frequently (read non-fiction, engage in political conversation, etc.), eat a well-balanced diet, take antioxidant supplements (though overdoses of selenium and vitamins A and E could be fatal), and possibly increase the proportion of omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.

Hi there, I saw you are into programming and even python, so I wondered if you would be interested in a [http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444e1w/vokeng.htm learning project] I have started. It is described and discussed at [[:en:user:Get-back-world-respect|my site in wikipedia]]. Maybe you could let me know there what you think about it? [[User:Get-back-world-respect|Get-back-world-respect]] 11:05, 24 May 2004 (UTC)

:I'm not sure this is the proper way to answer a message but what can I do. Well, I don't believe I can contribute to your learning project. First, it's written in qbasic, a language I don't know and don't want to know. And secondly, it seems to me to only be accessible in the Microsoft Windows environment which is not my area of specialization. If I were you I would rewrite the program using Java and release one stand-alone version and one as an Java applet for online use. Furthermore I don't see why you need me at all.

:I do believe in the basic method of learning a language by studying sentences though.

==Speculative History of the West==

For thousands of years there was little change toward better conditions for human beings. The changes in the ability to treat diseases was minor. Technology improvement was slow. And then, suddenly, things started to change rapidly. 

Initially, people didn't expect change to happen.   As a self-fullfilling prophecy, nothing happened. On many levels change was not tolerated.
Then, new inventions became common, change happened everywhere and people started to expect change to happen.

And what was expected, happened. And it happened even more dramatically than anyone expected. Today, new knowledge accumulates and the ability to apply it is acquired faster than ever.  The Age of Networking is born.

Also, during the centuries, old systems have been replaced by newer more efficient systems. A new government replace the old with each new revolution. After a while, the new system is old and it's time for a new replacement.

==On a Smaller Scale==

On a smaller scale, this can happen in an individual too. Use the power of self-fullfilling prophecies. Love change and don't be afraid of changing. Everytime we learn something, we change. If you are afraid of changing it will make learning harder.

Moreover, each remodeling of the solution to a problem tends to make the solution better. Everyone who has done some computer programming knows that a program solution tends to be better if it is remade from scratch instead of applying ad hoc patches.

Use this phenomena to your advantage. Throw all your habits out of the window every now and then. Start from scratch, use your new and increased knowledge to create better habits.

Our nervous system recieves a large amount of impressions each second. From this chaos it selects a pattern which we perceive as reality. Thus our perception of reality is colored by how we recognize patterns. We see the patterns we know. Example: Think of red. Look around right where you are sitting now. Your brains extract everything that is red. But what smells were around? How many green items did you see? The brains works in the same fashion when it comes to ideas, views and opinions. Thus, if you try to build on your old knowledge new information will be filtered according to your old information. A better idea might be to try to start from scratch, as described above.

==Coulomb's law==
Dielectric constant, definition of charge

Electricity

:&lt;math&gt;F = {kq_{1}q_{2} \over r_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The force resulting from two nearby charges is equal to k times charge one times charge two divided by the square of the distance between the charges.

:&lt;math&gt;E = {F \over q}&lt;/math&gt;

The electric field created by a charge is equal to the force generated divided by the charge.

:&lt;math&gt;E = {kq \over r_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Electric field is equal to a constant, “k”, times the charge divided by the square of the distance between the charge and the point in question.
:&lt;math&gt;U = {(kq_{1}q_{2}) \over r}&lt;/math&gt;

Electric potential energy is equal to a constant, “k” multiplied by the two charges and divided by the distance between the charges.

Variables

F: Force (N)
k: a constant, 99 (N•m2/C2)
q1: charge one (C)
q2: charge two (C)
r: distance between the two charges, (m)

A charge in an electrical field feels a force. The charge is not a vector, but force is a vector, and so is the electric field. If a charge is positive, then force and the electric field point in the same direction. If the charge is negative, then the electric field and force vectors point in opposite directions.

A point charge in space causes an electric field. The field is stronger closer to the point and weaker farther away.

=== Introduction to the Insects ===

In terms of number of species described, the '''Subphylum Hexapoda''' is the largest in the Phylum Arthropoda.  Hexapods (meaning &quot;six legs or feet&quot;) include the insects ('''Class Insecta'''), which dominate terrestrial environments on earth. The subphylum also includes several groups of wingless arthropods of uncertain placement; namely the orders: Diplura, Collembola, and Protura.

===Ideal Filters===
(Discussion of how ideal filters provide the signal until the break frequency/cies and then provide total attenuation.  That is they look like a &lt;math&gt;u(\omega )- uu(\omega - \omega _{c}) &lt;/math&gt; for low pass filter, where u(w) is the unit step function or Heaviside function.  That is they have infinite drop off at the cutoff frequency.  How this is not possible.  Pretty diagrams of all the filters Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Band Stop.)

&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left&quot;/&gt;

This section introduces first order butterworth low pass and high pass filters.  An understanding of Laplace Transforms or at least Laplace Transforms of capacitors, inductors and resistors.

===Low Pass===

[[Image:1st Order Lowpass Filter RC.svg|center|thumb|200px|Figure 1: A basic RC circuit.]]

Transforming the Resistor and Capacitor to the Laplace domain we get:
:R and &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{Cs}&lt;/math&gt;.
Expressing &lt;math&gt;V_{out}(s)&lt;/math&gt; using terms of &lt;math&gt;V_{in}(s)&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{out}(s)=\frac {V_{in}(s)\frac {1}{Cs}}{R+\frac {1}{Cs}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_{out}(s)=\frac {V_{in}(s)}{RCs+1}&lt;/math&gt;
The transfer function is
:&lt;math&gt;H(s)=\frac {V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
So 
:&lt;math&gt;H(s)=\frac {1}{RCs+1}&lt;/math&gt;
For the Frequency Domain we put &lt;math&gt;s=j\omega &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H( \omega )=\frac {1}{jRC \omega + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
The magnitude is
:&lt;math&gt; | H( \omega ) |=\frac {1}{\sqrt {R^2C^2 \omega ^2 + 1}}&lt;/math&gt;
and the angle is
:&lt;math&gt; &lt;H( \omega )=-arctan(RC\omega)\,&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; increases &lt;math&gt; |H(j \omega )|&lt;/math&gt; decreases so this circuit must represent low pass filter.

Using the -3 dB definition of band width.  &lt;math&gt; |H(j \omega )|= \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}=\frac {1}{\sqrt {R^2C^2 \omega ^2 + 1}}&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;2=R^2C^2 \omega ^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega =\frac {1}{RC}&lt;/math&gt;

Which gives the general form of a low pass butterworth filter as:
:&lt;math&gt; | H( \omega ) |=\frac {1}{\sqrt {1+ (\frac {\omega }{\omega _c})^{2k}}}&lt;/math&gt;
, where k is the order of the filter and &lt;math&gt;\omega _c &lt;/math&gt; is the cut-off frequency.

===High Pass===

:(Image of a first order RL high pass filter)

If all the component of the circuit are transformed into the Laplace Domain.  The resistor becomes &lt;math&gt;R &lt;/math&gt; and the inductor becomes &lt;math&gt;Ls &lt;/math&gt;.  Using voltage divider rule &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt; below is reached.

:&lt;math&gt;H(s)=\frac {\frac {Rs}{L}}{1+\frac {Rs}{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt; is transformed into the frequency domain by putting &lt;math&gt;s=j \omega&lt;/math&gt;.  
:&lt;math&gt;H(\omega)=\frac {\frac {j \omega R}{L}}{1+\frac {j \omega R}{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which has a magnitude of
:&lt;math&gt;| H(\omega) |=\frac {\sqrt {\frac { \omega ^2R^2}{L^2}}}{\sqrt {1+\frac { \omega R^2}{L^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and an angle of
:&lt;math&gt;&lt; H(\omega)=90 - \arctan ({\frac {\omega R}{L}})&lt;/math&gt;

:(cut-off frequency is w (R/L)^0.5)

Intro to design of radio receivers/transmitters, including much maths


'''I. Introduction to Electromagnetics / Transmission Line Theory'''

Previous sections have presented an overview of DC and AC circuit principles. The circuits we have looked at until now all have one thing in common: they are ''electrically small'' compared to the ''wavelength'' of the voltages and currents induced on them. In other words, the ''physical'' size of the circuit is much smaller than the length of the voltage or current wave. Many other circuits, however, have physical dimensions the same as or larger than the wavelengths of their voltages and currents. In order to understand their operation, it is necessary to introduce the principles of ''electromagnetic'' theory.

All alternating voltages and currents move through space the form of waves. This is a fundamental principle of physics discovered in the 19th century and elaborated by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, among others. Like a wave in water, an electromagnetic wave contains &quot;crests&quot; and &quot;troughs&quot;. ''Wavelength'' is the distance from one crest to the next. In the electrical case, a crest is a point in space where the alternating voltage or current value is at maximum, and a trough is a point where the value is at minimum. 

In the case of a DC current or voltage, the value is the same everywhere, so the wavelength is infinite. Alternating voltages and currents have finite wavelengths. The pattern the values take in space is that of a ''sine wave''. If voltages and currents are measured at locations along the path of an electromagnetic wave, they will fit the curve of a sine wave. 

''Frequency'' in electromagnetics is the number of crests passing a particular point in space per unit of time, as the wave moves. It is the ''inverse'' (one over) wavelength. 


What has been discussed so far is a ''subset'' of ''electromagnetic'' theory.

The techniques described here are not very useful for a musician or a painter (or they are, but not directly). The goal is to get new ideas and break old thinking habits. The essence of the theory is as follows: Usually your mind is in a rut. In order to move your thinking wagons out of the rut, you provoke it. You will find it to be very simple and it will work immediately. With practice, it will work even better! 

(Here it would be nice with a picture with thinking wagons stuck in a rut. Can you draw one?) 

Sometimes the brains seems to be slow, lacking energy and wit. Maybe you have to finish an article before you go to bed. Ideas don't flow easily. To get the brains into full swing so thinking goes with a bang, you might try the following exercise: 

Point at an object in your surroundings and call it by another name. Point at a lamp, and say snake! Point at a floppy disk, say spoon! A book -- dance! Table -- Swimming! Etc. Try to increase the speed until you cries out weird words immediately when you point at something. 

I will not say how it feels afterwards. Do it and you will know! You might observe that it is easy to slip into patterns, like &quot;Cow! Milk! Breakfast! ...&quot;. Practice a little bit more to get rid of these patterns. 

Now I will give you two good techniques to get new ideas. I think it's all you need. There are thick books about this, and you may read them if you think it is interesting. But if you are intelligent, understanding the essence is all you need (everywhere, always, in every theory. Am I overenthusiastic?) 

The first one is to simply have something to think of. Instead of looking at the whole problem at once (if you have a problem), look at a tiny detail. If you walk down the street, force yourself to only look at -- for instance -- a lamppost or maybe even only at the hold or the very lamp. Then think, how could this be done better? Compare this to looking at the whole street at once, thinking &quot;Can anything be done better here?&quot;. Make this a habit if you wish to be the guy or girl who always have new and funny ideas. It is like a burning glass which produces a warmer spot if the spot is smaller. So have a small focus point!

The second thing, which you can combine with the above idea to get good results is to have a thought in mind, a thought you want to develope. Then provoke your brain with a random word, like &quot;pancake batter!&quot; or &quot;machete!&quot;. Then let this word bring new ideas. Often all you need is to be provoked. The very provocation, the weird word, is only needed to bring the thinking out of the rut. 

Here is an example: In my hands I've got a CD case. I want to make it better. As a focus point, I choose the hold. I need a provocation word. FROG! Frog? They are slimy... Gluing the disk is not a good idea... But one could hold the disk with suction cups! There is actually free space on the plastic of a CD where no data is written, so leaving suction marks doesn't matter. 

Maybe this is a very stupid example, but this is how it works even when you're thinking of not so stupid things. Remember the essence! You must provoke your brains. People who haven't provoked their brains in years get dull and robotic. People who provoke their brains often get creative and non-robotic.

Additional Techniques for Provoking Creativity and Intelligence

Random associations.  The point  of this exercise is to be able to state how a ___________ is like a ________________.  Use whatever method you choose to fill in the blanks and state how the two are alike.  

For example, suppose you want to make a game of this with a child.  Place assorted objects into a bag.  Gather the objects from various places, so that they are not all related by location, toy figures count as well.  Then have the child, without looking and, doing so quickly as not to select by feel, pull out two objects.  Then have the child describe how the two objects, say a bottle opener and a (toy) giraffe are alike.

Additional ways of filling in the blank might be to randomly select words from a dictionary of telephone yellow pages, select images from advertisements or commercials (it takes some of the mindlessness out of television watching), with multiple people have each select a word individually secretly (nouns work best) then fill in the blank with the two word and see who can come up with the most connections.

No-name naming.  Describe a scene, or the room that you are in without using nouns, except for the names of geometric shapes.  Use only adjectives and verbs.  Try describing a specific picture from a group of pictures that are not too dissimilar with enough detail that another person can pick out the one you are describing.

Smallest differences.  From a group of 4-6 similar objects, such as lemons, oranges, eggs, unsharpened pencils, choose one specimen.  Spend 5-10 minutes getting to know your specimen.  Then return it to the group and mix them up.  Test yourself to see if you can differentiate yours from the rest. (This is a useful skill when doing magic tricks with cards.  If you can discern small differnces, every deck of cards becomes a marked deck with use.)

Observation. This is the most basic skill of all, and the one others are based upon, the ability to observe. Where ever you are, take time to observe and verbalize (even if only internally) what it is you observe.  Start with one sensory channel, such as visual, then proceed to auditory, then kinesthetic, and olfactory.

Looking at things upside-down.  Or sideways.   Turn your head so that you look at things upside down.  Think about what would happen if suddenly gravity changed directions.   Or imagine the building you are in suddenly turned over on its side and imagine how you would climb out.     

Sudden difference.   Look at something and imagine what it would be like if a particular detail about it changed to its opposite.  For instance, what if CDs were suddenly square?   

Different use.   Think of alternate ways to use things than for the original purpose for which they were intended.   For example, children often consider their parent's bed a trampoline instead of a bed.   Kitchen sink could be used as a mixing bowl.   For that matter, mixing bowls could be made into sinks!   CDs could be used as frizbees.. or light catchers... or christmas tree ornaments.   I've heard of people using doors as desk surfaces.   (This kind of exercise is particularly helpful for conserving money in times of unemployment.)

'''Supplement:'''

Creativity is simply making new intellectual connections. Everyone has some potential to be more creative than they are now; it just takes a willingness to allow their minds to wander in an unforeseen direction. When an unusual thought enters many people's heads, they dismiss it as silly or pointless. They may be right, but that's beside the point. By judging these spurs of creativity before the mind is given a chance to follow them to their conclusion, they are closing themselves from creative thoughts that may be relevant, useful, or entertaining at the very least.

Next time you get an odd idea, run with it. If you see a man walking his dog in the park and you begin to wonder how things would be if the dog were instead walking the man, follow that thought and see where it takes you. It may sound silly, but sharpening your creative process for these simple observations will sharpen your ability to come up with original solutions to things more relevant to your life too.

Be creative! You have nothing to lose and only a sense of humor, a newfound ability to express yourself, and an ability to solve problems better to gain.

==The Theoretician==

In periods I'm a striking theoretician. I think about a lot of interesting things and new ideas pops up in my mind all the time. But nothing gets done. That's the problem of the theoretician. Knowing that one is a typical theoretician, one has better chances to counteract. 

The typical situation is that one buys a book or reads a text about something interesting. Instead of putting everything into practice one contents oneself with reading the exercises (if there are any) and thinking about the content. One may actually feel that one really learnt something and that the reading gave lots of insights. Imagine how many insights you would get if you tried everything you read about in physical reality (whatever that is). 

Another problem associated with books is that authors often wants to write hundreds of pages about a theory which very well could be explained in ten pages. In general, all an intelligent reader needs is the essence of a theory. Everything else is evident when the essence is understood. In fact, many books explains so many unnecessary details that the essence is never understood. That is the problem of the theoretician. He spends time reading about details which soon becomes obvious for anyone who put the ideas to use. Whenever you, the reader, feels a section in this book doesn't break down to the essence of the subject, please use the possiblity to discuss a page in order to make the active contributors of this book aware of the problem.

==The Virtue of Discipline==

The only way to solve the problem of putting things into practice that I can think of is discipline. Maintaining discipline is crucial when one must overcome the psychological barrier that so often appears when one wants to learn something or do something creative. Discipline can be practiced in various ways, the reader can probably invent his own methods. You are your best teacher. That is why you should only read this book to inspire your own thinking and practice.

==Why Boring Repetition?==

''If you want to'' '''minimize''' studying time, repetition is important. If you repeat, you tell your brain this is important, remember this.

==Optimizing Repetition==

''Repetition should be made'' at certain intervals of time. Of course it's best if you experiment and find your own optimal intervals but a general guideline is as follows: After one hour of study wait ten minutes. During these ten minutes your brain will organize the new information. Then you should briefly repeat the information during about five minutes. The next repetition should be after about an hour, also about five minutes long. Then repeat again after one day, as much as you feel needed. Try again after a week and then after a month. Hopefully the information is in your long-term memory by then. 

Note that these are only general guidelines which may very well vary due to the nature of the material you study, your studying technique, etc. Experiment! 

==Aiding Software==

There already exist several software programs that optimise the repetition cycle.

[http://www.supermemo.com SuperMemo]&lt;sup&gt;(proprietary)&lt;/sup&gt; uses a repetition algorithm, which is based on neural research. Free programs with a similar algorithm include such programs as [http://ankisrs.net/ Anki] or [http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/ Mnemosyne].

The best combination between using a structured approach and  optimal repetition intervals  is realised with [http://www.recallplus.com RecallPlus]&lt;sup&gt;(proprietary)&lt;/sup&gt;. RecallPlus uses concept maps for structuring the learing material and then uses repetition cycles, associated with the links between topics.

===Classical Speed Reading===

If you have never thought about how you can increase your reading speed, you will find these tips very interesting. You can probably read at much higher rates without losing understanding. Your brain is faster than your eyes. If you're still skeptical about increasing your reading speed, consider the following. This technique does not have to be used to increase your reading speed. You could choose to continue reading at your old speed, but have more time to understand the text, with less time used interpreting symbols. It is also strange that many people say that they don't need to read faster, but nobody wants to read slower.

Speed reading is not suitable for many types of written material.  Text with complex mathematical concepts or equations, for example, needs to be read many times, slowly.  Written material describing a complex historical scenario likewise may be too complicated to be understood quickly. However, when the reading speed is slow and the information is not interesting, the mind tends to wander.

Speed reading poetry will not improve one's appreciation of it, partly because in reading it too quickly, one loses much of the nuance of poetical metre. This is also true if you try to recite poetry at 700wpm. Speed reading tends to be a useful technique for light material such as easy-reading novels or magazine columns. The best idea is to speed read slowly. That is, use a perfect reading technique, but do it at a rate appropriate for the appreciation of what you are reading. Using a bad technique doesn't increase the appreciation of poetry, or the understanding of mathematical formulae.  Speed reading the small print of speed reading course contracts (or any contract, for that matter) is also not a good idea.


In order to increase your reading speed, do this: 

# Never pronounce the words. Your mouth should be absolutely still.
# Don't move your head. If you try to read at a breakneck speed, you will hurt your neck.  Move your eyes instead.  
# Practice not looking back at words.  This is extremely important. Read a text, and note how your eyes tend to look back and read the same words repeatedly.  In the beginning it takes a lot of concentration to read with a steady flow.  The eyes will read a chunk of words, then another, and so on.  However, don't get hung up on this: recognize that some texts simply require reading, rereading, and rereading again before comprehension begins to settle in.  If you didn't understand something that you have just read, read it again (and again and again if necessary) before moving on.   Well-written text repays close attention; but (of course) trashy novels or suchlike may be read using speed reading techniques with no loss.  Remember that the goal of speed reading (or indeed any type of reading) is comprehension, not speed.
# At the end of the row, the eyes should move diagonally (the shortest path) to the next row. 
# You can't read while your eyes are moving. When you read, your eyes should grasp a couple of words, then your gaze should jump forward in order to read the next couple of words.  When you actually read, your eyes are not moving.  In order to read as quickly as possible, read as many words as possible in each glance.  Reading research shows that it is possible to read as many as two words at one time. So keep practicing.

===Aiding Software===

The key to success is concentration and therefore discipline. If you really want to practice the last point, reading as large chunks of words as possible, you can create a computer program which writes two words on the screen with a space between them. Both words should be read at once, not one after the other. As you practice, enlarge the space between the two words. Another idea is to write a program which shows a text and as you press the space bar it begins to make the text invisible one word at a time (or maybe &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; words at a time). In that way, you are forced to continue reading, you cannot look back. If you write any of these programs, which shouldn't take more than a couple of hours, please make them available for everyone here. (''Shouldn't the code be posted to [[wikisource:|Wikisource]], under [[wikisource:Wikisource:Source code|Source Code]]?'')

Yet another option which may be more viable for some is using available speed reading software package. Among the best are [http://www.readfaster.com The Reader's Edge], [http://www.rocketreader.com RocketReader] and [http://www.acereader.com AceReader], though of course many others exist. Most of these programs will have grouping, flash, memory, speed reading, and shadow exercises.

:: The books weren't hidden they were made to show in a fixed area and scroll. I've tried something else now. Each time it loads shows a different good book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I am worried that this approach is hiding what we do at Wikibooks.  We create books to be read. 

:::Here are some examples of commercial ebook sites:

:::http://www.ebooks.com/

:::http://www.free-ebooks.net/

:::http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page

:::http://www.ebookimpressions.com/

:::They tend to show their books as the most important feature.
:::[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

:::: I really don't like the way the books are presented. Thats why I changed it previously and was trying different things. I believe the &quot;library catalog&quot; should remain side by side with the welcome box as it was previously. I was trying to make the &quot;featured books&quot; more consistent with how websites such as those listed above do so. None that I could tell, present as many featured books, do so without an image for the book, divide the books into subsections on the front page, or make there list of book categories completely unaccessible without scrolling. In other words, I don't think the changes make it look any more like a professional ebook website.
:::: To me it looks like you may of just simply reverted back to an earlier version. I'm worried that the current state of this module looks unprofessional and wonder whats the points in trying to show our best books if we also don't show our best in designing the front page. I really didn't want to have to say anything like this and I hope it doesn't come off the wrong way. I prefer do or improve than explain why I don't like something. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:32, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::This is just a test page and the list of books that I have included definitely needs an improved presentation, as you say. At present there are only about 40 books that could qualify as &quot;nearly complete&quot;.  I would like to suggest that we use this moment, when there are not many good books, to work out how to display books so that readers are attracted to them.  In 6 months to a year we will need to have displays of books in the individual departments and only a few featured books on the front page.  However, at this moment we have the opportunity to work out how to display individual books on the front page itself.  We can then use this method of display later in the individual departments.

:::::So, what I am asking is that you, or someone else who is good at laying things out, should work out a way of displaying individual books.  Obviously this should involve a picture and a summary but should be neater and prettier than my crude table! [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:33, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

(reset indent) Derbeth made the following comment:
First of all, the table with &quot;excellent books&quot; (is &quot;excellent&quot; the best word? Aren't we exaggerating?) leaves too much space in left and right; this looks odd. Perhaps the solution is to make a two-column layout to use all of existing space? Look how long is the page now; it should be not like that, especially when category selection is deep on the bottom.

Secondly, I don't think that putting PDF's in front is a good idea. We are wiki and should be focused on wiki materials. PDF's are: inconsistent in look, require user to download a large ammount of data at once, may be seriously outdated and are something &quot;external&quot; to our project (internal links, categories do not work). I think that part of Wikipedia success is that you read and simultaniously fix mistakes you find. Showing out non-editable form of our books would be a shot in our foot in my opinion. So, the order should be the opposite: book titles should lead to books on our wiki (cover pages when possible), and links to PDF versions should be given as an option.

Less important things: table with Wikijunior books has an inconsistent look with the rest of the page. &quot;Search and browse&quot; with category selection together with list of sister projects leave to much white space on left and right. They should be aligned more horizontally; be wider but lower.

Things I particularly like are book descriptions with cover images; this brings some diversity to the main page. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:28, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, we have to &quot;lay out our stall&quot; to be successful. We need to implement your suggestions:

:1.  Replace &quot;excellent etc.&quot;

:2.  Make the display 2 column

:3.  Make the link to the editable version with a &quot;(PDF)&quot; link. ie: &quot;[[Special relativity]]  [[Media:special relativity.pdf|(PDF)]]&quot;

:4.  Wikijunior should have same layout.

:Good ideas. Unfortunately (or fortunately from my point of view!) I am just about to go on holiday. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== Using columns? ==

I like the idea of using two columns on the main page. Instead of the current setup, we could have the &quot;Welcome!&quot; message on the left, and a list of books on the right (likely a partial, randomly generated list of books, instead of the complete list). At the bottom we could have then the links to our bookshelves, and then the links to the sister projects. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

: I rather see welcome and the bookshelves at the top for the left and right column for the first row, followed by a partial and randomly generated list of books following using two columns followed by the sister projects links last. Neither the welcome nor bookshelves take up much screen space and should be easily accessible from the top. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== Current Version ==

I really like the current version, With the two columns up top, the 2x2 grid of books underneith, and then the sister project links. It looks very good on this screen, but I am currently on a wide-aspect screen, so more things are showing then they would on a smaller screen (the lab on campus has very large monitors). I think we are definately moving in the right direction. All we need now is to write short summaries of all our good books! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:50, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

The current version looks better. However, with only 40 completed books we could, and should, put all of these books on the front page. I have provided an example in the [[Main_Page/test/Humanities_and_arts_department|Humanities and Arts department]] of how the departmental pages might be arranged if only a short listing of books is provided on the main page.  Each department would have a full list of its best books up front.  Eventually this might be extended into the page for each subject area with only the best at the departmental level. (The list of books in the arts dept is not complete) [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:30, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

:I like that idea alot! every department should contain, right on the bookshelf, listings of the best books. This could include little blurbs like cover images and summaries. If we had a standardized system for displaying these blurbs, it would be a trivial matter for a bot to read them, and create templates for inclusion on the main page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

::While I'm thinking about it, i'm going to create a suitable template for this. Book blurbs like this could be written in the template, and then all references to that template on the bookshelves could be easily picked out by a human or a bot, for inclusion on the main page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I like the look of the proposed front page listed here, and i also believe that this is the way forward. I think that giving each bookshelf it's own set of featured books as demonstrated at the arts and humanities departments would be a great help to the project and would ake it more accessible to those who wish to read rather than edit, whilst still maintaining the editor functionality.

::::I'm only quickly scanning the comments here, but I like Urbane's idea of having some good book for each bookshelf, at least for the most part. I like this page a lot and think it looks nice. I'd have no problem with it becoming the new main page if we could add a few more good books to it. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:13, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

→ tab reset

I think we should restrict books listed on the main page to one book per department in order to show that Wikibooks has a broad range of textbooks. Each department could pick what books to show on its department page and than one book picked from that list could be used for the main page. Alternatively each time the page is loaded a different book is picked from the books listed on a department page. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:52, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

== Information Ecology Practices ==

::&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;Principle 4: understanding is enhanced by intelligent practice&lt;/font&gt;

The transition to a knowledge-based digital environment has been vital to the transformation of the nature of information ecosystems and a global dynamic of the intensification of intelligence. The emerging holistic life science of [[Information Ecology]] incorporates principles, disciplines and protocols that facilitate the emergence of a common collective intelligence:

* '''Be mindful''' that '''information''' has:

:* '''Zero mass'''

:* '''Zero physical size'''

:* '''Virtually zero travel time'''

* '''Be mindful''' that these '''zero-based properties''' - combined with advances in technology - open up a new, '''infinite, digital universe'''

:* Discover how '''information properties''' make possible - as never before - a new '''digital commons''' and

:* Enable  '''common access to properties of the whole'''

* Be mindful of the '''power of zero'''

:* '''addition''' &amp;amp; '''subtraction''' - it '''does nothing'''

:* '''multiplication''' - reducing any number to '''zero'''

:* '''division''' - raising any number to an immeasurable, '''infinite''' number

:* '''exponential power''' - bringing all numbers to '''one'''

:* Be mindul of zero's '''synonyms''': nothing, none, null, empty, void, the unknown

* '''Be mindful''' that '''information obeys the following principles''':

:* '''value''' is enhanced by intelligent '''organization'''

:* '''management''' is enhanced by intelligent '''protocols'''

:* '''flow''' is enhanced by intelligent '''networks'''

:* '''understanding''' is enhanced by intelligent '''practice'''

* Observe the '''intelligence''' and '''value''' of each '''information ecosystems''' with which you interact

:* Pay attention to the '''boundaries''' of information ecosystems

:* Pay attention to the '''interactions between''' information ecosystems

:* Discern and observe the '''architecture''' of information ecosystems

:* Be mindful of '''endangered information species''' and '''patterns of dominance'''

* Observe your '''organization's information habitats''' and their dynamics. Are they in design and use?

:* Engage in an ongoing collective process of observing, enhancing and fine tunic the '''internal flow of information'''

* Observe your personal information habitats. Are they for you?

:* Integrate, enhance and fine tune your '''personal information habitats'''

* Seek '''virtually effortless''' interaction with your information habitats

:* Focus on '''hand''' and '''eye'' movement alone

:* '''Save keystrokes''' whenever possible

:* Align in style with '''cascading styles'''

:* Observe the '''Tao of information'''

* Choose Wikibooks as your default platform for writing

==Doing One Thing At a Time==

In karate, practicing the basic strike demands that

# The opponent should be vividly imagined
# The look should be steady and directed to the chest of the imagined opponent
# The elbow of the arm not striking should strike backwards with equal force
# The hip should rotate in order to enhance the strike
# The exhale should take place in the moment of impact
# The wrist must be straight during the strike
# The arm should not be streched out entirely (in order not to wear out the elbow joint)
# The fist should rotate just before the moment of impact

Having all this in mind when practicing is very difficult. A better idea is to concentrate on one thing at a time. Iterate over the list of things to practice. Let the other things happen by themselves or go wrong, as the case may be. This method of practicing is of course applicable in all kinds of training.

==Choosing to Focus on the Practice==

Another useful technique to use when practicing, also inspired by martial arts, is to enter a meditation position before and after the training.

Before the training, enter the position and

# Consciously remind yourself that you ''choose'' to do this training
# Affirm that you will be concentrated and use the time effectively
# Visualize yourself doing what you are going to do, feel that you are relaxed and that it is fun to practice

After the training, enter the position and

# Visualize what you practiced and visualize yourself doing everything perfectly
# Thank yourself for being concentrated and feel the joy of development

Someone should lay off on the big worded talk later down the page when talking about permeability. 

In the common case of an isotropic medium, D and E are parallel and ε is a scalar, but in more general anisotropic media this is not the case and ε is a rank-2 tensor (causing birefringence). 


isotropic? birefringence? rank-2 tensor? anisotropic media?

== RC circuit drawings are incorrect ==

The circuit drawings for RC circuit portion of the article are incorrect.  One of two things can be done to fix these:  (1) replace the battery with a current source or (2) keep the battery but put all the components in series.  I recommend option (2) as a battery is more familiar than a current source.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 01:35, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

== Pros &amp; cons of different capacitor technologies ==
Different capacitor types have inherent characteristics which make them unsuitable or less desirable for certain applications.  It would be useful to list both pros and cons for electrolytic, ceramic, mica, paper, tantalum, aluminum-Mylar, and other types of capacitors.  As a 25+ year electronic design engineer, I am frequently amazed how even my fellow electrical engineers are unaware of these factors.  It's not an area typically covered in undergraduate engineering programs, and the better engineers acquire this knowledge on the job over a five- to ten-year period. --[[User:Hydrargyrum|Quicksilver]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Hydrargyrum|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum|@]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:58, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

==Electrolytic pics are bad==
I don't like the electrolytic picture, it (the caption) doesn't say which one is radial and which is axial, and the leads are shown of equal length, which is incorrect.  I may post something on this if it is ok.[[User:66.75.230.103|66.75.230.103]] 06:32, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

== equivalent series resistance ==

This module mentions
: ''ESR or &quot;equivalent series resistance&quot; (explained above).''
but alas, I don't see any explanation of it, either &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; that mention.
Has the ESR explanation been accidentally deleted?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 16:14, 2 September 2008 (UTC)

== which capacitor information goes where ==

I think somewhere we should mention &quot;surge current&quot; ratings.
In particular, the fact that tantalum capacitors can fail and become a short circuit if their surge current is exceeded[http://www.ryston.cz/pdf/avx/solid_ti.pdf].

But should I mention that in [[Electronics/Capacitors#Capacitor Labeling]], [[Electronics/Component Identification#Tantalum capacitors]], or [[Electronics/Capacitor Construction]] ?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Perhaps we scrap the sound section, and other undesirables, yes?

Sound has a long history in Electronics components (microphone, speaker).  It has bandwidth and serves as a good analogy to light that people can relate to.  As for light, well there is radio and TV among other things.  I have removed the pop cultural references so this should hopefully address your concerns about undesirables.

== X ray laser ==

Thanks a lot for this article, i've been looking for a long time for this information. However i don't think is actualized, ti would be amazing if in the x ray segment would explain the new x ray lasers and why it can't be an gamma ray laser. Since i'm not a physicist (or a scientists either) may be there is a reason for it, then accept my excuses in advance for my ignorant comment :-)

==Vacuum Tube equals Thermonic Valve==

A Vacuum Tube is a container (usually of glass) from which the air is removed. Inside the tube are two or more &quot;Elements&quot;.

- Cathode: (electron emitter) has an electrically heated filament (which you can usually see glow red ) which spits out electrons that travel through the vacuum to the Anode (electron acceptor).

- Anode: Is a conductive (usually metal) plate that is connected to a positive voltage. The negative electrons flow from the Cathode to the Anode.

A vacuum tube with just Cathode and Anode elements is a DIODE.  Current will flow only when the Anode has a positive voltage relative to the Cathode.

- Grid(s): metal gratings or grids are placed between the Cathode and Anode to produce devices that can amplify signals.

NOTE: A tube with 3 elements (one grid) is a TRIODE, with 2 grids a TETRODE, with 3 grids a PENTODE.

A Grid between the cathode and anode controls the flow of electrons.  By applying a negative voltage to the grid it is possible to control the flow of electrons.  This is the basis of the Vacuum Tube amplifier.  

A problem with Vacuum Tubes is they are big, bulky, and often meant for applications involving a lot of power.  They are very powerful  which usually being a Vacuum.  However it is possible to scale up vacuum tubes to very high powers, and many high-powered transmitters for broadcast FM and TV use vacuum power tubes. 

Vacuum tube based amplifiers have largely been replaced by semiconductor transistor based amplifiers, as they are low power and much more compact.  

The voltage difference in the direction from the cathode to the anode is known as the forward bias and is the normal operating mode. If the voltage applied to the Anode becomes negative relative to the Cathode, no electrons will flow. In electronics vacuum electron tube or valve is a device that controls current. Through a vacuum in sealed container. Vacuum tubes rely on thermionic emission of electrons from hot filament.

==Klystron==
A klystron is a vacuum tube used for production of microwave energy.  This device is related to but not the same as a magnetron.  The klystron was invented after the magnetron.

Klystrons work using a principle known as velocity modulation.

The klystron is a long narrow vacuum tube.  There is an electron gun (heater, cathode, beam former) at one end and an anode at the other.  In between is a series of donut shaped resonant cavity structures positioned so that the electron beam passes through the hole.

The first and last of the resonant cavities are electrically wired together.

At the cathode the electron beam is relatively smooth.  There are natural slight increases and decreases in the electron density of the beam.  As the beam passes through the holes of the resonant cavities, any changes in the electron beam cause some changes in the resting electro magnetic (EM) field of the cavities.  The EM fields of the cavities begin to oscillate.  The oscillating EM field of the cavities then has an effect on the electrons passing through, either slowing down or speeding up their passage.

As electrons are affected by the EM field of the first cavity they change their speed.  This change in speed is called velocity modulation. By the time the electrons arrive at the last cavity there are definite groups in the beam.  The groups interact strongly with the last cavity causing it to oscillate in a more pronounced way.  Some of the last cavity's energy is tapped off and fed back to the first cavity to increase its oscillations.  The stronger first cavity oscillations produce even stronger grouping of the electrons in the beam causing stronger oscillations in that last cavity and so on.  This is positive feedback.

The output microwave energy is tapped of for use in high power microwave devices such as long range primary RADAR systems.

The klystron is a coherent microwave source in that it is possible to produce an output with a constant phase. This is a useful attribute when combined with signal processing to measure RADAR target attributes like Doppler shift.

Related microwave vacuum tubes are the Travelling Wave Tube (TWT) and the Travelling Wave Amplifier (TWA).  A Hybrid device, which combines some aspects of these devices and the klystron, is a device called a Twicetron.

==Magnetron==
Magnetrons are used to produce microwaves.

This is the original device used for production of microwaves and was invented during the Second World War for use in RADAR equipment.

Magnetrons work using a principle known as velocity modulation.

A circular chamber, containing the cathode, is surrounded by and connected to a number of resonant cavities.  The walls of the chamber are the anode.  The cavity dimensions determine the frequency of the output signal. A strong magnetic field is passed through the chamber, produced by a powerful magnet. 
The cathode is similar to most thermionic valves, except heavy, rigid construction is necessary for power levels used in most Magnetrons.
Early, experimental designs used directly heated cathodes. Modern, high powered designs use a rigid, tubular cathode enclosing a heater element.

Naturally excited electrons on the surface of the cathode are drawn off, into the chamber, toward the outer walls or anode. As the electrons move out, they pass through a magnetic field that produces a force perpendicular to the direction of motion and direction of the magnetic field.  The faster the electrons move, the more sideways force is produced.  The result is that the electrons rotate around the central cathode as they move toward the outside of the chamber.

As electrons move past the entrances to the resonant cavities a disturbance is made to the electro magnetic (EM) field that is at rest in the cavities.  The cavity begins to oscillate.  When another electron moves past the cavities, it also interacts with the internal EM field.  The motion of the electron can be slowed or sped up by the cavity field.  As more electrons interact with the cavity EM fields, the internal cavity oscillations increase and the effect on the passing electrons is more pronounced.

Eventually, bands of electrons rotating together develop within the central chamber.  Any electrons that fall behind a band are given a kick by the resonant cavity fields.  Any electrons going too fast have their excess energy absorbed by the cavities.  This is the velocity modulation effect. The frequency of the resonance and electron interaction is in the order of GHz. (10^9 cycles per second)

In order to have a signal output from the magnetron, one of the cavities is taped with a slot or a probe to direct energy out into a waveguide for distribution.

Magnetrons for RADARs are pulsed with short duration and high current.  Magnetrons for microwave ovens are driven with a continuous lower current.

The magnetrons for WWII bombers, operated by the RAF, were sometimes taped into a shielded box so that the aircrew could heat their in-flight meals, hence the first microwave ovens.

==Cathode Ray Tube==
A cathode ray tube or CRT is a specialized vacuum tube in which images are produced when an electron beam strikes a phosphorescent surface. Television sets, computers, automated teller machines, video game machines, video cameras, monitors, oscilloscopes and radar displays all contain cathode-ray tubes. Phosphor screens using multiple beams of electrons have allowed CRTs to display millions of colors.

The first cathode ray tube scanning device was invented by the German scientist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897. Braun introduced a CRT with a fluorescent screen, known as the cathode ray oscilloscope. The screen would emit a visible light when struck by a beam of electrons.

=== TV Tubes ===
TV tubes are basically cathode ray tubes. An electron beam is produced by an electrically-heated filament, and that beam is guided by two magnetic fields to a particular spot on the screen. The beam is moved so very quickly, that the eye can see not just one particular spot, but all the spots on the screen at once, forming a variable picture.
:Colours are produced by having 3 or more differently coloured screen spots activated at once to a variable degree.
The 2 magnetic fields are one for the vertical deflection, one for the horizontal deflection, and they are provided to the beam by external coils.

=== Oscilloscope Tubes ===
Oscilloscope tubes are basically the same as TV tubes, but the beam is guided by two electrostatic fields provided by internal pieces of metal. It is a necessity because an oscilloscope uses a very large range of synchronisation frequencies for the deflection, when a TV set uses fixed frequencies, and it would be too difficult to drive large coils on a so large band of frequency. 
They are much deeper for the same screen size as a TV tube because the deflection angle is little. A TV tube has a deflection angle of 90° for the be

==DC Circuit Analysis==
In this chapter, capacitors and inductors will be introduced (without considering the effects of AC current.) The big thing to understand about Capacitors and Inductors in DC Circuits is that they have a transient (temporary) response.    During the transient period, capacitors build up charge and stop the flow of current (eventually acting like infinite resistors.)  Inductors build up energy in the form of magnetic fields, and become more conductive. In other words, in the steady-state (long term behavior), capacitors become open circuits and inductors become short circuits.  Thus, for DC analysis, you can replace a capacitor with an empty space and an inductor with a wire.  The only circuit components that remain are voltage sources, current sources, and resistors.

==Capacitors and Inductors at DC==
[[Image:Electronics DC CLmess 0.PNG]]
[[Image:Electronics DC CLmess 1.PNG]]
[[Image:Electronics DC CLmess 2.PNG]]
[[Image:Electronics R.PNG]]

DC steady-state (meaning the circuit has been in the same state for a long time), we've seen that capacitors act like open circuits and inductors act like shorts.  The above figures show the process of replacing these circuit devices with their DC equivalents.  In this case, all that remains is a voltage source and a lone resistor.  (An AC analysis of this circuit can be found in the AC section.)

==Resistors==

If a circuits contains only resistors possibly in a combination of parallel and series connections then an equivalent resistance is determined. Then Ohm's Law is used to determine the current flowing in the main circuit.  A combination of voltage and current divider rules are then used to solve for other required currents and voltages.  

Simplify the following:&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Electronics R.PNG]](a)
[[Image:Electronics R2S.PNG]](b)
[[Image:Electronics R3S.PNG]](c)&lt;br/&gt;
:Figure 1: Simple circuits series circuits.

The circuit in Figure 1 (a) is very simple if we are given R and V, the voltage of the source, then we use Ohm's Law to solve for the current.  In Figure 1 (b) if we are given R1, R2 and V then we combine the resistor into an equivalent resistors noting that are in series.  Then we solve for the current as before using Ohm's Law.  In Figure 1 (c) if the resistors are labeled clockwise from the top resistor R1, R2 and R3 and the voltage source has the value: V.  The analysis proceeds as follows.  
:&lt;math&gt;R_{eq}=R_1+R_2+R_3 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This is the formula for calculating the equivalent resistance of series resistor.  The current is now calculated using Ohm's Law.

:&lt;math&gt;i=\frac {V }{R_{eq}}= \frac {V}{R_1+R_2+R_3}&lt;/math&gt;
If the voltage is required across the third resistor then we can use voltage divider rule.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{R3}=\frac {VR_3}{R_1+R_2+R_3}&lt;/math&gt;
Or alternatively one could use Ohm's Law together with the current just calculated.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{R3}=iR_3= \frac {VR_3}{R_1+R_2+R_3}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Electronics R2P.PNG]](a)
[[Image:Electronics R3P.PNG]](b)&lt;br/&gt;
:Figure 2: Simple parallel circuits.

In Figure 2 (a) if the Resistor nearest the voltage source is R1 and the other resistor R2.  If we need to solve for the current i.  then we proceed as before. First we calculate the equivalent resistance then use Ohm's Law to solve for the current.  The resistance of a parallel combination is:
:&lt;math&gt;R_{eq}=\frac {R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}&lt;/math&gt;
So the current, ''i'', flowing in the circuit is, by Ohm's Law:
:&lt;math&gt;i=\frac {V(R_1+R_2)}{R_1R_2}&lt;/math&gt;
If we need to solve for current through R2 then we can use current divider rule.
:&lt;math&gt;i_{R2}=\frac {V(R_1+R_2)(R_1)}{(R_1R_2)(R_1+R_2)}= \frac {V}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;(1)
But it would probably have been simpler to have used the fact that V most be dropped across R2.  This means that we can simply use Ohm's Law to calculate the current through R2. The equation is just equation 1.  In Figure 2 (b) we do exactly the same thing except this time there are three resistors this means that the equivalent resistance will be:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{R_{eq}}= \frac {1}{R_1}+\frac {1}{R_2}+\frac {1}{R_3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{eq} =\frac {R_1R_2R_3}{R_1R_2+R_1R_3+R_2R_3}&lt;/math&gt;
Using this fact we do exactly the same thing.

[[Image:Electronics 4RSP.PNG]] (a)
[[Image:Electronics 7RSP.PNG]] (b)
[[Image:Electronics R cube.PNG]] (c)
:Figure 3: Combined parallel and series circuits

In Figure 3 (a), if the three resistors in the outer loop of the circuit are R1, R2 and R3 and the other resistor is R4.  It is simpler to see what is going on if we combine R2 and R3 into their series equivalent resistance &lt;math&gt;R_23&lt;/math&gt;.  It is clear now that the equivalent resistance is R1 in series with the parallel combination of &lt;math&gt;R_23&lt;/math&gt; and R4.  If we want to calculate the voltage across the parallel combination of R4 and &lt;math&gt;R_{23}&lt;/math&gt; then we just use voltage divider.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{4 | | 23}=\frac {R_4 | |(R_2+R_3)V}{R_4 | |(R_2+R_3) + R_1}&lt;/math&gt;
If we want to calculate the current through R2 and R3 then we can use the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_4 | |(R_2+R_3)&lt;/math&gt; and Ohm's law.
:&lt;math&gt;i_{23} = \frac {R_4 | |(R_2+R_3)V}{(R_4 | |(R_2+R_3) + R_1)(R_2+R_3)}&lt;/math&gt;
Or we could calculate the current in the main circuit and then use current divider rule to get the current.

In Figure 3 (b) we take the same approach simplifying parallel combinations and series combinations of resistors until we get the equivalent resistance.

In Figure 3 (c) this process doesn't work then because there are resistors connected in a delta this means that there is no way to simplify this beyond transforming them to a star or wye connection.

Note: To calculate the current draw from the source the equivalent resistance always must be calculated.  But if we just need the voltage across a series resistor this may be necessary.  If we want to calculate the current in parallel combination then we must use either current divider rule or calculate the voltage across the resistor and then use Ohm's law to get the current.  The second method will often require less work since the current flowing from the source is required for the use of current divider rule.  The use of current divider rule is much simpler in the case when the source is a current source because the value of the current is set by the current source.

[[Image:star Electronics.png|Star Network]]

The above image shows three points 1, 2, and 3 connected with resistors ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' with a common point.
Such a configuration is called a ''star network'' or a ''Y-connection''.

[[Image:delta Electronics.png|Delta Network]]

The above image shows three points 1, 2, and 3 connected with resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''R&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''R&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;''.
The configuration is called a ''delta network'' or ''delta connection''.

We have seen that the series and parallel networks can be reduced by the use of simple equations.
Now we will derive similar relations to convert a star network to delta and vice versa.
Consider the points 1 and 2.
The resistance between them in the star case is simply

''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''

For the delta case, we have 

''R&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; || (R&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;) ''

We have similar relations for the points 2, 3 and 3, 1.
Making the substitution ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= R&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;'' etc., we have, simplifying,

&lt;math&gt;
  R_1 = \frac{r_2r_3}{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
  r_1 = \frac{R_1R_2 + R_2R_3 + R_3R_1}{R_1}
&lt;/math&gt;

in the most general case.
If all the resistances are equal, then ''R = r/3''.

== Regular ==
These are simply cut or stamped from a sheet of material. The side to be glued is usually slightly sticky, and protected by a plastic film which should be removed just before use.
As they are the same thickness all over there will be a sudden change in stiffness of the repaired inner tube at the edge of the patch. This can cause the patch to start peeling from the inner tube if not well stuck.

== Feather Edge ==
These are as thick as regular patches in the middle, but get thinner towards the edge. This makes it less likely that the patch will peel from the inner tube if not well stuck. They usually have a metal foil protecting the side to be glued, and a plastic film to support the thin edges while the patch is placed and pressed down.
== Self Adhesive ==
These are patches of either of the above types, but do not need a separate glue. Simply roughen the tube, peel the protective film from the patch and stick.

A Perl function is a grouping of code that allows it to be easily used repeatedly.   Functions are a key organizing component in all but the smallest of programs.

== Introduction ==

So far we have written just a few lines of Perl at a time.   Our example programs have started at the top of a file and proceeded to the bottom of the file, with a little jumping around using control-flow keywords like &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt;.   In many instances, though, it is useful to add another layer of organization on our programs.

For example, when something goes wrong in a typical program, it prints an &quot;error message&quot;.   The code to print an error message might look like

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
print STDOUT &quot;something went wrong!\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Other messages might look slightly different, like

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
print STDOUT &quot;something ELSE went wrong!\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

We could pepper our code with hundreds of lines just like this, and things would work just fine...for a while.   But sooner or later, we'd want to separate out error messages from &quot;status messages&quot; that report harmless information about our program.  To do this, we could prefix all of our error messages with the word &quot;ERROR&quot; and all of the status messages with &quot;STATUS&quot;.  The code for a typical error messages would change to 

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
print STDOUT &quot;ERROR: something went wrong!\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

The problem is, with hundreds of error messages, it would be a hassle to go change them all.   This is where subroutines can help out.

The [[w:wikipedia|wikipedia]] defines a subroutine, as &quot;a sequence of instructions which perform a specific task, as part of a larger program.  Subroutines can be called from different locations in a program, thus allowing programs to access the subroutine repeatedly without the subroutine's code having been written more than once.&quot;

All that gobblydeegook means we can wrap up our error message code in one place, as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub print_error_message {
   my($message) = @_;
   print STDOUT &quot;ERROR: &quot; . $message . &quot;\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Whenever something goes wrong in our program, we can activate, or ''call'', this subroutine, with whatever message we prefer:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
print_error_message(&quot;something bad happened&quot;);

print_error_message(&quot;something really horrible happened&quot;);

print_error_message(&quot;something sort of annoying happened&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
 
And see messages such as

 ERROR: something bad happened

If we need to change the formatting of our error message, say, to include a few exclamation points, it's simple enough to change the subroutine:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub print_error_message {
   my($message) = @_;
   print STDOUT &quot;ERROR: &quot; . $message . &quot;!!!\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
 
This has been an admittedly simple example, and subroutines have a few other advantages, but that's it in a nutshell.  Type it in one place, fix it in one place, change it in one place.

Now for a little more detail about subroutines.   Much of what follows will use the following subroutine, which, if it isn't obvious already, adds two numbers together, and returns their sum.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub add_two_numbers {
    my($x,$y) = @_;
    my $sum = $x + $y;
    return $sum;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Parts of a Subroutine==

===Name===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub add_two_numbers {
  my($x,$y) = @_;
  my $sum = $x + $y;
  return $sum;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The first line of a function begins with the keyword &lt;tt&gt;sub&lt;/tt&gt; followed by the function's name.   Any string of letters and numbers that is not a reserved Perl word (such as &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt;) is a valid function name.  Subroutines with names that describe what the subroutine does make for easier-to-read programs.

===Prototype (rarely used) ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;sub add_two_numbers($$) {&lt;/source&gt;

The optional &lt;tt&gt;($$)&lt;/tt&gt; specifies how many arguments this subroutine expects. &lt;tt&gt;($$)&lt;/tt&gt; says &quot;this function requires two scalar values&quot;.  Perl prototypes are NOT what most people with experience with other languages expect them to be: instead, the prototypes alter the context of the parameters to the subroutine.

It is possible to disable a prototype by calling the function with a leading '''&amp;''', but this is not recommended.  

Prototypes are used only seldomly, as it's much easier to use the normal method of passing parameters.

===Body===

The body of a subroutine does the &quot;work&quot;, and consists of three primary sections.

====Reading arguments====

The pieces of information handed to a subroutine are called ''arguments'' or ''actual parameters''.  For instance, in

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;add_two_numbers(3,4);&lt;/source&gt;

3 and 4 are the arguments to the subroutine &lt;tt&gt;add_two_numbers&lt;/tt&gt;.

Perl passes arguments to a subroutine in an array represented by &lt;tt&gt;@_&lt;/tt&gt;.  Usually it is more convenient to give meaningful names to these arguments, so the first line of a function often looks like

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub add_two_numbers {
    my($x,$y) = @_;  # reading parameters
    my $sum = $x + $y;
    return $sum;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

which puts the contents of &lt;tt&gt;@_&lt;/tt&gt; into two variables named &lt;tt&gt;$x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$y&lt;/tt&gt;.  &lt;tt&gt;$x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$y&lt;/tt&gt; are called ''formal parameters''.  The distinction between formal parameters (arguments) and actual parameters is subtle and for the most part unimportant.  It is described somewhat in the wikipedia article [[w:Parameter_%28computer_science%29|Parameter (computer science)]].   Be careful not to confuse the special variable &lt;tt&gt;$_&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;@_&lt;/tt&gt;, the array of arguments passed to a function.

Some subroutines don't require any arguments, for example

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub hello_world {
   print STDOUT &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

will print &quot;Hello World&quot; to STDOUT.   This subroutine doesn't need any extra information about how to do its job and accordingly doesn't need any arguments.

Most modern programming languages save programmers the trouble of explicitly breaking the argument array into variables.  Unfortunately, Perl does not. Which on the other hand makes writing subroutines with variable number of arguments very easy.

In programming context ''parameter'' means almost the same thing as argument (see [[w:Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] for details).  The two are often confused with no loss of understanding.

=====Important note: global and local variables=====
Unlike programming languages such as C or Java, all variables created or used within Perl subroutines are, by default, ''global'' variables.   This means that any piece of your program outside of your subroutine may modify these variables, and that your subroutine may be, unknowingly, modifying variables which it has no business modifying.   In small programs this is often convenient, but as programs get longer this often leads to complexity and is considered poor practice.

The best way to avoid this trap is to place the keyword &lt;tt&gt;my&lt;/tt&gt; in front of all your variables the first time they appear.   This tells Perl that you only want these variables to be available inside the nearest enclosing group of curly braces.   In effect, these ''local'' variables act as a &quot;scratch space&quot; for use within your subroutines that disappears when the subroutine returns.   The line &lt;tt&gt;use strict;&lt;/tt&gt; at the top of your program will instruct Perl to ''force'' you to use &lt;tt&gt;my&lt;/tt&gt; in front of your variables, to prevent you from accidentally creating global variables.

An alternative to &lt;tt&gt;my&lt;/tt&gt; that you may see in some older Perl programs is the &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.  &lt;tt&gt;local&lt;/tt&gt; is somewhat similar to &lt;tt&gt;my&lt;/tt&gt;, but is more complicated to deal with.   It's better to stick with &lt;tt&gt;my&lt;/tt&gt; in your own programs.

&quot;Scope&quot; describes whether a variable is local or global, and a couple of other complexities.  See [[w:scope (programming)|scope]] for a technical discussion.

====The interesting part of a subroutine====

In the very middle of the subroutine you're likely to find the more interesting &quot;guts&quot; of it all.  In our add_two_numbers subroutine, this is the part that actually does the adding

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub add_two_numbers {
    my($x,$y) = @_;
    my $sum = $x + $y;  # the interesting part
    return $sum;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this middle section, you can do just about anything your heart desires, arithmetic, printing to files, or even calling other subroutines.

====The &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; statement====

Finally, some subroutines &quot;return&quot; some piece of information, called the &quot;return value&quot;, using the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub add_two_numbers {
    my($x,$y) = @_;
    my $sum = $x + $y;
    return $sum;  # the return statement
}
&lt;/source&gt;

For example

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;$sum = add_two_numbers(4,5);&lt;/source&gt;

will set &lt;tt&gt;$sum&lt;/tt&gt; to 9 (the sum of 4 and 5).

&lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; can also be used without any return value as a shortcut to leave a subroutine before getting to a closing &lt;tt&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt;

== Invoking subroutines ==
Subroutines may be declared anywhere within a Perl program. They may be invoked like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
add_two_numbers(4,5); # the safest approach

add_two_numbers 4, 5; # only if predeclared

&amp;add_two_numbers(4,5);  # older Perl syntax, but still valid
&lt;/source&gt;

If no &amp; prefix is used, parentheses are required unless the subroutine has been predeclared.

== Functions calling functions ==

On their own, functions provide a major stepping stone towards good code, but combining functions together really unleashes their power.

As you might expect, calling a function from ''within'' another function doesn't look any different from calling a function from the part of your program that is sitting outside any curly-braces.

This function adds two numbers, then multiplies them by 3.   Bear with us on the uselessness of these functions.   As you build your own programs to solve your unique problems, you'll see their usefulness immediately.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub add_two_numbers_and_mult_by_three {
  my($x,$y) = @_;    # read parameters
  my $sum = add_two_numbers($x,$y);   # add x and y, put result in sum
  my $sum_times_three = $sum * 3;     # multiply by three
  return $sum_times_three;     # return result
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The line

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;my $sum = add_two_numbers($x,$y);   # add x and y, put result in sum&lt;/source&gt;

calls our function add_two_numbers and puts the result into our &lt;tt&gt;$sum&lt;/tt&gt; variable.   Easy stuff, huh? 

In this function, we've actually written much more code than we need.   It could be pared down to something much smaller, but equally readable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub add_two_numbers_and_mult_by_three {
  my($x,$y) = @_;    # read parameters
  return 3 * add_two_numbers($x,$y);   # add x and y, mult by 3, return
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Functions calling themselves -- recursion ==

We've seen functions calling ''other'' functions, but one neat concept in programming is when functions call ''themselves''.   This is called [[w:recursion|recursion]].   At first it seems like this might cause a so-called [[w:infinite loop|infinite loop]], but it's really quite standard programming.

In math, the [[w:factorial|factorial]] function, multiplies a positive [[w:integer|integer]] by each positive integer less than itself.   For example, &quot;5 factorial&quot; (usually written &lt;tt&gt;5!&lt;/tt&gt;) is calculated by multiplying 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.   Of course, the 1 doesn't change the result.   The factorial function is useful in calculating things like the number of different possible ways to seat your relatives at the dinner table.

Factorial makes a natural example for recursion, though it can be written just as easily with a &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub factorial {
  my($num) = @_;
  if($num == 1) {
    return 1;   # stop at 1, factorial doesn't multiply times zero
  } else {
    return $num * factorial($num - 1);   # call factorial function recursively
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The self-referential line here is

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
return $num * factorial($num - 1);   # call factorial function recursively
&lt;/source&gt;

which calls the factorial function from ''within'' the factorial function.   This would go on forever, but we have a sort of stop-sign that prevents it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if($num == 1) {
  return 1;   # stop at 1, factorial doesn't multiply times zero
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This stops the sequence of calls to factorial and prevents the never-ending infinite loop.

Written in a sort of longhand

  factorial(5)
  = 5 * factorial(4)
  = 5 * 4 * factorial(3)
  = 5 * 4 * 3 * factorial(2)
  = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1)
  = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 
  = 120

We've just barely touched on recursion. For some programming problems, it is a very natural solution.  For others, it's a little... unnatural. Suffice it to say, it's a tool every programmer should carry in his or her belt.

== Subroutines vs Functions vs Procedures ==

While reading programming literature and talking to programmers, you might run across the three terms &quot;subroutines&quot;, &quot;functions&quot; and &quot;procedures&quot;.   Most of the time these are used interchangeably, but for the purists out there:

A '''function''' always returns a value, and, given the same arguments, always returns the same value.  Functions are a lot like the functions you may have used in math class.

A '''procedure''', unlike a function, may return no value at all.   Unlike a function, a procedure often interacts with its external environment beyond its argument array.  For instance, a procedure may read and write to files.

A '''subroutine''' refers to a sequence of instructions that may be either a function or a procedure.

== The official grammar ==

The syntax for defining a subroutine is:

 sub NAME PROTOTYPE ATTRIBUTES BLOCK

If this makes any sense to you, you probably don't need to be reading this book ;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Diels-Alder reaction, named after the German chemists who developed it, is a method for producing simple ring compounds.

&lt;center&gt;[[image:Dielsalder.png|A diene adds to a dienophile in a simple Diels-Alder Reaction]]&lt;br&gt;''Mechanism of a reaction between a diene and a dienophile''&lt;/center&gt;

In the Diels-Alder reaction, a conjugated diene reacts with a dienophile. The dienophile is named for its affinity to react with the diene. 

Because dienes and dienophiles are often gases, this reaction usually takes place in a sealed container at elevated pressure and temperature. The temperature required by this reaction can be reduced by the presence of electron-witdrawing groups attached to the dienophile.

In some cases, such as furan and maleic anhydride, or cyclopentadiene  and acrolein, the reaction will take place at room temperature in an ethoxyethane solution.

The reaction shown above is highly unlikely due to the lack of substituents on the diene and dienophile. The dienophile will usually have a carbonyl, nitro, or other electron-withdrawing group attached. Any substituents attached to the diene or dienophile will end up in the final product. 

&lt;center&gt;[[image:Dielsalder2.png|A substituated dienophile reacts to form a product with the same substituents.]]&lt;br&gt;''Notice that the product retains the same basic cyclohexene structure. The substituents simply extend from the ring.''&lt;/center&gt;

Alkynes can also react as dienophiles. 

Diels-Alder reactions can sometimes reverse themselves through Retro-Diels-Alder reactions. For example, dicyclopentadiene can be cracked to form 1,3-cyclopentadiene by thermal dissociation. Retro reactions occur under situations where the fragments are stable by themselves.

In the earlier chapters we were taught how to create [[../Introduction to XML#The_major_XML_elements|XML files]] in detail. This involved the development of [[../A single entity#XML_document|XML documents]], [[../A single entity#XML_Stylesheet|Style sheets]] and [[../A single entity#XML_schema|Schema]] and their validation. In this chapter, we will focus on different approaches for parsing [[../Introduction to XML#The_major_XML_elements|XML files]] and when to use them. 

But first, it is time to refresh what we have learned about parsing.

= The Process of Parsing XML files =

One goal of the XML format was to enhance raw data formats like plain text by including detailed descriptions of the meaning of the content. Now, in order to be able to read XML files, we use a parser which basically exposes the document’s content through a so-called API (application programming interface). In other words, a client application accesses the content of the XML document through an interface, instead of having to interpret the XML code on its own! 

== Simple Text Parsing ==
One way to extract data from an XML document is simple text parsing – browsing all characters in the document and check for a desired pattern:


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;house&gt;
&lt;value&gt;&lt;int&gt;150,000&lt;/int&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/house&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Let’s say we are interested in the value of the house. Using straight text parsing, we would scan the file for the character sequence &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;value&gt;&lt;int&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and call it the start pattern. Then, we would further scan the document for the end pattern (i.e. &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/int&gt;&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;). Finally, we declare the text string in between these two patterns to be the value of the surrounding &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;house&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tag.

== Why it doesn't work that way ==
Obviously, this approach is not suitable for extracting information from large and complex XML documents, since we would have to know exactly what the file looks like and where the information needed is located. From a more general point of view, the structure and semantics of an XML file is determined by the makeup of the document, its tags and attributes – hence, we need a device that is able to recognize and understand this structure and can point out any errors in it. Moreover, it has to provide the content of the document through an interface, so that other applications can access it without difficulty. This device is known as an XML parser.

== What a parser does ==
Almost all programs that need to process XML documents use an XML parser to extract the information stored in the XML document in order to avoid any of the difficulties that occur when reading and interpreting raw XML data. The parser usually is a class library (e.g. a set of Java class files) that reads a given document and checks if it is well-formed according to the W3C specification. Then, any client software can use methods of the interface provided by the parser API to access the information the parser retrieved from the XML file. 

All in all, the parser shields the user from dealing with the complex details of XML like assembling information distributed over several XML files, checking for well-formedness constraints, and so on.

= Parsing: an Example =

To illustrate more clearly what parsing an XML file really means, the following example was created which contains information about some cities. It also keeps track of who is on vacation and demonstrates the parsing process with the currently most common parsing methods. 

== Example: ''cities.xml''==

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;cities&gt;
&lt;city vacation=&quot;Sam&quot;&gt;
&lt;cityName&gt;Atlanta&lt;/cityName&gt;
&lt;cityCountry&gt;USA&lt;/cityCountry&gt; 
&lt;/city&gt;
&lt;city vacation=&quot;David&quot;&gt;
&lt;cityName&gt;Sydney&lt;/cityName&gt;
&lt;cityCountry&gt;Australia&lt;/cityCountry&gt; 
&lt;/city&gt;
&lt;city vacation=&quot;Pune&quot;&gt;
&lt;cityName&gt;Athens&lt;/cityName&gt;
&lt;cityCountry&gt;Greece&lt;/cityCountry&gt; 
&lt;/city&gt;
&lt;/cities&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Based on the information stored in this XML document, we can easily check who is on vacation and where. The parser will read the file using one of the various techniques presented later in this chapter. 

This process is very complicated and prone to errors of all kinds. Luckily, we will never have to write code for it, because there are plenty of free, fully-functional parsers on the Web. All we do is download a parser class library and access the XML document through the interface provided by the parser software.  With more recent builds of Java, most parsers do not even have to be downloaded.  In other words, we use the functions or methods included in the class library for extracting the information.

Basically, a parser reads the XML document and tries to recognize the structure of the file itself while checking for errors. It simply checks for start/end tags, attributes, namespaces, prefixes, and so on. Then, the client software can access the information derived from this structure using methods provided by the parser software (i.e. the interface).

The best way to learn about the functionality of a parser is to actually use them; therefore, the next section demonstrates the different methods of parsing.

= Parser APIs (Application Programming Interface) =

== Overview ==
There are two “traditional” approaches that dominate the market right now, an event-based push-model as represented by SAX (Simple API for XML) and a tree-based model using the DOM (document object model) approach.

However, there is a movement towards newer approaches and techniques that try to overcome the flaws inherent in these traditional models – an event-based pull-model and a “cursor model”, such as VTD-XML, which allows us to browse the XML document just like in the tree-based approach, but simpler and easier to use.

== SAX (Simple API for XML) ==
=== Description ===
The push model, typically the exemplified by SAX (www.saxproject.org) is the “gold standard” of XML parsing, since it is probably the most complete and accurate method so far. The SAX classes provide an interface between the input streams from which XML documents are read and the client software which receives the data made available by the parser. The parser browses through the whole document and fires events every time it recognizes an XML construct (e.g. it recognizes a start tag and fires an event – the client software is notified and can use this information… or not).

=== Evaluation ===
The advantage of such a model is that we don’t need to store the whole XML document in memory, since we are only reading one piece of information at a time. If you recall that the XML structure is a set of nodes of various types (like an element node) – parsing the document with a SAX parser means going through each node one at a time. This makes it possible to read even very large XML documents in a memory-efficient way. However, the fact that the parser only provides information about the node currently read also implies that the programmer of the client software is in charge of saving certain information in a separate data structure (e.g. the parents or children of the currently processed node). Moreover, the SAX approach is pretty much read-only, since it is hard to modify the XML structure when we do not have some sort of global view. 

In fact, the parser is in control of what is read when. The user can only wait until a certain event has occurred and then use the information stored in the currently processed node. 

=== Example: ''TGSAXParser.java'' ===
As mentioned before, the best way to fully understand the concept of the parsing process is to actually use it. In the following code sample, the information about the name and country of the cities that people are vacationing in will be displayed. The SAX API that is part of the Xerces parser package was used for the implementation (([http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j Xerces 2 Homepage]):


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
// import the basic SAX API classes
import org.xml.sax.*;
import org.xml.sax.helpers.*;
import java.io.*;

public class TGSAXParser extends DefaultHandler
{
    public boolean onVacation = false;

    // what to do when a start-element event was triggered
    public void startElement(String uri, String name, String qName, Attributes atts)
    {
        // stores the string in the XML file          
        String vacationer = atts.getValue(&quot;vacation&quot;);
        String cityName = atts.getValue(&quot;cityName&quot;);
        String cityCountry = atts.getValue(&quot;cityCountry&quot;);

        // if the start tag is &quot;city&quot; set vacationer to true
        if (qName.equals(&quot;city&quot;) &amp;&amp; (vacationer != null))
        {
            onVacation = true;
            System.out.print(&quot;\n&quot; + vacationer + &quot; is on vacation in &quot;);
        }
        if (qName.equals(&quot;cityName&quot;) &amp;&amp; onVacation)
            {                       
            }
        if (qName.equals(&quot;cityCountry&quot;) &amp;&amp; onVacation)
        {                       
        }
    }

    /**This method is used to stop printing information once the element has
    *been read.  It will also reset the onVacation variable for the next
    *element.
    */
    public void endElement(String uri, String name, String qName)
    {
        //reset flag
        if (qName.equals(&quot;city&quot;))
        {
            onVacation = false;
        }
    }

    /**This method is triggered to store and print the values between
    *the XML tags.  It will only print those values if onVacation == true.
    */
    public void characters(char[] ch, int start, int length)
    {
        if (onVacation)
        {
            for (int i = start; i &lt; start + length; i++)
            System.out.print(ch[i]);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;People on vacation in the following cities:&quot;);

        try
        {
            // create a SAX parser from the Xerces package
            XMLReader xml = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();
            TGSAXParser handler = new TGSAXParser();
            xml.setContentHandler(handler);
            xml.setErrorHandler(handler);
            FileReader r = new FileReader(&quot;cities.xml&quot;);
            xml.parse(new InputSource(r));
        }
        catch (SAXException se)
        {
            System.out.println(&quot;XML Parsing Error: &quot; + se);
        } 
        catch (IOException io) 
        {
            System.out.println(&quot;File I/O Error: &quot; + io);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;DefaultHandler&lt;/tt&gt;: As mentioned before, SAX is completely event-driven. Therefore, we need a handler that “listens” to the input stream coming from the input file (''cities.xml'' in this case). 

The SAX API provides interface classes, which we have to extend with our own code to read our own specific XML document. In order to include our code in the SAX API, we just have to extend the DefaultHandler interface with our own class and set the content handler to our custom handler class (which consists of three methods: startElement, endElement and characters)

The &lt;tt&gt;startElement()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;endElement()&lt;/tt&gt; methods: These methods are invoked whenever the SAX parser finds a start or end tag respectively. The SAX API provides blank stubs for both methods and we have to fill them with code of our own. 

In this case, we want our program to do something whenever the &lt;tt&gt;vacation&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is set, so we set a Boolean variable to true whenever we find such an element and process the node by printing out the character sequence in between the start and end tag. The &lt;tt&gt;character&lt;/tt&gt; method is automatically called whenever a &lt;tt&gt;startElement&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;endElement&lt;/tt&gt; event was triggered, but prints out the character string only if the &lt;tt&gt;onVacation&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is set.

== DOM (Document Object Model) ==

=== Description ===
The other popular approach is the tree-based model as represented by the DOM (document object model, see [http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR W3C Recommendation]). This method actually works similarly to a SAX parser, since it reads the XML document from an input stream by browsing through the file and recognizing XML structures. 

This time, instead of returning the content of the document in a series of small fragments, the DOM method maps the XML hierarchy to a DOM tree object that contains everything from the original XML document. Everything from elements, comments, textual information or processing instructions is stored in the tree object as nodes, starting with the document itself as the root node. 

Now that all the information we need is stored in memory, we access the data by using methods provided by the parser software to read or modify objects within the tree. This facilitates random access to the content of the XML document and provides the possibility to modify the data it contains or even create new XML files by transforming a DOM back to an XML document. 

=== Evaluation === 
However, the major downside of this approach is that it requires much more memory and is therefore not suitable for situations where large XML files are used. More importantly, it is somewhat more complex than the simplistic SAX method even for small and simple problems.

=== Example: ''MyDOMParser.java'' ===
In the following code sample, a list of cities with people on vacation is again created but this time with the tree-based approach:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
// import all necessary DOM API classes
import org.apache.xerces.parsers.*;
import org.apache.xerces.dom.*;
import org.w3c.dom.*;
public class MyDOMParser{
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(&quot;People on vacation in the following cities:&quot;);  
try {
// creates a DOM parser object
DOMParser parser = new DOMParser();
parser.parse(&quot;cities.xml&quot;); 

// stores the tree object in a variable
         org.w3c.dom.Document doc  = parser.getDocument();

// returns a list of all city elements in my city list
	 NodeList list = doc.getElementsByTagName(&quot;city&quot;);

// now, for every element in the city list, check if the
// &quot;vacation&quot; attribute is set and if yes, print out the   
// information about the vacationer.
for(int i = 0, length = list.getLength(); i &lt; length; i++){
Element city  = (Element)list.item(i);
Attr vacationer = city.getAttributeNode(&quot;vacation&quot;);
if(vacationer!= null){
String v = vacationer.getValue();
System.out.print(v + &quot; is vacationing in &quot;);

// grab information about city name and country
// directly from the DOM tree object
ParentNode cityname = (ParentNode)
doc.getElementsByTagName(&quot;cityName&quot;).item(0);
ParentNode country = (ParentNode)
doc.getElementsByTagName(&quot;cityCountry&quot;).item(0);
System.out.println(cityname.getTextContent() + &quot;, &quot; + country.getTextContent());
}
}
} catch (Exception e) {         
System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}     
}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;tt&gt;parser.getDocument()&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/u&gt; Once we parsed the XML document, the tree object is temporarily stored in the parser variable. In order to work with the DOM object, we have to create a variable holding it (of type  &lt;u&gt;&lt;tt&gt;org.w3c.dom.Document&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/u&gt;). 

Then, we create a &lt;u&gt;list of nodes holding all elements with the tag name &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;city&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. The parser finds these nodes by browsing through the DOM tree. Then, we just go through each one of the city-elements and check if the &lt;tt&gt;vacation&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is set and display all the information about the vacationer if so. 

Xerces provides a helpful method called &lt;u&gt;&lt;tt&gt;getTextContent()&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/u&gt; that lets us directly access the text node of an element node, avoiding all difficulties emerging from unneeded white space and the like.

= Summary = 

Choosing an API at the beginning of your XML project is a very important decision. Once you decide which one to use, it is easy to try different vendors without having much trouble, but switching to a different API will be a very time-consuming and costly process, since you will have to redesign your whole program code.

The SAX API is a widely accepted and well-working parser that is easy to implement and works especially well with streaming content (e.g. an online XML source). Because it is a read-only API, you would not be able to modify the underlying XML data source. Since it only reads one node at a time, it is very memory-efficient and fast. However, this implies that your application expects the information to be close together and ordered. 

If you want to randomly access the entire document at any point of time, then the DOM approach might be a better choice for you. The DOM API is more complex and harder to implement, but gives you full control over the whole document and lets you modify the data, also. However, it reads the whole XML document into memory, so the DOM API is not suitable for projects with very large XML files.

==Introduction==
==First order==

Any partial differential equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt; h_1  \frac {\partial u}{\partial x_1}
+ h_2 \frac {\partial u}{\partial x_2} \cdots +
h_n \frac {\partial u}{\partial x_n} = 
b&lt;/math&gt;
where ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;hellip; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''b'' are all functions of both ''u'' and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations.

To see how to do this, we will first consider some simpler problems.

===Special cases===
We will start with the simple PDE
:&lt;math&gt;u_z(x,y,z)=u(x,y,z) \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;
Because ''u'' is only differentiated with respect to ''z'', for any fixed ''x'' and ''y'' we can treat this like the ODE, ''du/dz=u''. The solution of that ODE is ''ce&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''c'' is the value of ''u'' when ''z=0'', ''for the fixed x and y''

Therefore, the solution of the PDE is
:&lt;math&gt;u(x, y, z)=u(x,y,0) e^z &lt;/math&gt;

Instead of just having a constant of integration, we have an arbitrary function. This will be true for any PDE.

Notice the shape of the solution, an arbitrary function of points in the ''xy'', plane, which is normal to the 'z' axis, and the solution of an ODE in the 'z' direction.

Now consider the slightly more complex PDE
:&lt;math&gt;a_x u_x +a_y u_y + a_z u_z=h(u) \quad (2)&lt;/math&gt;
where h can be any function, and each ''a'' is a real constant.

We recognize the left hand side as being '''a'''&amp;middot;'''&amp;nabla;''', so this equation says that the differential of ''u'' in the '''a''' direction is ''h(u)''. Comparing this with the first equation suggests that the solution can be written as an arbitrary function on the plane normal to '''a''' combined with the solution of an ODE.

Remembering from [[Calculus/Vectors]] that any vector '''r''' can be split up into components parallel and perpendicular to ''a'',
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}= \mathbf{r}_\perp + \mathbf{r}_\| =  \left( \mathbf{r}-\frac{(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{a})\mathbf{a}}{|\mathbf{a}|^2} \right) + \frac{(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{a})\mathbf{a}}{|\mathbf{a}|^2} &lt;/math&gt;
we will use this to split the components of '''r''' in a way suggested by the analogy with (1).

Let's write 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = (x,y,z) = \mathbf{r}_\perp + s\mathbf{a} \quad 
s =  \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
and substitute this into (2), using the chain rule. Because we are only differentiating in the '''a''' direction, adding any function of the perpendicular vector to ''s'' will make no difference.

First we calculate grad ''s'', for use in the chain rule,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla s = \frac{\mathbf{a}}{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

On making the substitution into (2), we get,
:&lt;math&gt;h(u)= \mathbf{a} \cdot \nabla s \frac{d}{ds} u(s)=
\frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}}{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a}} \frac{d}{ds} u(s)= \frac{du}{ds}&lt;/math&gt;
which is an ordinary differential equation with the solution
:&lt;math&gt;s=c(\mathbf{r}_\perp) + \int^u \frac{dt}{h(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

The constant ''c'' can depend on the perpendicular components, but not upon the parallel coordinate. Replacing ''s'' with a monotonic scalar function of ''s'' multiplies the ODE by a function of ''s'', which doesn't affect the solution.

''Example:''
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t)_x=u(x,t)_t&lt;/math&gt;

For this equation, '''a''' is (1, -1), ''s=x-t'', and the perpendicular vector is  (x+t)(1, 1). The reduced ODE is ''du/ds=0'' so the solution is
:u=f(x+t)

To find ''f'' we need initial conditions on ''u''. Are there any constraints on what initial conditions are suitable?

Consider, if we are given
* ''u''(''x'',0), this is exactly ''f''(''x''),
* ''u''(3''t'',''t''), this is ''f''(4''t'') and ''f''(''t'') follows immediately
* ''u''(''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+2''t'',''t''), this is ''f''(''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+3''t'') and ''f''(''t'') follows, on solving the cubic.
* ''u''(-''t'',''t''), then this is ''f''(0), so if the given function isn't constant we have a inconsistency, and if it is the solution isn't specified off the initial line.

Similarly, if we are given ''u'' on any curve which the lines ''x''+''t''=''c'' intersect only once, and to which they are not tangent, we can deduce ''f''.

For any first order PDE with constant coefficients, the same will be true. We will have a set of lines, parallel to ''r''='''a'''t, along which the solution is gained by integrating an ODE with initial conditions specified on some surface to which the lines aren't tangent.

If we look at how this works, we'll see we haven't actually used the constancy of '''a''', so let's drop that assumption and look for a similar solution.

The important point was that the solution was of the form ''u''=''f''(''x''(''s''),''y''(''s'')), where (''x''(''s''),''y''(''s'')) is the curve we integrated along -- a straight line in the previous case. We can add constant functions of integration to ''s'' without changing this form.

Consider a PDE,
:&lt;math&gt;a(x,y)u_x+b(x,y)u_y=c(x,y,u)&lt;/math&gt;
For the suggested solution, ''u''=''f''(''x''(''s''),''y''(''s'')), the chain rule gives
:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{du}{ds} = \frac{dx}{ds}u_x+ \frac{dy}{ds}u_y&lt;/math&gt;
Comparing coefficients then gives
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{ds}=a(x,y) \quad \frac{dy}{ds}=b(x,y) \quad \frac{du}{ds}=c(x,y,u) &lt;/math&gt;
so we've reduced our original PDE to a set of simultaneous ODE's. This procedure can be reversed.

The curves (''x''(''s''),''y''(''s'')) are called ''characteristics'' of the equation.

''Example:''
Solve &lt;math&gt;yu_x=xu_y&lt;/math&gt; given ''u''=''f''(''x'') for ''x''&amp;ge;0
The ODE's are
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{ds}=y \quad \frac{dy}{ds}=-x \quad \frac{du}{ds}=0 &lt;/math&gt;
subject to the initial conditions at ''s''=0,
:&lt;math&gt;x(0)=r \quad y(0)=0 \quad u(0)=f(r) \quad r \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
This ODE is easily solved, giving
:&lt;math&gt;x(s)=r \cos s \quad y(s)=r \sin s \quad u(s)=f(r)&lt;/math&gt;
so the characteristics are concentric circles round the origin, and in polar coordinates ''u''(''r'',''&amp;theta;'')=''f''(''r'')

Considering the logic of this method, we see that the independence of ''a'' and ''b'' from ''u'' has not been used either, so that assumption too can be dropped, giving the general method for equations of this ''quasilinear'' form.

===Quasilinear===
Summarising the conclusions of the last section, to solve a PDE
:&lt;math&gt; a_1(u,\mathbf{x})  \frac {\partial u}{\partial x_1}
+ a_2(u,\mathbf{x}) \frac {\partial u}{\partial x_2} \cdots +
a_n(u,\mathbf{x}) \frac {\partial u}{\partial x_n} = 
b(u,\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
subject to the initial condition that on the surface, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;), u=f(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;) --this being an arbitrary paremetrisation of the initial surface-- 

*we transform the equation to the  equivalent set of ODEs,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_1}{ds}=a_1 \ \ldots \ \frac{dx_n}{ds}=a_n \quad \frac{du}{ds}=b&lt;/math&gt;
:subject to the initial conditions
:&lt;math&gt;x_i(0)=f(r_1, \ldots ,r_{n-1}) \quad u=f(r_1,r_2, \ldots r_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
*Solve the ODE's, giving ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as a function of ''s'' and the ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. 
*Invert this to get  ''s'' and the ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as functions of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Substitute these inverse functions into the expression for ''u'' as a function of ''s'' and the ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; obtained in the second step.

Both the second and third steps may be troublesome.

The set of ODEs is generally non-linear and without analytical solution. It may even be easier to work with the PDE than with the ODEs.

In the third step, the ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; together with ''s'' form a coordinate system adapted for the PDE. We can only make the inversion at all if the Jacobian of the transformation to Cartesian coordinates is not zero,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial r_1}&amp;\cdots &amp;\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial r_{n-1}} &amp; a_1 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{\partial x_n}{\partial r_1}&amp;\cdots &amp;\frac{\partial x_n}{\partial r_{n-1}} &amp; a_n \end{vmatrix} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
This is equivalent to saying that the vector (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip:, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is never in the tangent plane to a surface of constant ''s''.

If this condition is not false when ''s''=0 it may become so as the equations are integrated. We will soon consider ways of dealing with the problems this can cause.

Even when it is technically possible to invert the algebraic equations it is obviously inconvenient to do so.

====Example====
To see how this works in practice, we will &lt;br&gt;
a/ consider the PDE,
:&lt;math&gt;uu_x+u_y+u_t=0&lt;/math&gt;
with generic initial condition,
:&lt;math&gt;u=f(x,y) \mbox{ on } t=0&lt;/math&gt;

Naming variables for future convenience, the corresponding ODE's are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{d\tau}=u \quad \frac{dy}{d\tau}=1 \quad \frac{dt}{d\tau}=1 \quad \frac{du}{d\tau}=0 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
subject to the initial conditions at &amp;tau;=0
:&lt;math&gt;x=r \quad y=s \quad t=0 \quad u=f(r,s)&lt;/math&gt;

These ODE's are easily solved to give
:&lt;math&gt;x=r+f(r,s)\tau \quad y=s+\tau \quad t=\tau \quad u=f(r,s)&lt;/math&gt;

These are the parametric equations of a set of straight lines, the characteristics.

The determinant of the Jacobian of this coordinate transformation is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} 
1+\tau\frac{\partial f}{\partial r} &amp; \tau\frac{\partial f}{\partial s} &amp; f \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}=1+\tau\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}&lt;/math&gt;

This determinant is 1 when ''t''=0, but if ''f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is anywhere negative this determinant will eventually be zero, and this solution fails.

In this case, the failure is because the surface &lt;math&gt;sf_r=-1&lt;/math&gt; is an envelope of the characteristics.

For arbitrary ''f'' we can invert the transformation and obtain an implicit expression for ''u''
:&lt;math&gt;u=f(x-tu,y-x)&lt;/math&gt;
If ''f'' is given this can be solved for ''u''.

1/ &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=ax&lt;/math&gt;, 
The implicit solution is 
:&lt;math&gt;u=a(x-tu) \Rightarrow u=\frac{ax}{1+at}&lt;/math&gt;
This is a line in the ''u-x'' plane, rotating clockwise as ''t'' increases.
If ''a'' is negative, this line eventually become vertical. If ''a'' is positive, this line tends towards ''u''=0, and the solution is valid for all ''t''.

2/ ''f''(''x'',''y'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
The implicit solution is 
:&lt;math&gt;u=(x-tu)^2  \Rightarrow u=\frac{1+2tx-\sqrt{1+4tx}}{2t^2}&lt;/math&gt;


This solution clearly fails when &lt;math&gt;1+4tx&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, which is just when &lt;math&gt;sf_r=-1&lt;/math&gt; . For any ''t''&gt;0 this happens somewhere. As ''t'' increases this point of failure moves toward the origin.

Notice that the point where ''u''=0 stays fixed. This is true for any solution of this equation, whatever ''f'' is. 

We will see later that we can find a solution after this time, if we consider discontinuous solutions. We can think of this as a shockwave.

3/ &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=\sin (xy)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The implicit solution is
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,y,t)=\sin \left( (x-tu)(y-x) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
and we can not solve this explitely for ''u''. The best we can manage is a numerical solution of this equation.

b/We can also consider the closely related PDE
:&lt;math&gt;uu_x+u_y+u_t=y&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding ODE's are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{d\tau}=u \quad \frac{dy}{d\tau}=1 \quad \frac{dz}{d\tau}=1 \quad \frac{du}{d\tau}=y \quad&lt;/math&gt;
subject to the initial conditions at &amp;tau;=0
:&lt;math&gt;x=r \quad y=s \quad t=0 \quad u=f(r,s)&lt;/math&gt;

These ODE's are easily solved to give
:&lt;math&gt;x=r+\tau f+\frac{1}{2}s\tau^2+\frac{1}{6}\tau^3 \quad 
y=s+\tau \quad t=\tau \quad u=f+s\tau+\frac{1}{2}\tau^2&lt;/math&gt;
Writing ''f'' in terms of ''u'', ''s'', and &amp;tau;, then substituting into the equation for ''x'' gives an implicit solution
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,y,t)=f(x-ut+\frac{1}{2}yt^2-\frac{1}{6}t^3,y-t)+yt-\frac{1}{2}t^2&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to solve this for ''u'' in some special cases, but in general we can only solve this equation numerically. However, we can learn much about the global properties of the solution from further analysis

====Characteristic initial value problems====

What if initial conditions are given on a characteristic, on an envelope of characteristics, on a surface with characteristic tangents at isolated points?

====Discontinuous solutions====

So far, we've only considered smooth solutions of the PDE, but this is too restrictive. We may encounter initial conditions which aren't smooth, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt;u_t = c u_x \quad u(x,0)= 
\left\{ \begin{matrix} 1, &amp; x \ge 0 \\ 0, &amp; x &lt; 0 \end{matrix} \right. 
&lt;/math&gt;

If we were to simply use the general solution of this equation for smooth initial conditions,

:&lt;math&gt; u(x,t) = u(x + ct, 0) \,&lt;/math&gt;

we would get

:&lt;math&gt; u(x,t) = 
\left\{ \begin{matrix} 1, &amp; x+ct \ge 0  \\ 0, &amp; x+ct &lt; 0 \end{matrix} \right. 
&lt;/math&gt;

which appears to be a solution to the original equation. However, since the partial differentials are undefined on the characteristic ''x''+''ct''=0, so it becomes unclear what it means to say that the equation is true at that point.

We need to investigate further, starting by considering the possible types of discontinuities.

If we look at the derivations above, we see we've never use any second or higher order derivatives so it doesn't matter if they aren't continuous, the results above will still apply.

The next simplest case is when the function is continuous, but the first derivative is not, e.g. |''x''|. We'll initially restrict ourselves to the two-dimensional case, ''u''(''x'', ''t'') for the generic equation.

:&lt;math&gt;a(x,t)u_x + b(x,t)u_t = c(u,x,t) \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Typically, the discontinuity is not confined to a single point, but is shared by all points on some curve, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''), ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') )

Then we have
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
x&gt;x_0 &amp; \lim_{x \rarr x_0} = u_+ \\
x&lt;x_0 &amp; \lim_{x \rarr x_0} = u_-
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; 

We can then compare ''u'' and its derivatives on both sides of this curve.

It will prove useful to name the ''jumps'' across the discontinuity. We say

:&lt;math&gt; [u]=u_+-u_- \quad [u_x]=u_{x+}-u_{x-} \quad  [u_t]=u_{t+}-u_{t-}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, since the equation (1) is true on both sides of the discontinuity, we can see that both ''u''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;, being the limits of solutions, must themselves satisfy the equation. That is, 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
a(x,t)u_{+x} + b(x,t)u_{+t} &amp; = &amp; c(u_+,x,t) \\
a(x,t)u_{-x} + b(x,t)u_{-t} &amp; = &amp; c(u_-,x,t)
\end{matrix} \mbox{  where  } 
\begin{matrix}x=x_0(s) \\ t=t_0(s)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting then gives us an equation for the jumps in the differentials

:&lt;math&gt;a(x,t)[u_x] + b(x,t)[u_t] =  0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

We are considering the case where ''u'' itself is continuous so we know that [''u'']=0. Differentiating this with respect to ''s'' will give us a second equation in the differential jumps.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx_0}{ds}[u_x] + \frac{dt_0}{ds}[u_t] =0 &lt;/math&gt;

The last two equations can only be both true if one is a multiple of the other, but multiplying ''s'' by a constant also multiplies the second equation by that same constant while leaving the curve of discontinuity unchanged, hence we can without loss of generality define ''s'' to be such that

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx_0}{ds}=a \quad  \frac{dt_0}{ds}=b &lt;/math&gt;

But these are the equations for a characteristic, i.e. '''discontinuities propagate along characteristics.''' We could use this property as an alternative definition of characteristics.

We can deal similarly with discontinuous functions by first writing the equation in ''conservation form'', so called because conservation laws can always be written this way.

:&lt;math&gt; (au)_x+(bu)_t=a_x u + b_t u +c \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the left hand side can be regarded as the divergence of (''au'', ''bu''). Writing the equation this way allows us to use the theorems of vector calculus.

Consider a narrow strip with sides parallel to the discontinuity and width ''h''
&lt;!-- could be improved --&gt;

We can integrate both sides of (1) over R, giving

:&lt;math&gt;\int_R (au)_x+(bu)_t \, dx dt = \int_R (a_x + b_t) u +c \, dx dt &lt;/math&gt; 

Next we use Green's theorem to convert the left hand side into a line integral.

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{\partial R} au dt - bu dx = \int_R (a_x  + b_t) u +c \, dx dt &lt;/math&gt;

Now we let the width of the strip fall to zero. The right hand side also tends to zero but the left hand side reduces to the difference between two integrals along the part of the boundary of ''R'' parallel to the curve.

:&lt;math&gt; \int au_+dt-bu_+dx - \int  au_-dt-bu_-dx =  0 &lt;/math&gt;

The integrals along the opposite sides of ''R'' have different signs because they are in opposite directions.

For the last equation to always be true, the integrand must always be zero, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt; \left( a \frac{dt_0}{ds} - b \frac{dx_0}{ds} \right) [u] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since, by assumption [''u''] isn't zero, the other factor must be, which immediately implies the curve of discontinuity is a characteristic.

Once again, ''discontinuities propagate along characteristics.''

Above, we only considered functions of two variables, but it is straightforward to extend this to functions of ''n'' variables.

The initial condition is given on an ''n''-1 dimensional surface, which evolves along the characteristics. Typical discontinuities in the initial condition will lie on a ''n''-2 dimensional surface embedded within the initial surface. This surface of discontinuity will propagate along the characteristics that pass through the initial discontinuity. &lt;!-- diagram needed --&gt;

The jumps themselves obey ordinary differential equations, much as ''u'' itself does on a characteristic. In the two dimensional case, for ''u'' continuous but not smooth, a little algebra shows that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d[u_x]}{ds}=[u_x]\left( \frac{\partial c}{\partial u} + a\frac{b_x}{b}-a_x \right) &lt;/math&gt;

while ''u'' obeys the same equation as before,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du}{ds}=c &lt;/math&gt;

We can integrate these equations to see how the discontinuity evolves as we move along the characteristic.

We may find that,  for some future ''s'', [''u''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;] passes through zero. At such points, the discontinuity has vanished, and we can treat the function as smooth at that characteristic from then on.

Conversely, we can expect that smooth functions may, under the righr circumstances, become discontinuous.

To see how all this works in practice we'll consider the solutions of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;u_t+uu_x=0 \quad u(x,0)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for three different initial conditions.

The general solution, using the techniques outlined earlier, is

:&lt;math&gt; u=f(x-tu) \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

''u'' is constant on the characteristics, which are straight lines with slope dependent on ''u''.

First consider ''f'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; f(x)= \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
1 &amp; x&gt;a \\ \frac{x}{a} &amp; a \ge x &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; x \le 0 \end{matrix} \right.
\quad a&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;

While ''u'' is continuous its derivative is discontinuous at ''x''=0, where ''u''=0, and at ''x''=a, where ''u''=1. The characteristics through these points divide the solution into three regions.

All the characteristics to the right of the characteristic through ''x''=a, ''t''=0 intersect the ''x''-axis to the right of ''x''=1, where ''u''=1 so ''u'' is 1 on all those characteristics, i.e whenever ''x''-''t''&gt;a.

Similarly the characteristic through the origin is the line ''x''=0, to the left of which ''u'' remains zero. 

We could find the value of ''u'' at a point in between those two characteristics either by finding which intermediate characteristic it lies on and tracing it back to the initial line, or via the general solution.

Either way, we get

:&lt;math&gt; f(x)= \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
1 &amp; x-t&gt;a \\ \frac{x}{a+t} &amp; a+t \ge x &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; x \le 0 \end{matrix} \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

At larger ''t'' the solution ''u'' is more spread out than at ''t''=0 but still the same shape.

We can also consider what happens when ''a'' tends to 0, so that ''u'' itself is discontinuous at ''x''=0.

If we write the PDE in conservation form then use Green's theorem, as we did above for the linear case, we get

:&lt;math&gt;[u]\frac{dx_0}{ds}=\frac{1}{2}[u^2]\frac{dt_0}{ds}&lt;/math&gt;

[''u''&amp;sup2;] is the difference of two squares, so if we take ''s=t'' we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_0}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}(u_-+u_+)&lt;/math&gt;

In this case the discontinuity behaves as if the value of ''u'' on it were the average of the limiting values on either side.

However, there is a caveat.

Since the limiting value to the left is ''u''&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt; the discontinuity must lie on that characteristic, and similarly for ''u''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;; i.e ''the jump discontinuity must be on an intersection of characteristics'', at a point where ''u'' would otherwise be multivalued.

For this PDE the characteristic can only intersect on the discontinuity if 

:&lt;math&gt;u_- &gt; u_+ \, &lt;/math&gt;

If this is not true the discontinuity can not propagate. Something else must happen.

The limit ''a''=0 is an example of a jump discontinuity for which this condition is false, so we can see what happens in such cases by studying it.

Taking the limit of the solution derived above gives

:&lt;math&gt; f(x)= \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
1 &amp; x&gt;t \\ \frac{x}{t} &amp; t \ge x &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; x \le 0 \end{matrix} \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

If we had taken the limit of any other sequence of initials conditions tending to the same limit we would have obtained a trivially equivalent result.

Looking at the characteristics of this solution, we see that at the jump discontinuity characteristics on which ''u'' takes every value betweeen 0 and 1 all intersect.

At later times, there are two slope discontinuities, at ''x''=0 and ''x''=''t'', but no jump discontinuity.

This behaviour is typical in such cases. The jump discontinuity becomes a pair of slope discontinuities between which the solution takes all appropriate values.

Now, lets consider the same equation with the initial condition

:&lt;math&gt; f(x)= \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
1 &amp; x \le 0 \\ 1-\frac{x}{a} &amp; a \ge x &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; x &gt; a \end{matrix} \right.
\quad a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

This has slope discontinuities at ''x''=0  and ''x''=a, dividing the solution into three regions.

The boundaries between these regions are given by the characteristics through these initial points, namely the two lines

:&lt;math&gt; x=t \quad x=a &lt;/math&gt;

These characteristics intersect at ''t''=a, so the nature of the solution must change then.

In between these two discontinuities, the characteristic through ''x''=''b'' at ''t''=0 is clearly

:&lt;math&gt; x=\left( 1- \frac{b}{a} \right) t + b \quad 0 \le b \le a &lt;/math&gt;

All these characteristics intersect at the same point, (''x'',''t'')=(''a'',''a'').

We can use these characteristics, or the general solution, to write ''u'' for ''t''&lt;''a''

:&lt;math&gt; u(x,t)= \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
1 &amp; x \le t \\ \frac{a-x}{a-t} &amp; a \ge x &gt; t \\ 0 &amp; x &gt; a \end{matrix} \right.
\quad a &gt;t \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

As ''t'' tends to ''a'', this becomes a step function. Since ''u'' is greater to the left than the right of the discontinuity, it meets the condition for propagation deduced above, so for ''t''&gt;''a'' ''u'' is a step function moving at the average speed of the two sides.

:&lt;math&gt; u(x,t)= \left\{ \begin{matrix}
1 &amp; x \le \frac{a+t}{2} \\ 0 &amp; x &gt; \frac{a+t}{2} \end{matrix} \right.
\quad t \ge a \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This is the reverse of what we saw for the initial condition previously considered, two slope discontinuities merging into a step discontinuity rather than vice versa. Which actually happens depends entirely on the initial conditions. Indeed, examples could be given for which both processes happen.

In the two examples above, we started with a discontinuity and investigated how it evolved. It is also possible for solutions which are initially smooth to become discontinuous.

For example, we saw earlier for this particular PDE that the solution with the initial condition ''u''=''x''&amp;sup2; breaks down when 2''xt''+1=0. At these points the solution becomes discontinuous.

&lt;!--Need an example of this where the algebra is clear enough after the break time. May take a little finding --&gt;

Typically, discontinuities in the solution of any partial differential equation, not merely ones of first order, arise when solutions break down in this way and propagate similarly, merging and splitting in the same fashion.

===Fully non-linear PDEs===

It is possible to extend the approach of the previous sections to reduce any equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1,x_2, \ldots ,x_n,u,u_{x_1},u_{x_2}, \ldots , u_{x_n})=0&lt;/math&gt;
to a set of ODE's, for ''any'' function, ''F''.

We will not prove this here, but the corresponding ODE's are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_i}{d\tau}=\frac{\partial F}{\partial u_i} \quad \frac{du_i}{d\tau} = -\left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial x_i} + 
u_i \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} \right) \quad
\frac{du}{d\tau}=\sum_{i=1}^n u_i \frac{\partial F}{\partial u_i} &lt;/math&gt;

If ''u'' is given on a surface parameterized by ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;hellip;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; then we have, as before, ''n'' initial conditions on the ''n'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau=0 \quad x_i=f_i(r_1,r_2, \ldots ,r_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
given by the parameterization and ''one'' initial condition on ''u'' itself,
:&lt;math&gt;\tau=0 \quad u=f(r_1,r_2, \ldots ,r_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
but, because we have an extra ''n'' ODEs for the ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s, we need an extra ''n'' initial conditions.

These are, ''n''-1 consistency conditions,
:&lt;math&gt;\tau=0 \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial r_i}=
\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} u_i \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial r_j}&lt;/math&gt;
which state that the ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s are the partial derivatives of ''u'' on the initial surface, and ''one'' initial condition
:&lt;math&gt;\tau=0 \quad F(x_1,x_2, \ldots ,x_n,u,u_1,u_2, \ldots , u_n)=0&lt;/math&gt;
stating that the PDE itself holds on the initial surface.

These ''n'' initial conditions for the ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; will be a set of algebraic equations, which may have multiple solutions. Each solution will give a different solution of the PDE.

====Example====

Consider
:&lt;math&gt;u_t=u_x^2+u_y^2, \quad u(x,y,0)=x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt;

The initial conditions at &amp;tau;=0 are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} x=r &amp; y=s &amp; t=0 &amp; u=r^2+s^2 \\
u_x=2r &amp; u_y=2s &amp; u_t=4(r^2+s^2) &amp; \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and the ODE's are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
\frac{dx}{d\tau}=-2u_x &amp; \frac{dy}{d\tau}=-2u_y &amp; \frac{dt}{d\tau}=1 
&amp; \frac{du}{d\tau}=u_t-2(u_x^2+u_y^2)\\
\frac{du_x}{d\tau}=0 &amp; \frac{du_y}{d\tau}=0 &amp; \frac{du_t}{d\tau}=0 &amp;  \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the partial derivatives are constant on the characteristics. This always happen when the PDE contains only partial derivatives, simplifying the procedure.

These equations are readily solved to give
:&lt;math&gt;x=r(1-4\tau ) \quad y=s(1-4\tau ) \quad t=\tau \quad u=(r^2+s^2)(1-4\tau )&lt;/math&gt;

On eliminating the parameters we get the solution,
:&lt;math&gt;u=\frac{x^2+y^2}{1-4t}&lt;/math&gt;
which can easily be checked. abc

==Second order==

Suppose we are given a second order linear PDE to solve

&lt;math&gt;a(x,y)u_{xx}+b(x,y)u_{xy}+c(x,y)u_{yy} =  d(x,y)u_x+e(x,y)u_y +p(x,y)u +q(x,y) \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

The natural approach, after our experience with ordinary differential equations and with simple algebraic equations, is attempt a factorisation. Let's see how for this takes us.

We would expect factoring the left hand of (1) to give us an equivalent equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt; a(x,y)(D_x+\alpha_+(x,y)D_y)(D_x+\alpha_-(x,y)D_y)u \, &lt;/math&gt;

and we can immediately divide through by ''a''. This suggests that those particular combinations of first order derivatives will play a special role.

Now, when studying first order PDE's we saw that such combinations were equivalent to the derivatives along characteristic curves. Effectively, we changed to a coordinate system defined by the characteristic curve and the initial curve.

Here, we have two combinations of first order derivatives each of which may define a different characteristic curve. If so, the two sets of characteristics will define a natural coordinate system for the problem, much as in the first order case.

In the new coordinates we will have

:&lt;math&gt; D_x+\alpha_+(x,y)D_y=D_r \quad D_x+\alpha_-(x,y)D_y =D_s &lt;/math&gt;

with each of the factors having become a differentiation along its respective characteristic curve, and the left hand side will become simply ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''rs''&lt;/sub&gt; giving us an equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;u_{rs}=A(r,s)u_r+B(r,s)u_s+C(r,s)u+D(r,s) \, &lt;/math&gt;

If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' all happen to be zero, the solution is obvious. If not, we can hope that the simpler form of the left hand side will enable us to make progress.

However, before we can do all this, we must see if (1) can actually be factored.

Multiplying out the factors gives

&lt;math&gt;u_{xx}+\frac{b(x,y)}{a(x,y)}u_{xy}+\frac{c(x,y)}{a(x,y)}u_{yy}= u_{xx}+(\alpha_++\alpha_-)u_{xy}+\alpha_+\alpha_-u_{yy}&lt;/math&gt;

On comparing coefficients, and solving for the &amp;alpha;'s we see that they are the roots of

:&lt;math&gt;a(x,y)\alpha^2+b(x,y)\alpha+c(x,y)=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since we are discussing real functions, we are only interested in real roots, so the existence of the desired factorization will depend on the discriminant of this quadratic equation.

*&lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }  b(x,y)^2 &gt; 4 a(x,y)c(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;
:then we have two factors, and can follow the procedure outlined above. Equations like this are called ''hyperbolic''

*&lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }  b(x,y)^2 = 4 a(x,y)c(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;
:then we have only factor, giving us a single characteristic curve. It will be natural to use distance along these curves as one coordinate, but the second must be determined by other considerations. 
:The same line of argument as before  shows that use the characteristic curve this way gives a second order term of the form ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''rr''&lt;/sub&gt;, where we've only taken the second derivative with respect to one of the two coordinates. Equations like this are called ''parabolic''

*&lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }  b(x,y)^2 &lt; 4 a(x,y)c(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;
:then we have no real factors. In this case the best we can do is reduce the second order terms to the simplest possible form satisfying this inequality, i.e ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''rr''&lt;/sub&gt;+''u''&lt;sub&gt;''ss''&lt;/sub&gt;
:It can be shown that this reduction is always possible. Equations like this are called ''elliptic''

It can be shown that, just as for first order PDEs, discontinuities propagate along characteristics. Since elliptic equations have no real characteristics, this implies that any discontinuities they may have will be restricted to isolated points; i.e., that the solution is almost everywhere smooth.

This is not true for hyperbolic equations. Their behavior is largely controlled by the shape of their characteristic curves.

These differences mean different methods are required to study the three types of second equation. Fortunately, changing variables as indicated by the factorisation above lets us reduce any second order PDE to one in which the coefficients of the second order terms are constant, which means it is sufficient to consider only three standard equations. 

:&lt;math&gt;u_{xx}+u_{yy}=0 \quad u_{xx}-u_{yy}=0 \quad u_{xx}-u_y=0 &lt;/math&gt;

We could also consider the cases where the right hand side of these equations is a given function, or proportional to ''u'' or to one of its first order derivatives, but all the essential properties of hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic equations are demonstrated by these three standard forms.  

While we've only demonstrated the reduction in two dimensions, a similar reduction applies in higher dimensions, leading to a similar classification. We get, as the reduced form of the second order terms,

:&lt;math&gt;a_1\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1^2}+ 
a_2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_2^2} + \cdots + 
a_n\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_n^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where each of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s is equal to either 0, +1, or -1.

If ''all'' the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s have the ''same sign'' the equation is ''elliptic''

If ''any'' of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s are ''zero'' the equation is ''parabolic''

If ''exactly one'' of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s has the  ''opposite sign'' to the rest the equation is ''hyperbolic''

In 2 or 3 dimensions these are the only possibilities, but in 4 or more dimensions there is a fourth possibility: ''at least two'' of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s are ''positive'', and ''at least two'' of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;s are ''negative''. 

Such equations are called ''ultrahyperbolic''. They are less commonly encountered than the other three types, so will not be studied here.

When the coefficients are not constant, an equation can be hyperbolic in some regions of the ''xy'' plane, and elliptic in others. If so, different methods must be used for the solutions in the two regions.

===Parabolic===

The canonical parabolic equation is the diffusion equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 h=h_t&lt;/math&gt;

Here, we will consider some simple solutions of the one-dimensional case.

The properties of this equation are in many respects intermediate between those of hyperbolic and elliptic equation.

As with hyperbolic equations but not elliptic, the solution is well behaved if the value is given on the initial surface ''t''=0.

However, the characteristic surfaces of this equation are the surfaces of constant ''t'', thus there is no way for discontinuities to propagate to positive t.

Therefore, as with elliptic equations but not hyberbolic, the solutions are typically smooth, even when the initial conditions aren't.

Furthermore, at a local maximum of ''h'', its Laplacian is negative, so ''h'' is decreasing with ''t'', while at local minima, where the Laplacian will be positive, ''h'' will increase with ''t''. Thus, initial variations in ''h'' will be smoothed out as ''t'' increases.

In one dimension, we can learn more by integrating both sides,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int_{-a}^b h_t dt &amp; = &amp; \int_{-a}^b h_{xx} dx \\
\frac{d}{dt} \int_{-a}^b h \,dt &amp; = &amp; \left[ h_x \right]_{-a}^b
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Provided that ''h&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' tends to zero for large ''x'', we can take the limit as ''a'' and ''b'' tend to infinity, deducing

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \int_{-\infty}^\infty h \,dt&lt;/math&gt;

so the integral of ''h'' over all space is constant.

This means this PDE can be thought of as describing some conserved quantity, initially concentrated but spreading out, or diffusing, over time.

This last result can be extended to two or more dimensions, using the theorems of vector calculus. 

We can also differentiate any solution with respect to any coordinate to obtain another solution. E.g. if ''h'' is a solution then

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 h_x = \partial_x \nabla^2 h = \partial_x \partial_t h 
=\partial_t h_x &lt;/math&gt;

so ''h&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' also satisfies the diffusion equation.

====Similarity solution====

Looking at this equation, we might notice that if we make the change of variables

:&lt;math&gt; r = \alpha x \quad \tau =\alpha^2 t &lt;/math&gt;

then the equation retains the same form. This suggests that the combination of variables ''x''&amp;sup2;/''t'', which is unaffected by this variable change, may be significant.

We therefore assume this equation to have a solution of the special form

:&lt;math&gt;h(x,t)=f(\eta) \mbox{ where } \eta = \frac{x}{t^{1 \over 2}} &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;h_x = \eta_x f_{\eta} = t^{-{1\over 2}}f_{\eta} \quad
h_t = \eta_t f_{\eta} = -\frac{\eta}{2t}f_{\eta} &lt;/math&gt;

and substituting into the diffusion equation eventually gives

:&lt;math&gt; f_{\eta \eta} + \frac{\eta}{2} f_{\eta}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

which is an ordinary differential equation.

Integrating once gives

:&lt;math&gt;f_{\eta} = A e^{-\frac{\eta^2}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;

Reverting to ''h'', we find

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
h_x &amp; = &amp; \frac{A}{\sqrt{t}} e^{-\frac{\eta^2}{4}} \\
h &amp; = &amp; \frac{A}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{-\infty }^x e^{-s^2/4t} ds +B \\ 
&amp; = &amp; A \int_{-\infty }^{x/2\sqrt{t}} e^{-z^2} dz +B
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This last integral can not be written in terms of elementary functions, but its values are well known. 

In particular the limiting values  of ''h'' at infinity are

:&lt;math&gt;h(-\infty ,t)=B \quad h(\infty ,t)= B + A \sqrt{\pi } ,&lt;/math&gt;

taking the limit as ''t'' tends to zero gives

:&lt;math&gt;h= \left\{ \begin{matrix}
B &amp; x&lt;0 \\ B + A \sqrt{\pi } &amp; x&gt;0 \end{matrix} \right. &lt;/math&gt;


We see that the initial discontinuity is immediately smoothed out. The solution at later times retains the same shape, but is more stretched out.

The derivative of this solution with respect to ''x''

:&lt;math&gt;h_x  =  \frac{A}{\sqrt{t}} e^{-x^2/4t}&lt;/math&gt;

is itself a solution, with ''h'' spreading out from its initial peak, and plays a significant role in the further analysis of this equation.

The same similarity method can also be applied to some non-linear equations.

====Separating variables====

We can also obtain some solutions of this equation by separating variables.

:&lt;math&gt;h(x,t)=X(x)T(t) \Rightarrow X^{\prime \prime}T=X\dot{T} &lt;/math&gt;

giving us the two ordinary differential equations

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2X}{dx^2}+k^2 X=0 \quad \frac{dT}{dt} = -k T &lt;/math&gt;

and solutions of the general form

:&lt;math&gt; h(x,t)= A e^{-kt} \sin (kx+\alpha) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Working in the IT field I come across an unimaginable amount of data on a regular basis in just dealing with day-to-day issues.  ''Any'' task is like that these days - and especially to someone who knows nothing of the task until it's presented.

The main thing to remember here is organization.  The method you use to organize the data is not important - only that you stick to it for the most part.  If something doesn't fit then you either change the item you're having a problem with...or you change your system of organization.

Ever watch a flock of birds?  One thing you'll notice is that if you try to focus on all the birds at once you'll most likely get confused.  If you focus on, say, one bird out of the flock, then you've mentally organized that one bird out of the flock.  Guess what...if you keep adding birds out of the flock until you've looked at them all then you've ''organized'' the flock in your mind.  Information in the day-to-day world is no different.

Breaking down information into chunks you can deal with is absolutely vital to understanding and remembering.  After all, without training you couldn't recall a whole book from memory, right?  But you could recall important parts of it. Eventually, if you keep adding to those parts then you would at some point recall the entire book. In another context, this techique has been known for roughly two millenia. Remember the Latin phrase ''divide et impera'' ([[w:Divide and rule|divide and rule]])?

Now, how this relates to sifting is most of the time pretty simple.  Organize the data, but focus on the stuff you want.  For instance if you want to observe only the red birds in the flock then focus on the color red.  Sounds pretty easy right?  Well...yes and no.

When dealing with large amounts of data you have to do a little estimation of chance up front.

What's that mean?  Let's say your family bakes a pie with a ring in it for the holiday.  Whoever gets the ring wins a prize.  You really want that prize so you focus on the ring.  Thus you ask some questions of yourself:

''Does the ring have any special properties I can use to identify it?''

''Does the ring affect the piece of pie it's in in any way?''

''Is there anywhere in the pie I ''know'' the ring is not located?''

Suppose the ring is copper and turns the pie green.  Then you know that any piece of pie that is the normal color is less likely to have the ring in it.

That narrows your focus by a certain amount.

Suppose the ring is also pretty big, so the pie bulges where the ring is.  Then you know that any flat piece of pie will not have the ring in it.

That narrows your focus again.

You keep going with this method until you've found the ring.

Some things that help this process:

''Learning to speed-read.  There are plenty of courses out there for this.''

''Good language skills for the materials you're searching.''

''Frequent breaks.  Spending too much time sifting often blurs your focus.''

Focus on one thing at a time.  You get more done that way.  Remember, sunlight spread out only warms things up, but sunlight focused on one place with a magnifying glass can burn holes in things.  

Know what you want.  Know what you are looking for.  If you don't know, how will you know if you find it?  

Delegate.   Get people to help you.  Parallel searching is helpful, as long as you make sure they know what they are looking for.  


It's horribly cliche, but big mountains are just piles of pebbles stacked on top of each other.  Information is the same...

      <text xml:space="preserve">Obviously this doesn't work as I want :/   Instead of removing the [[II Speed Reading]] page and cut-and-paste the text to this page, I would like to import the text from the speed reading page to this page. Why? Alfred Korzybski coined the phrase &quot;The map is not the territory&quot; and anyone familiar with maps know that there are different kinds of maps concentrating on different aspects of the same territory. As this is a modern book I would like to have different maps (Table of contents) to the same territory (text). At the same time, I don't want redundancy. Therefore it would be nice if I could &quot;import&quot; text from other wiki pages. --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 12:45, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Moving is not what I want. Transclusion is precisly what I'm looking for. Another idea might be to make the whole book one page. The manual of style says &quot;Try and keep everything in one block because its easier to edit and read&quot;. I don't really understand what they mean. Of course, having the whole book in one page isn't compatible with the idea of sveral simulatenous organizations of the book. --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 22:46, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: Transclusion: You put your text-to-transclude at [[MediaWiki:Whatever]]. You insert it with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:Whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or you can ''substitute'' it in with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What maths should we cover, you ask? -- Ultimately, I'd say, we'd like to cover every topic at every level, but that's a task that needs taking in small steps.

I suggest assigning each book to an ability range- under 12, 12-16, 16-1st year undergrad, undergrad, postgrad, postdoc (allowing for differing syllabuses)- the higher levels having more, but more narrowly focused, books. If any of the current books cover too wide a range, split them up.

Then in each book we can say 'you ''must'' know this first,' and 'This book stops here.' which I've been doing a bit. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 20:08, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Sounds like a very good suggestion.  Also sounds like it would take a lot of guts for a single person to try to do it :).  This WikiBook site is fascinating to me, I want to help as much as I can - keep contributing everyone!

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Paul. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Paul~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">As far as I can see, this page describes RTL (Resistor-Transistor Logic) and not TTL. There is also DTL (Diode-transistor logic). DTL superceeded RTL and was in turn superceeded by TTL. TTL if I recall correctly was developed at least partly as a requirement of the Apollo moon program of the 1960s.

TTL as the name implies has 2 (at least) transistors in each gate. Key is the input transistor which often has multiple emitters. The emitters are free and used as the inputs for the gates. The base is connected via a resistor to +Vcc. Pulling down any of the emmiters will result in the collector of the input transistor being pulled down, which further transistors will pass to the output (perhaps with inversion to change functionality).

== Errors ==

There are lots of things wrong here. It is RTL logic not TTL. The explanation of how current 'chooses' the path of least resistance is wrong. The battery in the diagrams is connected backwards. The base of the transistor is left floating instead of being either high or low voltage.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm English, with a Degree in Electronics and a PhD in Laser Physics (sounds good !). Got my first chemistry set at age 8 and bought my first electronics magazine at 12 (1971 before they became popular). After working for quite a few years with Optoelectronics and Optical Fibres, I have spent the last 10 years (since 1993) working in the Internet and Telco business. I spent 5 years working in Munich and speak German.</text>

== Characteristics &amp; influences ==

New Zealand cuisine is characterised by its freshness and diversity. Diversity is owed to its relative youth, in world terms, which brings a willingness to experiment with food. Freshness is owed to its surrounding ocean and fertile lands. Its distinctiveness is more in the way New Zealanders eat - generally preferring as relaxed and unaffected as possible.

New Zealand’s cuisine has been described as Pacific Rim, drawing inspiration from Europe, Asia, Polynesia and its indigenous people, the Maori. For dishes that have a distinctly New Zealand style, there’s [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] and [[Cookbook:Venison|cervena]] (venison), [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]], [[Cookbook:Lobster|crayfish]] (lobster), Bluff oysters, paua (abalone), [[Cookbook:Mussel|mussels]], [[Cookbook:Scallop|scallops]], pipis and tuatua (both are types of New Zealand shellfish); [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|kumara]] (sweet potato); [[Cookbook:Kiwifruit|kiwifruit]], [[Cookbook:Tamarillo|tamarillo]] and [[Cookbook:Feijoa|feijoa]]; and [[Cookbook:Pavlova|pavlova]], the national dessert.

Perhaps even better known than New Zealand lamb, mussels and other foods are the country’s wines. There are 10 major wine-producing areas in New Zealand, with Marlborough famed for its sauvignon blanc, Gisborne for its chardonnay, and Central Otago and Martinborough building a reputation for pinot noir and pinot gris. Hawke’s Bay is known for its bold cabernets and Auckland’s Waiheke Island is home to one of the top 20 cabernet blends in the world. Marlborough and Hawke's Bay are New Zealand’s two premium wine-growing regions.

== Casual Kiwi cuisine ==

The New Zealand summer sees many eat outdoors, often in a [[Cookbook:Barbecue|barbecue]] setting. Kiwi barbecues - featuring New Zealand beef, lamb and [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] - are a big part of the culture, and typify the laid-back nature of the New Zealand people.

A Maori specialty is the hangi (pronounced hung-ee), a pit in which meats or fish are cooked with vegetables. A deep hole is dug in the ground, lined with red-hot stones and covered with vegetation. The food is then placed on top. The whole oven is sprinkled with water and sealed with more vegetation. The hole is then filled with earth and left to steam for several hours. Traditionally, men dig and prepare the hole, and women prepare the food to go in it. All members of an extended family (whanau) help out for such a feast. The occasion is relaxed, friendly and fun, with people often eating the meal under a marquee.

New Zealand cuisine experience is incomplete without enjoying traditional [[Cookbook:Fish_and_Chips|fish and chips]] served wrapped in paper.

New Zealand dishes include:

*[[Cookbook:Fish_and_Chips|Fish and Chips]]
*[[Cookbook:Colonial_Goose|Colonial Goose]] (a surprisingly effective preparation of roast leg of lamb)

Desserts:

*[[Cookbook:Pavlova|Pavlova]] (a light and fluffy meringue dessert named after the ballet dancer, Anna Pavlova)
*[[Cookbook:Lamington|Lamingtons]] (a type of sponge cake (or more traditionally, butter cake) squares, coated in a layer of chocolate icing or strawberry jam, then desiccated coconut)
*[[Cookbook:Anzac_Biscuits|Anzac biscuits]]

==Kiwi barbecues==
To my mind, this involves cooking small fuzzy fruits. I hear that &quot;kiwi&quot; can also mean a human from New Zealand or an endangered bird. Uh, the bird sounds tasty, but... [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:38, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

== The Picture ==

Couldn't we take the Vegemite picture down and replace it with a Marmite one? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:222.154.5.87|222.154.5.87]] ([[User talk:222.154.5.87|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/222.154.5.87|contribs]]) 2007-01-07T14:53:33.&lt;/small&gt;

:G'day, I couldn't find any Kiwi Marmite photos in Commons, so I replaced the Vegemite with a photo of the big L&amp;P bottle at Paeroa. I miss that stuff :( [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">why has everything got &quot;CookBook&quot; in front of it?

:To answer [[User:Christiaan|Christiaan]]'s question above, we use the &quot;Cookbook:&quot; prefix to avoid possible nameing conflicts.  While many pages in the cookbook have unique names without the prefix, some would not.  For example, the cookbook module on salt, at [[Cookbook:Salt]], should have different information than [[Salt (general chemistry)]], if it's there yet (I don't really know what naming convention they're using over there), while our module on [[Cookbook:Oyster|oyster]]s is very different than what you'd expect to find in [[Marine Biology:Oyster]] (which doesn't exist, but might one day).

== Education ==

The teaching of first aid is in itself a valuable safety measure.  Educating even a few people in first aid improves the safety of everyone they come into contact with.

Teaching first aid also provides an opportunity for teaching safety, prevention and risk reduction measures at the same time, as part of the first aid curriculum.

A person trained in first aid is more motivated to avoid personal injury, because their first aid training gives them a greater appreciation of the potential serious consequences.

Last but not least, someone trained in first aid can be taught to appreciate the importance of safety, prevention and risk reduction.  This makes them an ideal advocate for spreading safety awareness to others in their organization or family.  This &quot;peer to peer&quot; education can be very valuable.

CHINESE CHARACTER PINXXIEE METHOD

* Introduction
* What is PX or Modernized Internet-Chinese Script
* The PX Rules

Introduction:

Chinese Character Pinxxiee Method is based on the Chinese Language Pinyin Scheme, the official Chinese phonetic standard, as promulgated and published by China and recognized by the United Nations.                                                                            

What is PX or Modernized Internet-Chinese script?

If the user wishes to learn the complete Pinxxiee language input method, Chinese Computer Communication, Inc. has a DOS version of PX 2001 Tutor#, which serves as a Chinese word processor and also instructs the user how to input Chinese characters using the complete Pinxxiee language technology.

Pinxxiee language technology (Æ´Ð´ÓïÑÔ¼¼Êõ) has advanced to the point that it will complement the other input methods (ÊäÈë•½•¨)), popular on the market, such as Cangjie Code (²Öò¡), Wubizi Code (Îå ±Ê×Ö), Pinyin (Æ´Òô) or Zhuyin (×¢Òô) spellings, and can also facilitate the use of telegraphic code (µç±¨ Âë), Three-corner Code (Èý½Ç), Four-corner Code (ËÄ½Ç), or Simple Stroke (±Ê»­) or other graphic-phonetic (ÐÎÉù) hybrid methods, with or without AI or abbreviations, for speedy Chinese word-processing . However, in the long run, speed of input should not be the only criterion of economy. We need to consider the meaning of the input language in word-processing and writing manuscripts for the users’ true productivity and creativity.

The meaning of an input language is highly significant for the average Chinese user, as it is for the ordinary English user of the typewriter or word processor. Stenography and shorthand are high-speed tools of English language specialists, but ordinary writers of English do not learn stenography or shorthand to do typing or word-processing. In fact, ordinary writers need a meaningful language to learn, to read, and to type. What’s typed should be readable and memorable. There are hundreds of Chinese input methods but they are mostly not readable or easily memorable by the average person. Hence, the need for this Pinyin+Pinxxiee Computer-Chinese language.

In brief, Pinxxiee language is Computer-Chinese, electronic Chinese, or e-Chinese for the Internet. Its time has come. It is the linear transformation of the square Chinese character in the computer of Information Age. Pinxxiee Æ´Ð´ integrates, explains, and aids the other input methods in their functions as speed tools, just like the English language must be the foundation of English shorthand, stenography or abbreviations.

And similarly, Pinxxiee completely solves the Chinese homophone problem and also serves as a computer-compatible language. As with any languages, you, of course, have to learn it. On the average, it takes 15 hours to learn Pinxxiee, if you are familiar with Pinyin and Chinese characters. Furthermore, the user can learn Pinyin+ Pinxxiee language with PX 2001 Tutor, independently. Now, let’s learn step 1: Pinyin+Tones, so that we can apply Pinyin+Tones to Chinese input for Palm-size personal computers, effectively and efficiently.

The CAIS’99 Dictionaries within the Manual serves you as a standard for Chinese and Pinyin+ spellings of Chinese characters. Pinyin+ gives you faster and more efficient graphic input tools with a future. And this CAIS’99 Dictionaries helps you now with proper spelling and writing of any lanugage as the PX 2001 Tutor will give you a glimpse into the bright future of Chinese/English and bilingual word-processing and multilingual data management.

The PX Rules

1. The Pinyin Rule: Use the Pinyin syllable as the phonetic base. Xinhhua ZiidiaannÑ [New China Dictionary] serves as this Manual’s standard reference for Pinyin syllabary, character fonts and stroke counts.

2. The Pinyin+Tone Rule: Replace the Pinyin diacritic tone marks with tonal letters, according to a linguistic consonant-vowel principle: that is, repeat a consonant (to raise the tone) or repeat a vowel (to lower the tone). For example:

1st tone: ma = £í ¨¡= ma (Âè )

2nd tone: mma = £í ¨¢= mma (Âé )

3rd tone: mmaa= £í ¨£= mmaa (Âí )

4th tone: maa = £í ¨¤= maa ( Âî ) so that,

1st tone: The Pinyin spelling base remains unchanged. Remove the level tone mark from the principal vowel (¨¡), but add no letters. e.g., ma (Âè ), ba, ci, de, er, etc.

2nd tone: Remove the tone-raising mark from the principal vowel. Replace it with the tone-raising consonant by doubling the consonant. e.g., mma (Âé ), bba, cci, dde, err, etc.

3rd tone: Remove the tone-lowering-and-raising mark from the principal vowel . R eplace it with two letters, by doubling both the associated consonant and the principal vowel a. e.g., mmaa (Âí ), bbaa, ccii, ddee, eerr, etc.

4th tone: Remove the tone-lowering mark from the principal vowel. Replace it with the tone-lowering letter, by doubling the principal vowel. e.g., maa ( Âî ), baa, cii, dee, eer, etc.

What if the Pinyin syllable has more than one consonant?

2.1 The Pinyin+tone nth Rule. Whenever the consonant letter n is present in any syllable e.g. man, n is the consonant to be doubled to signal the tone (2nd or 3rd). The nth Rule’s power and its ease to master becomes more obvious with the following examples:

1st tone 2nd tone 3rd tone 4th tone

an °² ann [ÎÞ ] aann Ûû aan °µ

ban °ã bann ÙØ baann °å baan °ë

chan ²ó chann µ¥ chaann Ùæ chaan âã

…

man ò© mann Âù maann Âú maan Âý

nan àî nann ÄÐ naann [ÎÞ ] naan ÄÑ

ren [ÎÞ ] renn ÈË reenn ÈÌ reen ÈÏ

zheng Õù zhenng [ÎÞ ] zheenng Õû zheeng Õý

What if the Pinyin syllable has two or more consonants and no letter n?

The following 2.3 Rule is applied:

2.3. The h-rule: Whenever h is present without n (e.g. cha), h is the consonant to be doubled. Examples of the two rules, respectively:

1st tone cha = cha (²æ) 2nd tone cha = chha (²è) 3rd tone cha = chhaa (ïï) ) 4th tone cha = chaa (²î )

What if a syllable has no consonants at all, but only vowels?

The following Rules are applied:

2.4. The single-vowel rule: For single-vowel Pinyin syllables (e.g. &quot;a&quot; or &quot;e&quot;), add an h at the end, and then follow the 2.3.h-rule:

1st tone a = ah (°¢) 2nd tone a = ahh (àÄ) 3rd tone a = aahh (ºÇ) 4th tone a = aah (ºÇ )

2.5. The double-vowel rule: For Pinyin syllables with two vowels and no consonants (e.g. &quot;ao&quot;), have the second vowel act as a consonant:

1st tone ao = ao (°¼) 2nd tone ao = aoo (°½) 3rd tone ao = aaoo (°À) 4th tone ao = aao (°Â)

What about homotonic and homophonic Ideographic characters?

Please, once again, recall the Pinxxiee Formula to our aid:

Pinxxiee
 =
 Pinyin
 +
 Tone
 +
 Radical
 =
 Ideograph
 
Px
 =
 Py
 +
 T
 +
 R
 =
 Hz
 
Æ´Ð´
 =
 Æ´Òô
 +
 Éùµ÷
 +
 ²¿ Ê×
 =
 ºº ×Ö
 
Pinxxiee
 =
 Pinyin
 +
 Shengdiaao
 +
 Buushhaao
 =
 Haanzii
 

That’s when we add the needed radical stroke letter(s)to the Pinyin+toned syllable to complete the spelling.

3. The Pinxxiee Radical Rule: Change the ideographic radicals to look-like alphabetic letter suffixes. Chinese characters, through a process of TiENSTROKES Pinxxiee transformation, are changing stroke(s) into a letter or letters, and then make the stroke letters into a radical suffix. For instance, the t-radical is condensed from the H-stroke Ò» and L-stroke l, which, combined, form the t letter, or the -t suffix. A Pinyin+ syllable plus a radical suffix produce a Pinxxiee word, similar to an English alphabetic spelling, e.g., ma + xx = maxx (mother). The following 4 examples show how spellings of Pinxxiee words are naturally derived from Chinese characters themselves, thus retaining their ancient historical roots:

Hanzi Tenstrokes Radical Script Pinyin+Plus Radical Pinxxiee English

Âè CJH-PZH cjh-pzh ma -xx maxx mother

Ä¿ LP-HH-H d-hh muu -dhh muu* eye

²Ý HLL-LPHH-HL tt-lphh-t ccaao -tt ccaaott grass

Ä¾ HL-JY tv muu -tv muutv tree

* muu Ä¿ can also be spelled as muudhh with itself as radical .

 

These spellings, maxx Âè, muudhhÄ¿, ccaaott ²Ý, and muutv Ä¾, contain silent Pinxxiee suffixes, serving as the semantic radicals in the original square characters. These radicals must be added to Pinyin+Plus spellings in order to be differentiated from their homophones, e.g. muu Ä¿ must be spelled differently from muutv Ä¾. And so, each Chinese character (square ideograph) has been transformed into a unique monosyllabic Pinxxiee word (linear ideograph) as its original in the computer Internet world.

However, you only need to learn TiENSTROKES Alphabet VHLJY TGPCZ and then about 50 of the most-frequently-used radical-suffixes (like -xx, -dhh, -tt, -tv…) in order to process 95% or more of the ordinary Chinese text. A set of 250+ silent Pinxxiee radical-suffixes has been created to spell differentially all homophones for both complex and simplified characters. This applies to all 60,000+ Chinese ideographs, and even more characters, if created. These suffixes are easy to remember, because they are created to look like the original radicals, by neuro-association, based on a child’s game: search for English letters in Chinese characters! Study the following characters and you will see what we mean:

ccaaott = ²Ý = grass; fentt = •Ò = scent; zhhukk = óÃ; xiaaokk = Ð¦ smile and others.

4. The Two-Syllable Compound Rule: Omit the silent radical suffixes when entering a two-character compound word as follows:

Âè + Âè =&gt; ÂèÂè

maxx + maxx =&gt; mama

5. The Three-Syllable Compound Rule: Omit the silent suffixes and the tone letters when entering a three-character compound word as follows:

Áª + ºÏ + ¹ú =&gt; ÁªºÏ ¹ú

liannthht + hhejy + gguoq =&gt; Lianheguo (United Nations)

Conclusion Report On Dr. H. C. Tien’s [Ìï Èý ÎÄ ] PINXXIEE Technology

by Experts at Standardization Conference

AUTHENTICATION OF CERTIFICATE

The China Standardization Association hereby decrees that the panel of experts were indeed authorized to review Dr. H. C. Tien’s (Tiann San Wenn, Ìï Èý ÎÄ ²© Ê¿ ) presentation and demonstration in defense of his Pinxxiee Language Technology. Furthermore, this conference was declared on public record that the expert panel’s conclusions are true and valid.

On November 3, 1999, a conference was held in Beijing, China, at which Dr. H. C. Tien demonstrated and defended his Pinxxiee Language Technology. The technology was subsequently validated by the China Standardization Association. The CSA invited China’s experts in the following fields to participate in the review: information technology, standardization, ergonomics, software evaluation, software design, language coding analysis, psychology, internet software analysis, et al.

The following conclusions were reached by the commission of panel  experts.

Pinxxiee Language Technology was developed based on the Chinese Government’s official standards of spoken Mandarin and the Chinese (&quot;Pinyin&quot;) phonetic spelling method. Moreover, this technology adheres to the contents of China’s official Mandarin language Xinhua Dictionary. In conclusion this language technology’s overall design is in accordance with China’s national Mandarin language policies. 
This technology is an effective system of writing Chinese characters because the problem of duplicate Chinese character spellings is rendered small. All aspects of a Chinese character -- i.e. the phonetic spelling, tone, and semantic root -- are expressed in its Pinxxiee language spelling. 
This technology is a breakthrough in solving the problem of homophone ambiguity in Mandarin because Pinxxiee spells out all aspects of the Chinese character (see above point # 2). For all practical purposes, the homophone problem has been solved. 
Pinxxiee Language Technology is in ASCII, so it can be used on the Internet to send Chinese Mandarin email messages (as easily as in English) without the ambiguity that arises when the phonetic &quot;Pinyin&quot; spelling method is used. Thus, fluent speakers of Mandarin, who do not know English and do not have a Chinese character platform on their PC, now have a convenient method for sending and receiving email messages in Mandarin Chinese. This is especially true for international communication, and will have ever increasing usefulness in the future. 
There is sufficient education software available for Pinxxiee Language Technology, and the PX-2001 software package (PX Toolbox) makes learning this technology easy. 
In summary, Pinxxiee Language Technology’s method of spelling Chinese characters is technically sound; it has simple rules and very little memorizing needed for Mandarin’s inflection tones. It is suitable for being introduced for learning as early as the elementary and junior high school grade levels by students who have knowledge of the phonetic &quot;Pinyin&quot; spelling method.

The Commission’s panel of experts raised the following relevant issues regarding Pinxxiee Language Technology that it felt must be considered and addressed:

China is a huge country with many different ethnic dialects; and although the Chinese government has extensively taught Mandarin Chinese for more than 30 years, the vast majority of Chinese people still find difficulty in speaking Mandarin properly. They find even greater difficulty in writing Chinese phonetic &quot;Pinyin&quot; spellings. Since teaching Pinxxiee Language Technology is based on both the correct speaking of Mandarin and the spelling of &quot;Pinyin&quot; sounds, Pinxxiee Language Technology  will be very difficult to promulgate. 
Because Pinxxiee Language Technology  has all the aspects of the Chinese character contained in its spelling system, its Chinese character representations are much longer than all the other systems used in China today. 
In addition, the Commission stated that any further developments or improvements of Pinxxiee Language Technology  must be in accordance with the Chinese language standards set down by the Government’s relevant official bodies. 
Up until now the phonetic &quot;Pinyin&quot; spelling method has been primarily used for learning Mandarin Chinese. It has also been a beneficial tool in Chinese character display for software. With the introduction of Pinxxiee Language Technology , we now have what can be called &quot;the Chinese writing script&quot; for the PC and Internet environments. In fact, it has become Chinese language technology for international communication. Needed now is for the general populace to master it while the relevant government bodies support its use. 
The China Standardization Association hereby decrees that the panel of experts were indeed authorized to review Dr. H. C. Tien’s demonstration and defense of his Pinxxiee Language Technology. Furthermore, this conference was on public record and the expert panel’s conclusions valid.

1999 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2001

1. COMPANY OVERVIEW: In 1960, while working as a practicing physician with dyslexic children, H. C. Tien, M.D.[UMICH.MED] discovered a historic and scientific link between the two major languages of the world, English letters and Chinese characters. In 1983, 

Dr. Tien, President and CEO founded CCC, Inc. By 1997, after having received 3 patents for his inventions, he closed his private practice of medicine and decided to launch CCC on the Internet supermarket.

2. DISCOVERY: What he discovered in 1960 turned out to be the &quot;genetic code&quot; of Englishó Chinese transcription in TiENSTROKES ALPHABET. Using TiENSTROKES®, CCC can speed up U.S. trade &amp; communication with China.

3. RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT: After more than a quarter of a century (1961-1999) of R&amp;D with considerable equity investment from family’s savings and a number of private investors, Dr. TiEN perfected the PINXXIEE theory and its language technology TREE model:

HLJY ó Ä¾ ó MUUH ó TREE. 

CCC has copyrighted, trademarked and patented [1960-99] the intellectual properties of a global TiENSTROKES ® Alphabet, and its derived Pinxxiee ComputerChinese™ dictionaries, InternetChinese scripts and language technologies.

4. BUSINESS MISSION: To achieve this mission, CCC seeks strategic investors and experienced technology partners to help plan an IPO by 2001. Today, almost one-forth (1/4) of the world’s population is Chinese, the vast majority can’t touch-type Chinese characters directly on the computer keyboard in their own language (ºº ×Ö ) ! The remaining three-quarters (3/4) including Americans, who are trading with China can’t read Chinese ºº ×Ö . However, the basic invention and the applications of TiENSTROKES to Chinese-English translations has readily enhanced the commercialization of products and services on the market. CCC supplies accurate and rapid Englishó Chinese translation service, using its own products, the 3 InternetChinese™ word-processing and translation tools.

5. PRODUCT &amp; SERVICE:

Ìï ™ TiENSTROKES® INTERNET-CHINESE™ TOOLBOX™, retailing @ $775/box: contains the 3 key tools used by CCC over the years (1983-date) in its Translation Services:

[i] Pinxxiee® Internet-Chinese AutoInput System’98 (CAIS’98), retailing @ $375/ per tool; a Chinese character word-processor that works like English.

[ii] TiENSTROKES® Pinxxiee® e-Chinese SpellChecker’99, retailing@ $350/per tool; for checking the spellings of linearized Chinese characters!

[iii] TiENSTROKES® MindMasterTutor2000™, retailing $300/per tool; a hand-held computer educational tool for students and language workers in translating Chinese ºº ×Ö ó Pinxxiee ó English documents and database.

6. FOCUS: Washington Post has forecast that CCC will eventually become the leader in Pinxxiee Chinese script technology. CCC is ready to enter the largest and fastest growing Internet markets with its Toolbox™99 for US-China &amp; global trade. Although already well known to some important governmental customers and users, e.g., the State of Michigan; GM and EDS, and other fortune companies, CCC aims to fulfill its destiny as a leading corporation in the multilingual information industry, championing for the Golden Age of East-West trade in Peace with Prosperity for the 21st Century.

Announcement of Discovery
Gary Vey

An ancient alphabet has been found and successfully translated on six continents. 
Translations and grammar suggest a global human culture thrived in antiquity.

Note: Viewzone has recently published a book, Evil Fire Made To Burn, which is available at
www.dandelionbooks.net and which gives new details and complete translations of this material, 
as well as other interesting facts surrounding the old language.

Abstract

The author, in attempting to document some unusual and very old rock art in remote North America, has discovered an ancient alphabet. This alphabet is similar to ancient writing found in other locations around the globe and the author suggests that this is the result of a cultural migration. The Colorado site, located near La Junta, has been dated to before 800 BC. In the Negev desert of Israel, the same alphabet has been meticulously dated to 1500 BC. In South Australia the alphabet is estimated to be over 5000 years old. Similar alphabets have been discovered in Oklahoma, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and in Western Asia.

The alphabet has been given the name &quot;old Negev,&quot; after the location of the alphabet's initial discovery in the Sinai by a Harvard funded expedition (see James Harris, Ph.D., Brigham Young University). In Australia it has been known by the name &quot;Panaramitee Art.&quot; In the Americas it has been misrepresented as Native American Indian sign language (See LaVan Martineau, The Rocks Speak). The alphabet has most recently surfaced in Yemen, where it was carved in a beautiful font style associated with the Sabaean Empire under Bilqis, the Queen of Sheba. The alphabet is now understood to be proto-Himyaritic, or Sabaean, and has successfully been translated using the port-Canaanite algorithm.

The author recognizes the danger of describing the language as &quot;old Negev&quot; or &quot;old Hebrew,&quot; despite the fact that root-Semetic languages are used in the translations. Evidence of the antiquity of this script in both the Americas and Australia suggest that this root language may pre-date that of the Hebrews by at least a millennia. The author and his associates suggest using an unbiased name, such as &quot;the First Tongue,&quot; to avoid any biased association with a specific people, culture or era. The content of the translations, although not complete, suggests a global culture and religious belief system devoted to a monotheistic deity, often symbolized by the word &quot;AL&quot; or &quot;EL.&quot; But more scrutiny of this language system, its content and occurrence around the globe is indicated.

Photographic evidence is presented here and on-going translations are posted from the ViewZone Expedition in May 2000 which returned to Colorado and Oklahoma and also the Yemen Expedition of 2001. A discussion of the evidence is welcomed. 

A helpful summary of background data is presented HERE beginning with 
the first publication of the petroglyphs in 1998 on viewzone.com.

THE ALPHABET 

Summarized Links by Topic and Region

The Alphabet contains basic, distinct geometric shapes that correspond to established phonetic sounds. Certain letters have more than one symbol so that they can be used consecutively with either inclusion or exclusion of the corresponding word. Since there are no word breaks (spaces) in this language, this is a natural requirement.

The vowels (except for Y) are almost always omitted, unless they are necessary to distinguish precise meaning. Most words have one sylible.

Earlier attempts to translate the symbols failed because the alphabet was believed to be proto-Arabic. This was a natural assumption since the symbols were first seen only in the Sinai and the Arabian peninsula. However, translations have successfully been made by using an old Semitic dialect that ore-dates Hebrew.

The alphabetical symbols were originally found pecked in stone. The stone surface is typically flat and has a dark patina of oxidized minerals, similar to a blackboard. The surface is breached with a sharp object, removing small chunks of the patina and revealing the bright contrasted stone. The bright petroglyphs gradually darken with age making them visible only with oblique lighting and shadows. An exception to this was the discovery of the Sabaean font in Yemen, which utilized the finest masonry and carving techniques. The Yemen text was also found cast in bronze and printed with movable typographic characters. 

The alphabetic symbols are often arranged in groups that can be mistaken for pictures or maps. These &quot;ligatures&quot; can be broken down into discrete letters and phrases. Curiously, many of the ligatures are made such that the word meaning is conveyed both phonetically (for those that can read) and symbolically. A typical word or phrase will have two or three symbols in length. The direction of flow and the grammar are explained in detail in subsequent papers linked from this page.

BACKGROUND DATA

The Expedition 1998 was undertaken as a way of becoming familiar with petroglyphs. The four-corners area of Monument Valley was documented, as well as Anasazi habitats never before filmed. Special attention was given to the nature and style of the petroglyphs and pictograms (painted on rock) of that area.

An attempt is made to translate some of the symbols using the methods of LaVan Martineau, with limited success.

The Four-Corners, Anasazi Habitat (1998)

 
The Expedition visited the Hopi Reservation and was allowed to document ancient petroglyphs, never before photographed, and to explore the mythology and tradition of the oldest North American habitat.
The Hopi Reservation (1998)

 
All of the visits to known American Indian sites were in preparation for assessing the southeast Colorado petroglyphs, which were meticulously documented in the feature, &quot;The Picketwire People,&quot; shown for the first time on ViewZone Magazine in 1998. At the time, no similar alphabet was known to the author.

PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
COLORADO, USA

We revisited the Colorado location again in May of 2000 and May 2002 with a higher resolution imaging and recording apparatus and documented many new sites. The most impressive was named &quot;the Gillespie Stone&quot; and contained an altar stone with appropriate texts praising the One God, &quot;El.&quot; (see The Colorado Expedition of 2000 and Colorado Expedition 2002).

Other Atrifacts recently translated reveal the manner in which the alphabet is grouped and can easily be mistaken for a picture.

These OKLAHOMA translations were made after discovering an old photograph taken of a remote site in Colorado. The black and white original is in a museum, largely forgotten. 

 
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
Most recently, Viewzone received photographs from a team in Australia who depicted similar petroglyphs of a much older date (i.e. in excess of 1800 B.C.) These were examined and translations of the material proved that it originated with the same root culture and ascribed to the same rules of grammar and symbols.

Translation of these Australian panels, a style known locally as Panaramitee Tradition, has been completed but the complete and the results have been successful. We provide some examples here.

NEGEV DESERT, ISRAEL
The Negev Desert has been explored by Dr. James Harris, of BYU, who identified some of the grammar and structure of the Middle-East petroglyphs and has described this alphabet as &quot;old Negev.&quot; His translations are reviewed in detail.

Additional script from the Negev region are also included for review.

 Update from Yemen: Translations.
On October 15, John McGovern, busy documenting the First Tongue in Australia, located pictures of inscriptions from the alleged Queen Sheba's archaeological site in Yemen. The language on the wall, although stylized into a font, appears to be First Tongue. Click HERE to see a recently uncovered panel and our attempt at a meaningful translation. Additional translations of a stone, partially buried in the sand and unexcavated, are attempted HERE.

It is our belief that this ancient alphabet was used much as Latin inscriptions and Roman Numeral dates are used on contemporary dedication plaques. A dead language never changes and is therefore constant through time. 

Old temple uncovers Queen of Sheba 

The Mahram Bilqis contains priceless documents, artifacts from the time of the biblical queen.

September 13, 2000 
TORONTO (Reuters) 

A Canadian archaeologist said on Tuesday that his team was slowly unravelling the secrets of a 3,000-year-old temple that may have belonged to the Queen of Sheba. Half-buried under the sands of the southern Arabian desert in northern Yemen, the Mahram Bilqis or Temple of the Moon God contains priceless documents and artifacts from the time of the biblical queen. 

The Yemeni government does not have control over the various tribal groups that live in the country and who believe that they own the land'The temple was a sacred site for pilgrims in Arabia from around 1200 BC to to 550 AD, the time that fits with history's record of the Queen of Sheba and her visit to King Solomon of Israel. &quot;To have such historical, religious and cultural connection to one site is tremendous. Not often in archaeology do we have that.&quot; Professor Bill Glanzman the project's director told Reuters. The discovery and excavation of the temple began in 1951 by the late American archaeologist Wendell Phillips. But it was halted abruptly a year later because of political unrest. Work was restarted in 1998 by the American Foundation for the Study of Man, a nonprofit organisation that spearheads such projects. 

Surprisingly, Phillips and Jamme, in the 1950's, remarked that some of the oldest scripts in Yemen seemed to have proto-Canaanite characteristics and did not translate using Arabic dialects. The team were ousted from Yemen before this could be explored. Curiously, none of the subsequent research -- including the present work at the Temple Bilquis -- has attempted to apply this method to the texts.

Glanzman, leader of the recent University of Calgary expedition to Yemen, said the Bilquis Temple could become an &quot;eighth wonder of the world,&quot; attracting people from around the world. But another expert disagrees. &quot;This is the most optimistic of statements at the moment, given the economic and political situation and the problem of raising money for such things,&quot; said Edward Keall, senior curator of Middle Eastern Archaeology at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. 

&quot;I do not expect to see it in my lifetime,&quot; he said. &quot;As of the moment, the Yemeni government does not have control over the various tribal groups that live in the country and who believe that they own the land,&quot; Keall said. But Glanzman tries to sell the importance of the excavation, saying it is as important a discovery as the ruins of Pompeii, the pyramids of Giza or the Acropolis. &quot;The sanctuary is packed with artifacts, pottery, artwork and inscriptions, opening a new door to the ancient civilisations of southern Arabia,&quot; he said. Glanzman said his team could be finished with the excavation within 15 years.

Discovery of Writing in Oklahoma, U.S.A.
 
This is a portion of the long petroglyph mural that was discovered just to the South of the Purgatory River in Colorado. The petroglyph was chalked by professor Weisendanger and his associates from Tulsa University in the 1940s, and then photographed in black and white from a large negative. The only surviving print is in the &quot;No Man's Land Museum&quot; in Goodwell, Oklahoma, pictured at the bottom of this page.

This section represents about five feet of a carefully executed narrative, reading from right to left, which runs about 80 feet in total length. Areas of the petroglyph were worn with age and water erosion and were not chalked. But what is enhanced is clear enough to translate, and the results are reproduced here for scrutiny.

One of the many curious observations that we have been able to make concerns the arrangement of multiple concentric circles. At first, we did not imagine these as ligatures. The arrangement has been shown to result in meaningful translations when taken as a double-Tsadeh ligature. Some examples of the concentric circle ligatures can be seen in these petroglyphs.

NTN = &quot;give, allow, let...&quot; (A)YL =&quot;...the leader, ram...&quot; L[horizontal]= preposition &quot;to, for, of, from...&quot; AR = &quot;...light...&quot; LN =&quot;...to pray...&quot;

The last LN segment appears to be part of a longer ligature; however, a section of uncarved rock breaks this ligature from the adjoining one while maintaining an illusion of design continuity. 

BY = &quot;...entreating, invoking...&quot; AL =&quot;EL (God)&quot; SLS = &quot;...the serpent...&quot; LR =&quot;to be attentive, to take notice...&quot; L[horizontal]= preposition &quot;to, for, of, from...&quot; SN =&quot;tongue, language...&quot; V =&quot;and&quot; TsTs =&quot;to appear, blossom, emerge...&quot;

This could possibly be a reference or prohibition against using the name of the God, &quot;El&quot; or &quot;Yah,&quot; in vain because it also allows the &quot;serpent&quot; to be invoked. More translations of the wall could provide some further explanation.

Yemen and Sabean Culture &amp; Language

**20** Semitic Languages.. Many scholars believe that about 1000 BC four branches developed from the original Semitic alphabet: South Semitic, Canaanite, Aramaic, and Greek. (Other scholars, however, believe that South Semitic developed independently from North Semitic or that both developed from a common ancestor.) The South Semitic branch was the ancestor of the alphabets of extinct languages used in the Arabian Peninsula and in the modern languages of Ethiopia. Canaanite was subdivided into Early Hebrew and Phoenician, and the extremely important Aramaic branch became the basis of Semitic and non-Semitic scripts throughout western Asia. The non-Semitic group was the basis of the alphabets of nearly all Indian scripts; the Semitic subbranch includes Square Hebrew, which superseded Early Hebrew to become the prototype of the recently constructed Hebrew writing. Semitic Languages comprise one of the five subfamilies or branches of the Hamito-Semitic or Afro-Asiatic language family. Of the Semitic languages, Arabic was carried beyond its original home in the Arabian Peninsula and spread throughout the Arabian Empire and is spoken across North Africa to the Atlantic coast. Arabic is used by Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Arabs. The other Semitic languages are centered in a region bounded on the west by Ethiopia and on the north by Syria and extending southeast through Iraq and the Arab Peninsula, with some slands?of Semitic speech farther east in Iran.

The Yemen Museum in Sana'a displays this stone. 
Ironically, it lists prophecies and prerequisited for the
time to open the buried chamber, containing the &quot;cabinet of El&quot; 
and, presumably, the self-sacrificed son of Saba and Solomon, Menelik.


This stone was photographed as it is displayed in a prominent museum -- upside down -- with no idea of its translation or alphabet. A similar alphabet later developed in Ethiopia but misread many of the ligatures as letters and replaced many sound values with new sounds to accommodate an Arabic dialect. This is still in limited use today while this older form is used exclusively for religious and official writing. The Ethiopic script translates using Arabic dialects instead of Semitic. 
Using the First Tongue, Semitic root language and symbols, we can arrive at a somewhat fluid and lucid translation with some historical flavor. 

The stone has been trimmed on both ends and notched in the center and appears to have been used as a building stone subsequent to its creation as part of a significant narrative mural. The resulting translation lacks these additional symbols making a precise translation impossible.

We hesitate to use the term &quot;Semitic&quot; because it really does not represent the root language that eventually evolved into what is commonly known as Semitic. We choose to call this &quot;First Tongue&quot; since it has been found in Australia, Chile and the United States with dates as old as 8000 BCE! The use of this script and dialect on this important construction appears to resonate with the contemporary use of Latin, Greek and other &quot;dead languages&quot; on public buildings, currency and official insignias.

Anyone who scrutinizes our work as it is presented here will acknowledge the intent of these inscriptions. We have intentionally been inexplicit in these details. Please review the on-going work in the links provided below. 



Above, a work in progress.

The Inscriptions from Bilqis (Yemen) according to Dr. Jamme in 1962


Above is the first of many illustrations of the exterior wall of the Temple of Sheba, taken from W. F. Jamme's book, Sabaean Inscriptions from Mahram Bilqis (Marib), (1962). Most of the artifacts were photographed by Jamme himself and were gathered under restrictive circumstances owing to the territorial disputes that still continue in Yemen.

Jamme's methodology of transliteration is of interest to us because we have translated a small portion of these artifacts with an entirely different algorithm. We will attempt to show the difference in these two approaches.

We have determined the sound values for an assortment of letters based in the work of Dr. James Harris (BYU), who successfully translated numerous scripts in the Negev desert. Earlier forms of this script have also been found as far back as 8,000 years ago, which demonstrate the consistency of grammar and dialect. This discovery was not made when Jamme attempted his translations in 1962. He therefore relied on the Ethiopian sound values. Some sound values required for Arabic dialects are different from the proto-Semitic language that we believe was used when the older artifacts were made. Various letters in the relatively newer Ethiopian alphabet, which were Jamme's only resource, have been re-assigned to Arabic phonetics. But there are other errors as well.

The early language used characters called &quot;ligatures&quot; (a group of letters which are graphically combined to represent a more compact and unified shape). In the artifacts that we reviewed from Bilqis, we noted ligatures for such words as &quot;EL&quot; (the Lord), &quot;BN&quot; (the Son), &quot;BL&quot; (life, love), &quot;TseL&quot; (protection), while these ligatures have been assigned the status of single letter sounds in the Ethiopian version.



The artifacts pictured above attest to the use of ligatures in the older language. This &quot;anomaly&quot; on the left is the ligature for AT &quot;chamber, cabinet, box, cell...&quot; as in the Ark of the Covenant. Note that it appears to be immediately followed (to its left) by a ligature for EL &quot;the Lord.&quot; In many instances the ligatures were used when the referenced word was repeated within the text or if it previously made reference to a person.

Jamme's methodology did not recognize the lamed as a vertical line and instead considered this line to indicate word or phrase breaks, as we would use punctuation. According to Jamme's tables, the gimmel of the older language is read as a lamed. Jamme also interprets the ligatures for &quot;EL&quot; to have the sound value of qof, and attributes an &quot;S&quot; sound to the ligature for &quot;BN&quot; and &quot;BL.&quot;

It is then not too surprising that Jamme's results consist largely of complex personal names and alleged genealogies. He also reads the script from left-to-right, even when the &quot;fonts&quot; are reversed. It was the practice to alternate the direction in multi-lined texts so that the reader could scan the text in a zig-zag pattern. Confusion was avoided by writing the letters backwards on alternate lines. Jamme seems to have ignored this phenomenon. One can see the &quot;Mem&quot; and &quot;Resh&quot; to quickly determine the correct flow. By reading from left-to-right, Jamme was fortunate at least half of the time, but without using the correct sound values his translations are mundane at best.

Our methodology reads the script from right-to-left and alternates as the letters are mirrored. This provides a relatively smooth and meaningful translation without constant mention of personal names or tribes. The vertical line in our interpretation is a lamed and we recognize the word or phrase breaks as being marked by the vav, which resembles a dissected circle or can be two adjacent circles. This translates as &quot;but, and, also...&quot; and makes for some long run-on phrases that would enrage a modern editor.

The writers were careful to repeat their phrases and to use multiple ligatures to assist in the deciphering of these strings of letters. Since most words are devoid of vowels (except if the vowel falls outside of the last consonant) there are typically two letters to a word. Where there could be some ambiguity with similar adjacent letters, alternate forms of the letters will be used to denote word breaks. An example would be &quot;the chamber underneath&quot; AT-TT. This would be written similar to AtTT to allow the reader to see that the break is between the two forms of the letter. Otherwise this string of letters could possibly be interpreted as &quot;the signal&quot; ATT-T.

We have identified alternate forms for bet, chet, dalet, and tav in the Bilqis alphabet. The older examples of this script also employ alternates for peh, mem, nun, tsadeh and zayin. In addition, the script in North America and the Negev has used rotation of letters and repetition of the final consonant to to indicate phrase breaks. Undoubtedly some of the material at Bilqis was produced in the last two millennia and utilize the Ethiopian variant. This older language was buried, literally, and disappeared for almost 800 years, before emerging in Ethiopia with a new dialect and quickly spread back to Yemen. Our translations seem to state that this dormant interval was the result of events surrounding the only son of Queen Saba (Queen Sheba), Menelik, whose mother had her former palace and temple buried to prevent its destruction and pillage by invading nations (see transliteration below).

What has been translated thus far?

Using the algorithm that has been successful in translating numerous examples of this script from around the world, we have obtained the following information, quoted here from a letter sent to His Eminence, Abdulla Salleh, President of The Republic of Yemem. 

Menelek (spelled MNLCC), the only son of Queen Saba (Queen Sheba) and Solomon, was depressed when he learned that his father's kingdom had been overcome and the Temple in Jerusalem was sacked. His grief was deep (&quot;The happiness of the Son was poisoned...&quot;) and this worried his mother. Shortly after this invasion of Jerusalem, Menelik received word that the Ark of the Covenant (the &quot;cell of the Lord&quot; AT-EL), formerly housed in Solomon's Temple, was relocated to what is now Yemen and was in the protection of Menelik. The text refers to an &quot;oath&quot; that was taken by Menelik to protect the Ark, perhaps agreed upon when he visited Solomon several years earlier. Menelik also received a warning from Nathan, Menelik's half-brother, that the Ark could be harmful to his health and that it had caused vision problems and &quot;trembling&quot; (seizures?)when Nathan had attempted to interact with it. Menelik, however, had none of these adverse reactions and eagerly interacted with this object, constructing a special chamber underground in which he stored the Ark and conversed through it with the Lord.
As the danger of invading neighbors became real for the kingdom of Saba, Menelik announced that the Ark had instructed him to enter the underground chamber with the Ark, and to have the entire construction covered with sand to conceal it and protect it from hostile forces. Menelik informed his mother, Queen Saba, that he would remain buried with the Ark for a long period of time.

Following her only son's instructions, Menelik was buried with the Ark. However, his mother had a chamber constructed adjacent to the Ark chamber and had a secret peephole (&quot;...aperature...&quot;) installed so that she could monitor his condition while he was buried. She secretly planned to open the chamber and rescue her son should he be in peril. On many occasions, Queen Saba viewed her son inside the chamber and, on one occasion, noted that he was receiving a revelation of the future from the Ark, which made a sound like thunder. As she watched Menelik interact with the Ark, she noted that he trembled and shook from the visions that were being shown to him.

As time passed, the thundering noise and movement of her son ceased. On one occasion the Queen noted that a worm crawled out from the peephole. This suggested that Menelik had died. The Queen was determined to open the chamber and rescue her son but she recalled her promise to him and remembered his words, stating that he would be buried for &quot;a long time.&quot; She wept (&quot;...cried an ocean of tears...&quot;) that his vision of the future also included the realization that she had doubted his word and she prayed that he would forgive her for her doubts.

Determined to honor her son's wishes, Queen Saba had the chamber reinforced with stone and consulted with the builders and masons to design an enclosure that would protect the buried chamber from future earthquakes, floods, and other natural phenomenon. The chamber was thus made more sturdy and a large dam was constructed around the buried chamber to protect it from water and floods.

In the Yemen museum there is another stone which dictates the conditions that should exist prior to any attempt at opening the chamber. These include the occupation of the land by a &quot;friendly&quot; nation and the warning that the Ark must not be moved and should not be used for any national or personal benefit. The Ark is to be used for the benefit of mankind and petitions to the Lord are to be made by collective prayer in the area of the buried Chamber and through the &quot;priest&quot; of the Ark (Menelik?).

Following the burial of the chamber and the surrounding temple, Queen Saba &quot;dimmed her kingdom&quot; and moved to Ethiopia with the prohibition that the area where the Ark and Menelik were buried should be forgotten, lest future hostile nations and &quot;blind prophets&quot; should seek it out.


Additional translations are beginning to fill in the gaps of this remarkable story and we will present these as they are translated.

The translation program is only as good as the data which is entered. The sequence of letters is not covered by any known convention, and therefore some interpretation of the pattern is needed. Most, but not all, Colorado petroglyphs are read from right-to-left. With a stacked ligature, bottom-to-top reading is usually associated with references to God, while the reverse is true for earthly matters. With experience, complex ligatures can be successfully broken down into their correct sequence and will result in accurate translations.
Distinguishing between word groups was accomplished by repeating the last letter in a word or phrase. A double letter, therefore, is a helpful indicator of the sequence with which old Negev alphabetical letters should be read. This rule is also not adhered to completely and some scripts simply end with no duplicity.


 
The photograph above is of the most famous &quot;old Negev&quot; script found in North America. Heavily chalked and scrutinized by the likes of Barry Fell and other epigraphers, no logical translation has ever been made and published of this script. Until now. 

We are using McGlone's own drawings of this panel and have duplicated this below to allow the script to be seen more clearly.



You will note that we have broken the script into word groups, starting from the right and working towards the left. Translations can be verified by using the on-line negev translation program. We will explain each section here.

Section 1 consists of a ligature formed by the letters Tsadeh and Lamed. 

Tsel =shadow, shade, protection. 
Section 2 consists of a large Yod. This is interpreted as a shorthand for OY! or a sign of exclamation. Thus, the first word group is being emphasized (i.e. &quot;Shade!&quot;) 
Section 3 begins with a horizontal Lamed. This indicates that the Lamed is to be read as a preposition &quot;of, at, to, for...&quot; The remaining ligature consists of a Khaf+two Lameds, followed by a large Yod. KLLY= for the public, general, commonplace person...  
Section 4 consists of two vertical Lameds. 

LUL=were it not for... or because of... provided by... 
Section 5 shows a curved Resh followed by an extended ligature of Khaf plus Alef plus Lamed. 

Rakka El = temple of El. 
Section 6 consists of a single Lamed, followed by two Nun. 

Lina = lodgings or accommodations (literally, &quot;stay the night!&quot;). 


So far, this group of signs appears to be a sort of advertisement for staying, in effect, ...at the temple of &quot;El&quot; protection, shade and accommodations are provided to the general public... All of these translations were made by converting the &quot;old Negev&quot; symbols into their corresponding Hebrew sounds and then using a Hebrew to English lexicon which is encoded in the Negev translation program. Although the program is not entirely complete, most of the common words will be found if it is used correctly. Hopefully this will further the effort to gain acceptance by traditional historians by first gaining the support of non-scholastics who can translate these important links to our past with a minimum of bias.

Viewzone would like to hear from any attempts at translating in the field. We hope to share more detailed transcripts in the near future.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Captive in Fort Sumner

A grueling 300-mile march to imprisonment in a sterile land.

The Dine, or Navajo as they were called by the Spanish, share a common Athabascan ancestry with the Apache. The Dine emulated the Pueblo, shedding their animal skin clothing for cotton and learning quickly to farm. They settled in, herding sheep and growing corn in the canyons and mesas between the Rio Grande and the Grand Canyon.

When American settlers started filtering into the area, raids began. Attempts to negotiate treaties were made between 1846 and 1849, but the Dine, a population of approximately 12,000, were vastly scattered, and coordinated talks never took place.

In 1851, Fort Defiance was built about 30 miles southeast of Canyon de Chelly. The land that had been long used for grazing Navajo sheep was suddenly taken over for use by the soldier's horses. A long cycle of bloody attacks and reprisals began, peaking in 1860, when 1,000 warriors waged an attack on Fort Defiance. The army abandoned the fort, but a full-fledged campaign of revenge cut across Navajo country. Crops were burned and destroyed, livestock was slaughtered or confiscated, and the Dine faced the threat of starvation.

A peace agreement was signed in 1861, which included a government promise of rations for the tribe. Later that year, the supplies were distributed in a festive atmosphere which included horse racing and betting. In the last race, an army rider accused of cheating was declared winner, and an uproar followed. The troops withdrew to the fort where the commander ordered them to open fire. More than 30 Navajo were shot dead, many of them women and children. This initiated an new wave of vengeance.

In 1863, Colonel Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Carson was named by General Carlton (known for his ruthless treatment of Apache raiders) to begin a campaign against the Navajo. His troops stormed into the ancient and sacred Canyon de Chelly, rousting the people from their hogans which were then burned, along with saddles, clothing and all other stores. Their sheep and cattle were slaughtered, and about two million pounds of corn burned. Families attempted to hide in caves in the canyon walls, but were hunted and put under armed guard. One small band of Kayenta Navajo found fresh-water springs in a hidden canyon behind the top of Navajo Mountain, and were able to escape captivity.

After many months of bitter imprisonment, about 8,000 men, women and children were forced to make a grueling 300-mile forced march, remebered as &quot;the Long Walk,&quot; across New Mexico to a dry desolate strip of land known as Bosque Renondo. There, Carleton invisioned, they would become &quot;happy and contented people.&quot;

Navajo men were forced to mold adobes and to build Fort Sumner. They were given no wood for fires, the drinking water was bitter and the soil no good for growing corn. Men, women and children became ill, developing stomach problems and other conditions due to the lack of fires to withstand the cold winter rain and wind. Without their land and their corn, the people were in a state of desperation, made worse by disease and starvation. They were wasting away.

Ultimately, the imprisoment has its desired effect. A treaty was signed in 1868, granting Navajo survivors a 3.5 million acre reservation which included their old home country.

During their imprisonment, the Navajo lost about 25% of their people, and were no longer considered a threat. They returned home and began to rebuild their homes and their lives.

Recorded in petroglyph form, these symbols, found in Largo Canyon, New Mexico, tell the story of Carson's campaign against the Navajo.

Next-generation Medicine Man- An interview with Albert Laughter.

My family goes back several generations. We were not held captive in Fort Sumner. My family grew up in what is now the Canyon Lands. Over the years I have been asked questions by a number of interested people from universities and I have welcomed the opportunity to share my culture and to learn about their culture.

I have my own language and tradition but I also live in two cultures- my own and my adopted culture, the Anglo society. Presently I am a contractor and build and sell houses. I specialize in making our culture's type of house, called a hogan. We have some even sided octagon shape and also the traditional dome shape hogans. These are based on the traditional styles that are made of the earth.

Our ways are different. We are not a scriptual type of people. We are not known to be writers, we are known to be symbolizers. We may use a symbol or a color to represent a concept. When we teach something or we are shown something, you will only hear it once - you will not hear it again. If you hear it the second time it will not be the same as you heard it the first time and it will not be as strong a message. That is why we use symbols to represent the meaning of important teachings.

Although we have clans within our tribe, it is the elders in our family who are the ones who answer our questions and give us our tradition. When old people speak we listen because the spirit is speaking through them, the spirit is within them. When we speak with the old people, the old spirits are with them and are speaking through them. That is how we answer the questions from the young people.

The word &quot;Navajo&quot;

I am used to being called Navajo. It is a Spanish word that has a meaning that is not nice. It means renegade. We call ourselves Dine (dee-neh)- like our language. It is our identity and our heritage. I would prefer to be called a Dine.

On Ceremonies

In my family I am more or less the one who is looked up to because I am asked to explain things to the younger members of the family. I do some chanting with my father, often throughout the night and I assist my father, the Medicine Man, in his chanting and praying.

There are about two hundred sacred songs but we can only use about twenty four or thirty six songs because they must stop when the big morning star is in the sky. We call it the big star and when it comes, about mid-morning, we stop singing. So we sing by these stars. Some of these songs can only be sung in the morning, while some can only be sung from midnight until the time when the big star is in the sky. We also have songs for when the sun comes up and when the sun is in the mid-afternoon. 

On Healing

In healing, there are certain prayers that we say and these prayers are repeated by the patient. He or she will repeat them after the shaman says them. The prayers are to heal whatever the problem is and what is causing it. Maybe the problem is from the thunder or maybe the illness is from the Mother Earth. With each special prayers there can be special offerings. We also use herbs that are prescribed much like modern medicine will prescribe certain pills. The herbs that are gathered are gathered just for that specific individual with that specific illness. We also use what we call prayer bundles. These, like the herbs, are specific bundles of prayers that prescribed for specific conditions. We often have corn pollen in a little bag in one hand and in the other hand we will hold the prayer bundle. 

 The prayer bundle is difficult to describe because, like the prayer sticks, they are sacred things and we do not want to describe them in detail. The god people, as we call them, do not want these sacred things to be revealed or given away. We believe that if you give up some of these sacred things by revealing them carelessly, we will also lose all of our memory and our thoughts and the memories of our race. This is what my father told me. I am in the last part of my apprenticeship and I am learning certain creative singing right now.

The singing starts with certain ages. There are songs for pregnant women, for babies and for children. Usually, for babies, there is corn pollen that is offered as a blessing. Gestures and direction are important. We always push the corn pollen towards the baby, never from the back or the side - always directly towards the baby. This is how my father, the Medicine Man, taught me and this is how he was taught by my grandfather who was also a Medicine Man.

When we do these ceremonies we do not do them according to a schedule. We do not have a special holy day like a Saturday or a Sunday. We do the ceremonies when they are needed and then we will repeat or continue them in two days, or three days, but we do not use the days of the week as a marker of time. Every week has a Monday and every day has a one o'clock or a two o'clock, so we say that we will do the ceremonies in two days.
That is our way.

On Family

I have children and nieces and nephews and a large family with many young people. No one in my family is carrying on these traditions and it worries me. I have enjoyed taking on the tradition of my father, especially at my age. I am 49. But it seems like this long tradition will end with me. My own children do not speak the language. But as far as carrying on with the Anglo society, they can get by much better than even I can do. I do better talking with older people in the traditional ways.

Do you think your children will eventually want to leave this area?

 We often talk about it. I try to speak to them about my own experiences. I lived once for six years in Gallup (New Mexico) and Flagstaff. At first the children may want to move there to see what it is like but at a certain age they will want to come back. They want to see what they see here. They often say that they have seen this area in their dreams and they want to come back. They say that even though they do not speak the language - even though they do not understand their grandmother - they have the strong desire to come back. This is the mission that we have in this area. We say that it is important that the traditions be carried on by the next generation and it is very important that they learn the language.

After Death

Your destiny is fortold. Like after you pass on someone may mention your name. We may talk about, say, our grandmother. &quot;Remember how grandmother used to say this or that?&quot; Also, we can sometimes see the person who has passed on in a child who has the same expression or temperment. We say, &quot;He or she is just like grandmother!&quot; In this way the person continues. These are some of the ways that a person stays with us. They live on in memories and thoughts. Even tears can mark a continuance. We live within our family who remember us. We all return to the earth and we can come back as the rain.

If you travel around some of the pueblos and the ruins you may hear the conversations of the people who have passed on - you can hear their planning and their laughter, their preparation of food and chatting of the woman folks, old people and the fires. If you close your eyes you can hear the children playing. You can really hear them. These are some of the talk that is left behind within the wind. The winds are the only messengers that we have. As we grew up, that is what our grandparents used to tell us. The only thing that you can have a conversation with is with the wind. There is a certain way that you face yourself and then you can hear them.

The way we were taught was to go out at the dawn - that is the time that you can speak to the old ones. You go out at dawn and make an offering and talk to them. They are the living gods - they are gone to the other side. The only time that you are going to hear them talking back is when there is a thunder or a new plant or a quick glance during which time you can see them. They only come at a certain time but they are around you, they are with you. But they are real and they are your guides. You speak to them in the morning - that is the time to talk to the old ones.

You can make an offering of corn pollen and say something like, &quot;Hear me. You know me.&quot; This other side of the culture, the Christianity, you say &quot;My Father in heaven,&quot; and you are speaking to the Great Spirit, but I will say, &quot;I am your great grandchild, your grandchild, and I, as your child, would like to say something. I talk to you in beauty.&quot; Thats how I learned from my father and he from his grandfather. My grandfather is not here. He is passed on. That is how we say it- we say they have passed on. Some would say that they have passed away but we say that they have passed on, meaning that their life continues. We are their life that carries on.

On History &amp; Tradition

Well, I hate to use the words, but the Hollywood style of viewing us is bad. The &quot;cowboys and indians&quot; view of history is not correct. I can remember when they were filming a John Wayne movie out here and the director had some of our people in the movie. He said that when John Wayne pulled out his gun we were all supposed to fall to the ground. This is what the young people learn about themselves and it is sad.

 If I could give a message to any Native children who would listen, I would say to first learn about who you are and then to be proud to be who you are. You should go somewhere very quiet and just feel what kind of person that you are and try to feel the spirit inside and outside and then to not be ashamed or feel bad about who and what you are.

Let nature be nature. Let yourself be who you are. Don't try to improve or cover up your true self. At the same time, some things should be preserved and kept private. Even within the Navajo people there is a great difference between the so-called East and West Navajos. Around Gallup and Albequerque there are Navajo who are selling souvenirs of sacred items and are making a living off of the culture. This only diminishes the culture when you sell it off. Some things ought to be kept to the people as their sacred traditions.

One thing that is harmful is television. Young people see things and get ideas that are difficult for the older people to even understand. As a result we have young people shooting other young people in schools and we have a problem with drugs and alcohol. It is what they see on television. We have a very bad problem among some of our youth in this area. It is a difficult problem to face.

Some of the other things that I do not feel good about are intermarriage. People will say that he or she is a good person and will be a good mate. We are trying to keep our ways intact. It is hard for me to say what my own children will do. The most important thing is that they should want to learn the language and then they will be able to carry on the ways. I don't want to be the last one to preserve the ways of my family and my people. My mission is to encourage them to listen and to want to learn these things. I think I am becoming successful because they are returning again and again. They are coming back and asking questions and they are curious and it is a good sign. Only time will tell.

On the Earth

We have noticed that things are a little bit different from one year and season to the next. Once we did not get burns from the sun but now we notice that even our skin begins to burn when we are out in it for a long time. It was not like that before. Man makes the mistake of trying to understand things and improve upon them when they do not need to be looked at so closely. Once there would be a beauty walk, as we call it, and it was fine. Then someone would decide that it would be better to build a paved road on the same path. And the road is not natural and so things around the road change. Sometimes we do not need to look at trying to improve on natural things. And sometimes it is not really progress.

We thank Albert Laughter for taking the time to share his heritage with us and our readers. We found our time with him to be most rewarding.

Stories are very important to us. We have stories that remind us of the past ...

In our tradion we say that a long, long time ago the gods got together to have a meeting. It was what I call the god conference. They had to decide, &quot;How shall we make the human people? How shall we make the plant people? The reptile people, and so on...&quot; And more importantly they had to decide, &quot;How shall these people live together?&quot; Those are some of the questions that came about. They decided to give them each different settings and categories. So that is what happened when they called this conference.

The cayote was, as you would say, the &quot;MC&quot; of the conference. And so it was the cayote who ran the meeting and became the messenger, telling which category everything would be in. But the cayote was clever and had a sense of humor. That is why we see humor in the world. The cayote has a sense of humor and so you will see that at every meeting of Native Americans there is always a joke- someone will crack a joke to start the discussion. Then they get down to business. 

Many white people think that the Navajo are serious people because we do not smile much. This has its origin in the cayote legend. We are told that everything is not a joke. The many gods have things that they control, and they are not all humorous, but the only messenger we have is the cayote. If we see a cayote cross our path we say, &quot;Oh look, the cayote! What kind of message is he bringing to me?&quot; If the cayote is encountered when you are facing to the north then it is usually a bad message. If he shows when you are facing the south then it is likely to be good news. Whatever the case, we usually stop and make an offering to the cayote for delivering the message. If it is a good message then the offering will assure hid blessing. If it is a bad message then you should make that offering so maybe it will not come true. In any case, if you see the cayote it is a wake up call and an indication that he is delivering a message to you.

The cayote has his songs, too. They are different for each of the seasons. In fact, we can talk about the cayote mainly in the winter because he is hiding, or, as we say, he is taking a vacation. Right now, as we talk about him, he is listening to us and hears what we say about him. That is why some cayote stories are told only at certain times of the year.

When the gods made the different kinds of people, they decided &quot;Let's not make them know each other at first. Let the different people find each other and be curious and want to know about each other.&quot; Curiosity is important because it fosters respect for each other and our differences. When we have to learn about each other, we also learn about ourselves and we respect our differences. 

When people who speak different languages meet, the hand languages are very important because that is how we can communicate. We use gestures and symbols. This was the intention of the cayote. He wanted to make it interesting for different people to meet. That is his sense of humor.

Sometimes the cayote will make things happen for a purpose- always for a purpose. He may make you have a deformity or an illness, but it is because you need to learn something or to pay attention to something. So he may make something happen that you might think is bad but it is for your benefit to make you learn a lesson. Often the lesson will make you say, &quot;Why me? Why did this happen to me?&quot; The cayote knows that this is a big lesson that will be learned by you and your family and your friends, so that they all benefit from the lesson.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Hopi are a tribe of about ten thousand people located in a fairly isolated geographic area in northeast Arizona. Descendants of the ancient Hisatsinom, their culture can be traced back over two millennium, making it one of the oldest known in North America. They settled in the land of the Four Corners area long before the Navajo, the Apache, the Spanish or the Europeans who now call themselves Americans. 

About a thousand years ago, the Hopi occupied a vast territory stretching from the Grand Canyon to Toko'navi (what is now called Navajo Mountain), toward the Lukachukai Mountains near the Arizona and New Mexico border, and south to the Mongollon Rim. Hopi clan markings can be seen throughout this entire area in the form of petroglyphs, etched figures and symbols in the rock cliffs and stones. 

Here they developed a system of farming, called dry farming, and were able to grow a variety of vegetables which included several types of corn. They had an understanding of natural cycles and they incorporated these into their daily religious rituals. Unlike other &quot;warrior&quot; tribes, the Hopi were a peaceful people and had good relations with all of their neighbors, including several Native people in Mexico, with whom they shared trade and ideas.

Within fifty years of being &quot;discovered&quot; by the Spanish, the Hopi were to face the first of many cultural challenges in the form of Christianity. Limited contact with the Spanish missionaries was at first beneficial since it brought the horse, sheep, burros and cattle. Several new vegetables and fruits were also introduced to their agriculture. Along with these &quot;gifts&quot; was the persistent attempt to convert the Hopi from their spiritual beliefs, and subsequent contact with the Spanish was marked by severely harsh and brutal treatment- all in the name of the Christian god.

Along with other &quot;gifts&quot; from the Spanish, the Hopi people suffered from a previously unknown disease, smallpox, which plummeted their population from about 10,000 to a mere 3,000. Also, the Navajo, who entered the region about the 13th century, made frequent raids and attempts to secure Hopi land during the early part of the 19th century.

In 1882, president Chester A. Arthur designated a small rectangular area in northeast Arizona as the Hopi reservation. This area included the present day three mesas that comprise the Hopi homeland. The wording of this agreement, however, allowed any other Indians which the Secretary of the Interior permitted to live in this reservation area also. This opened the way for successive waves of Navajo infringement on Hopi land.

Several subsequent treaties and actions of the United States government have further encouraged intrusion on Hopi land and ways of life. This intrusion has created a current threat to the Hopi, as we will discuss further during our stay.

&quot;Here in Arizona, we trace our history back two millennium. We emerged here over 100 generations ago, making us one of the oldest cultures in North America.&quot; --The Hopi

As we pointed out in our brief history, the Hopi once occupied the land stretching from the Grand Canyon to Toko' navi (what is now called Navajo Mountain), toward the Lukachukai borderlands, south to the Mogollan Rim. Their ancestral ruins and clan markings clearly distinguish their traditional homeland boundaries.

In 1882 a rectangular tract of land was designated as the Hopi Reservation. Since that time, the Hopi have had a continual struggle to maintain the land granted to them. As you can see by the map (not an exact rendering), the once rectangular portion of land originally set aside as the Hopi Reservation has been gradually diminished by the Navajo, who have tried to claim everything outside the portion marked Section Six as their own. These lands contain ancient sacred sites still used in traditional ceremonies by the Hopi, who have strong ties to this ancestral land.

The effort to keep control of their homelands has been a difficult, ongoing struggle for the Hopi, a small group whose religious beliefs and daily lifestyle are firmly meshed, keeping them from extensive contact with the modern world. Their desire to handle their problems in traditional ways has put them at a disadvantage to the Navajo, people who quickly adapt to changes and are not hesitant to take advantage of partnerships with the &quot;outside world.&quot; Therefore, the Hopi have been receiving what definitely appears to be the &quot;short end of the stick.&quot;

During their effort to keep control of their ancient lands, the Hopi have witnessed the destruction of mesas containing sites which they consider sacred or sanctified ground. These mesas have been destroyed for the production of amalgam, used in the making of asphalt highways. Ironically, despite their outrage and pleas for preservation of these important and historic sites, construction companies under contract to the state of Arizona are using this material to pave Route 264, which passes through the center of the Hopi Reservation.

In addition to the assaults on their land, the Hopi have also become the target of fortune seekers who have raided ancient sites and stolen sacred items used in religious ceremonies. Ceremonial masks and other items used in spiritual practice have been sold in the &quot;art market&quot; and have fallen into the hands of collectors or museums. To the Hopi, these items are living entities and their absence can hinder or even prevent sacred rites from taking place. Some items have been recovered in cooperation with the FBI under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, but the tracking and recovery of the items takes years, during which their absence seriously affects the spiritual health of the Hopi people.

Hopi village life revolves around their religious calendar which divides the year based on the visits of the Kachinas. These Ancestral Spirits arrive after the winter solstice and leave at the peak of summer. During their stay, colorful ceremonial dances take place in the village plazas for the benefit of all people, plants, animal and spirit life. Upon their departure, carved images of the Kachinas are given as spiritual gifts. The Katsinam, who perform the public dances, are sacred to the Hopi people, as are the carved Kachinas which have been ceremonially sanctified.

Only the Hopi and their pueblo relatives have esoteric manifestations called Kachinas within their culture, but it has become the practice of non-Hopi Indians, as well as Caucasian craftspersons, to try to &quot;cash in&quot; on the tribe's religious practices by creating imitation kachina dolls. Over 70% of the Hopi people earn a part of their income from the creation of arts and crafts such as kachinas, baskets, pottery and jewelry. An individual Hopi doll carver makes less than 50 high quality kachinas per year meant for sale to the public, yet over 100,000 imitation kachina dolls are placed into the stream of the Indian art market. Highways are scattered with signs advertising &quot;authentic kachinas.&quot;

The activities described thus far are enough to keep the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office staff busy year 'round. Operating with a very small staff and antiquated equipment, the office has its hands full trying to handle the legal aspects of all the above-mentioned situations, which need to be handled quickly when they arise. Most old documentation is hand written in quill pen and quite fragile. This documentation needs to be put into electronic format so that it can be easily accessed and printed when needed. The office is lacking state-of-technology computer equipment, modems, scanners, printers and faxes which could make their huge task much easier. (We ask our readers who have connections to computer equipment to pitch in here and help this office get some badly needed equipment.)

Other concerns of the Cultural Preservation team center around insuring the continuance of Hopi cultural heritage which has suffered, not only from the examples mentioned, but from the influences of modern society as well. Television has caused a lack of interest in Hopi practices and encouraged a desire to become involved in the outside world, as well as a trend of disrespect for the Elders. The impact of modern education and economics have also put a strain on the Hopi style of life. According to the Public Relations Office of the Hopi Tribe, &quot;when a man has a full-time job there is little time left over to tend his fields and take part in the yearlong religious ceremonies.&quot;

Prior to the construction of Jr./Sr. high school facilities on the reservation, students attended off-reservation schools, border town public schools or the boarding schools of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Hopi language was never taught in these schools, nor were the children allowed to speak in their native tongue. Violating this rule met with severe punishment. As a result, a whole generation has fallen off from learning the language or being able to teach it to their children. Since the language has no written form and was traditionally taught by the grandmother, introducing it into the school system will be a complicated task.

Some of the ancient Hopi language has already been lost. Ceremonial songs contain some words which are no longer understood by older Hopi, but are still sung by tradition. If no attempt is made to revive the language in Hopi youth, the refined concepts and religious traditions that are the very foundation of Hopi identity will eventually be lost.

Several years ago a team of linguists approached the Hopi with an offer to prepare a dictionary of their language. Many were happy to cooperate with this effort, believing that it would help preserve and sustain their culture. When the dictionary was completed it was put on sale in the public market, and profits given to the universities and foundations that started the project. Complaints from the Hopi netted them 24 copies and instructions to purchase more copies if they were needed. &quot;They have even sold our language,&quot; remarked one of our hosts.

The Hopi are the true owners of their cultural heritage. They are now beginning to fight back by investing in lawyers who are securing proprietary rights to their language, art and cultural practices. One concerned Hopi stated, &quot;In the old days our people would circle around the invading enemy and they would shoot bullets at us from the wagons. I see our job now is to be inside those wagons and to be loading blanks in the enemy's guns.&quot;

This is the daily struggle of the Hopi against constant infringements on their basic rights to practice their religion, maintain their lands and secure their way of life. Some members have educated themselves in the ways of the outside world and are seeking to correct the wrongs that have taken place. This in itself has caused some division with those who prefer to deal with the outside world in the old, traditional ways- to ignore it. But these moves may be necessary to save an endangered culture.

If Vice President Gore can commit our tax funds to place a modern computer per student in our school systems by the year 2000, then certainly one or two concerned businesses should be able to provide this ancient culture with the tools they need to insure their future existence. We ask our readers to support this effort by furnishing the computer equipment necessary. If you can be of help, contact the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office at P.O. Box 67, Second Mesa, Arizona, 86043, or e-mail us at ViewZone.

We were surprised and honored to learn that we would be allowed to enter one of the Hopi's ancient sacred sites. Join us for our next upload and witness an historic first as we are allowed to photograph, for the first time ever, some of the ancient rock inscriptions still visible in this sacred place.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Name of God From the Sinai to the American Southwest
James Harris

In the 18th Century BC, Canaanite miners were hired by the Egyptians to work in their Copper and Turquoise mines in an area called Serabit el-Khadim (see map below) of the Sinai Desert (now called the Egyptian East Desert). Hieroglyphic signs were used to write their West Semitic names and keep correct accounts of their days of labor. This was a great motivation for them to learn the sound signs that phonetically articulated their names. Very soon they had an Alef-Bet with which they could record their Proto-Canaanite language. The script they developed is called Proto-Sinaitric (First-Sinaitic) and the language was a Pan-Canaanite language often called Old Hebrew 

Three centuries later (15th Century BC) there was a cave-in at Mine-L, within the above mentioned area, and artifacts, tool, and a few inscriptions were frozen in time. This event provided knowledge of how much the Alef-Bet had matured in three centuries. 

In the same century an area variation appeared in the Land of Canaan. This variation retained the archaic forms of Proto-Sinaitic and introduced a few abstract forms (used side by side with archaic forms). This area variation was called Proto-Canaanite. Both of these archaic scripts were the parents of Old Negev (1200 BC) an area variation found South of the Land of Canaan (an area that today extends from Beersheva to Eilat). Another script that emerged about the same time as Old Negev was Phoenician. Unlike Phoenician, Old Negev retained many of the archaic signs which they used side by side with abstract signs [the abstract signs were simply reformed Egyptian signs].

A study of the two parent Alef-Bets was an important step toward assigning the appropriate phonetic values to the Old Negev signs. Also since Old Hebrew was used as the best language to translate the two parent scripts it was logically the best language with which to translate Old Negev inscriptions. The geographical location of the emergence of Old Negev also favored a strong link to the parent scripts. 

In addition symbols, icons, and ligatures that doubled as icons and enhanced the meaning of the whole composition were consistently observed and they frequently included icons and phonetic signs that spell the most sacred name of the God of Israel [Yah, Yahh, &amp; Yahu, which out of respect was never spelled out fully]. 

But all the above is just the beginning of the surprises that Dr. Harris describes in his book, The Name of God From the Sinai to the American Southwest. 

The real discovery was that this same ancient alphabet system was found on rocks darkened by patina (desert varnish), on paintings in caves and overhangs, with the same icon, ligatures, symbols, and the name of the same God spelled the same three ways in six Southwestern States. Prof. Harris has a corpus of I20 inscriptions from the Negev of Israel, and about 400+ from the American Southwest. It is indisputable evidence that a Canaanite people speaking and writing a Canaanite language and worshipping the God Yahweh found their way to ancient America. 

Dr. Harris is continuing his examination of the Israel site and has gained the interest of various international scholars in his Middle-East find.</text>

Wednesday, June 3, 1998- Well, the ViewZone road crew has finally arrived in Kayenta, Arizona, where we're unpacking our equipment and getting in touch with our contacts. We've decided to take the rest of the day to get our land legs back.

Chinle, Arizona 

The four corners area is one of the places where true American history really begins. The western states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona meet at right angles in the arid, red soil that permeates this scenic and majestic landscape. It is here, hundreds of years before Columbus reached the &quot;new world,&quot; that the ancient people known as the Anasazi settled.

Now home of the Dine, called by outsiders Navajo, the area abounds with eroded landscape that has left towering mesas and striated cliffs of red, white, green and black rock. Each colorful layer has been revealed by the powerful force of water that emptied the once enormous lake that occupied most of the central part of North America. As the continent shifted, this huge body of water spilled southward with speed and abrasive power over the landscape on route to the ocean. Some spots resisted this sudden erosion and remain today as towering monuments to the past.

The deepest colors are dark, from when the earth was lifeless. Further up there are white layers which reflect the debris of shells and limestone from an ocean that once covered the land. As you look higher, the color turns to a distinctive reddish brown. This is the result of iron oxide - rust - and marks the era when the oceans were teaming with plant life and the planet was beginning to develop an atmosphere rich in oxygen. 

Much of the four corners area is quite high in altitude. Vegetation is sparse but very diverse and hardy. Plants have evolved to conserve water and to cope with the higher levels of ultraviolet light that penetrate the thin atmosphere - one mile above sea level. The humans that occupied this area were forced to rely upon each other and quickly learned the benefits of agricultural planting and storing grain.

Monument Valley, Sixth Wonder of the Modern World, homeland to the Navajo, and a destination for tourists from around the globe. Poised on the Utah and Arizona border, Monument Valley has inspired writers and cinematographers and is a popular motif of the West.

Today, the Native Americans that dwell here, as well as their predecessors, place great emphasis on the cycle of the seasons and the importance and vitality of water. The religion and culture of these indigenous people is intimately linked with the earth and nature and is characterized by beliefs in myriad spirits and signs. It is a religion of the earth for the people of the earth and it has endured for much longer than our history is able to record.

Around 900 A.D., the Anasazi, main cultural ancestors of the Pueblo communities, came into prominence in the Four Corners Region. Nomadic hunters and foragers, who may have ventured in from the Mojavi Desert, the Anasazi settled in this area, creating large communities in Kayenta and Canyon de Chelly, Arizona, as well as Mesa Verde in Colorado, and New Mexico's Chaco Canyon. 

A panoramic view of Canyon de Chelly (pronounced &quot;shay&quot;).

Canyon de Chelly is shaped somewhat like a bird's foot, with three narrow canyons meeting at the town of Chinle. The high, arid landscape drops 600 feet to reveal a moderated climate rich in vegetation and water. Originally home to the ancient Anasazi, the Navajo now make their homes and plant their crops in this ancient canyon.

The Anasazi settled in- raising corn, creating pottery and building large, functional communities. They lived partly underground at first, but then began to build above-ground storage for their harvests. These structures, created from a mud-covered latticework frame, proved to be so functional and comfortable that the Anasazi started living in them. 

As their communities grew, the building skills of the people grew with them. The Anasazi builders achieved an incredible degree of architectural mastery. Within and alongside the cliffs of the canyons they created multi-apartment complexes, many multi-storied.

They Anasazi prospered here until just around 1150, it is believed, when severe drought may have driven them to migrate to other areas. Shortly after that time, the Navajo took up residence in this part of the land.

In our next exploration we'll take you Tsegi Canyon and Mystery Valley for a close-up look at some of these dwellings and the petroglyphs and pictographs left by their ancient inhabitants. Don't miss it!

The focus of our trip to the southwest is rocks, and more specifically, the markings left on them by ancient peoples. Our final desination is southeastern Colorado, where we have been invited to look at inscriptions which may have been written in an extinct language, known to be the tongue of Indo-Europeans many thousands of years before Christopher Columbus made his discovery of the new world. 

In our travels, we will stop at various sites known to be inhabited by the ancient indian tribes of Four Corners and examine some of the structures and symbols left behind by them. We'll also talk with some members of the Navajo and Hopi tribes who have lived in this area for centuries.

A Brief History

In order to shed light on some of the fragments and markings on this trip, we offer a very brief background on the inhabitants of the area.

Several hundred years B.C., native cultures in the southwest were comprised of three groups: the Mongollon, the Hohokam and the Anasazi (the name given by the Navajo who now inhabit the land). The Mongollon are usually credited with the introduction of farming and the cultivation of corn, squash, potatoes, beans, tomatoes and strawberries. They were the innovators of the circular pit houses, or kiva, that eventually characterized all of the Desert Tradition indians.

The Mongollon pottery started as plain red and brown, then progressed into red on white and black on white designs bearing stylized figures of people and animals. This pottery style, like much of their culture, was absorbed, along with Hohokam contributions, into the flourishing Anasazi nation.

The Hohokam people were expert artisans. They were also great engineers, creating canals and irrigating much of what is now the Phoenix, Arizona area. Their pottery was also embellished and they created many clay figurines that showed heavily influenced Mexican styles and designs.

 The Anasazi ruins show that they lived in a tight community, in what appear to have been apartments. There were several underground circular chambers, or kiva, and archaeological data shows that they cultivated cotton and made fabric. One outstanding characteristic of the Anasazi people was their ability to live peacefully with their surrounding tribes and to assimilate unique skills and survival techniques into their own culture.

Mystery Valley

Our guide is Bill Crawley, a good friend who runs a tour service in the area. Bill's own interest ancient markings was excuse enough for him to take time from his busy schedule and show us some of his favorite spots.

Upon entering Mystery Valley (so named by early government surveyors because of the many markings found there) we could immediately see the need for 4-wheel drive and an expert navigator, since steep, narrow creeks are used for roadways. The area is sparsely vegetated, mostly sagebrush punctuated by occasional Juniper and &quot;gum plant&quot; (shown at left).

Much of the stone and mud construction still remains intact and the cliff dwellings remain as they were left when the area was abandoned. Around the dwellings we found pieces of colored pottery representing the various styles we described earlier. Inside, the walls of the shelter were covered with black coatings from the fires that had been used to warm the inhabitants.

Our exploration included three sites. Or first stop was Honeymoon Bridge, an arc shaped rock formation with a dwelling inside. We found both petroglyphs (symbols chipped into stone) and pictographs (symbols painted with gum and plant pigment) in this area. Or next stop, Manyhands Pueblo, was named for the many handprints left on the rocks here. Our last stop was at Lookout Cliff Dwelling, high in a cavelike structure from which inhabitants had a clear view of enemies coming down the canyon.

We were able to get some good shots of both the dwellings and the markings before we wrapped up for the day, which can be found on the following page.

The Barringer Meteor Crater- A short side trip. 

While we're here in Arizona, we thought we'd stop by and show you the famous Barringer Meteor Crater. It's a giant hole in the middle of the Arizona desert.

This crater measures 4,000 feet across, 560 feet in depth, and has a 2.4 mile perimeter. It was caused 50,000 years ago when a huge, iron-nickel meteorite, traveling at 40,000 miles per hour, struck the rock plain of Northern Arizona. 

Believe it or not, this crater is privately owned. It was purchased by a man named Barringer who spent over 27 years attempting to find the giant rock beneath. The venture cost Barringer and his associates over $600,000 ($10 million in today's money), but Barringer never realized his dream of a mining bonanza. He did, however, suceed in convincing the scientific community that the giant hole was caused by impact .

Since the terrain of the crater closely resembles that of the moon, NASA designated it as one of the official training sites for the Apollo Astronauts.Today the area is alive with tourist center, gift shop, RV Park and guided tours of the giant hole. The Visitor Center includes the Astronaut Hall of Fame and an Astronaut Memorial is also located at the site.

After driving for miles and miles on this incredibly long road, we've arrived in Kykotsmovi, Arizona, in the land of the Hopi. We're at the Hopi Cultural Preservation Center and are preparing to meet our contacts before we set up our equipment.

We noticed upon entering the Hopi reservation that numerous signs are posted prohibiting photography of any kind, as well as video and audio taping, or even sketching!

During our initial contacts to set up meetings we learned that these people are very private, and we are very respectful of that. We hope to be able to discuss current issues and concerns that face the Hopi today.

Our cameras are packed away unless, of course, we are given permission to use them.

Note: Out of respect for the request not to draw or photograph items that we see, the graphic designs on the following pages are created to give the feel of Pueblo designs in general, and are not meant to be interpreted as original Hopi art.

Hidden away in the canyon- Solar alignments and storyboards of the past. 

We arise early from a very comfortable stay at The Cultural Visitor's Center, located right on the main road. We have received instructions to meet our guide for this morning's trip, Clyde Qotswiswma, immediately after breakfast. Clyde is an employee of the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office and a Hopi village clan member. During our drive we ask Clyde about his work.

Clyde's responsibilities center around the retrieval of stolen artifacts. He contacts museums around the world that have been found to hold sacred Hopi religious items and expedites their return to the tribe. Despite recent Federal laws to back him up, he encounters frustrating delays and unforeseen problems. He tells us of a sacred mask recently identified in one of the most important national museums. Prior to its return to the Hopi, it was found to have been impregnated with arsenic, a once common museum trick to reduce the destructive growth of molds and fungus on organic material. It has since been determined that there is no safe way to remove the poison so that the mask can be handled or worn again. Since the Hopi believe that these masks embody the very spirit in whose honor they were created, this situation presents quite a dilemma.

Clyde pulls our 4-wheel drive vehicle off the main road to a horseshoe-shaped canyon. Even in this remote and secret location, he is careful to wear his official identification badge and reminds us that we may be watched by the Tribal Police, who are more aggressive now in response to invasions of their land by outsiders.

As we enter the canyon, we notice that cliffs, some sixty feet high in places, protect a large flat courtyard and that the central plaza is graced by a high sun clock.

Centrally located, but invisible until it's pointed out, the clock is made from an existing protrusion of rock which creates a natural pointer at its right top corner. Recessed behind this rock stands a flat surface bearing a circular target-like petroglyph (shown slightly enhanced). Clyde tells us that during a certain ceremonial dance which is performed at the same time each year, the shadow of the pointer falls exactly in the center of the circles. According to Clyde, this date is the only occasion on which this natural phenomenon occurs.

We find this interesting since we have been told that some of the petroglyphs at our Colorado destination also bear this special feature.

We come face to face with the past in Sun Park.

Barely visible, many symbols and ideas have been pecked into the rock cliffs.

To the right of the sun clock we see several groups of petroglyphs that appear to tell a story. Images of people, more spirals, stars, and some animals are pecked into the rock. The graphics are stylized- the bodies drawn trapezoidal or triangular, suggesting a large upper body with narrow hips and legs. (We saw this in Mystery Valley, also.). The horned beings, taken by many to be a shaman, are always present. Clyde says that some isolated images are clan marks.

To the right is &quot;kokopelei&quot; the flute player, a repeating motif in the Four Corners Area. The bird is thought to be a clan symbol. Spirals and waves (left) - tales of migrations?
To the left of the sun clock are the remains of more old petroglyphs. The dark patina of age is slowly being eroded away from the bottom by the weather and time, but enough of the panel remains to see the many examples of the ancient artisans.

We spot some graffiti from more recent visitors and perhaps even from modern Hopi, but these markings are easily distinguished from the darkened, pecked grooves of the older messages. The old work appears to be grouped in specific and confined spaces within the park, as if they might be put in that spot for a specific reason. Why? Clyde offers no explanation or translation for the ancient murals, but allows us to walk among the stones and respectfully photograph the work.

Some of the past is gone forever in this deteriorating and weathered storyboard.

&quot;We think that the spiral represents the number of years or cycles,&quot; Clyde finally offers, &quot;and the wavy lines that often come out from the spirals may represent a migration. The height of the waves may represent the degree of difficulty encountered on the migration.&quot;

What story are these walls trying to tell? If someone still maintains the knowledge of translating them, will this skill soon vanish with the rest of the Hopi culture? In a moment of stark awareness, we face the reality of Hopi future. For a few awkward moments there is silence in Sun Park. We are not sure what Clyde feels. Is it hope for the future, or perhaps resignation that the ways of the past are weathering away with time? Before we can ask, Clyde motions us to return to the truck for the next destination- Awatovi, the oldest continuously inhabited village in North America.

Driving from Sun Park to the ancient village of Awatovi took us over the stretch of Highway 264 that was being resurfaced. Modern equipment with conveyor belts accepted amalgum from waiting trucks. The newly paved road was smooth and quiet, but we were thinking about Clyde's story of the bulldozed shrines. Were we riding over them right now?

The drive to Awatovi was a long and hot one. Clyde drove the four-wheel up a dirt trail, over a steep sandy incline and parked on the ridge of a spectacular mesa that looked southeast, toward the San Francisco Mountains in New Mexico. Between the mountains and the mesa, the vast expanse of rolling, fertile plains looked like the ideal place to raise sheep, grow corn, hunt buffalo and build a community. 

The wind was blowing strong and the dry air was little comfort against the sun as we walked amidst rubble on the high ridge. Here, in excess of 6,500 feet, the air was thin. We could actually see the horizon curve with the earth before us. The ruins were everywhere, as far as the eye could see, atop the mesa and spilling down to the valley. Awatovi was not just a village, but a metropolis of multi-level dwellings, kivas, storage areas and plazas. With little rain and the baking of the sun, mud and stone still remained firmly intact in a few locations. We could see walls and the square foundations of the now buried pueblos. 

Clyde told us of some of the old and recent history of this village. It was settled back in 1100 A.D. While standing in the hot sun it was easy to forget that these areas get their share of snowfall and freezing temperatures. This location, although ideal for watching over your sheep or spotting invaders, was not an ideal winter residence.

Awatovi's decline was punctuated by disputes with other clans, but it actually appears to have been simply abandoned. Many broken pots and sand filled peublos still hold on against the weathering of time. 

Since the wind was strong and sand blew in our eyes, we were persuaded to leave this place to its solitude. We returned to Clyde's truck and headed back to Kqotsmovi.

We were invited to visit the Hopi Museum and spent some time viewing the exhibits and a large collection of the Edward Curtis photographs. In these photos, taken around the turn of the century, the highly artistic style of the Hopi people is illustrated in their dress and hairstyles. Along with the photos we enjoyed the display of baskets, pottery, silver jewelry and masks.

Out of respect, we did not attempt to take any unauthorized photographs during our visit.

The ViewZone crew wishes to thank Leigh Jenkins Kuwanwitswma and Clyde Qotswisiwma of the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office for their cooperation in sharing this special view of Hopi life with our readers. As we metioned previously, your help in securing computer equipment for their great task in urgently needed. 

We're headed for our final destination- La Junta, Colorado. Before we begin inspecting the inscriptions at this location, there is another type of Indian petroglyph that you should be familiar with- that of the Plains Indians.

The Four Corners Expedition was initiated by our invitation to visit an area in southeast Colorado, where a group of scientists have discovered evidence of a foreign civilization who used an alphabet similar to an extinct language last seen around 500 B.C. in Arabia. Obviously this does not fare well for believers in Christopher Columbus or Leaf Erikson and their claim to &quot;discovering&quot; America.

In fact, the continent of North America was likely discovered by the ancestors of todays Native Americans, who migrated here from Asia. We see tantilizing evidence that these indiginous people were visited by sea-farers from both the East and West, and that a variety of cultural traits from these areas were incorporated into the Native American culture. Most of the evidence for this has been speculative and centered around a few small artifacts and a great deal of imagination. The Colorado discovery is different.

In preparation for this discovery, we have taken you to see many of the outstanding petroglyphs made by Native Americans in the Southwest. We have seen small figures of birds and goats with horns repeatedly pecked into the weather walls of canyons, and these have been attributed to clan markings (see bird petroglyph below). We have also seen various sun symbols and stylized human and animal forms carved into the blackened rock faces of the Hopi Sunpark. Some of these were clan marks as well, but others appear to be stories that used symbols and shapes that were well understood by their creators.

In his book, The Rocks Begin To Speak, which we will mention later in detail, LaVan Martineau has successfully translated the meaning of these various shapes and figures. His crowning success was the translation of the Kit Carson campaign, as recorded in petroglyph form, which appeared earlier in our expedition. Martineau has also discovered that the Hopi used these same universal symbols to detail their snake dance, a ritual usually performed in the late autumn to solicit rain for the maturing corn.

We Quote from Martineau's book:

&quot;Symbol a is a deity reaching out of his dwelling and saving the crops. The V-shaped symbol opening exists where the head should be. The arc formed by symbol b is a covering of this opening in the neck of the deity. This is the sipapu - the spirit entrance to the underworld, which the to the Hopi is heaven and the abode of some deities.

The sipapu is very common in Hopi ceremonies, and is still used in the Snake Dance, where it is represented by a hole dug in the dance arena and covered with a sounding board. The dancers stomp on this board each time they circle the arena with a different snake.

Symbols a and b clearly indocate the sipapu. Symbol a is the spirit coming out, indicated by its body and arm protruding outside the covering, as if in the act of emerging.

Symbol c is a man stomping on the sounding board over the sipapu, and symbol d represents the circuit made around the arena with each snake before it is freed (e).

Symbol f is an accompanying dancer who makes the circuit each time to help guide the one holding the snake...&quot;

The explanation goes on is great detail but we suggest you read this for yourself.

I would recommend Martineau's book, The Rocks Begin To Speak (Library of Congress 72-85137) and an additional book, Ancient American Inscriptions: Plow Marks or History? by William R. McGlone et al. (ISBN 0-10953-65-xxx). The latter will be available on this web site shorty.

In general, the Plains Indian petroglyphs and pictographs appear ro have been drawn in pictoral symbols, or representational form. As most of the Native American languages were not written, these symbols seem to act more as reminders to the story tellers who would embellish the story with important, memorized details and lessons. Symbols also appear in combined form to make compound meanings.

In one early pictograph at Mystery Valley, we saw the symbol for &quot;war&quot; (two arrows pointing at each other), combined with a circle, &quot;holding&quot; and gave a possible explanation of the phrase &quot;holding war&quot; as a meaning. To the right, the horizontal line or &quot;trail&quot; symbol is combined with the pictograph for &quot;temple&quot; or &quot;gathering place&quot;, possibly meaning that the inhabitants had moved to the populated area.

The Plains Indian art we will be encountering in Colorado will be similar. It will contain numerous clues as to the recent origin of these markings, such as the depiction of horses (brought by the Spanish in the 1600's) and of White Men (usually depicted with cowboy style hats) and rifles. We mention this because these petroglyphs were often drawn on the same stone walls as the much earlier abstract art and, most importantly, the alphabetical writing that we will be examining. Some prime examples of Plains Indian petroglyphs are shown below. Note that they seem to be inscribed or scratched into the rock rather than pecked, as many of the older glyphs are made.

Help Solve The Mystery of Ancient America's Canyon People

An amazing discovery in Southeast Colorado suggests that ancient America could have been visited by a culture with roots in Asia. Rock carvings and other evidence are presented here for public scrutiny the first time. Your comments and discussion are welcome.  

The land around Southeast Colorado is arid, supporting cactus and tall grass. It is used today for cattle grazing and is sparsely populated. In the past, this area was known as &quot;the Sea of Grass&quot; because, prior to the introduction of the horse by the Spanish, the Native people had great difficulty navigating the hills and valleys that were covered with tall, thick grass. That same grass is kept short now by thousands of cattle that graze the area. 

The Native people were able to navigate the many canyons and rivers in this area, as is evidenced by their artifacts and carvings found here, but the area was, and still is, largely unexplored and uninhabited. The isolation of this area has preserved a unique and mysterious collection of rock writing -- called petroglyphs -- that can be found mingled with the familiar scrapings and art of the Plains Indians. Not many know it exists and still fewer are able to understand the significance of what appears to be an ancient system of writing.

Viewzone Magazine was asked to investigate this phenomenon and to publicize the data on the internet. It is hoped that some scholars of archaic languages might be able to shed some light on the origins of these odd symbols. And so, in the summer of 1998, Viewzone took a team to Colorado and photographed the petroglyphs with a high-resolution digital camera. Some of these images are presented here.

We initially planned to visit only this one archaeological site in Colorado. To gain some quick education in American rock art we headed to one of the oldest inhabited areas of the Southwest, where the great and mysterious Anasazi (&quot;ancient competitor&quot;). See beginning of this expedition for our exploration of both the Hopi and Anasazi ruins.

Here's what we learned from the &quot;Four Corners&quot; area: We noticed that Arizona's petroglyphs were sparse and isolated, almost hidden. Most always they were small animals with horns - goats or sheep - and were interpreted as Anasazi clan marks. In fact, we saw more pictographs, or painted images, on the ancient dwelling walls than we saw petroglyphs. The interpretation of the other symbols is pretty well understood and is believed to have been a sort of &quot;universal&quot; inter-tribal language based on hand signs. At least this is the highly regarded effort of LaVan Martineau. Martineau was adopted by a Native American family as a youth, exposed to the science of cryptography in the military, and he applied his unique talents to decipher the signs and symbols of the &quot;universal&quot; Indian language as it appeared on the rocks throughout America. His translations have opened up a view of Native American history from a perspective uncommon to most white history books. 

&quot;Holding war... gone to the main city...&quot; - An attempt at a translation using Martineau's technique.

Most Native People's language was not written, only spoken. When two tribes with different dialects met, they often communicated with hand signs, and this practice is still sometimes used today. Martineau's ability to recognize graphic representations of these hand movements allowed him to inspire historians and archaeologists all over the West. We would strongly recommend his book, The Rocks Begin To Speak (Library of Congress Number 72-85137).

We revisited the symbols in Mystery Canyon (above) and noted that Martineau's translation would have had the two arrowheads interpreted as &quot;conflict&quot; or &quot;war&quot; while the circle would mean &quot;holding&quot; - &quot;holding war?&quot; Was this the last painted message left by the Anasazi before they disappeared into the shadows of history? In some of their most remote habitats there was still grain and remnants of basketry, left abruptly. To the right is a stepped figure that begins with a horizontal line. The line looks like &quot;trail&quot; while Martineau seems to suggest the steps mean &quot;temple or heaped-up place&quot; - some important place (note the similarity to the faded symbol in the Hopi Sun Park). Perhaps this was a message that they were leaving to assemble at some obvious center before going to war? Or had war forced them to travel to a more fortified area? We're just guessing. But that's the way it works when you have no writing and mere symbols.

The Mystery of Ancient America's Canyon People

To attract their prey, Plains Indians believed that the &quot;heart-line,&quot; seen in their petroglyphs as a line which usually enters the mouth, allowed them to &quot;call&quot; the animal's spirit, drawing it close for easier hunting. This heart line (in the buffalo above) was often, but not always, connected to a hunter. In some similar petroglyphs, the animal is depicted with &quot;phi&quot; like symbols in its back - a successful hunt?

Some of the petroglyphs in Southeast Colorado were different from anything we had seen in either Arizona or in Martineau's book. Only a few of the stick figures, with circles as heads, seemed familiar. It was writing but in what form? There were what appeared to be organized groups of symbols, about twenty six different ones in all, that were repeated on hundreds of rocks along the canyons of the Pergatory River. Most of the &quot;writing&quot; was within a narrow region of land that stretches from the Arkansas River to the Oklahoma panhandle, near the Cimmeron River. 

Bill McGlone has spent a good part of his life photographing petroglyphs and has extensively documented the mysterious writing in Colorado. 

Viewzone was hosted by Bill McGlone, a highly intelligent man who has been the hub of what little research has been done in this area. Bill moved to La Junta, Colorado soon after he retired. Being an engineer, his mind was always active and curious about his surroundings. All his life, Bill had been learning the local history and visiting the locations of decisive battles and event-- in whatever region of the world his occupation took him. Originally from Indiana, Bill was drawn to this beautiful and friendly town by something he had seen while visiting the area - a very real mystery - and one that he would pursue for the rest of his lefe.

Before we really let you have the details we must warn you. First, don't put down your copy of The Rocks Begin To Speak, because you will see lots of Plains Indian style petroglyphs and pictographs. The Native Americans used many of the same walls to petition the Great Spirit or to record their own events and ideas. These petroglyphs often are carved over a darkly patinated and much older collection of repeating letters. We also ask you to keep an open mind about what you see. There is very little known about this phenomenon and, in a very real sense, you are part of our expedition. You share in the mystery and the solution to this historic riddle.

The Sites

The archaeological region we visited is deceptively blank (white space) on most maps of Colorado. In fact there are little signs of civilization in this dusty area. It's the &quot;wide open space&quot; where the buffalo once roamed. The area is a patchwork of barbed wire fences and cattle troughs. The deep canyons in this ptherwise flat landscape seem to have been etched from the sandstone by what remains of the Pergatory River (or &quot;Picket Wire&quot; as it is called by locals). Just a few hundred years ago, this area was quite different. The grass was taller and ungrazed. Its 4 to 5 foot height rippled like water as the winds pushed across the rugged landscape. Historians call it the &quot;Sea of Grass&quot; because, like a sea, it was difficult to cross and remained isolated from the surrounding communities. Only when the Native Americans utilized the Spanish horses, in the 16th Century, did travel and hunting become worth the effort. But much earlier and deep inside the Sea of Grass there were people that could read and write.

Could the &quot;Picket Wire&quot; or Pergatory River Canyons have been the community of an ancient sea-faring culture?

The land is mostly owned by large ranchers. This makes viewing these special sites quite a privilege for Viewzone's crew. Bill McGlone respects the privacy of the ranchers and limits his intrusions to objective research and discourages any attempt to trespass by sight-seers. His cooperation was vital. We were also been invited to one of the few archaeological &quot;digs&quot; that is being conducted in this area. As you will see, this is a very special area.

We woke up early. The position of the sun effects the visibility of the petroglyphs. The alphabetical petroglyphs are pecked (as opposed to scraped or painted) on to the stone by some sharp tool. Experiments have shown that a sharp piece of flint, held in the hand, is excellent for this purpose.
The rock typically has a black coating or patina which is the result of thousands of years of deposition. Bacteria and chemical reactions with magnesium and iron in the rock coat the surface like hard tar. The early &quot;carvers&quot; of these stones would have chipped away the patina to reveal the brightly colored rock below, some of which is almost white. The original petroglyphs would have been quite visible and would have had excellent contrast. Today, the passage of time has allowed the same chemical reactions to form a new patina over the carved surface and measuring this later patina is a good clue to the age that they were first made. The carved petroglyphs are as black inside as the rock surface from which they were carved. Laboratory analysis of this newer patina has been carried out on a few selected grooves of the Picket Wire Canyon petroglyphs. This placed possible ages for some of these petroglyphs to be from 2000 to 3000 years old. Some look much, much older.
   





When you first see them, your eyes focus on the more contrasted and relatively newer Plains Indian art. The themes of these carvings deal horses, shaman and other human shapes. Plains Indian art is often scraped, not pecked, into the stone. When lit from the side, artificially or by the angle of the sun, the faint depressions of the older, more shallow and blackened marks readily reveal themselves. Bill and his associate, Ted Barker, have visited every site at every time of day. And so it was a matter of the position of the sun that dictated our hurried schedule to various canyon walls in the early morning and late evening afternoon.



Look closely and you will see all four styles of petroglyphs on these rocks (pictured above and below). The meandering lines are examples of the abstract form, the tree-like figures are examples of the mysterious alphabet in compound form, the animals are likely Plains Indian marks and there are occasionally names and dates scratched into the collection.

Our first stop was just a few miles south of La Junta. The rocks were perfectly illuminated by the sun from the side. We clearly saw all four of the styles that both Bill and Ted had cataloged. There was the oldest abstract shapes and meandering lines and spirals. Then there was the mysterious alphabet, the Plains Indian renderings of animals and spirits, and finally the recent &quot;cowboy art&quot; and graffiti.

The graffiti and Plains Indian art was obvious. Its color and the depth of the grooves indicated it was much younger than the barely visible ancient marks. The intent was to create symbols or pictures that told a story. We couldn't understand them but, from Martineau's work, we were sure that they could be read. But they were symbols and pictures, not an alphabet. And their appearance on the rocks obscured the oldest layers of the black rock.

Some of the older petroglyphs were familiar to us. Goats heads with horns swept back, a deer-like animal with multiple antlers, and the ever present spiral and sun signs that we had seen in the Hopi Sun Park. Contrary to what we had been told in Chinle, this sign was frequently indicative of a solar alignment where a particular shadow would be cast on the spiral at a unique time of the year, usually at sunrise. Other spirals did not appear to have been intended for such alignments but were symbolic of the sun itself. These spirals seemed to be of the much older type of petroglyph, often blackened and faint like the ancient alphabet.

While Viewzone takes dozens of photographs, our local guides, Bill and Ted, assure us that &quot;the best is yet to come.&quot;

Writing or coincidence? You can decide for yourself as we view some of the strongest evidence.

We have been given a rough map that has many unmarked roads that can be found only by looking for landmarks. Much of the land is devoted to cattle and we have frequent encounters with animals that are either lying down in the road or are startled by our vehicle and run in front of us. The map could be that of a small village but, in reality, it covers about 200 miles. We were instructed to stop at certain locations and &quot;hunt&quot; for the petroglyphs. Notations made by Bill, like &quot;look on top of cliff,&quot; was our only clue.

Our first stop required that we climb down into a large flat canyon which is bordered by two parallel stone walls. The climb is difficult but the reward is well worth the effort. At the bottom we can see a large collections of symbols, arranged in a row. These symbols are pecked deep into the rock face and have some residual chalk from prior attempts to make them photograph better. This &quot;enhancement&quot; is unfortunate because it precludes any valid means to determine the age by contaminating the patina. This particular collection of symbols was perhaps the best example of what has been called &quot;writing&quot; and what, according to Bill McGlone, could very well be in the ancient alphabet called Thamudic.

&quot;Bill had written to me, describing an enormous number of petroglyphs that he had been studying. Some of these rock carvings appeared to be much more than mere doodles in stone, or the graffiti of Native Americans. He saw writing, with letters and repeated symbols. Over the years, Bill had attempted to identify these letters and, shortly before his death, January 30th, 1999, he had made a reasonable argument that some of the petroglyphs were from an Arabic alphabet, called Thamudic, which would have been made by Turkish sailors around 500 BC. It was this claim that prompted Viewzone's 1998 Expedition, still posted in the magazine's archives.&quot;

Bill informed us that the famous writer, Barry Fell, examined these same petroglyphs in photographs and was the first to suggest that they were ancient writing. Unfortunately for Fell, the photographs were not detailed enough to discriminate between the petroglyphs and naturally formed rock stains. When Fell's attempt at a translation was reviewed at this site, this was abundantly clear - even to Fell. Although Fell was on the right track, his work was summarily discredited and the possibility of these symbols being &quot;writing&quot; was largely ignored by scholars.

Chalk is not used any more for enhancing these marks. Bill McGlone and his team once had success with aluminum powder which they painstakingly applied to the grooves and photographed. The aluminum was inert and could easily be washed from the petroglyphs after the photographs were taken. It should not have hindered any age determination techniques, however, the current opinion is to leave the walls untouched. Our digitally enhanced images are the best for recording these ancient messages. Some of the illustrations shown here were made with this aluminum enhancement and we are grateful to Bill for sharing these old photographs with us.

In addition to the horizontal arrangement of symbols, this same alphabetical system was used in what has been called the &quot;music glyphs.&quot; A sixty foot horizontal line has been pecked into one canyon wall with vertical lines descending every couple of inches. At the base of each short vertical line there is a symbol, sometimes repeating and often different. Some of the symbols and shapes are presented (traced) on the right--&gt;    

The symbols appear to have been carved at different times, perhaps to mark the passing of time as with a calendar or to help with the telling of a long story. The truth is we do not know. We only know that a Thamudic alphabet can be seen in these &quot;musical notes&quot; and appear to be purposely and meticulously etched with great effort and over a long period of time.

Every square inch of these walls is covered with markings and carvings, many on top of older and faded ones. This would suggest that a community of substantial size and duration lived in the area and that this particular location was some type of community center. The large plaza and the supply of water from the Purgatory River would have made this an ideal location for a habitat. 

Looking at the walls, we noticed that there were frequent spirals associated with some types of solar alignments. To test this theory we place the back of our head against the spiral and look towards the rising sun. The sun aligned with pointed rocks that protruded from the canyon wall. The shadow of this pointed rock passed through the center of the spiral as we watched the sun rise. We were only a few days shy of the summer solstice and we could easily see that this spiral would mark the longest day at sunrise. Solar alignments were found at virtually all of the petroglyph sites.
  
An accidental discovery begs for an explanation and adds another clue to the mystery.

Our map also directed us to look for a wall that contained &quot;writing&quot; that was atop a high mound of earth (&lt; -- see photo). Being about 30 feet above the canyon floor, the mound was the only way to reach this wall. As we approached it, we could see what was perhaps the most prolific collection of petroglyphs confined to a small, 25 foot long and ten foot high portion of the wall. We were directed to look for a group of symbols at the top left of the wall. Although they did not appear to be related to the Thamudic writing they were certainly odd and worth photographing.

The Wall itself contained layer upon layer of petroglyphs, such that it was impossible to discern any shapes or symbols with the naked eye. It seemed as if the wall had been used for some purpose over an extremely long period of time and that petroglyphs were drawn over faded petroglyphs for centuries. The wall was so interesting that we took many shots of it - something that would prove to be a stroke of luck when we processed them on the computer later in the evening. 

Because the rock face color is uniform, the minute pecks that make up the petroglyphs can only be seen as shadows, and even then, as faint shadows. With the help of manipulating the contrast and color balance, we were able to show many of these markings. The first thing we noted were the older, abstract style of meandering lines. However, in our enhanced versions, these lines were not meandering - they actually seemed to be forming shapes and outlines. As we traced the enhanced pictures we discovered that the wall was actually a large mural of an elk, with giant antlers.

The precision with which the hoofed feet and the proportions of the elk were drawn were very different from the stick figures of the Plains Indians. It also appeared that this mural was related to the odd symbols we had seen that did not appear to be Thamudic. Could we have discovered a yet older culture that inhabited this region?

We noted that the right antler was artistically extended to encompass the right half of the wall (not visible in photos above). Several slash marks appeared to have been made by repeatedly scarring a portion of the antler with a sharp object or objects. Again, these scars appeared to have been made over a long period and at different times, perhaps by different individuals. Could this have been a ritualistic image that hunters used to sharpen their spears before the hunt? Could the slashes be recordings of successful hunts? Again we could only guess.

We left the canyon with more questions than answers. Our map directed us to yet another location, some hundred miles away. We wondered what we would find there.

Unimagined shapes and symbols lurk in the faint backgrounds of these ancient stones.

We are pleased with our discovery of a huge elk image in the rock art. But we are curious about some of the fainter petroglyphs that are behind the elk. A close-up of the area above the elk's hind quarters reveals an odd collection of circles, often connected to other circles by pecked lines. We also can see what appear to be tree-like shapes with arms or branches that terminate in these circles. Also, near to the top of these images, we can see compound symbols (a collection of symbols grouped together in one design) that incorporate the circle as part of the &quot;trunk&quot; of the tree.

But we don't know that the Picket Wire people meant for these to be actual trees. Probably not. We have read that the elk was often a symbol for fertility in the Old World. Perhaps these circles can mean something like &quot;life&quot; or a &quot;living thing&quot; and then the tree concept can be viewed as the &quot;family tree&quot; and perhaps has significance in recording family lineage or births. This might also explain the &quot;phi&quot; symbols as meaning &quot;death.&quot; What better symbol could signify the death of an animal than a slash through its symbol of life?

We also note that, paradoxically, the human hand, appearing repeatedly on this wall, is a symbol for &quot;bloody hands&quot; or &quot;death&quot; in Martineau's interpretations. We see many hands on the bottom but they are all very small - much smaller and more realistic than the stylized hand in the antlers (lower right of picture). It seems as if they have been traced from actual hands. We have been told that the dwellings and artifacts of in the area suggest that, like the Anasazi, the people of these times were small. But some hand prints are even small for a three to four foot human and are obviously those of children. Most all are left hands. Where the hands can be seen clearly, they are male. Anthropologists tell us that in men, the ring finger is longer than the index finger. While in women this is reversed.

Were the elk and the circles drawn in different eras? This is a question that will have to be answered on a return to this site with Polaroid's new PDC3000, a mega pixel camera that will allow us the resolution we need to extract this answer. In the meantime, we can only assume that the elk, whose hind quarters do not contain any circles, was incorporated into the mural with them. These pictures were taken with a 600 x 800 pixel camera.

To complicate matters, there appear to be yet older and more crudely drawn circles pecked into the surface. Visible only as a pattern of pits and specks, when connected, they begin to form some of the oldest of these rock symbols.

Lined up like a giant dam, huge boulders reveal the oldest secrets yet!

Our next map location takes us to what was once a natural reservoir, since fortified with a dam to control periodic flooding. Although many old sites could possibly be under water now, several very old rock cliffs surround the reservoir. These rocks are extremely black and show signs of cracking and breaking away from the face of the cliff. 

Many compound symbols can be seen. 

Are these symbols combinations of the Thamudic writing?

As we approach we notice that there are the familiar &quot;phi&quot; signs and many of the tree-like shapes that we saw mixed with the music glyphs and the elk wall. We wonder if these symbols formed words or if they told a story. Also, would each compound design be read alone, or in context with the adjacent symbols? 

At this location there were many dot patterns. In LaVan Martineau's system of the universal language these would be interpreted as meaning rain or small particles. But these dots seemed to be different. They appeared to be arranged in neat rows and columns, as if perhaps keeping a tally of events. Some had from six to ten rows, with any number of dots in each row. It was not possible to determine if the dots were made at the same time, or added to over a long period. The surface was just too worn to guess. The thought occured that this might be measuring a life span, but we were reminded that it was rare for the ancestral humans to have lived beyond 35 or 40 - and many of the &quot;tallys&quot; had well over seventy dots in them. Perhaps these were not years, as we know them, but seasons or lunar cycles. Again, we can only guess.

While the elk wall had many circles on its tree-like compound symbols, this location had an abundance of semi-circular &quot;branches.&quot; When they did have a shape attached to the branches it was frequently in the shape of a &quot;Y.&quot; But this was only true to the naked eye.

 When we later examined the digital images for a pattern of small pits, we were able to play a sort of &quot;connect the dots&quot; game. By doing this, many of the older shapes became visible. We noticed that the visible patterns appeared to us to be parts of much older and more intricate patterns that had been partially re-pecked. These older petroglyphs are covered by black patination from thousands of years of weathering. An example of these patterns can be seen in the animation below. This is just a partial outlining of what is hidden on this four foot wide area of an enormous boulder.

These older and heavily patinated petroglyphs show the same circular patterns and tree-like arrangements we had seen on the &quot;elk&quot; wall. We decide that we should look for these in each site that we have photographed. But that will have to wait. We are off to yet another destination and an encounter with the past. This time in the Oklahoma panhandle. 

The Oklahoma Connection: Familiar shapes but something's missing.

For the next location we report to the Department of Forestry where we pick up a key that unlocks a gate to protected land on the Colorado and Oklahoma border. The site is located in the Comanche National Grasslands and access to the petroglyphs is restricted to research. Again, our host, Bill McGlone has made all the arrangements and our visit has been anticipated by the authorities.

We travel about a hundred miles on dusty unpaved roads and arrive at the gate in the heat of high noon. The landscape is familiar to us. We are presented with a large flat plaza, surrounded by tall sheer cliffs. A small stream meanders through the plaza and there is ample vegetation and signs of recent cattle grazing. This is another ideal habitat and a possible center for a clan or tribe.

We spot our first petroglyphs easily. Called &quot;the arena&quot; on Bill's map, the site consists of a scooped out cave that has a large collection of vertical slash marks. These marks are very similar to those on the elk wall that we saw and appear to have been made over a period of time, perhaps with different tools. This could very well be connected to the same people that made the elk wall petroglyphs.

We look closely for the pecked shape of elk antlers, as we found in the previous site, but there are none. The slashes appear to have been made on protruding horizontal section of the cave wall. There is little other art except for a few small quadrupeds that look like cattle in the Plains Indian style. Much of the interior of the cave is crumbling and breaking away from the cliff. If there was anything to offer a clue as to the intent of these rows of scars, it has long since turned into rubble.

We continue searching along the cliff walls and eventually come to a barbed wire fence that marks the Oklahoma border. Crawling under the fence we follow the map to a huge collection of boulders. There, among the rocks, we find a flat topped one with many smooth scoops on it. This is &quot;metate rock,&quot; a place where the people of the past ground their corn and other grain into flour. These smooth depressions (metates) were made by years of scraping and mashing with a special stones called a manos (literally &quot;hand&quot;). There were many such depressions on this one rock and the signs of age were obvious.

Corn and seeds were ground to flour in these stone mortars. Rounded stones called a &quot;manos&quot; (inset in photograph) were used to mash the material in these worn depressions.

Who made these natural mortars? The clue was on the side of the same rock, facing the cliff. A beautiful collection of petroglyphs showed what looked like a family of elk arranged in a row, facing south. The elk were all different in size and character. A dominant male with large antlers took a superior position in the group. We recalled that our Plain Indian expert, LaVan Martineau, suggested that the elk were used to represent a family group, or clan. Could this be a symbolic family portrait? The idea was plausible. At the very least we had the coincidence of elk petroglyphs and vertical slash marks at the same site, but that only raised more questions. Were these the same people who had made the Thamudic-like signs -- or could they be an early Plains Indian culture that used the elk motif as part of their symbolism?

Curiously, we also found several examples of the circles that were also associated with the elk motif. Although some of the older petroglyphs showed the familiar tree-like arrangement, the most striking example of circles was in what was called the &quot;small pox woman.&quot; Given the name by white explorers who assumed they understood the significance of this petroglyph, this three foot figure is just a few hundred yards from the metate rock. 

Her hair style and slim body give little clues except that she is literally adorned with circles, many of which are interconnected with lines and other circles. If this is of Plains Indian origin, then the circle motif was familiar to them. In fact there was a rumor that this figure was used by the Plains Indians as a fertility site.

What we do not see in this location is evidence of the Thamudic writing or, in fact, any of the symbols that have been associated with it. This site appears to contain Plains Indian petroglyphs and perhaps some older culture that utilized the circle and elk motifs.

Our map has one remaining stop to visit. Will this next site solve some of these mysteries or just leave us with more questions? We are anxious to return to La Junta and to show Bill McGlone our findings. Perhaps he will be able to explain what we have seen. 

The rocks are dated. Surprise! Some of these petroglyphs are 4700 years old.

Dating the petroglyphs has been accomplished in the past by associating the styles and designs with similar designs found on pottery, whose dates are known. Another way of dating these carvings is to locate their use on formations in layers of the earth whose dates have been calculated by some other means. But these dating techniques are only circumstantial.

 If someone from a particular time in history was to bury and object, or dig up a previously buried object, this object would mistakenly be associated with the level of earth in which it was found. These types of errors were unavoidable. But now a direct method has been used. Professor Ronald Dorn (right) of Arizona State University developed a reliable radiocarbon dating method by sampling the varnish in the grooves of the petroglyphs. This rock varnish or patina forms very slowly in the hot, arid Colorado climate. The original artists would have pecked away at the dark varnish to uncover fresh bright rock. As the varnish forms over this fresh rock, it captures organic matter which can be separated and dated. 

Several samples were run through this test for each site. Examples of all of the various grouped styles were sampled and averages ages were obtained. The results are below. (Thanks to Bill McGlone for sharing this data. References and inquiries will be forwarded.)

The oldest and most perplexing are the abstract petroglyphs. They do not remind us of anything recognizable. Sometimes they do look as if they could have been the writing of some unknown alphabet, while other times their meandering and random shapes totally allude us. It's unthinkable that these were done randomly. They are painstakingly pecked out of the rock surface with some effort and time by the carvers and, often but not always, they seem to have a hint of patterns or similarities. Some of these showed very old dates of up to 4700 years ago! Similar petroglyphs in other parts of the world have been dated back to the Bronze Age. The elk that we were able to trace on our previous site seems to be of this oldest type. At least if you group it into the &quot;abstract&quot; family. But it is most certainly not abstract. It's too early to guess.

Since there are at least two very different styles in this group -- the meandering lines and the alphabetical shapes -- we will need to know which dates apply to which styles. The alphabetical symbols were dated at about the time of Christ, give or take a few hundred years. I'd prefer to see them in a different group because of the difference in time -- almost two thousand years difference -- but oddly they do appear related at some sites.

The pictorial style is the next oldest. These shapes are often solidly pecked and not merely outlined. The examples of quadrupeds with horns and antlers are in this group. The petroglyphs in both Mystery Valley and the Sun Park of the Hopi are also in this group. Occasionally we will see shapes that are similar to the alphabetical style (like the &quot;phi&quot; sign). It is argued that the alphabet, similar to Thamudic, was carved BEFORE the pictorial petroglyphs -- as much as a thousand years before. This view believes the people who made the pictorial style &quot;discovered&quot; the rock art from some previous inhabitants and then used some of these symbols in their own system of rock art. This view assumes that there were different cultures in this same area at different times.

But what if this was the same culture, evolving through thousands of years? We would now have to place the alphabet style AFTER the pictorial style because we would have the more organized alphabet system evolving from the earlier pictorial use of these same shapes. It would show intellectual evolution. But sadly, the dates show that the more organized alphabet was carved well before this use as symbols.

The biographic style is easily differentiated from the other styles in that it is made by scraping the shape in the rock and not by pecking. The scars in the rock are usually deep and enduring, often made right on top of the faded abstract and pictorial petroglyphs. Dating of these petroglyphs was easy and it appears that there is little controversy. Again, we sometimes see similarities in the symbols of the Plains Indian petroglyphs and the alphabetical and abstract meandering lines, but this case of copying what was &quot;discovered&quot; is obvious and historically proven.

The European style is very contemporary. Names and dates, hearts with arrows and often some famous people like Kit Carson are found in the area. 

The parallel lines are somewhat of an enigma in that they appear unrelated to all styles and seem to be about 3000 years old. How do they fit in with the cultures of this region? Our next and last stop on the map would yield some surprising information and some even more explosive evidence.

Our last stop visits an archaeological &quot;dig&quot; and some exploration of our own. It also leaves us with some impressions.

Our last stop takes us nearer to where we began - just outside La Junta. We travel to the side of a canyon bordering the Picket Wire River where a local archaeologist, Bill Tilley, has discovered the likely dwelling of an ancient settlement, one of many that lined the canyons and tributaries of this river.

&lt; This particular location overlooks the canyon and surrounding land while providing one of the few level spots to make a dwelling. 

A large boulder initially attracted Bill Tilley's attention. He later observed black scorch marks on the side of the boulder, suggesting to him that the area had been used as a hearth. Initial excavations revealed a cave under the boulder in which artifacts and charcoal were found.
   
In front of the boulder there were buried stones, the tops of which outlines a large circle. about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. With his own funds, Bill Tilley has begun to excavate the earth adjacent to these stones. As suspected, the stones are part of an intact wall that was filled in by earth and all but forgotten for centuries. The current dig is taking the earth away from a portion of this wall to learn how deep it continues and what lies at the bottom.

An dig is plain old hard work. The area must be subjected to measurements, grids plotted with string and of repeated photographs and notes taken as each handful of sand is removed, sifted through a screen and carefully examined. When a curious object is found, the person digging will stop and call for Tilley, who then passes judgment of whether to keep or toss it. Charcoal is carefully collected in aluminum foil so as to preserve the organic integrity for dating. Even some dust or a few cells of our fingers could cause errors in the carbon dating process. Solid artifacts like flint or chips of stone are photographed in place and then placed in numbered bags with accompanying paperwork. All this while the hot sun and thin air make every movement an effort.
 
Our last stop visits an archaeological &quot;dig&quot; and some exploration of our own. It also leaves us with some impressions.

Tilley admits that the data from his dig will likely only reveal evidence of Native American occupation, as this was their choice of locations and style of dwellings. He speculated that any earlier cultures would probably have left signs in the cave under the boulder, which would have been the initial shelter for this camp. To date, he has found a few pieces of flint and some evidence of a hearth and, of course, the stone walls. But all of this sheds no light on the people who made the Thamudic symbols in the same area -- or does it?

To escape being put to work in the trenches, we explored the area immediately above the encampment, on the top of the canyon. Surely the people that lived in the stone dwelling must have wandered up here. The view is great and the rushing breeze is relief from the burning heat. It occurs to us that these same people would have left evidence of their time on this ridge also. 
Looking at the rocks we find some petroglyphs right where we were standing. We can see a face with two eyes and a kind of halo made from sun-ray shapes. Not far from it we find another petroglyph, this one looking rather familiar. 
  
In the Hopi Sun Park we had been told that the spiral was the way Native Americans marked time or cycles. In this petroglyph we think we can see validation for this. The spiral marks one complete cycle. On the outside of this time marker there are several circles, possibly representing the sun or the moon, in various degrees of eclipsing the time symbol. It seems to us that these are Native American in origin. So how does all this relate to the initial claim of foreign visitors? 

Our expedition stimulated some unexpected ideas. We do see the similarities of certain symbols in the Picket Wire canyon as being similar in date and shape to a known alphabet called Thamudic, which existed in what is now Saudi Arabia and possibly parts of Turkey circa 500 BC to 500 AD. We see these particular shapes used in specific orders, like letters in a word, but we also more frequently see them arranged in groups with elements repeating many times. The &quot;trees&quot; with branches of &quot;Y&quot; shapes, or the branches that ended in large circles are examples of these same supposed Thamudic letters being used in compound &quot;words.&quot; Why would the same letter be repeated so many times?

We'd think it more likely the case that these shapes are symbols, that is shapes which represent entire concepts such as &quot;a living thing, a thing that curves to the left, on the top of a high place, at the bottom of...&quot; This would not only have been consistent with human development prior to conceiving an alphabet, but it would have been especially important to use symbols in a land where many different sounding languages were encountered.

In our travels to the three mesas that make up the small Hopi Reservation, we were told that each mesa had a different Hopi dialect that was not understood by the others. This was within an area of a hundred miles! It is certainly conceivable that the ancient Native Americans conceived a means to use universally understood symbols -- not a phonetic alphabet -- to mark such important things in stone for viewing by other cultures and times.

But what do YOU think? Maybe something in this story has suggested an area of interest or exploration... We'd really like to hear from you.E-mail to expedition@viewzone.com.

If you are interested in more information and science on the Colorado Rocks, there is an excellent book, unbiased and also speculative, that is available from the author, Bill McGlone. To obtain one of these books, please contact Bill at 1214 San Juan, La Junta, Colorado. The books are $24.95, check or money order. Don't forget to include your mailing address.

We end with some pictures of other petroglyphs from around the globe. You will see some similarities and you will make your own conclusions. Certainly this area of America needs to be researched by some experts. It holds too rich a yield in the answers to our true origins and of the early inhabitants of North America.

Petroglyphs from aroung the globe!

This petroglyph, enhanced with chalk, is located atop a high mesa in New Mexico. This shape was seen in the Hopi Sun Park as well as in Mystery Valley, but never so large and repeated. Perhaps this was THE high spot that other symbols made reference to?

This collection of Bolivian petroglyphs reminded us of the &quot;basket&quot; type of art we saw in the dam site in Colorado. Like Colorado, this collection of peckings also has the &quot;dots&quot; in proximity to the &quot;basket.&quot;

Even as far away as Pakistan we can find petroglyphs with hunting and shields as the prime motif.</text>

How do I tell when to read from the right to the left or where to start?

This is perhaps the first obstacle to reading the script because the authors, at that time in history, had no solid agreement of which direction their symbols would be read or written. It appears that there is a preference for writing from right to left, opposite of what westerners are familiar with doing, and from bottom to top in the script associated with the Purgatory River area in Colorado. Another thing to keep in mind was that, quite often, the script is written in a deliberate and clever way so that the meaning of the phrase is more or less the same, no matter which direction it is read.

When it comes to the holy name of God, &quot;Alef&quot; or a circle is used to denote &quot;Yah&quot; or &quot;El.&quot;

How do I tell when I have come to the end of one word and the beginning of the next word?

Ligatures are when two or more symbols are connected together to form a single shape. When grouped together like this, the entire ligature is usually a single word. Ordinarily, in old Negev script, the final letter of a word is repeated, signaling the end of the word. If there is more than one variant to any particular letter that terminates a word or phrase, the alternate sign is often placed next to the original sign. Another way that word breaks are indicated is in the deliberate rotation or enlargement of the last letter in a word string. It appears that each author had their own set of preferred rules but, with a little patience, the correct patter can usually be found with a little effort.

Many of the translations give me a collection of possible phrases -- how do I know which ones are correct?

Old Negev is a Hebrew dialect that was originally written without vowels. As variations in Hebrew dialects began to grow, vowel sounds were later added to standardize the exact sound of certain words and phrases. As a result, today there are several different words which have the same order and number of consonants but have different vowels. As a result, all of the possible words and meanings must be given equal weight. This may sound problematic but it is not. The different vowels that have been added to root words made of similar consonants all have similar root meanings so that the translation will usually be apparent regardless of the difference in vowels.

The order of concepts and grammar can vary as much as English. The subject, verb and object can be inverted (i.e. &quot;I went to the store to buy bread,&quot; could also be written as &quot;For bread I did go to the store,&quot; or &quot;I go for bread to the store...&quot;). It takes some practice and familiarity with the habits of the author(s) of the region in which the Negev script is found.</text>

Many of the translations reveal a rich spiritual life, devoted to the deity &quot;Yah.&quot; But many of the other petroglyphs appear to have been used as signs for the inhabitants and visitors to the area. The panel on the right is an example of what might be considered a sign or posted notice. This particular group of symbols shows that the symbols could be read from bottom to top (as with the ligature) and includes a ideogram (a circle) commonly used to represent the full moon.

Dr. Harris has added the &quot;Alef&quot; to the translation that does not appear in the actual script. This unique symbol is silent and is therefore frequently not written in the Colorado variant of Old Negev. The translation of this panel would thus read, &quot;Be fearful (reverent) in the mountain at full moon.&quot;

Additional examples of utilitarian signs and posted warnings suggest that the general population of this area was able to read and understand these messages. We can infer from this that their spoken language would be a form of old Hebrew. Another non-religious example is given below.
 
 Ironically, the water running throughout the Purgatory River (and the surrounding La Junta region) is rich in magnesium. Local residents have gotten used to drinking bottled spring water. Drinking the tap water or accidentally ingesting the river water causes almost instant diarrhea (milk of magnesium). This particular group of symbols was located near a point of easy access to the river bank and obviously served a useful purpose. Again, the use of these signs suggests that local inhabitants were able to read and benefit from the warnings contained therein.  
Another curious warning pertains to the sun, which can be surprisingly strong in ultraviolet rays at the high altitude. In fact, the site is only really accessible during the early spring and late autumn because of the extreme heat and the danger of sunburn. The translation reads as follows:

kh-l-d = hide, abide, continue for the duration of life; h-k = to be smitten, beaten down; h-t-r = to flow, (water) run, (or light) to shine bright. Translation: Hide or be smitten when the sun is bright [as at high noon indicated by the sign on the far left].

This interesting arrangement (above) can be read from both directions, has an unusual chiasmus arrangement and seems to be poetic in both form and structure. Reading from right to left we have d-' = to know, to be aware of (from y-d-'); n-h-l = to provide (sustain life); n-d = a heap or mound. Reading from left to right we have d-n = judge; l-h-n = but (with qualification); '-d = (defec. for '-w-d) = to testify again and again. Translated: Know how to maintain the mound (hill of judgment), judge but testify again and again.

There are many references to a hill or mound in these translations. Dr. Harris, who has not been to the site, could not have known that the canyon contains a ramp-like mound of earth that rises up some fifty feet to the canyon wall. At the top of this &quot;ramp&quot; there is an unusually large amount of symbols and layer upon layer of ligatures. The surface of the rock face at the summit of this mound has literally been worn flat by repeated inscriptions in the stone. This mound can easily be seen in a satellite photograph (taken in infrared) of the canyon [below].

+++

The references to the &quot;mound&quot; are frequent in this particular site. In the following example, translated by Dr. Harris, we see reference made to the &quot;tel [hill] of Bel.&quot; Bel, or Ba'al, was traditionally a local deity of a village or geographic region whose worship was popular in the middle eastern countries prior to the monotheistic doctrine of Abraham and Moses. Reference is made to this in the book of Judges (20, 21), where the early Israelites (Levites) were attacked by a group of the Ba'al cult while traveling in the land that was given to the tribe of Benjamin (Joshua 18). The twelve tribes of Israel met and instructed the Benjamites to deliver these followers of Ba'al to be punished, but the Benjamites refused. Their disobedience resulted in a bloody conflict, ending with their being cursed and banished from association or intermarriage with the other eleven tribes. It is known that the Benjamites fled to other regions of the world, establishing colonies in what is now southern France. They were almost exterminated by this curse. It has been suggested that they were assisted in their travels by sea-going peoples.  

The following panel speaks of &quot;the mark of the curse.&quot; Again, we have no idea whether this makes reference to an epidemic with obvious physical signs or some sort of tattoo or outward sign that one belonged to an &quot;accursed&quot; group. In any event, the warning admonishes the observer to give assistance and appears to be a humane gesture.  

The inscription below is one of many inscriptions that make reference to the Sun. Many of these have been found in caves and dark, protected area where rocks provide shelter from sunlight. This panel was in such an area.  

This last panel (on this page) includes a familiar ideogram -- the reclining man with an object protruding from his mouth. We can infer that this inscription might have been read with the introduction, &quot;It has been said that...&quot; Also note the clever use of an ideogram with the incorporation of Old Negev symbols on the far right. 

We will continue to present more translations from this important archaeological site. But this is a good time to remind readers that the site in Colorado remains unprotected and is vulnerable to damage by the elements as well as vandalism. We have therefore not given exact locations. Viewzone is seeking to work with organizations, students and volunteers to form an expedition to this location in the spring of 2000. Any interested parties should contact Viewzone directly for details. 

+++

An example of ritualistic writing and art at the top of the &quot;mound.&quot;

A personal name of antiquity, Ham, appears on many panels in the Colorado region. Here Ham is being quoted in a manner that suggests he was a spiritual leader. Once again we see reference to &quot;El&quot; or God, and also to His Son. 

Below is another panel making reference to Ham. In this panel we can see that Ham is apparently charged with securing women for the clan, or perhaps granting permission for marriage.  

The following panel speaks of a possible ritual prior to marriage. The male announces that he is going far away, possibly to obtain permission to marry her. While he is away, the other tribal members agree to care for her until her beloved returns. We will likely never know if this is really what is behind this interesting translation but it does provide yet another window on the past while leaving ample room for speculation.  

Another group of inscriptions is located in the canyon with the hill or mound and invites one to ascend the mound and partake in the safety and comfort of the community. There are many humane and ethical scripts associated with this ancient group.  

There are several additional panels from the Purgatory River area that have been translated and will be presented in subsequent pages. Viewzone has been in contact with members of Bill McGlone's team and we will allow them some time to digest the material we have presented. Although Bill McGlone never considered a group of Hebrew-speaking inhabitants were among those who contributed to the array of petroglyphs, he was not made aware of the discovery and properties unique to old negev script.</text>

Background Information

After the Expedition of '98, when we first saw these strange petroglyphs, ViewZone was anxious to return to Colorado to translate the petroglyphs using the recently discovered old Negev alphabet in combination with an old Hebrew lexicon. Our dreams became a reality in May of 2000 and the team assembled in La Junta, Colorado, equipped with all of the hi-tech tools that we could gather.

La Junta, Colorado is a small town in the middle of the most remote part of the lower 48 states. Surrounded by miles of prairie, it's raison d'etre (a US Calvary outpost that guarded the sana Fe trail) was renewed by American's insatiable appetite for meat. La Junta is smack dab in the middle of &quot;meat country.&quot; The railroad terminal and livestock auctions in La Junta are giant death camps for a variety of stock. Two of our team were vegetarians, which made for some awkward dining in local restaurants and even more awkward encounters with the cattle (one member, in particular, wanted to pet them).

The country around La Junta is dry and sandy with many deep and rocky canyons. Most of the vast land is either privately owned or sublet from the government by huge cattle ranchers. If you accidentally cross one of their barbed-wire fences, you may consider yourself lucky to escape being shot. Cattle rustling and arrowhead hunters have caused most locals to be wary of strangers and guarded in revealing geographic information. Oddly, they seem completely unaware and uninterested in the archaeological significance of the petroglyphs. Many privately owned ancient sites are currently being trampled by herds of Herefords.

Ted Barker, a local rancher who has devoted years to petroglyph research, negotiated for the ViewZone Expedition to gain access to many of the important, privately held sites containing examples of old Negev. The biggest surprise, however, was that many of the most intact and useful sites were located on the extremes of the National Grasslands area, a public park.

With the evidence our crew discovered, there should be no doubt that a migratory group from the Sinai occupied America many hundreds of years BC. In fact, much of the old Negev script that we documented was itself written over much older, more crudely drawn, Negev script. We saw countless evidence of at least two eras of Negev-like symbols, as well as the Plains Indian scrapings and the latter so-called &quot;cowboy art&quot; from the traffic of the near by old Santa Fe Trail.

While we await the scrutiny of the scholars to acknowledge our work, and to do their own research, we will continue translating and posting our material. We invite anyone with an interest to share in this exciting exploration of ancient history by using the translation program and viewing future images as they are reviewed by our team.

Viewzone Returns To Ancient America

A Preview of the Expedition's Discovery

The enhanced digital image above was taken following its discovery by producer, Lee Frank, while filming the zone's expedition, deep in the remote canyons of southeast Colorado. It is a simple but remarkably well preserved script that illustrates the use of the traditional old Negev alphabet but reverting to the archaic form to reference the name of God, or EL.

Lee chose to name the important discovery after Rollin Gillespie, a remarkable scientist whose insight and intellect first stimulated our interest in American petroglyphs. It is now known as The Gillespie Stone.

TRANSLATION:

The upper left ligature has three letters. The yod and resh are immediately recognized, as well as a rare inclusion of the vowel aleph. This ligature reads yaRE, &quot;fear, respect, to hold in awe...&quot;

See the old Negev alphabet and modern Hebrew equivalent. Also, remember that vowels are not usually written in old Negev.

The top central ligature appears somewhat distorted because of the underlying rock topography. It reads as a het, &quot;the, the one...&quot;

On the top right is the word for God, &quot;El.&quot; It is written using the archaic form of the vowel aleph, which was also depicted as an animal head with two horns. The lamed remained largely unchanged from the archaic form to that of old Negev script. The entire top of this panel can thus be read, from left to right, as our modern equivalent to &quot;praise to the one God,&quot; or quite simply, &quot;Praise God.&quot;

The central ligature that resembles a wishbone is actually a clever combination of letters written to graphically, as well as phonetically, convey its meaning. The main figure appears to be holding something in its right hand that ends in a circular shape. The object being held is actually a ligature read from the bottom up as A-S-S. Because the last two letters repeat, we will expect this to be a word-break (see Harris et. al.) and will read the ligature as &quot;ESH&quot; or &quot;fire.&quot; The main figure is a ligature for lamed and he (rotated to indicate end of word or phrase). LH is &quot; 'oLAH&quot; or &quot;burnt offering.&quot;

The figure further down also appears to be holding something in its hand. On close inspection it is the letters RSS. Deleting the final S we read ROSH as &quot;chief, leader, head...&quot; The significance of the figure is, as yet, untranslated.

The bottom of this panel contains the familiar horned ram symbol of &quot;El&quot; and is flanked by the letters (from left to right) LN, or to (lamed used as a preposition &quot;to&quot; or &quot;for&quot;) pray...

On the top of this photograph you can see a horizontal line which is actually the bottom of a flat step in the rock, which had a flat back to it which resembled a bench. There was no carving on this bench and so we did not focus attention on it. That was unfortunate. We later found the following inscription on the side of the same huge rock, directing the way to the &quot;kisSEM&quot;, seat or chair... 

With hundreds of digital images and video to examine, translations are being made daily. We hope to display more of this work as it becomes available. 

We now have solid proof that a culture from the Sinai lived and grew in the middle of America thousands of years ago. There is evidence that other cultures also migrated to America from Asia, and that global navigation was no obstacle to antiquity.

As always, viewzone welcomes your comments and questions.

Expedition 2002
by Gary Vey for ViewZone Magazine

Since our expedition back in 2000, ViewZone has been anxious to return to the remote canyons of Southeast Colorado to re-examine the petroglyphs that we hastily recorded on our last day of the trek. 

Specifically, we wanted to carefully validate the location and confirm the content of a highly significant collection of petroglyphs that we encountered on our way out of the hot and dry canyon of the Pergatoire River, located on public land in the Comanche National Grassland, just South of LaJunta, Colorado.

Gary Vey has led four expeditions to document this ancient alphabet. He has found and translated ancient script in North America, Yemen, Israel and South Australia. Here, Gary is pictured in front of two common petroglyphs representing the names of deity &quot;EL&quot; and &quot;Yah.&quot; &quot;EL&quot; represents the abstract form of deity -- that which cannot be comprehended by man -- while &quot;Yah&quot; is the Creator. Both symbols and concepts represent a single deity -- One God -- but recognize the aspects of &quot;knowable&quot; and &quot;unknowable&quot; deity.

According to Expedition Director, Gary Vey, pictured above, this one collection of petroglyphs is perhaps the best example of the ancient alphabet in North America, proving that there was cultural contact between this area and the Middle East, around 3000 years ago.

There are many petroglyphs in the Pergatoire River canyon. Many of these petroglyphs are attributed to Native American Indians who inhabited the region from about 1200 AD and until the arrival of the Spanish in the Sixteenth Century. A much smaller collection of petroglyphs has been identified in a very small area and appear very different from the widely accepted Amerindian art. The map above shows the areas where these unique petroglyphs can be found on public land. Often these older petroglyphs will be found underneath more recent Amerindian carvings and are distinguished by their &quot;pecked&quot; construction. Most American Indian petroglyphs are, by contrast, scraped into the surface of the stone. In addition, the petroglyphs that are the focus of our expedition are all composed of combinations of a specific set of shapes or symbols described here.

Notice the &quot;step&quot; or &quot;seat&quot; carved on the end of the large stone [above left] and then referenced in the petroglyph on the side of the stone [above right]. The view of the &quot;seat&quot; from the front is pictured below. The collection of petroglyphs have been enhanced to make them more visible in this photograph. The petroglyphs have a layer of dark patina, or varnish, that makes them the same black color as the surface of the stone. This is evidence of their extreme antiquity but also makes them difficult to photograph.

The particular collection we sought is associated with a uniquely shaped stone that appears to have been carved or modified in antiquity. The entire rock, as large as a house, is about 60 feet in length, fifteen feet wide and about fifteen feet high. On the Eastern end of the rock there is a ledge that forms a shelf [facing East 68 degrees]. The shelf is carved at a right angle, like a seat, with the back of the &quot;seat&quot; also showing signs of having been carved flat. The petroglyphs are found in two locations. The main collection is directly below the &quot;seat&quot; and face East on the narrow end of the rectangular stone.

What makes the petroglyphs so significant is their lack of erosion and the simplicity of their message. The petroglyphs have already been translated and described in our last bulletin and can be reviewed here again.

The central petroglyph alluded our prior translation but, upon close examination this time, we noticed that it was the symbol for &quot;Het.&quot; This would make the entire top row read, from left to right, &quot;YARE HA EL&quot; or &quot;Praise The Lord.&quot;

We would strongly suggest that skeptics make the effort to visit these petroglyphs before dismissing this theory. We also would suggest that professional historians review the work of James Harris and the &quot;old Negev&quot; script that was documented in the Israeli desert during the Harvard Expedition in 1994. We have provided map details for this reason and we welcome any informed commentary.

In addition to revisiting this previously documented stone, Viewzone also discovered a new collection of petroglyphs. These proved most interesting.</text>

Introduction and translations by Dr. James R. Harris
Expedition material and subsequent translations by Gary Vey.

Oral Tradition and History of the Ancient People

Information concerning the ancient ancestors of the Eastern Pueblos is scarce but certainly not totally missing. What contemporary descendants are able to tell us of their forefathers ranks high in value as we piece together the elements of this complex historical equation.

In 1976 a well educated and articulate Jemez Pueblo man named Joe S. Sando, son of Juanito Sando, published a book titled, The Pueblo Indians. Pages seventeen to nineteen of Chapter 2, summarizing most of the oral tradition concerning Eastern Pueblo origins known to Professor Sando. (See also the &quot;Historical Outline,&quot; pp. 207-208). Some quotes from his text follow: 

The people came from the north to their present areas of residence, from the place of origin in Shibapu, where they emerged from the underworld by way of a lake. 
I suggest that just as we speak of the Old and New Worlds being separated from each other by two great oceans, this ancient Pueblo tradition portrays a journey from an earlier world through water to the present world. From our studies of emergence symbols coupled with inscriptions it is clear that emergence from the first world to the fourth and present world does not end the emergence cycle. Rather we are continuing to emerge with a potential to reach the Seventh World and the realm of Yah, whose name appears so often in the inscriptions of the Ancients.

During their journeys they were led by the War Chief. This chief served for life. With his assistants and annually appointed captains and their staffs, they constituted a force responsible for clearing the path upon which the people traveled. And with them came the Great Spirit, and he guided the ancient ones through the many arduous tasks of daily life. For unknown ages the ancient people were led from place to place upon this great continent [North America]. Many of them finally settled in the four corners area [the junction of Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico], where they developed their civilization and settled for some hundreds of years before moving to their present homeland. As the ancient one related, it was in order to preserve the people from total annihilation that the Great Spirit impelled them to migrate. This they did, in groups and in different directions. Thus it is that the people created new dialects. 
The country where the ancient people lived was a vast open land of deserts, plains, and mountains. Here they built their villages and enhanced their lives. But they were filled with longing for perfection in their lives, harmony with their environment, and so they moved from time to time to other places with better sources of food and a better environment. (Sando 1975, p.17).
 
The monumental constructions and prosperous communities that spread over a wide area from northeastern Arizona to northeastern New Mexico are called to our attention by Sando. He was concerned with pointing out that the great success of the Pueblo people was maintained because when &quot;they came face to face with nature, [they] did not exploit her. They became part of the ecological balance instead of abusing and finally destroying it.&quot;(Sando, 1976, pp.18-19).

It seems probable that learning to live in harmony with nature was a long process (even for the ancients). The most ancient Hohokam prospered using channel irrigation and thus maximized the use of the waters of the Salt and Gila Rivers. A series of dry years resulted in abandoning channel communities and removing some to areas near the river and extending colonization establishments to the Verde, the Little Colorado, the San Juan, the Virgin, the Lower Colorado, and also the Sevier River.

Ancient tribes of the Southwest as envisioned and classified by modern anthropologists. 

These colonizations were sub-cultures of the Hohokam and their material remains were named by modern man as Sinagua, Anasazi, Fremont, Mogollon, and Patayan (the latter term is not a tribal designation but refers to a family of tribes located in the Lower Colorado River area). 

In these sub-cultures the building skills (stone construction), the agricultural technology and even the alphabetic writing system has survived on the rock inscriptions. The inscriptions seem to be most numerous in the early stages of the development of these sub-cultures (for example Anasazi, Basket-maker II, is the stage of the longest, oldest and most accurately constructed sign forms). The Classic period appears to have Great Kivas, and large condos but also to have lost completely the skill of writing and reading the ancient Southwestern script (or with the utilization of the Kiva, sacred things may have been written on perishable material kept in the Kiva).

The different names given to these cultures has suggested to the minds of most modern investigators that these were different peoples. May we suggest while their ancestral roots consisted of a hybrid made of Old Semitic speakers up from Mexico and the very ancient Desert Archaic people that were in the Southwest &quot;from of old,&quot; they were the same people whose culture was further modified by adapting to different environments and further encounters with other cultures.

Why do people think that if you wear different shoes, and have different colored dishes, with different designs and some different tools to work with, you are a different race of people?
 In May of 1980 I was in Albuquerque, to participate in an ARARA convention, and had an opportunity to visit with Joe Sando and his lovely wife at their home just outside of Albuquerque. One of the statements made by Joe, among others that have stuck in my mind, was, &quot;Why do people think that if you wear different shoes, and have different colored dishes, with different designs and some different tools to work with, you are a different race of people?&quot; Archaeologists and anthropologists have differentiated these ancient cultures on the basis of something as superficial as their material cultural remains with the result described above.

We now have something far less superficial to add to the unveiling of the origin of ancient cultures in the Southwest. We have a script of twenty two sounds, a language that gives it meaning, and small windows of history through which we can view the ancient religious ideas, and ethical values of these ancients.

The above remarks do not mean that we regard the classification and orderly identification of material cultural remains to have been a wasted effort. These laborious scientifically reconstructed patterns of material cultural movement are invaluable in the determination of places, times, and movements of peoples with the rock art inscriptions that are coexistent with their artifacts.

Since we are going to take a hard look at the inscriptions found in the Purgatory River (AKA &quot;Picket Wire River&quot;) area of Southeastern Colorado the scientific study unveiling the Largo-Gallina Phase in north-central New Mexico will help us to see that there are some very plausible ties between Taos and Picuris (also Tanoans in general), with the ancient peoples that produced these inscriptions.

In the description given by Wormington, this culture is described as &quot;Pueblo-like&quot; and fits into &quot;Great Pueblo&quot; times, although it is not entirely Anasazi. Tree-ring dates place the period of occupation from the beginning of the twelfth to the middle of the thirteenth century [a period when the great Southwestern cultures fade into small tribal units on the move].

It is possible that the inscriptions were composed centuries before this period and that reading and writing skills had been lost in earlier centuries.

Dwellings include pit houses, surface houses of uncoarsed stone, and surface houses of coursed stone. Still later structures seem to be small pueblos. The Largo county site is in on the west of the continental divide while Gallina is on the east slope of the continental divide. Similar characteristics are found at both sites. Walls of homes are often four feet thick. Floors are often covered with flagstone, and roofs are of pole and adobe foundation with flagstones providing a shingle effect. In summary, these sites have been described as &quot;a marginal Anasazi development from Basketmaker III to Pueblo I times&quot; and showing foreign influence from the north (H.M. Wormington, 1947, pp.102-105, 176).

The head waters of the Purgatory River are about twelve miles north of the Colorado - New Mexico border, just east of the continental divide.

The Purgatory River panels from the McGlone-Leonard collection were included in a study titled &quot;Age Determination of Petroglyphs in Southeastern Colorado&quot; by Dorn, McGlone &amp; Leonard, appearing in South-western Lore, Vol. 56, No. 2, pp.21 and another article in South-western Lore, by Gerald Blair, &quot;Archaeological Investigations In the Upper Purgatory River Drainage Southeastern Colorado,&quot; Vol. 41, No. 3, September 1975, p.41, contained a useful comment as follows: 

[The Purgatory River area] has a very complex history of occupation which has changed significantly previous ideas concerning the prehistory of the Purgatory drainage. An early pithouse on the western terrace has a ramp entry way not unlike Mogollon structures farther south in northern New Mexico. It is not unreasonable to expect Mogollon influence in the Trinidad region. 

 All of the panels shown in this article are but a small part of a collection made by Phil Leonard and William McGlone within the last decade. In 1992, Bill McGlone allowed Brian Stubbs to sketch a selection of these inscriptions from his file of sketches and photographs kept at his home in La Junta, Colorado. Later, Brian allowed me (J. Harris) to copy his set of inscriptions so that I would be able to do some independent studies and work with the signs. I selected about twenty of the most promising panels for their similarity to Old Negev and because they appeared to carry clear letter forms. A major interest in them was to obtain a large enough sample of signs to determine if we are dealing with the same alphabet found in Arizona and Utah. There is no doubt, from the sign studies, that the Purgatory Script has a close tie with Old Negev found throughout the desert Southwest and in the Negev region of the Middle East.

It is equally clear that the Purgatory script is a regional variation and, in addition to modifications in sign forms, may also have usage features that modestly differ from Old Negev of the more Western Pueblo ancestors.

Brian Stubbs also mentioned that he was working with photographs and slides when he obtained the sketches used in this article and that he could not always be certain of the correct orientation of the signs (i.e. right side up or up side down).

Translation Program In Progress Use Explorer only. 

This program is 250k and contains a javascript database created by Gary Vey, Viewzone Editor, that will operate on cross-platform browsers. It is presently 90 percent complete and will translate most of the old Negev script into familiar English phrases. To use this you must first understand how to read ligatures and other combined symbols. (See also FAQ.) This will take a few minutes to download but it is worthwhile and can be used on a laptop running a javascript browser. 
 
I (Harris) sent copies of the sketches back to McGlone and Leonard, asking that they identify any that were incorrectly sketched. They agreed to do so but never followed through. This could have meant that they changed their minds or that the orientations were all correct. If a few of the translated sketches are found to be up side down it will not change the general conclusions drawn here.

The panel selection is too small to attempt a reconstruction of the language and script usage characteristics but some tentative possibilities and tentative translations will be presented in this article.

We (Harris and Hone) would like to see Phil Leonard team up with a competent and courageous West Semitic scholar (one not afraid to challenge main stream canonized doctrine) and reconstruct the language and script usage in the Purgatory inscriptions (beginning where Harris and Hone left off).

We suggest that there is a very great possibility, indicated by both the language and the script, that these ancients who wrote the Purgatory River [or Picket Wire River] inscriptions, were descendents of the Old Semitic speakers up from Mexico that became the Hohokam. They were likely members of the colony that were sent to the Virgin River area and, sometime later, whose descendents moved East, mixing with more of their Desert Archaic cousins.

It is also quite possible that this eastward movement resulted in a loss of reading and writing skills which furthered diversity of dialects and languages. Pueblo brothers and sisters say &quot;hello&quot; to some of your ancestors, &quot;Shalom.&quot;

Ancient History from the Scribes of Purgatory
Commentary by Gary Vey

The petroglyphs of the Purgatory River (called &quot;Picket Wire&quot; River by the locals) are very old and worn by wind and the extreme temperatures of the region. The symbols are formed by pecking at the canyon wall with some sharp tool and the impressions, although once deep, are now very shallow and barely visible to the naked eye. [See close-up at right] In fact, the best way to view these petroglyphs is to approach the wall when the sun is at a right angle to the wall and will cast shadows in the tiny pits and grooves that are left in the stone.

The Purgatory River canyons were home to the Plains Indians, who found the area a good hunting ground. Thus, often the faint symbols of the ancient carvers have been covered with more recent art of the Ute and other tribes. It is only when one is trained to recognize the twenty two symbols of Old Negev, and the variants of each symbol to the region, that one can successfully identify a group or panel of the script.

The chart below shows some of the variants of the ancient alphabet as it was found in the Negev desert of Israel (known to have been made around 1500 BC) and in the Purgatory River canyons of Colorado. The corresponding Hebrew symbols are also shown.

You will note that each Old Negev symbol has a corresponding Hebrew character which represents a phonetic sound. A &quot;Yod&quot; will have the sound of a &quot;Y,&quot; while a &quot;He&quot; will have the sound of an &quot;H,&quot; and so on. As in Hebrew, the signs are often read from right to left, but not always. In ancient times there was really no convention for writing in a particular direction; however, the Purgatory scripts appear to use the right-to-left direction in most circumstances.

Another interesting and important feature of this ancient writing system is the use of what are called ligatures. Since the symbols are often made from basic geometric shapes, they can be combined in visually interesting ways to form words. An example of a ligature is shown on the right. Notice how the ligature combines two basic symbols to spell the name of the deity, Yah. The vowel, in this case an &quot;a&quot; is omitted out of respect for the deity, whose name was never written on either continent out of respect for its sacred invocation. Ligatures sometimes can be designed to imitate the concept that they represent and their instant recognition helped facilitate the translation.
 
Dr. James Harris has noted that, in the Sinai desert, certain symbols are sometimes enlarged, rotated or inverted to indicate the end of a word or phrase. He also has recognized that many archaic symbols, called ideograms, appear to add meaning to the script. Ideograms were also used by the Plains Indians as a kind of shorthand - the most widely used was the outline of a reclining figure (below) with a pipe or protrusion extending from the mouth. Ideograms such as this were used in the same manner as one would use &quot;once upon a time, long ago...&quot; to introduce a story or legend.

The method of translating the Purgatory River canyon symbols is fairly straight forward. Gary Vey has described many minor variants of the Colorado script from the Sinai version, but notes that these are only two letters of the alphabet. &quot;In both cases,&quot; says Vey, &quot;the people [in Colorado] reverted to a regional style based on the classic symbol but drawn their way.&quot; A group of Old Negev symbols is first identified and recorded. Any ligatures that appear are then broken down to their fundamental alphabetical elements and the Old Negev is then translated using old Hebrew sounds. The resulting language is then translated using an old Hebrew dialect. The following panel will illustrate this method.

Ancient History from the Scribes of Purgatory

Of the hundreds of panels located at this particular site, south of La Junta, Colorado, most were grouped in long, horizontal rows. Some of these rows extended almost 60 feet. Photographing a panel of this size was not anticipated at the time of Viewzone's 1998 Expedition, led by Gary Vey; however, thanks to the Polaroid Corporation, we have been given a hi-resolution camera which has enabled permanent digital records of this site to be made. We located three medium resolution photographs that were taken in the 1998 Expedition and were able to combine these digital images to illustrate a panel that is almost 6 meters square. This panel is shown on the right.

The canyon itself is the perfect place to use flooding techniques for farming and there is ample evidence of many thriving communities along the sunny side of the canyon walls. There is evidence of canopy construction from the pairs of holes in the canyon's western face. These would have supported wooden poles which would then become the supports for a roof. [In the linked photograph you can see the holes (white arrows) - and also a &quot;Yah&quot; symbol, presumably placed over the roof line as a sign of respect - and a curious petroglyph of a crib? (red arrows)].

The panel (right) shows some excellent examples of the Old Negev script and is almost free from the Plains Indian carvings that often make translations so difficult to read. 

This panel illustrates several &quot;ligatures&quot; which combine the basic alphabetical symbols. It also includes the utilization of &quot;ideograms&quot; such as &quot;the pillar of truth&quot; which denotes that the phrase is an important one whose validity and certainty are not to be doubted. 

Once the collection of symbols is copied, the flow and direction of the translation must be determined. In this panel the symbols begin in the upper left and move down. Then, the symbols are read from right to left, following the horizontal pattern, then they continue from top to bottom. An understanding of old Hebrew and a familiarity with Old Negev are assets that Dr. Harris, who translated this panel, has acquired in his years of studying such petroglyphs in the Sinai, Utah and Nevada. His initial translations are often right on target. On certain panels, he attempts to translate in different directions to see if the results vary or are still linguistically patent. It not uncommon to find a series of letters that reads from both directions and each meaning compliments the other. As Vey states, &quot;This is one way that this ancient language of 22 symbols and of words no longer than three characters could be so specific in meaning. Ligatures are another such tool, allowing the arrangement of symbols to be both 'read' in the traditional sense, and also 'recognized' by their configuration.&quot;  

The panel above was successfully organized as seen below:

As the First and the Last, He will be, He will be, Yah.
 
Fear the sound of increasing truth (pillar of truth) descending from my cover (hiding place).

Obviously, as with all of the translations, the context of the phrases cannot be known and so the exact meaning of the words is lost to time. This could have been a prayer or a song or an idiom expression.

Consider some of our common expressions like, &quot;The grass is always greener...&quot; or &quot;A stitch in time saves nine...&quot; These phrases could pose similar problems to future scholars of our language if they were to be interpreted literally. Perhaps &quot;increasing truth descending from my cover (hiding place)&quot; is another way of asking for blessings to be bestowed on one's home. 

In any case, this translation, and the several examples that follow, demonstrate the ability to give meaning to the Colorado petroglyphs and show a cultural link between these authors and their ancestors who lived in the middle east some 3500 years ago. 
 
The following examples are translations from the Purgatory River area which are based upon sketches that were drawn from slides and photographs of Bill McGlone, who hosted Viewzone's visit to the site in 1998. Bill had an extensive collection of photographs that he took of each panel of petroglyphs at different times of the day. He always attempted to photograph the canyon walls when the sun was at just the right angle to illuminate the faint depressions and his expertise in knowing the optimal time for each particular location allowed many of the most ancient petroglyphs to be seen when they would otherwise never have been noticed. Although we do not have the photographs to accompany these translations, Viewzone did, in fact, witness a majority of the collection being presented in this feature.

More ligatures from the &quot;mound.&quot; 

Dating techniques have placed the old negev style of writing, found on the most obvious and recent layers, to be a few hundred years BC. The hundreds of years difference in the use of old negev script in Israel and in Colorado is likely due to the spread and assimilation of this Semitic culture from their more ancient colonies in Mexico. Dr. Harris is especially careful in illustrating this in his book. Several layers deep there is still more old negev, suggesting an inhabitation period of substantial length.

Ted Barker and his wife, Alma, worked closely with McGlone for years. They have been responsible for many unique discoveries, such as the Solar alignment of certain symbols and shadows cast by geographic elements. Ted's knowledge of the area and its unpredictable terrain allowed the team to explore this extremely remote area of America. 

In this photograph you can see how the canyon walls have literally been ground to a flat finish by the millennia of script. The interesting &quot;figure&quot; in the far right of the picture is actually made up entirely of old negev characters. Some of the older and more abstract petroglyphs lie hidden beneath these more recent creations. With each harsh, hot summer and frigid winter, these petroglyphs sustain the effects of cracking and flaking. Unless they are documented soon, an important part of early American history will be lost forever.

Since this preliminary publication on Viewzone.com, we have made provisional arrangements to accompany Dr. James Harris to Cairo and the Negev region to document the widdle-east version of this alphabet system. We will then be comparing this, along with attempted translations, as we examine the Colorado site in mid-Spring. A translation program has been designed that converts symbols from negev to english meanings and is available at www.viewzone.com/negev/z.html. It has a database that is 70 percent complete and is a work in progress. Some examples of translations which utilized this program can be seen at www.viewzone.com/negev.protection.html.

The translation program is only as good as the data which is entered. The sequence of letters is not covered by any known convention, and therefore some interpretation of the pattern is needed. Most, but not all, Colorado petroglyphs are read from right-to-left. With a stacked ligature, bottom-to-top reading is usually associated with references to God, while the reverse is true for earthly matters. With experience, complex ligatures can be successfully broken down into their correct sequence and will result in accurate translations.

Distinguishing between word groups was accomplished by repeating the last letter in a word or phrase. A double letter, therefore, is a helpful indicator of the sequence with which old Negev alphabetical letters should be read. This rule is also not adhered to completely and some scripts simply end with no duplicity.</text>

The photograph above is of the most famous &quot;old Negev&quot; script found in North America. Heavily chalked and scrutinized by the likes of Barry Fell and other epigraphers, no logical translation has ever been made and published of this script. Until now. 

We are using McGlone's own drawings of this panel and have duplicated this below to allow the script to be seen more clearly.

http://www.viewzone.com/negev442.jpg

You will note that we have broken the script into word groups, starting from the right and working towards the left. Translations can be verified by using the on-line negev translation program. We will explain each section here.

Section 1 consists of a ligature formed by the letters Tsadeh and Lamed. 

Tsel =shadow, shade, protection. 

Section 2 consists of a large Yod. This is interpreted as a shorthand for OY! or a sign of exclamation. Thus, the first word group is being emphasized (i.e. &quot;Shade!&quot;) 

Section 3 begins with a horizontal Lamed. This indicates that the Lamed is to be read as a preposition &quot;of, at, to, for...&quot; The remaining ligature consists of a Khaf+two Lameds, followed by a large Yod. KLLY= for the public, general, commonplace person...  

Section 4 consists of two vertical Lameds. 

LUL=were it not for... or because of... provided by... 

Section 5 shows a curved Resh followed by an extended ligature of Khaf plus Alef plus Lamed. 

Rakka El = temple of El. 

Section 6 consists of a single Lamed, followed by two Nun. 

Lina = lodgings or accommodations (literally, &quot;stay the night!&quot;). 

So far, this group of signs appears to be a sort of advertisement for staying, in effect, ...at the temple of &quot;El&quot; protection, shade and accommodations are provided to the general public... All of these translations were made by converting the &quot;old Negev&quot; symbols into their corresponding Hebrew sounds and then using a Hebrew to English lexicon which is encoded in the Negev translation program. Although the program is not entirely complete, most of the common words will be found if it is used correctly. Hopefully this will further the effort to gain acceptance by traditional historians by first gaining the support of non-scholastics who can translate these important links to our past with a minimum of bias.

Viewzone would like to hear from any attempts at translating in the field. We hope to share more detailed transcripts in the near future.</text>

Font: Latin Extended

In Europe, Latin script is used for a large number of languages which belong to diverse groups including Romance, Germanic, Slavic and Turkic. Because of the economically dominant role played by West European and North American countries in recent history, the typographic professions have catered first to their typographic needs. Consequently, the set of characters which serve West European languages (including English) has become the de facto standard. Through the technological development brought on by computers and communications, this process has been further accelerated. So-called 'standard Latin' or 'Latin-1' character sets, and consequently fonts, support the major West European languages including English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. As a result of the prevalence of this terminology, fonts which support other Latin-script languages, including minority languages in Western Europe -- have been grouped under the broad term 'Extended Latin'. The major languages supported by various 'Extended-Latin' character sets include Czech, Croatian, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Turkish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Lappish, Welsh, Maltese, Vietnamese, as well as a host of African, Polynesian and other languages. As we shall see below, practically every use of Latin script for a language other than Latin could be rightly called 'extended Latin'.

The Romans honed the Latin (or Roman) alphabet based on that of their once powerful neighbors on the Italian peninsula, the Etruscans. The latter had, in turn, evolved their alphabet based on a western version of the Greek alphabet. Intending only to write their own language, Latin, little did the Romans know that they would one day be credited with inventing the most popular script of all time. Today, Latin script has in every sense become the first global alphabet. It is quite ironic that English, the language in which the largest number of Latin-script books have been published, is not closely related to Latin. In previous centuries, Spanish, Portuguese and French, all three close relatives of Latin, have played the role of emissaries for Latin script. As an alphabet of choice, Latin script has become the lowest common denominator. Typically, when speaking of 'transliterating' a language, one usually means that the language is written in Latin letters. Behind this choice is the implied notion that the audience of people which can decipher Latin script is larger than that of any other script. For instance, when the People's Republic of China decided on Pinyin as the standard transliteration scheme for Mandarin Chinese, it based it on Latin script. Likewise, the various transliteration schemes for Japanese use Latin (Romaji) script. However, what is common, familiar, and even popular, is often not without fault. As a writing system for diverse groups of languages, Latin script is riddled with deficiencies. As we know it today, the Latin alphabet consists of 26 letters, 5 of which represent vowels while the remainder are consonants. Ironically, the repertoire of the alphabet did not develop into its currentform until after the demise of Latin as a vernacular. In fact, the small forms (alternatively, miniscule or lower-case) of the letters did not fully mature until the 8th century AD. However limited the basic Latin alphabet may be, it has been effectively extended through a host of ingenious techniques which include the use of accent and diacritic marks, small appendages, digraphs and even trigraphs. When we consider the phonological features of Latin in light of all possible, human-produced phonological features, it comes as no surprise that the repertoire of Latin script needed to be amplified. For example, Latin had no symbol for the initial sound in the English word 'shell'. As a result, English uses the digraph 'sh' to stand for the sound, German uses the trigraph 'sch', while some other languages resort to placing an accent over an 's'. The following are a just a few of the many phonological phenomena which were not foreseen for the original Latin repertoire: tone (as in Vietnamese or Chinese), pharyngeal sounds (as in Maltese), clicks (as in some African languages), ejectives (as in some Amerindian languages), alveolo-palatal fricative (as in Polish). Yet, in some way, all these phenomena have been represented successfully in Latin script, thus raising it to the rank of 'global alphabet'.

EPISODE ONE:  &quot;THE GLOBAL CONDITION&quot;

From Public Radio International, I'm Christopher Lydon.  This is the Whole Wide World.  
Kicking the tires of globalism, also known as &quot;globaloney,&quot; the &quot;ism&quot; nonetheless of our age.  A 
complex web of money, ideas, disease, culture, terror, hope, pollution, warfare, and conscience 
pulling the world together, tearing the world apart, or maybe both.  There's a doctrine of global 
markets for Jeffrey Sachs to decipher…mobile capital and still a lot of people stuck in misery.  
Globalism is also the instant-message Internet, world music and literature, connections that Zadie 
Smith and the architect Tay Kheng Soon will think about out loud.  How is it the so-called 
&quot;world community&quot; is coming apart around war with Iraq amid the global visions of a more 
functional human family?  We're talking about global trends that could kill us, or make us wiser, 
more human; and we're sorting them, next…on the Whole Wide World.

[Music]

CL: I'm Christopher Lydon…and this is the Whole Wide World.  The mission of this radio series 
is to pull apart the riddles of global-ism and to thread our own path through the contradictions 
that come with a shrinking planet. Six billion of us earthlings can feel it now, that we're 
inextricably bound in many dimensions – environment, economics, culture, the genomics of our 
one global species.  At the same time, though, lopsided measures of wealth and tools, toys and 
power, and the politics of terror seem quite capable of undoing everything.  This hour we'll take 
a short journey from big-picture economics to architecture to literary fiction.  For much of the 
first half hour, we're talking with a development economist who's chafing at the limits of his 
science and of US politics.
Jeffrey Sachs:  It's a little preposterous of a population that's five percent of the world's 
population that absolutely depends for its prosperity on global peace, to think that we will bully 
the world…

CL: But there's a &quot;back of the book&quot; here, too, of writers and artists talking about globalism, and 
plain folk with their own take on it.
[Montage of quotes]

Colin Channer: We people in small countries can now engage global cultures without necessarily 
becoming destroyed by it.

Amber: The Romans understood globalism, the British understood globalism, the Russians 
understood it.  I don't think Americans quite get that. 

Zadie Smith: I think there is an odd idea amongst a kind of white majority that minorities 
consider themselves from an attitude of otherness; they don't. 

Tay Kheng Soon: Can you really be a global citizen? I doubt it. Am I Chinese? Or am I 
Singaporean? Or am I a citizen of the world?

CL: We'll also retrace some of my steps in the past year doing talk radio in the Caribbean, in 
West Africa, and in Southeast Asia, trying to show that a local conversation can strike a global 
spark, live on the Internet. 

[Montage]
…We have been independent for forty years and yet we still go cap in hand begging…
…America has this view of itself that is just really amusing. That they have a basketball match – 
the East Coast versus the West Coast – and it's a &quot;world tournament&quot;…
…Everything in Singapore is about fabrication; it's an air-conditioned nation…
…We're tired of hearing from everybody else but ourselves….

CL:  I started to write my own alphabetical list of the symptoms of our global condition: A is for 
AIDS, the pandemic; B is for Bono, or Bob Marley, for that matter; C is for climate change; D is 
for Davos, the bankers' forum in the Alps. E is for Ebola and the killer viruses; F is for the 
financial markets that never sleep, trading yen, euros, and dollars. G is for the genome, the 
universal code of our human architecture; H is for the hungry two billion, living on less than $2 a 
day; I is for the Internet, the free, global instant-message service; I is also for imperialism, the no-
no name for military, financial, and cultural domination; and on through the alphabet down to Y 
for the global musician Yo-Yo Ma, and Z for Zadie Smith, novelist of the globally cross-
pollinated North London scene that's Jamaican, Bengali, Jewish, Chinese, Pakistani, and 
(vestigially) English. 

Zadie Smith [reading]: This has been the century of strangers: brown, yellow, and white; this has 
been the century of the great immigrant experiment. 

CL: Listen to this thematic fragment of what, I think, is a prophetic global novel, Zadie Smith's 
&quot;White Teeth.&quot;  She leaves you no doubt that coming out of &quot;a century of strangers&quot; we've 
arrived at a new place.  She's writing about London, and a neighborhood where the whole British 
Empire seems to have come home to roost.  But try this out at a city playground near you.  She's 
noticing kids with a mix of front and back names, like Quang O'Rourke and Isaac Leung, names 
that tell you: something's changed. 
[Music]

ZS: It's only this late in the day that you can walk into a playground and find Isaac Yeung by the 
fishpond, Danny Rahman in the football cage, Quang O'Rourke bouncing a basketball, and Irie 
Jones humming a tune. Children with first- and last-names on a direct collision course. Names 
that secrete within them mass exodus, cramped boats and planes, cold arrivals, medical check-
ups. It is only this late in the day, and possibly only in Willesden, that you can find best friends, 
Sita and Sharon, constantly mistaken for each other because Sita is white (her mother liked the 
name) and Sharon is Pakistani (her mother thought it best - less trouble). Yet, despite all the 
mixing up, despite the fact that we have finally slipped into each other's lives with reasonable 
comfort (like a man returning to his lover's bed after a midnight walk), despite all this, it is still 
hard to admit that there is no one more English than the Indian, no one more Indian than the 
English. There are still young white men who are angry about that, who will roll out at closing 
time into the poorly lit streets with a kitchen knife wrapped in a tight fist.  But it makes an 
immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist, scared of infection, penetration, 
miscegenation, when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears - 
dissolution, disappearance.

CL: We'll come back to Zadie Smith's vision of a hybridizing world.  Vegetables before desert, 
though; dismal science before design issues. Let's suppose that globalization is first and 
fundamentally an economic doctrine, premised on growth through free trade; it's a vision of open 
markets around the whole planet, a trading world without borders. Jeffrey Sachs is an eminence 
that the world and I trust. He's a development economist; his head is a work in progress. A boy-
wonder on the Harvard faculty, Sachs became the famous &quot;shock therapist&quot; of the late 1980s, 
applying market principles to the sick economies of the Communist Bloc. The cold shower 
worked for Poland, then it gave Russia something like pneumonia. But by then Jeff Sachs was 
famous for other remedies: he coaches the Irish rocker Bono of U2 in the campaign for debt 
forgiveness, instead of endless austerity, as the way to treat bankrupt countries.  Jeff Sachs has 
moved to the Earth Institute at Columbia [University] in New York to be closer to the Kofi 
Annan, the UN, and the fight on AIDS and other world epidemics.  I began by asking him if the 
&quot;masters of the universe&quot; that he knows well and moves among know what they're doing.

JS:  No. I think that's painfully clear. People live in their own worlds, not necessarily in the 
worlds and the realities inhabited by billions of other people on the planet. No, they don't have 
the expertise to understand the deeper problems. It's fairly frightening. Certainly we're living in a 
dangerous time right now. We seem to be at the edge of war, of all sorts of conflict. We are 
facing monumental challenges whether it's a disease pandemic in AIDS that is the biggest killer 
epidemic in modern history; whether it's a change in climate that we feel or droughts this 
summer, the floods in Europe, and the floods in Asia, and the failed monsoons in India, and the 
drought in southern Africa, and, no, the expertise is not where it needs to be; it's not with the 
leadership.  Even the experts don't talk to each other; they don't understand how their problems 
are connected.  We're somehow not naturally geared to even understand the problems across the 
street much less around the world.  So while you talk about a &quot;converging planet,&quot; perhaps the 
most shocking thing is really how divergent our lives are right now…the billions of people who 
are struggling to survive and the billion or so very rich people who sometimes seem to be 
completely unaware of their presence until disaster hits. 

CL: That's the way it feels to me and I'm sort of the more scared to hear you say it, but is it a 
matter of expertise? Or is it a matter of heart, understanding, intention?  

JS: I think heart and intention is the starting point because that would tell you: gee, I better really 
understand something about this issue, I better not just dismiss the poor and the dying around the 
world out of profound ignorance, as US officials have done implicitly and sometimes shockingly 
explicitly when they've said: &quot;We can't treat people with AIDS, they can't tell time. We can't 
address their problems…&quot;

CL: You mean they'll forget to take a pill or something…

JS:  They won't know that it's morning or night; therefore, we're just going to have to stand by 
and let 'em die.  And of course that's a matter of heart and ethics at the start, but then it really 
does get into knowledge: what to do, how to do it, how do you mobilize goodwill to real results? 
How do you make connections from community to community?  How do you handle some of 
these big challenges that are real, global challenges, much more complicated than a lot of the 
things that we normally grapple with?  

CL: I want to just ask you to stand back and decode this global thing and the many globalisms, I 
mean, economic doctrine about the free flow of capital, somewhat less free flow of goods and 
workers; environmental globalism, this dread of climate change [and] habitat collapse. There's 
the whole refugee matter, spilling here and there and having very scary effects in places like 
France and Australia. There's global disease. There's also global medicine and global pharmacies. 
But I also want to talk about the genome, which is…It seems to me we forget this enormous sea 
change in the way all of us think. We know now, as we didn't know when I was in college, that 
it's one species with a universal grammar, a whole host of universal human qualities. It's one 
brain, probably, the world over and all the old differences of race and complexion and hair kink 
and whatnot are very, very recent and cosmetic things. I said this to a wonderful man in Africa 
and he said, you know, it's good to know that biological connection but the disparity of social 
circumstances has never been greater, and he talked about, you know, we read about Chinese 
men putting themselves in the cargo bay as a way to get to England, or…but he was talking 
about, not just boat people [but] people virtually crawling across the Sahara Desert to get to 
menial jobs in Greece, say, but he also said a fascinating thing, right out loud, on the radio, he 
said, you know, my friends and I talk about...if you put a slave ship in the harbor at Accra in 
Ghana and said - we're going to America, risky passage, maybe generations of agony, but we're 
going to America, he said, it would be full overnight. And that's Ghana, that's in many respects a 
model…a model country. How do we deal with this…you know…these many, many strands? 

JS: You made pretty clear and pretty vivid how much upheaval in our world there really is. This 
is the story of our generation. It's the story of recent generations. The world's changed in such 
fundamental ways over the course of just three or four lifetimes that we're just trying to race to 
get our minds around some of these realities. You know it took thousands and thousands of years 
for very, very slow growth of the human population to fill the world and all of a sudden, about 
two hundred years ago, the population explosion, we've got six billion people on the planet now; 
two centuries ago it was one sixth of that – about a billion people. The fact that our technologies 
have thrown us together so that people who are literally at the edge of death may be bombarded 
with television images of Beverly Hills and are somehow the most impoverished and the richest 
are thrown together in this common cultural space - we've never had that before.  And our ethics 
did not prepare us for this. Our ethics taught us a lot about living within our local communities, 
but it often poisoned our capacity to bridge across communities, much less across different 
regions. It seems to be our fate after September 11 to fall into Sam Huntington's trap of the &quot;clash 
of civilizations,&quot; as if somehow Christianity and Islam are going to be off to war with each other. 
We seem to be condemned through our simplicities and simple mindedness, our inability to have 
real discussion across cultures, our tribalism still in the early years of the 21st century, [our 
inability] to pull back from war, which could be absolutely devastating. 

CL: Let's talk about that, I mean, the Bush Doctrine...we're number one forever...we'll intervene 
where we choose with friends if possible, but on our own if not; it's basically our way or no 
way... 

JS:  It's a little preposterous. It's a little preposterous of a population that's five percent of the 
world's population that absolutely depends for its prosperity on global peace to think that we will 
bully the world. When I go to China, as I do regularly, and you see these huge cities and the 
technological advances and the buildings literally going up before your eyes and literally around 
the clock, whether they're putting up new floors at 2 a.m. because they can't ...it's 
just…economic growth without limit.  You understand that we're really not the center of the 
universe; we're not even the center of our planet. It's not for us to bully the whole world. It won't 
work in the end, but could do a lot of damage trying, no question about it. 

CL:  I wanted to bring Jeffrey Sachs back to economics and the scorecard of development.  For a 
lot of poor countries the game is about getting loans and blessings from the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund.  But the Nobel-Prize economist, Joseph Stiglitz, who served high 
in the Clinton administration, and is now Jeff Sach's colleague at Columbia, has just blown a 
very big whistle on the development game; it's sort of a shell game, he has written, an invitation 
to still deeper debt. 

CL:  What does the world do with this kind of candor? 

JS:  There's been a huge progress from world markets and international trade for a lot of people. 
Think about China. It's booming. And a boom in China…that means 1.3 billion people with 
significant, even unprecedented economic advance in the last generation, heavily due to 
globalization. 

CL: But not to the World Bank and not to…

JS: Oh, certainly not to the specific advice of the INS and the World Bank.

CL: But not to foreign loans is what I mean . . .

JS: In the case of China, it's been very clever policies to attract foreign investment, the true 
globalization, a lot of American and European and Hong Kong and other factories built on 
China's coasts now employing tens of millions of people putting out all the goods we buy all the 
time. It's the biggest export boom in the history of the world. So that's globalization that's 
successful.... But on the globalization scorecard: has globalization worked for Malawi? Has 
globalization worked for Tanzania? The answer is: absolutely no!  Is it because they're just 
bloody-minded dictatorships?  No, those two countries happen to be multi-party democracies 
where the presidents are real leaders; they're a sophisticated people. But the problem is that with 
the malaria, with the AIDS epidemic, with El Nino, with the droughts, with soil depletion, with 
impoverishment, globalization doesn't reach them and the IMF and the World Bank advice in 
those countries has been absolutely dreadful.  It was absolutely destructive of what those 
countries needed. What those countries needed was a health care system. What those countries 
needed was not the budget cuts that the IMF championed. What those countries needed was help.  
And the IMF didn't say, we bring help. The IMF said, we bring the message of budget cuts or 
else. So, globalization is complicated.  And, sometimes the winners are winners because of good 
policies; sometimes the winners are winners because they happen to be on the border of a rich 
region. Sometimes geography is devastating as it is in drought-ridden Malawi right now and, 
frankly, that seems to be as much related to the warm waters of the Eastern Pacific and the 
current El Nino as it is [to] anything that President Muluzi is trying to do to keep his people alive 
and that interconnection of climate, population change, disease…it's complicated, it's off the 
radar screen of our policy makers. They don't care anyway, particularly about &quot;these little places 
with dying people.&quot; And, by the way, Chris, you turn around and then the story is:  Oh! The 
Congo!  This place we could care less about may be a place where uranium is now going to 
be…is being smuggled or has been smuggled or could be smuggled to Iraq and, all of a sudden, 
these meaningless little places start looming in significance for the United States. The truth is: in 
an inter-connected world, it all matters and it matters not only for our heart; it matters for the 
most practical ways as well. We have a million people with AIDS.  AIDS started in a jungle in 
West Africa, according to the genomic evidence. AIDS wasn't picked up as a disease that spread 
probably from a chimpanzee to a human maybe having eaten bush meat or hunting in the bush. It 
wasn't picked up in Africa. It probably fulminated in Africa for years, but since there's no health 
care system, since there's no disease surveillance, we just sat back and all of a sudden the whole 
world is fighting this pandemic. Are we interconnected with the jungles of West Africa?  You're 
darn right we are….in the most direct and tragic and painful way.  Are we interconnected with 
what you would have probably put on the map as the most remote place in the world that couldn't 
conceivably do us any harm (of course I'm thinking of Afghanistan), of course we found out 
we're interconnected with Afghanistan.  Do we have a stake in the Congo?  Well, if it's uranium 
that's getting to Saddam's regime, you're darn right we have a stake in the Congo.  But we're not 
getting geared up to think about these things. We're geared up to believe that we run things, that 
it doesn't matter what happens in the rest of the world, that we really don't have to care.  When I 
say &quot;we,&quot; I actually don't mean the American people, I mean the way that the political system and 
our leadership has just missed the truth on this and is missing the truth right now.  

CL: Listening to Jeffrey Sachs, it strikes me now that part of what we're hearing is a brilliant and 
idealistic man catching up with the limits of his best thinking, the limits on a lot of good effort.  
Jeff Sachs made house calls as an &quot;economy doctor&quot; to Bolivia and to Vietnam in the mid-1980s, 
with a bag full of monetary theory.  I was amazed to hear—and I think he was amazed to say—
that, at that time, it didn't occur to him that geography had something to do with the economic 
development paths of Bolivia, which is 13,000 feet up in the Andes, and for Vietnam, in the 
thriving Pacific Basin.

JS: And this obvious geographical point, it was so trivial that it sounds preposterous.  Not only 
was it not in my own observation at the beginning, but it's not even in the professional 
observations today…because if you ask what's wrong with country x to a typical economist, 
they'll give you a long list of economic variables, they won't mention whether there's malaria, 
they won't mention whether you're on an earthquake zone, they won't mention whether you're 
landlocked at 13,000 feet – completely unrealistic because there's an incapacity, it seems, to 
move beyond the stovepipe of the narrow discipline to address other issues.

CL:  So, global experience keeps a good economist humble, and it's kept Jeff Sachs moving – 
from the classroom to the world, from debt issues to diseases, from a Detroit boyhood and an 
American perspective to putting his big hopes with the UN.  Doing radio myself on the road this 
past year, I've sometimes felt like a very poor man's Jeff Sachs, catching up with the many 
conundrums of growth and prosperity. You see spectacular differences in the trajectories of 
development between say Ghana, poorer today than it was on liberation 45 years ago, and 
Singapore, which got its independence from Britain and Malaysia [at] about the same time and 
now lives richer than most Americans do at home. You see very different shades of post-colonial 
feeling and politics: Ghana and Singapore have both come to love the Brits. The Queen of 
England is a celebrity and a friend, as she is in Jamaica.  It's so unlike Zimbabwe and the raw 
anti-colonial anger that President Mugabe could still whip up in his reelection campaign. There 
are terrific contrasts in cultural vitality, as well.  And, oddly enough, Ghana turns the tables on 
Singapore there. Ghanaians are hugely invested in their musical voice and its place in the world. 
What is Africa's comparative advantage in the cultural marketplace, I asked. The bold answer 
was: Africa supplies the content.  In dance, design, and music, Africans see themselves as &quot;the 
source.&quot;  Rich Singapore, on the other hand, feels voiceless. And as a young playwright said to 
me on the air in Singapore: &quot;Even if we find this voice, we wouldn't want to recognize it unless 
someone from the US or the West would give us a prize for it.&quot; 

Chien Tse Chong: We don't really value what we have.  Everything that we need could be easily 
imported, so why struggle over local culture, why struggle with a local voice, why struggle with 
anything that is indigenous.  

CL: Which gets back to the conversation with Jeffrey Sachs…The Ghanaians know their music 
and they know their culture, they know their history and they're deeply invested in it. The 
Singaporeans basically have bought Hollywood and Bollywood and they'll tell you [they] don't 
know who [they] are anymore.  They all want to talk, that's one thing in common... 

JS: Especially with you, Chris 

CL: Well, they bear with me…but um…the question is…I mean…none of the old, single 
answers apply.  But are there still answers, Jeff, in figuring this puzzle? 

JS: There really are answers and some are obvious, some are not so obvious, some require a lot 
more work.  So, if you see in Ghana that malaria remains, as it does, absolutely rife in the cities, 
in the countryside, killing children still in very large numbers, you have to say, &quot;Well that has to 
be attended to.&quot;  It's pretty much common sense that each society, if it is going to have a chance, 
has to have healthy, surviving children that go to school and that therefore can participate 
economically in our global conversation, in our global economy. Singapore, as an island without 
the mosquito vectors that Ghana has, didn't have that problem. Singapore also, by being on the 
sea path between China and Europe and Japan and Europe, has about the best real estate in the 
world from the point of view of an international trading system. It was the center of the trading 
route.  So when Lee Kwan Yew [Senior Minister of the Republic of Singapore] boasts about all 
that he's done (and he's done a great job), if he were out in the South Pacific, it would not be 
Singapore. He was just where he was because he had the best location in the world from the point 
of international trade. Well, Ghana, you got to get the port working…it's not…it's another 
obvious point.  So you look at these problems and here comes the real rub: Ghana is in a trap of 
poverty, it just can't afford to fight malaria and keep the children in school and pay the doctors 
enough not to leave.  And you can do it on a napkin; you can do it on a spreadsheet; you can do it 
on a full-blown budget.  They can't afford to get out of poverty; that's the trap that they're in right 
now. 

CL: That's one important point that Jeff Sachs says he got right from the beginning: there are 
certain desperate cases that cannot save themselves. 

JS:  I always did know from the practical experience (and I hope from the heart in the right place) 
that a place like Bolivia needed help.  I knew from the first day of Poland; if we didn't cancel the 
debts, Poland could not get out of Communism.  It all adds up to continuing crisis for Ghana and 
all of Singapore's success (and it's a success of globalization) doesn't prove the case that 
globalization works willy-nilly for Ghana, or for it's neighbors in West Africa, or for many other 
places in the world where it isn't working. 

CL: So there's an uncomforting overview from a congenitally cheerful economist who says that 
his colleagues are not factoring in disease or population or climate, that the policy guys are in a 
bubble, that our better public instincts are not engaged yet.  Coming up next…the globalization 
of arts and letters.  You're listening to the Whole Wide World, produced in association with 
WGBH Radio Boston, from PRI, Public Radio International.

[Music]

CL: It's my reflex by now, with an idea as broad as &quot;globalism,&quot; to ask: what do the writers 
think?  Because the poets and novelists always feel the trends first, and because the Salman 
Rushdie class of writers has been working these new, international themes and markets for years.  
Zadie Smith's novel &quot;White Teeth&quot; is a favorite among the rising global literati.  Still in her mid-
twenties, Zadie Smith is a sort of embodiment of her global theme: English father, Jamaican 
mother; she's a prophet of what looks from the outside like a sort of human hybridity. 

ZS:  I think &quot;hybridity&quot; is only a notion to people who aren't mixed. To people who are mixed, 
it's as much a fact as having two arms. I never considered it. It's just something that I am and I've 
always enjoyed being, not knowing any other kind of life, which is how we all are. 

CL: I had been reading &quot;White Teeth,&quot; underlining, scratching notes and thinking: this is a 
perfect distillation of the global idea, when literally I bumped into her in a Harvard Square 
bookstore, and then asked her to talk with us.  

ZS: I think there is an odd idea amongst a kind of white majority that minorities consider 
themselves from an attitude of otherness. They don't. They just walk around having themselves 
as central subjects the way everybody else does. It's impossible to consider yourself as &quot;the 
other,&quot; or &quot;the black guy,&quot; or &quot;the weird Chinese girl.&quot;  No one thinks of themselves that 
way…and politics based on that idea don't make any sense to me; it's an unnatural position.  

CL: One of Zadie Smith's characters in &quot;White Teeth&quot; is an English-Irish horticulturist.  Joyce is 
her name.  She writes gardening books and proclaims hybridity for plants and for people as the 
key to survival in the tough new climate.  In short, we've got to improve our human genes by 
mixing them up, just as we've done to our flowerbeds. 

ZS [reading]:  If it is not too far-fetched a comparison, the sexual and cultural revolution we've 
experienced these past two decades is not a million miles away from the horticultural revolution 
that has taken place in our herbaceous borders and sunken beds. Where once we were satisfied 
with our biennials, poorly colored flowers thrusting weakly out of the earth and blooming a few 
times a year (if we were lucky), now we are demanding both variety and continuity in our 
flowers, the passionate colors of exotic blooms 365 days a year…. In the garden, as in the social 
and political arena, change should be the only constant. Our parents and our parents' petunias 
have learned this lesson the hard way. The March of History is unsentimental, tramping over a 
generation and its annuals with ruthless determination. The fact is, cross-pollination produces 
more varied offspring, which are better able to cope with a changed environment. It is said cross- 
pollinating plants also tend to produce more and better-quality seeds. If my one year-old son is 
anything to go by (a cross-pollination between a lapsed Catholic horticultural feminist and an 
intellectual Jew!) then I can certainly vouch for the truth of this. Sisters, the bottom line is this: if 
we are to continue wearing flower in our hair into the next decade, they must be hardy and ever 
at hand, something only the truly mothering gardener can ensure. If we wish to provide happy 
playgrounds for our children, and corners of contemplation for our husbands, we need to create 
gardens of diversity and interest. Mother Earth is great and plentiful, but even she requires the 
occasional helping hand!

CL: The hybrids see this world differently from the monoculturists; they are a lot more relaxed 
about diversity. 

CC: I don't think that globalism will necessarily diminish the variety of literary voices. 
[Music] 

CL: I met another hybrid soul in Jamaica, Colin Channer, a novelist who moves easily between 
Kingston and Brooklyn, New York. He is rooted in a small island that has global ambitions – in 
Olympic bobsledding (quite astonishingly!), also in track, in pop music, and in literature.  What I 
kept seeing in Jamaica was the invasion of American brands and voices: CNN, KFC, BET – 
modern vehicles of what the Jamaicans label &quot;cultural imperialism.&quot;  But what Colin Channer 
also sees is a new context where small countries get relevant in the big world. Their leverage is 
what Colin Channer calls the &quot;reggae aesthetic.&quot;  

CC: Reggae is more than a music, you know.  Reggae took the Jamaican people out of a kind of 
binary discussion with Britain about colonialism and slavery. It broadened the range of subjects 
that one could talk about. Reggae also had this really broad emotional palette, from anger to 
meditation to excitement to romance to eroticism.  It's politics, Rastafarianism, it's socialism, it's 
philosophy, it's nutrition...(laughs) and weed, great weed, right?  Reggae demonstrated a model 
of a narrative art that was its real power.  One of the greatest achievements of reggae music was 
that it presented to Caribbean authors a model of art that could bring the ideas from little people 
in a small place to the world.  Now that is a model of assurance and, as V.S. Naipaul says, every 
writer needs a tradition to lean on (I am paraphrasing Naipaul, right?), needs a tradition to lean 
on.  Reggae gave the Caribbean writer that assurance that there was this tradition (right?) that 
was respected around the world (right?), and that it was okay to speak with passion about what 
you were seeing outside your window with assurance that it would be relevant  to somebody far, 
far away.  You know, when Bob Marley sings about…sings &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;…and when 
Bob Marley talks about Trenchtown, and when he talks about Trenchtown with the assurance 
that everybody else will understand it (right?), Marley is absolutely right, because somebody 
listening to &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; in Johannesburg will realize that Johannesburg is Trenchtown. 
Or somebody listening to &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; in Alabama will realize that Alabama is 
Trenchtown.  Before reggae in Caribbean literature, there was always a tacit understanding that 
our experience was not universal, that it was local (right?) and that Dickens' world was universal 
(right?) or, you know, that the world of Hemingway was universal (right?).  Reggae showed us 
that our world was universal but that the universal power of our art would only come when we 
wrote so specifically about our local (right?) that it would put somebody far away into the 
mindscape of our experience, and that is where the work would get its universal power. In other 
words, the less you try to be yourself, the less relevant you'll be, the less global, the less universal 
you will be.  Creating art comes from being intensely local, intensely specific, so that people can 
then see, and in clear relief, how your life mirrors their own. 

CL: The very Jamaican sound of that housing project in Kingston, Trenchtown, still resonates 
around the world.  But for a lot of artists and cultural figures elsewhere, there can be torment in 
this modern transition – a sort of torture in finding a new identity. I felt it specially in Singapore, 
the richest little city-state since imperial Rome or perhaps 14th century Venice.  Against the 
peacock skyline of modern, global Singapore, there was an architect I wanted to hear from again.  
He had said something I'll never forget: that the human spirit has been proven invincible in the 
face of adversity, but it may well be defenseless in the grip of wealth.  Tay Kheng Soon has 
designed striking modern buildings, homes, temples, a huge downtown hospital. He draws on a 
lot of Malayan motifs, and he builds for a tropical environment. His beef with most of 
Singapore's new, world-class profile is that it ignores both history and geography. It has forgotten 
its &quot;Asian-ness&quot; and its equatorial climate…and it has patched over what's missing in 
authenticity with imitation and fizzy emptiness. 

TKS: Well, the modern architecture in Singapore is completely copied from elsewhere. I mean, 
there's hardly any innovation at all. Most of the big buildings here have been designed by 
American architects. There is nothing so wonderful about it. We are living in the tropics and yet 
these buildings are huge energy guzzlers. They are uncomfortable. Street life around these mega- 
structures [is] totally poverty stricken; I mean, the city is empty at night. The central business 
district, like all the central business districts which we copy, has no life. Why should that be so?  
I mean, why are planners and architects constantly genuflecting on the altars of western taste?  I 
can't understand this.

CL: In the global alphabet, K is for kitsch, the bad art of imitation and bubbly banality. 

TKS: I describe &quot;kitsch&quot; as a narcotic, you know, because the pain of everyday existence is just 
too great. So we need a kind of…an aesthetic to dull the pain, you know, and kitsch is just a 
pleasurable form of narcotic, isn't it? And so you find all the major cities of Asia going through 
this phase. I mean, the change is incredibly fast and people are highly disoriented. So you have 
the city center of all the cities in Asia having the steel and glass towers trying to look like New 
York or Houston, and then the surrounding condominiums are all kitsch and the pattern repeats 
itself in every city -- Singapore, Kuala Lampur, Jakarta, Bangkok, Guangzhou, everywhere, 
Japan included. China is the biggest of all kitsches because it is going through incredible 
psychological trauma.  When you have successful modernization pulling in one direction, the 
kind of reaction to that is a loss of identity and even a sense of alienation, and as a result of the 
pulling apart between modernization – power and wealth and identity crisis – then something has 
to fill the gap in between, you see, and I think that is kitsch.  Terror and kitsch are opposite sides 
of the same coin. They are simply reactions to the rapidity of modernization. 

CL: An antidote to this, says Tay Kheng Soon, may be resolute self-searching and self-expression 
in the midst of all this change.  What's missing from the Asian skyline, Tay Kheng Soon says, is 
the Asian consciousness.    

TKS: I think there has to be some kind of toughness in the local sensibility and I don't mean a 
kind of return back to the village or the return back to some kind of presumed golden age in the 
past. You know, I mean a kind of toughness in wanting to be yourself in the contemporary time. 
Can you really be a global citizen? I doubt it without having some kind of notion of your own 
self and your own worth.  I myself have this question: Am I Chinese?  Or am I Singaporean?  Or 
am I a citizen of the world?  I think any kind of thinking person in the contemporary world has to 
take his own existence and his own consciousness seriously.  Otherwise, if you do not take your 
own consciousness seriously, then you are simply an object of manipulation. 

CL: It may well be harder to be yourself in Singapore than it is in Jamaica. TKS believes the real 
project in Asia is to break with the old conformity and authoritarianism most especially in the 
new global China. 

TKS: One artist I met - Chinese artist who migrated to Paris - said to me that the worst thing for 
the Chinese people is China. He said it in jest, but I think he's quite serious about it.  China is a 
great destroyer of the human spirit and if you read Gao Xingjian's book called &quot;Soul Mountain&quot; 
(which is regarded in China as pornography, but he got the Nobel Prize for that book and it's a 
very deep book), I mean, when I read it tears came to my eyes. There's a cry from the heart; this 
man - there's a cry from the heart about the kind of conditions in which the human spirit is being 
violated almost as a reflex against the privations of everyday life. It's a horrific kind of existence 
and, of course, today it is being assuaged by all the glitzy buildings and, you know, lifestyle in 
the bright lights of Guangzhou and Shanghai and all these other places.  And it's going through 
this, but there is (I'm told) a kind of resistance movement, artistic resistance movement.  Deep 
thinking intellectuals are beginning to emerge, particularly in Beijing, who are questioning these 
things.  In Taiwan, there is a kind of deep dialogue going on also. In Singapore there is a very 
small group of people beginning to address these questions of life in the modern phase and how 
do we actually address the kind of degradation of the human spirit both by development as well 
as by deprivation. So these are the kind of deep issues that are there. 

[Music]

CL: So there is a taste of some differences among serious people.  Jeffrey Sachs marvels at the 
biggest export boom in human history, the 24-hour pace of construction in the big Chinese cities, 
globalization at its best, he says. And Tay Kheng Soon warns you that the human spirit can be 
crushed by development maybe faster than by deprivation.  Will the human beings who live 
through all this be nourished and sustained by it – as the writers Zadie Smith and Colin Channer 
seem to think – or will they be disappointed and degraded by it?  Let's remember that the global 
fault-lines and the divisions of entitlement run through our own country, too.  &quot;Amber&quot; is the 
radio name of a talk-show caller in Boston.  She's a young woman without a country, without 
identity papers.  She's been living in America for almost 20 years now, an impoverished guest at 
our rich table.  An exile in our midst, uninvited, maybe not quite welcome, but she notices things.

Amber:  I was born, raised in the West Indies, you know.  Therefore, like most West Indians a la 
Colin Powell, I was born a conservative and I've been recovering ever since. I'm this strange 
little hybrid creature of the new world, the old world.  I'm African as far as I'm concerned 
because of where my roots are; I'm American in the big context of that word &quot;American,&quot; not the 
puny, tiny, small context that it has come to represent.  I'm European based on having Scottish 
grandparents; I'm English based on the education I had; I'm Latino based on where my 
grandmother and one grandfather came from; and I was raised to believe that there's nothing 
wrong with what I was told at my dining room table, my dinner table, without the electricity but 
with the hot piping food… and stern lectures from an old grandfather…that that was a fabulous 
thing to be.  It was great to be able to enjoy Cuban jazz and yet want to read Dickens, to live 
Elvis and yet to love Calypso and still know who the hell Picasso was. There was nothing wrong 
with that; that was encouraged at my dining room table. And I was told that was the heart of what 
globalism was.  You would think that I would be eating this idea of globalism up, but I am not.  I 
don't know what that word means anymore; I don't know what globalism should mean, might 
mean, could mean, in present society. The only thing it appears to stand for anymore is the idea 
that an American businessman can pay a teenager in the Philippines, you know, five cents a day 
to make Nikes so American kids can walk around the streets in them.  Then turn around and re-
sell to the Philippines, you know, repackage rap music (allegedly from the American ghetto), and 
then we all sit around and pretend we're all one big, connected society, which we're not.  We're 
further apart now than we've ever been before.  We're just a lot better at buying American 
McDonalds.  That's it.  That's all globalism has become today.  I should be able (you would 
think in an era of globalism) to see that world that my grandfather kept telling me to go see, go 
enjoy.  God put it there for you, girl; go get it, you know, go see it.  It doesn't work that way. 
Things are tighter than they've ever been.  I can't put this into fancy language, so I will just put it 
in simple terms: you can't get in here, here being America; you can't move around in here; there 
is nothing but fear and suspicion on the ground level. And Europe, you know, is slowly 
becoming the United States of Europe as well.  It used to be you could count on this notion of 
jobs that real, quote unquote, Americans didn't want.  There was almost a secret code that folks 
were needed to come here without papers, without their green cards, to clean those toilets, wipe 
those kids' behinds, stuff like that.  Now, no one's even hiring for those jobs anymore 'cause, 
you know, we might be the wrong-god-worshipping heathens looking to do damage or threaten 
Ashcroft's national security, quote unquote.  Even that seems to be disappearing, even that little 
small portal to globalism seems to be disappearing.

CL:  Amber, you live inside this country but outside the gates in a certain way of the society 
itself.   What's it like to deal with…the sort of…the dark side of INS restrictions all the time?

Amber:  You mean, I can't mail a letter in the main post office of the city I live it for 15 years…

CL:  Why not?  Tell me…

Amber:  'Cause I don't have a Massachusetts ID and a social security number.  When I have tried 
to go to Boston Housing to report a landlord who is malicious, they will not let you in without 
that number, and either you leave right away or, you know, you sit there and you try and invent a 
lie, make up a lie. 

CL: Amber, you say it is tough to get into the society, but what about into the conversation, into 
the culture? 
 
Amber:  Yes, the great national and international debates and dialogue of our day.  Aah, I'm 
supposed to pretend…

CL:  Are you sneering? 
 
Amber:  Yes I am.  I am supposed to pretend at this stage that, you know, the microphone has 
gotten bigger, it's being passed around to more people, but that's a lie, you know. The 
microphone has not gotten bigger; the conversation has not gotten bigger; it's not being passed 
around to any new or different voices; it's the same people, the same voices, at the same seats at 
the same table; it's Rupert Murdoch, it's Bill O'Reilly, it's the New York Times, it's the 
Washington Post, increasingly all saying the same thing, full of sound and fury and signifying 
nothing on the ground level…

CL:  Saying what, Amber? 
 
Amber:  Representing their interests, the interests of the comfortable, the interests of those in 
power, the interests of the satisfied.  They sure as hell don't represent the interests of those on the 
streets of Palestine, Iraq, or Detroit, or Brixton.  Those voices are being closed out even more; 
those voices don't even have the option to protest…[they] are becoming more and more 
frustrated. That is globalism. There is a reason why Africa to Mr. Brokaw and Mr. Jennings is 
nothing more than the place incubating AIDS or Ebola; it's not the place to go look for the 
African version of Dickens.  That's globalism.  Wouldn't it be great if Americans could look at 
Africa and see a place…and I am using Africa solely as an example…could see a place with 
million of human lives, rich lives, diverse lives, interesting lives, lives that want to read and learn 
about Sigmund Freud and William Shakespeare, life that might be the next Freud or William 
Shakespeare, life that could teach America and Americans so much. Wouldn't that be great if that 
was part of this globalism?  Shakespeare in Port au Prince debating Freud in Beijing, loving Billy 
Holiday in Berlin, eating jerk pork in Moscow – that's my idea of globalism. We would be 
enjoying what it means to be human at its core, to be global, to be us.

[Music]

CL:  That's one undocumented American's view of the many globalisms. The paradox is 
everywhere: Globalization is a way to wealth for some, to calamity for others. It's a by-word for 
empowerment, also for a condition of helplessness. It's a race; it's a map; it's the 21st Century 
system.  A successor to the Cold War, and to the ranking of first, second and third worlds.  It's an 
economic doctrine that liberates the flow of capital, regulates the flow of exports, and tries to 
stop the flow of people.  Aren't we all wondering: which of the global trends could kill us? 
Which could make us stronger?  Or wiser?  Or  more human?  We like to think of this program

Robert L. Owen was born in 1856 at Lynchburg, Virginia, of Scotch-Irish and Indian ancestry. Educated in the private schools of Lynchburg, he attended Washington and Lee University where he received a Master of Arts degree in 1877. Soon afterwards, he moved to the Cherokee Nation where he practiced law, taught school, and served as secretary of the Board of Education of the Cherokee Nation. In 1885, Owen was appointed agent for the Five Civilized Tribes and functioned in that position until 1887. Owen served as the attorney for the Choctaws beginning in 1890 and later in the same capacity for the Western and Eastern Cherokees. He organized the First National Bank of Indian Territory at Muskogee in 1890 and acted as its president until 1900.

Owen was elected to the United States Senate from the state of Oklahoma in December 1907 and was reelected in 1912 and in 1918. In 1920, Owen's name was submitted as a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. In the end, he ranked fourth among the candidates but declined the nomination for vice president. As a senator, Owen was the drafter of the Federal Reserve Act and the Farm Loan Act. Child labor laws were another of his interests. Owen retired from the U.S. Senate in 1925.

After his retirement, Owen engaged in activities which promoted the interests of Indians, both in the field of legislation and in the courts. He maintained his interest in world affairs and international law and became involved in a goal to enable people all over the world to speak together in a phonetic global alphabet. His later years were spent pursuing this project. Senator Owen died in Washington, D.C., on July 19, 1947.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Could Ancient Man Fly?  
 
Models of airplanes thousands of years old... vast works of art that can only be seen from the air... ancient texts that describe aerial battles. Are they proof that ancient civilizations mastered powered flight? 
Flight has been the dream of humankind since they watched in awe as birds soared effortlessly through the sky. But, according to accepted history, it wasn't until the 1780s that two Frenchmen achieved lighter-than-air flight when they were lifted into the air in a hot air balloon near Paris. Then powered, heavier-than-air flight became the goal. And although it was theorized that heavier-than-air flight was possible as early as the 13th century, and in the 16th century Leonardo da Vinci designed winged aircraft and a crude kind of helicopter, it wasn't until the Wright brothers made their first successful flights at Kitty Hawk in 1903 that powered flight became a reality.

That's the widely accepted history. Some researchers and a few rogue scientists believe there's evidence to suggest that humans achieved flight earlier in history - much earlier... so early, they say, that the knowledge of this technology has been lost and ancient stories that recount adventures of human flight have been relegated only to myth.

Is it possible that humans developed the technology to fly in early civilizations - or in civilizations that are now lost to history? Let's take a look at what some call the evidence - intriguing artifacts, carvings, inscriptions and legends - that they say point to the true record human of flight.

The Egyptian Airplane

In 1898, a peculiar six-inch wooden object was found in a tomb at Saqquara, Egypt that dated back to about 200 BCE. The object had a body or fuselage, seven-inch wings that curved downward slightly, a fixed rudder and a tail. It looked very much like a modern airplane or glider. But since airplanes had not yet been invented in 1898 (never mind ancient Egypt), it was labeled as a model of bird and stored away in the basement of the Cairo museum.

http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/egypt_plane.jpg

The object was rediscovered many years later by Dr. Khalil Messiha, an authority on ancient models. According to Messiha and others who have studied the object, it has characteristics of very advanced aerodynamics, much like modern pusher-gliders that require very little power to stay aloft. The curved wings are today known as reversedihedral wings, which can attain great amounts of lift. A similar design is employed on the supersonic Concorde aircraft.

Was this just a child's toy? Or was it a scale model of an aircraft the Egyptians planned to build... or did build. If they did build a full-scale version of the aircraft, no evidence exists for it. No full-size airplanes have been found in any pharaoh's tomb to fly him to the land of the dead.

The Carvings at Abydos

http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/abydos.jpg

Although no airplanes or airplane parts have ever been found from the ruins of ancient Egypt, is there corroborating evidence that they constructed aircraft?

Even more controversial than the model airplane are the enigmatic carvings found in the temple of Abydos, Egypt by Dr. Ruth Hover. Hover photographed a wall panel which had been revealed when a newer overlaying panel crumbled and fell off. The older panel beneath contained embossed images that resemble modern aircraft as seen in profile.

One bears a striking resemblance to a modern helicopter, while others could be interpreted as aircraft, hovercraft or even flying saucers. When the photos of these carvings first surfaced, it was assumed that they had been digitally altered to create a sensational hoax. And indeed some of them had been retouched to more clearly show aircraft-like features. But even unaltered photos seemed to show the very modern-looking figures.

Perhaps looks are deceiving, however. The official take from archaeologists is that the strange carvings are palimpsests - the result of two or more overlapping carvings that combine to look like something else. The &quot;aircraft,&quot; they say, are merely combinations of overlapping hieroglyphics.

Central and South American Shuttle

Egypt's isn't the only ancient civilization that has produced puzzling artifacts. A remarkable gold trinket estimated to be at least 1,000 years old - dating perhaps to between 500 and 800 AD - was found in Central America and along coastal areas of South America. If you weren't aware of its age, you might guess that it was a child's model of the Space Shuttle or a delta wing fighter aircraft.

http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/sa_plane.jpg

When the artifact was discovered, archaeologists called it a zoomorph, or animal-shaped object. It resembles no known flying animal, however. It looks distinctly mechanical with its delta-shaped wings, stabilizer fins and rudder. It even has what looks like a pilot's seat in the right place. Experts in aerodynamics, however, contend that the wings are too far back for the object's center of gravity, and that the nose is not aerodynamically sound.

Whatever this object is supposed to be or represent, its remarkable resemblance to a modern aircraft or spacecraft is uncanny.

Nazca - A Reason to Fly?

Spread over a 37 by 15 mile plateau near Nazca, Peru are huge works of art &quot;drawn&quot; on the ground by people of the Paracas and Nasca cultures. The figures, called geoglyphs, are stylized portraits of a 18 different kinds of birds, a curly-tailed monkey as big as a football field, a killer whale, a 150-foot spider, a lizard, human forms and other strange objects.

http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/nazca.gif

Although the civilizations that created the figures flourished between 200 BC and 600 AD, no one knows for certain when the geoglyphs were made... or why. But since they were discovered, archaeologists have wondered by these people would create such monumental works of art that could not be appreciated from the ground. The figures can only be distinguished when viewed from a great height. In fact, they were discovered in recent times only when an explorer noticed them when flying over them in an airplane. Since there are no nearby mountains or other elevated areas nearby from which to look down on the Nazca lines, how were they ever seen?

Because of Nazca's large grids of crisscrossing paths, that seem to go nowhere (some extending as long as six miles), authors such as Erich Von Daniken have suggested (with only this as &quot;evidence&quot;) that Nazca is a ancient spaceport. The paths, he contends, are runways for aircraft, and that their pilots and passengers were those privileged to view the large-scale figures.

Less sensationalistic is the suggestion that this ancient civilization constructed hot-air balloons in which to take passengers aloft to view the symbols. In 1974, Julian Nott and Jim Woodman tested this theory by building a balloon made of materials available to the Nazca natives. They constructed a gondola of totora reeds and stitched-together sheets of cotton cloth that they filled with the hot air from wood smoke. Their balloon, dubbed Condor I, quickly rose to over 300 feet, proving that it was at least possible for the South American natives of this region to have achieved lighter-than-air flight long before Europeans did.

The Vaimanika-sastra

Although the Chinese are credited with inventing rocketry, some people believe that an ancient text from India describes sophisticated air flight by human pilots. Written by Maharishi Bharadwaja in the 4th century BC (allegedly dictated while he was in a trance), the Vaimanika-sastra seems to talk about piloting some kind of aircraft - a vimana - with some astonishing capabilities.

Sounding like a manual for aerial battle (or instructions to a video game), the text claims to reveal 32 secrets of piloting a vimana, including:

Goodha - permits the pilot to make his vimana invisible to his enemies. 
Paroksha - enables the pilot to paralyze other vimanas and put them out of action. 
Pralaya - pushes an electrical force through the &quot;five-limbed aerial tube&quot; so that the pilot may &quot;destroy everything as in a cataclysm.&quot; 
Taara - provides the pilot with another means of avoiding contact with an enemy or hiding from observers: &quot;By mixing with ethereal force 10 parts of air force, 7 parts of water force, and 16 parts of solar glow, and projecting it by means of the star-faced mirror through the frontal tube of the vimana, the appearance of a star-spangled sky is created.&quot; 
Jalada roopa - instructs the pilot in the correct proportions of certain chemicals which will envelop the vimana and give it &quot;the appearance of a cloud.&quot; 
Was the Vaimanika-sastra simply imaginative writing, rich with symbolism and religious meaning? Or was it a description of ancient yet advanced technology that humankind was not to rediscover until the 20th century?

History Mystery: Ancients in America  
 
Long before Columbus sailed to North America, this hemisphere may have been visited by other Europeans, ancient Romans, Chinese and Japanese - even the ancient Egyptians! 
In fourteen hundred and ninety-two,
Columbus sailed the ocean blue...

Many of us learned that rhyme, part of a longer history poem, when being taught in school that Christopher Columbus discovered America. Although nothing can be taken away from Columbus' daring voyage, he certainly was not the first to arrive on the shores of the Americas. For one thing, there were already people here - many Native American nations inhabited what later became North and South America and even the Caribbean islands where Columbus landed. Columbus probably wasn't even the first &quot;white man&quot; to make it here. It's fairly well documented that Icelander Leif Ericsson successfully sailed to North America in the year 1000 - almost 500 years prior to Columbus's voyage.

In fact, there's a growing amount of proof suggesting that a lot of the familiar history of human exploration and &quot;discovery&quot; by our ancestors as we were taught it may be quite wrong. There is hard evidence of ancient civilizations making their mark in places where, according to traditionally accepted history, they just shouldn't be. Here's an overview of some of the most remarkable and fascinating cases.

Greeks and Romans in the New World

Coins:  
Roman coins have been found in Venezuela and Maine. 
Roman coins were found in Texas at the bottom of an Indian mound at Round Rock. The mound is dated at approximately 800 AD. 
In 1957 by a small boy found a coin in a field near Phenix City, Alabama, from Syracuse, on the island of Sicily, and dating from 490 B.C.  
In the town of Heavener, Oklahoma, another out-of-place coin was found in 1976. Experts identified it as a bronze tetradrachm originally struck in Antioch, Syria in 63 A.D. and bearing the profile of the emperor Nero. 
In 1882, a farmer in Cass County, Illinois picked up bronze coin later identified as a coin of Antiochus IV, one of the kings of Syria who reigned from 175 B.C. to 164 B.C., and who is mentioned in the Bible. 
Pottery: Roman pottery was unearthed in Mexico that, according to its style, has been dated to the second century A.D. 
Inscriptions: 
In 1966, a man named Manfred Metcalf stumbled upon a stone in the state of Georgia that bears an inscription that is very similar to ancient writing from the island of Crete called &quot;Cretan Linear A and B writing.&quot; 
In the early 1900s, Bernardo da Silva Ramos, a Brazilian rubber-tapper working in the Amazon jungle, found many large rocks on which was inscribed more than 2,000 ancient scripts about the &quot;Old World.&quot; 
Near Rio de Janeiro, high on a vertical wall of rock - 3,000 feet up - is an inscription that reads: 'Tyre, Phoenicia, Badezir, Firstborn of Jethbaal...&quot; and dated to the middle of the ninth century B.C. 
Near Parahyba, Brazil, an inscription on Phoenician has been translated, in part, as: &quot;We are sons of Canaan from Sidon, the city of the king. Commerce has cast us on this distant shore, a land of mountains. We set [sacrificed] a youth for the exalted gods and goddesses in the nineteenth year of Hiram, our mighty king. We embarked from Ezion-Geber into the Red Sea and voyaged with ten ships. We were at sea together for two years around the land belonging to Ham [Africa] but were separated by a storm [lit. 'from the hand of Baal'], and we were no longer with our companions. So we have come here, twelve men and three women, on a... shore which I, the Admiral, control. But auspiciously may the gods and goddesses favor us!&quot;  
The Kensington Stone, discovered in Kensington, Minnesota in 1898 contains an inscription describing an expedition of Norsemen into the interior of what is now North America. It's estimated that this expedition took place in the 1300s. 
In 1980, P.M. Leonard and J.L. Glenn, from the Hogle Zoological Gardens, Salt Lake City, visited a rock outcropping in Colorado that was reputed to be inscribed with &quot;peculiar markings.&quot; Leonard and Glenn believe they are excellent examples of Consainne Ogam writing - a type ascribed to ancient Celts. One of the many inscriptions was translated as: &quot;Route Guide: To the west is the frontier town with standing stones as boundary markers.&quot; 
A fist-sized, round stone was found during the early 1890s in an cemetery near Nashville, Tennessee. Its front was inscribed with symbols thought to be Libyan, pre-100 A.D. style. It translates as: &quot;The colonists pledge to redeem.&quot; 
Pictures: An experienced botanist has identified plants in an ancient fresco painting as a pineapple and a specific species of squash - both native to the Americas. Yet the fresco is in the Roman city of Pompeii. 
Statues: In 1933, in a burial at Calixtlahuaca, Mexico, archaeologist Jos?Garc燰 Pay鏮 discovered a small carved head with &quot;foreign&quot; features in an undisturbed burial site. It was later identified by anthropologist Robert Heine-Geldern as &quot;unquestionably&quot; from the Hellenistic-Roman school of art and suggested a date of &quot;around AD 200.&quot; 
Structures: Many stone chambers dot the New England countryside and most archaeologists insist they are all potato cellars built long ago by farmers. Others argue that they are too sophisticated for such a mundane application. One, is built into a hillside at Upton, Massachusetts, has sophisticated corbelling that follows they style of Irish and Iberic chambers. It's theorized that it was really built by Europeans around 700 AD - long before the Leif Eiriksson. 
Ships: In 1886, the remains of a shipwreck was found in Galveston Bay, Texas. Its construction is typically Roman. 
Toys: A doll made of wood and wax was found deep in a &quot;Well of Sacrifice&quot; at Chich幯 Itz? Mexico, on which is written Roman script. 
Tombs: In the Mayan ruins of Palenque, a stone sarcophagus was found that is very much in the style of the ancient Phoenicians. 

The Far-Traveling Egyptians

Statues: In 1914, archaeologist M.A. Gonzales was excavating some Mayan ruins in the city of Acajutla, Mexico when he was surprised by the discovery of two statuettes that were clearly Egyptian. One male and one female, the carvings bore ancient Egyptian dress and cartouches. They are thought to depict Osiis and Isis. 
Inscriptions: Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs have been found in New South Wales, Australia. Located on a rock cliff in the National Park forest of the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, the enigmatic carvings have been known since the early 1900s. There are more than 250 carvings of familiar Egyptian gods and symbols, including a life-sized engraving of the god Anubis. The hieroglyphs tell the story of explorers who were shipwrecked in a strange and hostile land, and the untimely death of their royal leader, &quot;Lord Djes-eb.&quot; From this information, scholars have been able to date the voyage to somewhere between 1779 and 2748 BC. 
Fossils: In 1982, archaeologists digging at Fayum, near the Siwa Oasis in Egypt uncovered fossils of kangaroos and other Australian marsupials. 
Language: There are striking similarities between the languages of ancient Egypt and those of the Native Americans that inhabited the areas around Louisiana about the time of Christ. B. Fell, of the Epigraphic Society, has stated that the language of the Atakapas, and to a lesser extent those of the Tunica and Chitimacha tribes, have affinities with Nile Valley languages involving just those words one would associate with Egyptian trading communities of 2,000 years ago. 
Artifacts: Near the Neapean River outside Penrith, New South Wales,  a scarab beetle - a familair Egyptian symbol - carved from onyx was unearthed. Another was found in Queensland, Australia. 
Tombs: The April 5, 1909 edition of The Phoenix Gazette carried a front-page article about the discovery and excavation of an Egyptian tomb in the Grand Canyon by none other that the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian has since denied knowledge of any such discovery.  
The Scattered Tribes of Israel

Inscriptions: 
In 1889, the Smithsonian's Mound Survey project discovered a stone in a burial mound in eastern Tennessee on which is inscribed ancient Hebrew lettering. Known as The Bat Creek Stone, experts have identified its letters as being Paleo-Hebrew dating from the first or second century A.D. Some of the letters spell out: &quot;for Judea.&quot; 
An abridged version of the Ten Commandments was found carved into the flat face of a large boulder resting on the side of Hidden Mountain near Los Lunas, New Mexico. Known as The Los Lunas Inscription, its language is Hebrew, and the script is the Old Hebrew alphabet with a few Greek letters mixed in. 
Artifacts: 
In June, 1860, David Wyrick found an artifact on the general shape of a keystone near Newark, Ohio that is covered in four ancient Hebrew inscriptions translated as: &quot;Holy of Holies,&quot; &quot;King of the Earth,&quot; &quot;The Law of God&quot; and &quot;The Word of God.&quot; 
In November of that same year, Wyrick found an inscribed stone in a burial mound about 10 miles south of of Newark, Ohio. The stone is inscribed on all sides with a condensed version of the Ten Commandments or Decalogue, in a peculiar form of post-Exilic square Hebrew letters. A robed and bearded figure on the front is identified as Moses in letters fanning over his head. 
Asians on the West Coast

Stories: 
Indian traditions tell of many &quot;houses&quot; seen on Pacific waters. Could they have been ships from Asia? 
Chinese history tells a charming account of voyages to the land of &quot;Fusang.&quot; 
Old Spanish documents describe oriental ships off the Mexican coast in 1576. 
Coins: In the summer of 1882, a miner in British Columbia found 30 Chinese coins 25 feet below the surface. The examined coins of this style were invented by the Emperor Huungt around 2637 B.C. 
Artifacts: 
Japanese explorers and traders left steel blades in Alaska and their distinctive pottery in Ecuador. 
Underwater explorations off the California coast have yielded stone artifacts that seem to be anchors and line weights. The style and type of stone point to Chinese origins. 
Structures: California's East Bay Walls, ancient low rock walls east of San Francisco Bay, have long been a mystery. No one knows who built them or why. In 1904, Dr. John Fryer, professor of Oriental languages at U.C. Berkeley, declared: &quot;This is undoubtedly the work of Mongolians... the Chinese would naturally wall themselves in, as they do in all of their towns in China.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mr. Vuara -- and others:

I've been with and spoken with my Father (Dr. James R. Harris, Sr. Professor Emeritus at BYU, etc.) many times over the last several years, including this morning (Thursday, 13 July 2006). He continues his work with ancient southwest enscriptions. He was most amused to discover that he is dead!!  Please take it upon yourself to correct this here and in other places where this error may be lurking.  Thanks much!

James R. Harris, Jr. --[[User:JamesHarrisJr|JamesHarrisJr]] 03:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

Editor's Note:
Before his untimely death, Dr. James Harris of BYU, along with Dann Hoane, succeeded in establishing the algorithm for the oldest alphabetical system yet discovered. The team brilliantly assigned sound values based on the pre-Thamudic (early Hebrew and Aramaic) dialects instead of sounds used in Arabic dialects. The results were dramatic.
Prior to their discovery it was believed that Southern Arabia held the root language on which the first alphabet was based. This was because the old signs were found in Ethiopia and Yemen. While other similar inscriptions were found in the Sinai, it was thought that these were from people that migrated from the South, and who spoke Arabic. 

Viewzone's expedition to Yemen in 2001, showed the possibility that the language originated in the Sinai and was brought to Yemen through the marriage of Solomon (King of Israel) and Queen Sheba (Yemen). The Queen's conversion from belief in planetary deities (the Sun and Moon) to the One God would almost require that the pre-Thamudic language of old the Judaic texts should be taught and used as the official tongue. The birth of their child, Menelik, also would have strengthened the reliance on the language of Israel since Menelik subsequently received the responsibility for caring for the Ark of the Covenant when Israel was invaded by the Assyrians. Indeed, many of the texts found at the Queen's palace, dated to the second millennium BC., have been successfully translated using the old Hebrew algorithm and dialect discovered by Harris and Hoane. And many of these texts speak of the union of the Queen with Solomon and the important prophecies given to Menelik by the Lord, EL, supposedly through the Ark.

Surprisingly, the same alphabet has also been found, dated and translated in other areas of the globe. Multiple inscriptions are grouped in Southeast Colorado and many more are scattered around the major Oceans and waterways of our planet. This may suggest that the alphabet was indeed the earliest one, based on Egyptian hieroglyphics, and was spread globally by an intelligent sea-faring culture at least 4 millennia ago.

What follows is a brief history of the language, including the important contributions made by Harris and Hoane, and which has been copied from an old web site that was accessible just prior to the death of James Harris.

The author spoke with Harris many times and developed a computer program to help translate the symbols in to English (see translation program) using JavaScript and Explorer.

The History of the First Tongue: Prior to Viewzone (1905 to 1998)
Sir William Flinders Petrie (1905) Up to the beginning of this century, the Mesha Stele (Moabite Stone, a royal inscription of a king of Moab named Mesha, ca. 850 BCE) was the earliest known alphabetic inscription. Speculation on the origin of West Semitic alphabets was based largely on the Bible, or traditional attempts to reconstruct the past.

In the winter of 1904-1905 Sir Wm. Flinders Petrie discovered the inscriptions at Serabit el-Khadim that became known as Proto-Sinaitic. Petrie reached the conclusion that the inscriptions were alphabetic but made no attempt to identify any related offshoots. An exhibition catalogue was published in 1905 and an expedition report in 1906.

Sir Alan Gardiner (1916)

A major breakthrough came with the decipherment of the word b'lt, (B'alat) by Sir Alan Gardiner in 1916. Gardiner concluded that the Sinaitic signs were created by reforming Egyptian Hieroglyphic signs based upon their acrophonic value. His reasoning has been found to be sound and his work continues to be the foundation upon which progress advances to the present. His early decipherment's are called the B'alat inscriptions (b`lt).

C. Hubert Grimme and A. Van den Branden (1929's)

Hubert Grimme stood alone, with modest support from Van den Brenden, in postulating the existence of a pre-Thamudic alphabet, and rejected the notion that Thamudic scripts evolved from the South Arabic script. He was never able to find such a script (possibly because he looked for it in the wrong desert). Had he looked closer to the birthplace of West Semitic scripts he may have recognized &quot;Old Thamudic&quot; (Old Negev) which was the most probable parent of the Arabian scripts. While Grimme's translations may have some serious defects [the same can be said of all translations before and since his time] his sign lists showing the correspondence of Proto-Sinaitic &amp;Proto-Canaanite to Egyptian Hieroglyphic signs is very helpful and was as well done as any others of more recent vintage.

II. The Harvard Expeditions (1927 and 1930)

In 1927 a Harvard University Expedition in the Sinai made a side trip upon their return from Santa Catherina through Serabit el-Khadim.

They removed some inscriptions left by Petrie and delivered them to the Cairo Museum. They also increased the corpus of Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions by three (Lake, Blake, and Butin 1928).

1930-35

The above effort was a prelude to a much more ambitious and well planned under-taking by Harvard University. From 1930 to 1935 Harvard and the Catholic University of America worked at Serabit el-Khadim and uncovered ten more inscriptions from the area (Butin, New, Lake and Barrois 1932; and Butin, and Starr 1936).

Decades of the 20th Century When Research Lagged

It seems possible that during the decades of the thirties through the fifties West Semitic scholars accepted earlier reconstruction's of alphabetic origins as solid facts and assumed that all essential questions had been adequately answered. In the era of this mind set Winnett, of the University of Toronto, attempted to translate what he called, &quot;Thamudic of the Negev.&quot;

Scripts of Pre-Dialects: 
Fredrich V. Winnett &amp; Emmanuel Anati (1959)

Winnett was a tireless researcher of the nine or ten pre-Arabic scripts of the Arabian Desert, among which he spent a major part of his professional life. He also attempted to reconstruct the emergence, and identify some relationships, between these alphabets. No doubt his work with pre-Arabic scripts was excellent but his brief exposure to Old Negev resulted in his participation in perpetuating the error that the Negev inscriptions were graffiti left by post Thamudic vagabonds. The extensive research and study of J. R. Harris &amp; D. W Hone has led to a more probable and substantial conclusion, i.e. that the Negev inscriptions are Post Proto-Canaanite and the major parent script of the pre-Arabic Thamudic scripts.

In 1959 Winnett published an article in Atiqot, Vol. 2, pp. 146-149 titled, &quot;Thamudic Inscriptions from the Negev.&quot; The four pages of this article contained fourteen inscriptions, one of which he pronounced &quot;Illegible&quot; (No. 10393), two of the remaining thirteen were composed of three and four lines respectively and the remaining ten were one liners. The introduction paragraph contained the following information:

http://www.viewzone.com/666.jpg

The following graffiti (fig. 1. pl. XXII), which Mr. E. Anati has very kindly allowed me to study, are all of the type which in my study of the Lihyanite and Thamudic Inscriptions, Toronto, 1937, I labeled Thamudic C and dated to the 1st or 2nd centuries C.E. (p. 52). They may be as late as the 3rd century (see A. VAN DEN BRANDEN, Les inscriptions thamudeennes, Louvain, 1950, p. 24), but in the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to be more definite (Winnett, 1959, p. 146). No doubt the above collection was gathered by Emmanuel Anati in April of 1954 &amp; January of 1955 and was the bases for his articles in P.E.Q. of July/Dec. 1954, &quot;Ancient Rock Drawings in the Central Negev,&quot; pp. 49-57. Jan/June 1956, titled, &quot;Rock Engravings From the Jebel Ideid (Southern Negev).&quot; 

The above site (Jebel Ideid) is now called Har Karkom (of which more will be said later). Anati called the inscriptions Thamudic-Nabatean, style IV2, and Winnett called them Thamudic C. 1st to 3rd Cent C.E.. More resent research has made it clear that neither of the above two men had a clear perception of the nature and origin of the script in question.

The Proto-Sinaitic Inscriptions and their Decipherment: Wm. Foxwell Albright (1966)

Albright's publication was a major step forward in that it included transliterations and translations of all of the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions identified up to that point in time. We have some reservations with Albright's translations because it is now possible to recognize ligatures and consequently assign them the several sound values they represent (rather than viewing them as single signs with an elaborate flourish). Also no-one (in that period) recognized the clues that signal a word break, but each translator was left to arbitrarily decide where these breaks should be made.

Research Revival: Proto-Sinaitic, Proto-Canaanite &amp; Old Negev:
Itzhaq Beit-Arieh (Ophir Expedition 1982)

http://www.viewzone.com/777.jpg

Beit-Arieh BAR, Winter, 1982 p. 13.



Beit-Arieh BAR, Winter, 1982 p. 16

Beit-Arieh was a Senior Research Associate and Lecturer of the Institute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University. Since 1971 he has been the director of the Ophir Expedition in the Sinai Peninsula. His work at Mine L, in the Serabit el-Khadim area was of great importance in establishing 1500 BCE (the cave-in date for Mine L.) as a time when there was a reasonably mature alphabet, reinforcing the probability that Proto-Sinaitic began to emerge about 1700 BCE.

Early on, the Ophir Expedition became an extension of the 1927 to 1935 Harvard expedition, not because Harvard had joined them but because they could see that they had a possibility of successfully dating the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions (which had been a major objective of the Harvard project). Mine L, had not been excavated by Harvard because cracks in the over head made them fear a cave-in if debris was removed. After appropriate precautions had been made the Ophir crew began a three week task of removing debris (1977). Each stone, large or small, &quot;was carefully examined twice before being discarded&quot; (Beit-Arieh, BA, Winter, 1981, pp. 14-15).

One of the early stones with an inscription carried the name El (God) and may well be the earliest West Semitic inscription of the divine name. Other appearances of this special name were also found. A concluding statement by Beit-Arieh will help to highlight the significance of his work. He wrote: 

The dating of the above finds is a key issue in the present study, because only archaeological evidence of this kind can bring us closer to solving the problem of the period of the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions. Since Mine L contained another inscription besides the one carved on the rock inside it, we may assume that all the finds are contemporaneous and were buried at the end of a single mining season. Weighty evidence for dating the find to the Late Bronze Age (the New Kingdom in Egypt) is a sherd from a bichrome flask found in the mine. The sherd is burnished and decorated with black and brown stripes on a light ground and belongs to a class of pottery ubiquitous in the Near East in the Late Bronze Age between the 16th and 14th centuries BC. Parallels for axes occur in occupation levels and tombs from the time of the New Kingdom in some places in Egypt, as well as on wall paintings depicting their use. . . The ax was probably the symbol of the miners. . . The many finds of the Late Bronze Age discovered during the clearing of Mine L. together with the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions discussed here strongly suggest that the mine was worked and the inscriptions carved in this period [LBA](Beit-Arieh, 1981, pp. 17-18).

Beit-Arieh BAR, (Winter, 1982)

Benjamin Sass (West Semitic Alphabets)

In 1988 a very important doctoral dissertation was completed at Tel Aviv University, by Benjamin Sass titled, The Genesis of the Alphabet and its Development in the Second Millennium BC, Agypten Und Altes Testament, Band 13, in Kommission bei Otto Harrassowitz, Weisbaden. Sass had been a student of Beit-Arieh and spent considerable time in the Sinai as a deputy officer of the Israeli Antiquities Department.

Much of this current, brief scan of important events in the unfolding history of the emergence of West Semitic alphabets is based on the Sass dissertation. While working in the Sinai, Sass expanded the corpus of Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions and also carefully verified several very important inscriptions. The final impact of his work was best stated in his 7th and last chapter, page 161, as follows:

The origin of the Phoenician letters [and even more so the Old Negev letters] in the Proto-Canaanite and Proto-Sinaitic scripts, and the borrowing of most, if not all, letter forms in the latter script from Egyptian hieroglyphics on the basis of acrophony are now seen as indubitable facts (cf. Snyczer 1974, 9).

 inai 376 (Rainey 1975, fig. 1) Sinai 380 1978 fig. 10).

The bracketed insertion in the paragraph above was justified by the research of Harris and Hone in which they discovered that twenty one of twenty-two Canaanite/Phoenician sound signs are clearly of archaic origin; i.e., they retain a clear correspondence to Proto-Canaanite and Proto-Sinaitic.

Out of a shorter list of twenty Old Negev sound signs positions, forty-two are archaic. The number forty-two is possible because each of the twenty Old Negev sound positions may have several abstract alternative signs and several alternative archaic signs. The above short sign lists were used because their study was confined to signs found in the inscription of the Land of Canaan, the Negev and the Sinai that were included in their research. Old Negev has a stronger link to Proto-Canaanite and Proto-Sinaitic than does Canaanite Phoenician.

Sass and Beit-Arieh carefully made an on-site verification of the several renditions made by earlier scholars of Sinai 357. As a result Harris and Hone proceeded with confidence to observe in this inscription one of the earliest uses of identifying word breaks by changing the size or shape of a letter (in the column letters #'s 12-13). The phrase involved reads,= &quot;for 'Avev.&quot;

Linder, M. Halloun &amp; M. Sharon (Ancient Rock Inscriptions 1990)

In 1990 the Archaeological Survey of Israel, project of the Israel Antiquities Authority, under the direction of Yeshua`yahu Lender, published a two volume series on the findings of their survey. The first Volume was titled, Map of Har Nafha (196), and Vol. 2, titled, ANCIENT ROCK INSCRIPTIONS, SUPPLEMENT TO MAP OF HAR NAFHA (196) 12-01, The so-called &quot;Thamudic&quot; inscriptions were translated by Dr. Moin Halloun. Although Halloun continued to refer to this collection of inscriptions as &quot;Thamudic&quot; and although he translated them as if they were a pre-Arabic dialect, he also expressed his reservation about the labeling and the dating of the inscriptions. He said: 

If at one time it was assumed that inscriptions discovered in the Negev were but the traces of Thamudic tribes passing through the region, particularly along the main trade routes, this assemblage of inscriptions, as well as additional inscriptions, published and unpublished, now calls for a reevaluation of the subject.

Archaeological evidence from the first and second centuries (CE) - the presumed dates of the inscriptions - is insufficient to establish the history of settlement in the region, especially insofar as settlement and sedentarization is concerned. Comprehensive epigraphic research could contribute a great deal to this complex subject (Moin Halloun, 1990, Vol. 2, p. 36.).

Research of Harris and Hone, conducted from 1994 to April of 1997 focused on verifying some of Halloun's photographs and transliteration by an on-site examination. Their conclusion was that the inscriptions at Nahal `Avedat date to the period of the colonization of the Negev enacted by the Royal Kings of the House of Judah to secure safer trade lanes from the Gulf of Elath to the Mediterranean (six to eight hundred years before the dates suggested by Winnett).

Harris and Hone (aided by Jon &amp; Cindy Polansky) now have a growing corpus of about 130 inscriptions from the Negev. From a careful examinations of the twenty two sound signs (each sign having from one to nine alternative forms) they have concluded that a large number of archaic forms are retained in use and that this &quot;Old Negev&quot; alphabet is the ancient parent of the Thamudic scripts.

James Harris &amp; Dann Hone (Expanding the Old Negev Corpus)

Introduction:

&gt; Observing the inadequate translations of Winnett, Harris was encouraged to begin with a careful study of the signs and the result was that the abundance of archaic letter forms and archaic construction and usage demanded that this script be considered an early post Proto-Canaanite script and not a pre-Arabic dialect script. As a post Proto-Canaanite script it was best translated in Hebrew (i.e. pre Massoretic Hebrew).

In the years that followed James R. Harris and Dann W Hone expanded their corpus of &quot;Old Negev&quot; inscriptions. They abandoned the misleading word &quot;Thamudic&quot; because Old Negev (1200 BCE) is the ancient parent of the Arabian Scripts, while Thamudic (pre-Christian) is a late offspring.

We have discovered a script in the Negev of Israel that appears to be a local variation of Proto-Canaanite [a generic formative script widely used among Canaanite peoples during the second millennium B.C.]. This local variation, which we call the Old Negev script, was widely used by Negev Canaanites (such as Kenites and Israelites) from 1200-600 BC. In the interest of not straining the strong indications from archaeology, inscriptions, and the Bible that the major carriers of this script were Midianites we call this script Old Negev and identify its carriers as ancient Canaanite people or peoples. 

This Old Negev script not only has a distinctive sign system with features that go back to it's Proto-Sinaitic parent script but also a grammatical structure persisting from Proto-Sinaitic through Proto-Canaanite to Old Negev. These distinctive characteristics were not passed on to Canaanite/Phoenician or to Old Negev's offspring scripts of the Arabian desert. Therefore these features will become &quot;ear marks&quot; for the identification of this script where ever it may be found and must be clearly presented so that all may judge the certainty of our observations. 

With a collection of over one hundred and thirty inscriptions this study has opened a small window to the early (pre-Exile) history of Canaanite peoples of the Negev. And since twenty-five percent of the inscriptions contain names of the God of Israel (Yah, El/Yah, Yahu, and Yahh) it seems fair to say that these Canaanite speakers had a covenant relationship with Yahweh.

The second letter from the right (above) is an intrusive abstract resh placed in the inscription at some later period, therefore we will simply ignore it. [From Benjamin Sass, (1988) pp. 56-57, translation by Harris and hone. ]

Some General Characteristics of Old Negev:

(Some General Characteristics of Old Negev that were not continued in Canaanite/Phoenician or in the pre-Arabic scripts of the Arabian Desert.)

1. Sign Rotation; the orientation of a sign can signal the reader that, when in horizontal position, it represents an inseparable preposition or an article.

2. When in an upside down position it represents the end of a word or phrase.

3. When a letter is larger or smaller than the preceding letters it indicates the end of a word or phrase.

4. The numbers 2 &amp; 3 above also indicate the direction of language flow.

5. All West Semitic alphabets (emerging after Proto-Canaanite) utilize the abstracted forms but Old Negev retains in use a very large number of archaic forms (i.e. Proto-Sinaitic and Proto-Canaanite forms).

6. Old Negev also retains an elaborate use of ligatures to create symbols that often complement or enhance the inscriptions. [This form of composition was especially useful when a population was a mix of literate persons and persons with varying levels of illiteracy.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Christiaan. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Christiaan~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

{{subpages}}

In your previous study of calculus, we have looked at functions and their behavior. Most of these functions we have examined have been all in the form
: ''f''(''x'') : '''R''' &amp;rarr; '''R''',
and only occasional examination of functions of two variables. However, the study of functions of ''several'' variables is quite rich in itself, and has applications in several fields.

We write functions of vectors - many variables - as follows:
: '''''f''''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
and '''''f'''''('''''x''''') for the function that maps a vector in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; to a vector in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.

Before we can do calculus in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, we must familiarize ourselves with the structure of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. We need to know which properties of '''R''' can be extended to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. This page assumes at least some familiarity with basic [[linear algebra]].

== Topology in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ==

We are already familiar with the nature of the regular real number line, which is the set '''R''', and the two-dimensional plane, '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This examination of ''topology'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; attempts to look at a generalization of the nature of ''n''-dimensional spaces - '''R''', or '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;, or '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Lengths and distances===
If we have a vector in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, we can calculate its length using the Pythagorean theorem. For instance, the length of the vector (2, 3) is 
: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3^2+2^2}=\sqrt{13}&lt;/math&gt;

We can generalize this to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. We define a vector's length, written |'''''x'''''|, as the square root of the sum of the squares of each of its components. That is, if we have a vector '''''x'''''=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;),
: &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{x}| = \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now that we have established some concept of length, we can establish the distance between two vectors. We define this distance to be the length of the two vectors' difference. We write this distance ''d''('''''x''''', '''''y'''''), and it is
: &lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = |\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}| = \sqrt{\sum{(x_i-y_i)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

This distance function is sometimes referred to as a ''metric''. Other metrics arise in different circumstances. The metric we have just defined is known as the ''Euclidean'' metric.

=== Open and closed balls ===
In '''R''', we have the concept of an ''interval'', in that we choose a certain number of other points about some central point. For example, the interval [-1, 1] is centered about the point 0, and includes points to the left and right of zero. 

In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and up, the idea is a little more difficult to carry on. For '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, we need to consider points to the left, right, above, and below a certain point. This may be fine, but for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; we need to include points in more directions. 

We generalize the idea of the interval by considering all the points that are a given, fixed distance from a certain point - now we know how to calculate distances in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, we can make our generalization as follows, by introducing the concept of an ''open ball'' and a ''closed ball'' respectively, which are analogous to the open and closed interval respectively.
: an ''open ball''
:: &lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf{a}, r)&lt;/math&gt;
: is a set in the form { '''''x''''' &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;|d('''''x''''', '''''a''''') &lt; r}
: a ''closed ball'' 
::&lt;math&gt;\overline{B}(\mathbf{a}, r)&lt;/math&gt;
: is a set in the form { '''''x''''' &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;|d('''''x''''', '''''a''''') &amp;le; r}

In '''R''', we have seen that the open ball is simply an open interval centered about the point ''x''=''a''. In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; this is a circle with no boundary, and in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; it is a sphere with no outer surface. (''What would the closed ball be?'')

&lt;!-- 
*=== Neighbourhoods ===
A neighbourhood is an important concept to determine whether a set later, is open or closed. A set ''N'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; is called a neighbourhood (usually just abbreviated to nhd) of '''''a''''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; such that '''''a''''' is contained in ''N'', and that for some ''r'', an open ball of radius ''r'' about '''''a''''' is a subset of ''N''. 

More symbolically, for every ''r'' &gt; 0, '''''x''''' &amp;isin; ''N'' when ''d''('''''x''''','''''a''''') &lt; ''r''.

Simply put, all points sufficiently close to ''a'', are also in ''N''.
--&gt;
&lt;!-- image --&gt;
&lt;!-- 
We have some terminology with certain points and their neighbourhoods - a point in a set with a neighbourhood lying completely in that set is known as an ''interior point'' of that set. The set of all interior points of a set ''S'' is known as the ''interior'' of the set ''S'' and is written ''S''&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. 

*=== Open and closed sets ===
With these ideas now, we can formulate the concept of an open set and a closed set. 

We say that a set is ''open'' if every point in that set is an interior point of that set, which means that we can construct a neighbourhood of every point in that set. Symbolically, for all '''''a'''''&amp;isin;''S'', there is a ''r''&amp;prime; &gt; 0, so all '''x''' satisfying ''d''('''''x''''','''''a''''') &lt; ''r''&amp;prime; is in ''S''.

We have the fact that open balls are open sets. &lt;!-- shall put proof later --&gt;
&lt;!-- 
With the idea of the ''complement'' of a set ''S'' being all the points that are not in ''S'', written ''S''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; or ''S''&amp;prime;, a ''closed'' set is a set with its complement being open. 

It is important to note that most sets are not open or closed. Think about a box in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with its top and bottom included, and it's left and right sides open - this set is {(''x'', ''y'') | |''x''| &lt; 1 and |''y''| &amp;le; 1}.

*=== Limit points ===
A ''limit point'' of some set ''S'' is a point where, if we construct a neighbourhood about that point, that neighbourhood always contains some other point in ''S''. 

Here's an example. If ''S'' = {1/''n'' | ''n'' &amp;isin; '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}, and we pick the point 0, we can always construct a neighbourhood about 0 which includes some other point of ''S''. This brings up the important point that a limit point need not be in that set. 0 is clearly not in ''S'' - but is a limit point of that set.

If we include all the limit points of a set including that set, we call that set the ''closure'' of ''S'', and we write it &lt;math&gt;\overline{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

Limit points allow us to also characterize whether a set is open or closed - a set is ''closed'' if it contains all its limit points.

--&gt;

=== Boundary points ===
If we have some area, say a field, then the common sense notion of the ''boundary'' is the points 'next to' both the inside and outside of the field. &lt;!-- We can make this analogy with sets in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. A ''boundary point'' of a set ''S'' is a point where every neighbourhood of that point contains at least a point in ''S'' and not in ''S''. --&gt; For a set, S, we can define this rigorously by saying the boundary of the set contains all those points such that we can find points both inside and outside the set. We call the set of such points &amp;#x2202;S

Typically, when it exists the dimension of &amp;#x2202;S is one lower than the dimension of S. e.g. the boundary of a volume is a surface and the boundary of a surface is a curve.

This isn't always true; but it is true of all the sets we will be using.

&lt;!-- 
For example, 
: &lt;math&gt;\partial\overline{B}( (0,0), 1) = \{(x,y)|x^2+y^2=1\}&lt;/math&gt;
The boundary of a closed ball in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the circle surrounding the interior of that ball.
--&gt;

&lt;!-- === Bounded sets === Too short a section to warrant an heading --&gt;
A set ''S'' is ''bounded'' &lt;!--(don't confuse with ''boundary'')--&gt; if there is some positive number such that we can encompass this set by a closed ball about '''0'''. --&gt; if every point in it is within a finite distance of the origin, i.e there exists some ''r''&gt;0 such that '''x''' is in S implies |'''x'''|&lt;''r''.

==Curves and parameterizations==
If we have a function '''''f''''' : '''R''' &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, we say that '''''f'''''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s image (the set {'''''f'''''(''t'') | ''t'' &amp;isin; '''R'''} - or some subset of '''R''') is a ''curve'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''''f''''' is its parametrization. 

Parameterizations are not necessarily unique - for example, '''''f'''''(''t'') = (cos ''t'', sin ''t'') such that ''t'' &amp;isin; [0, 2&amp;pi;) is one parametrization of the unit circle, and '''''g'''''(''t'') = (cos ''at'', sin ''at'') such that ''t'' &amp;isin; [0, 2&amp;pi;/''a'') is a whole family of parameterizations of that circle.

=== Collision and intersection points ===
Say we have two different curves. It may be important to consider
* points the two curves share - where they ''intersect''
* intersections which occur for the same value of t - where they ''collide''.

==== Intersection points ====
Firstly, we have two parameterizations '''''f'''''(''t'') and '''''g'''''(''t''), and we want to find out when they intersect, this means that we want to know when the function values of each parametrization are the same. This means that we need to solve
: '''''f'''''(''t'') = '''''g'''''(''s'')
because we're seeking the function values independent of the times they intersect.

For example, if we have '''''f'''''(''t'') = (''t'', 3''t'') and '''''g'''''(''t'') = (''t'', ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and we want to find intersection points:
: '''''f'''''(''t'') = '''''g'''''(''s'')
: (''t'', 3''t'') = (''s'', ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
: ''t'' = ''s'' and 3''t'' = ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
with solutions (''t'', ''s'') = (0, 0) and (3, 3)

So, the two curves intersect at the points (0, 0) and (3, 3).

==== Collision points ====
However, if we want to know when the points &quot;collide&quot;, with '''''f'''''(''t'') and '''''g'''''(''t''), we need to know when both the function values ''and'' the times are the same, so we need to solve instead 
: '''''f'''''(''t'') = '''''g'''''(''t'')

For example, using the same functions as before, '''''f'''''(''t'') = (''t'', 3''t'') and '''''g'''''(''t'') = (''t'', ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and we want to find collision points:
: '''''f'''''(''t'') = '''''g'''''(''t'')
: (''t'', 3''t'') = (''t'', ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
: ''t'' = ''t'' and 3''t'' = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
which gives solutions ''t'' = 0, 3
So the collision points are (0, 0) and (3, 3).

We may want to do this to actually model physical problems, such as in ballistics.

=== Continuity and differentiability ===
If we have a parametrization '''''f''''' : '''R''' &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which is built up out of ''component functions'' in the form '''''f'''''(''t'') = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''),...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')), '''''f''''' is continuous if and only if each component function is also. 

In this case the derivative of '''''f'''''(''t'') is 
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;(''t''),...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;(''t'')). This is actually a specific consequence of a more general fact we will see later.


=== Tangent vectors ===
Recall in single-variable calculus that on a curve, at a certain point, we can draw a line that is tangent to that curve at exactly at that point. This line is called a ''tangent''.  In the several variable case, we can do something similar.

We can expect the ''tangent vector'' to depend on '''''f'''''&amp;prime;(''t'') and we know that a line is its own tangent, so looking at a parametrised line will show us precisely how to define the tangent vector for a curve.

An arbitrary line is '''f'''(''t'')='''a'''''t''+'''b''', with  :''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')=''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''t''+''b''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, so
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;(''t'')=''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and 
:''f''&amp;prime;(''t'')='''a''', which is the direction of the line, its tangent vector.

Similarly, for any curve, the tangent vector is ''f''&amp;prime;(''t''). 



&lt;!-- 
The gradient of the line ''f''(''t'') in the one-variable case is ''f''&amp;prime;(''t''), likewise, the ''tangent vector'' to a curve in the several variable case is the vector '''''f'''''&amp;prime;(''t'') (this vector must not be '''0''').--&gt;

==== Angle between curves ====
[[Image:Inner-product-angle.png|right|thumb]]
We can then formulate the concept of the ''angle'' between two curves by considering the angle between the two tangent vectors. If two curves, parametrized by '''''f'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''''f'''''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intersect at some point, which means that 
: '''''f'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'')='''''f'''''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')=''c'',
the angle between these two curves at ''c'' is the angle between the tangent vectors '''''f'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;(''s'') and '''''f'''''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;(''t'') is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\arccos{\mathbf{f}_1^\prime(s)\cdot\mathbf{f}_2^\prime(t) \over |\mathbf{f}_1^\prime(s)||\mathbf{f}_2^\prime(t)|}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Tangent lines ====
With the concept of the tangent vector as being analogous to being the gradient of the line in the one variable case, we can form the idea of the ''tangent line''. Recall that we need a point on the line and its direction. 

If we want to form the tangent line to a point on the curve, say '''''p''''', we have the direction of the line '''''f'''''&amp;prime;('''''p'''''), so we can form the tangent line
: '''''x'''''(''t'')='''''p'''''+''t'' '''''f'''''&amp;prime;('''''p''''')

&lt;!--
...=== Forming parameterizations ===
I'll come back to this... (mention standard parametrization here)
--&gt;

=== Different parameterizations ===
One such parametrization of a curve is not necessarily unique. Curves can have several different parametrizations. For example, we already saw that the unit circle can be parametrized by '''''g'''''(''t'') = (cos ''at'', sin ''at'') such that ''t'' &amp;isin; [0, 2&amp;pi;/''a'').

Generally, if '''''f''''' is one parametrization of a curve, and '''''g''''' is another, with 
: '''''f'''''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''''g'''''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)
there is a function ''u''(''t'') such that ''u''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)=''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''''g''''(''u''(''t'')) = '''''f'''''(''t'') near ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

This means, in a sense, the function ''u''(''t'') &quot;speeds up&quot; the curve, but keeps the curve's shape.

=== Surfaces ===
A surface in space can be described by the image of a function '''''f''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. '''''f''''' is said to be the parametrization of that surface.

For example, consider the function
:'''''f'''''(&amp;alpha;, &amp;beta;) = &amp;alpha;(2,1,3)+&amp;beta;(-1,2,0)
This describes an infinite plane in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. If we restrict &amp;alpha; and &amp;beta; to some domain, we get a parallelogram-shaped surface in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Surfaces can also be described explicitly, as the graph of a function ''z'' = ''f''(''x'', ''y'') which has a standard parametrization as '''''f'''''(''x'',''y'')=(''x'', ''y'', ''f''(''x'',''y'')), or implictly, in the form ''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')=''c''.

==== Level sets ====
The concept of the ''level set'' (or ''contour'') is an important one. If you have a function ''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z''), a level set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is a set of the form {(''x'',''y'',''z'')|''f''(''x'',''y'',''z'')=''c''}. Each of these level sets is a surface.

Level sets can be similarly defined in any '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;

Level sets in two dimensions may be familiar from maps, or weather charts. Each line represents a level set. For example, on a map, each contour represents all the points where the height is the same. On a weather chart, the contours represent all the points where the air pressure is the same.

&lt;!--
...==== Intersections of surfaces ====
Different surfaces can intersect and produce curves as well. How can these be found? If the surfaces are simple, we can try and solve the two equations of the surfaces simultaneously.
--&gt;

== Limits and continuity ==
Before we can look at derivatives of multivariate functions, we need to look at how limits work with functions of several variables first, just like in the single variable case.

If we have a function '''''f''''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, we say that '''''f'''''('''''x''''') approaches '''''b''''' (in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) as '''''x''''' approaches '''''a''''' (in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;) if, for all positive &amp;epsilon;, there is a corresponding positive number &amp;delta;, |'''''f'''''('''''x''''')-'''''b'''''| &lt; &amp;epsilon; whenever |'''''x'''''-'''''a'''''| &lt; &amp;delta;, with '''''x''''' &amp;ne; '''''a'''''. 

This means that by making the difference between '''''x''''' and '''''a''''' smaller, we can make the difference between '''''f'''''('''''x''''') and '''''b''''' as small as we want.

If the above is true, we say  
* '''''f'''''('''''x''''') has ''limit'' '''''b''''' at '''''a'''''
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''''f'''''('''''x''''') approaches '''''b''''' as '''''x''''' approaches '''''a'''''
* '''''f'''''('''''x''''') &amp;rarr; '''''b''''' as '''''x''''' &amp;rarr; '''''a'''''

These four statements are all equivalent.

=== Rules ===
Since this is an almost identical formulation of limits in the single variable case, many of the limit rules in the one variable case are the same as in the multivariate case. 

For '''''f''''' and '''''g''''', mapping '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''h''('''''x''''') a scalar function mapping '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R''', with
* '''''f'''''('''''x''''') &amp;rarr; '''''b''''' as '''''x''''' &amp;rarr; '''''a'''
* '''''g'''''('''''x''''') &amp;rarr; '''''c''''' as '''''x''''' &amp;rarr; '''''a'''
* ''h''('''''x''''') &amp;rarr; ''H'' as '''''x''''' &amp;rarr; '''''a'''''
then:
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{a}} (\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{g}) = \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{a}} (h\mathbf{f}) = H\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
and consequently
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{a}} (\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{g}) = \mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{a}} (\mathbf{f}\times\mathbf{g}) = \mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--if ''n''=1 they're all scalar functions and '''''g'''''('''''x''''') is never '''0''', 
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{a}} ({\mathbf{f}\over \mathbf{g}}) = {\mathbf{b}\over\mathbf{c}}&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;
when H&amp;ne;0
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{a}} ({\mathbf{f}\over h}) = {\mathbf{b}\over H}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Continuity ===
Again, we can use a similar definition to the one variable case to formulate a definition of continuity for multiple variables. 

If '''''f''''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, f is continuous at a point '''''a''''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; if '''''f'''''('''''a''''') is defined and
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{a}} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a})&lt;/math&gt;

Just as for functions of one dimension, if '''''f''''', '''''g''''' are both continuous at '''''p''''', '''''f'''''+'''''g''''', &amp;lambda;'''''f''''' (for a scalar &amp;lambda;), '''''f'''''&amp;middot;'''''g''''', and '''''f'''''&amp;times;'''''g''''' are continuous also.  If &amp;phi; : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R''' is continus at '''''p''''', &amp;phi;'''''f''''', '''''f'''''/&amp;phi; are too if &amp;phi; is never zero.

From these facts we also have that if ''A'' is some matrix which is ''n''&amp;times;''m'' in size, with '''''x''''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, a function '''''f'''''('''''x''''')=''A'' '''''x''''' is continuous in that the function can be expanded in the form ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''''a'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+...+''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;'''''a'''''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be easily verified from the points above. 

If '''f''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which is in the form '''''f'''''('''''x''''') = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''''x'''''),...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''''x''''') is continuous if and only if each of its component functions are a polynomial or rational function, whenever they are defined.

Finally, if '''''f''''' is continuous at '''''p''''', '''''g''''' is continuous at '''''f'''''('''''p'''''), '''''g'''''('''''f'''''('''''x''''')) is continuous at '''''p'''''. &lt;!-- proof coming--&gt;

=== Special note about limits ===
It is important to note that &lt;!-- 1 variable functions can have multiple limits too
since we are looking at limits of functions of more than one variable, we must note that 
--&gt;we can approach a point ''in more than one direction'', and thus, the direction that we approach that point counts in our evaluation of the limit. It may be the case that a limit may exist moving in one direction, but not in another.
&lt;!--ex--&gt;

== Differentiable functions ==
We will start from the one-variable definition of the derivative at a point ''p'', namely
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow p} {f(x)-f(p) \over x-p} = f'(p)&lt;/math&gt;

Let's change above to equivalent form of
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow p} {f(x)-f(p)-f'(p)(x-p) \over x-p} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
which achieved after pulling f'(p) inside and putting it over a common denominator.

We can't divide by vectors, so this definition can't be immediately extended to the multiple variable case. Nonetheless, we don't have to: the thing we took interest in was the quotient of two small distances (magnitudes), not their other properties (like sign). It's worth noting that 'other' property of vector neglected is its direction. Now we can divide by the absolute value of a vector, so lets rewrite this definition in terms of absolute values
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow p} \frac{\left|f(x)-f(p)-f'(p)(x-p)\right|}{\left|  x-p\right|} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Another form of formula above is obtained by letting &lt;math&gt;h=x-p&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;x=p+h&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow p&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;h = x - p \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, so
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{\left|f(p+h)-f(p)-f'(p)h\right|}{\left| h\right|} = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as a 'small change'.

So, how can we use this for the several-variable case? 

If we switch all the variables over to vectors and replace the constant (which performs a linear map in one dimension) with a matrix (which denotes also a linear map), we have
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{p}} {|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p})-\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{p})| \over |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{p}|} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\mathbf{h}\rightarrow\mathbf{0}} {|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{h})-\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p})-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{h}| \over |\mathbf{h}|} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
If this limit exists for some '''''f''''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and there is a linear map '''''A''''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (denoted by matrix ''A'' which is ''m''&amp;times;''n''), we refer to this map as being the derivative and we write it as D&lt;sub&gt;'''''p'''''&lt;/sub&gt; '''''f'''''. 

A point on terminology - in referring to the action of taking the derivative (giving the linear map '''''A'''''), we write D&lt;sub&gt;'''''p'''''&lt;/sub&gt; '''''f''''', but in referring to the matrix ''A'' itself, it is known as the ''Jacobian'' matrix and is also written ''J''&lt;sub&gt;'''''p'''''&lt;/sub&gt; '''''f'''''. More on the Jacobian later.

=== Properties ===
There are a number of important properties of this formulation of the derivative.

==== Affine approximations ====
If '''''f''''' is differentiable at '''''p''''' for '''''x''''' close to '''''p''''', |'''''f'''''('''''x''''')-('''''f'''''('''''p''''')+''A''('''''x'''''-'''''p'''''))| is small compared to |'''''x'''''-'''''p'''''|, which means that '''''f'''''('''''x''''') is approximately equal to '''''f'''''('''''p''''')+''A''('''''x'''''-'''''p'''''). 

We call an expression of the form ''g''(''x'')+''c'' affine, when ''g''(''x'') is linear and ''c'' is a constant. '''''f'''''('''''p''''')+''A''('''''x'''''-'''''p''''') is an affine approximation to '''''f'''''('''''x''''').

==== Jacobian matrix and partial derivatives====
The Jacobian matrix of a function is in the form
: &lt;math&gt;\left(J_\mathbf{p} \mathbf{f}\right)_{ij} = \left.{\partial f_i \over \partial x_j}\right|_\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;
for a '''''f''''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;'''''p'''''&lt;/sub&gt; '''''f'''' is a ''n''&amp;times;''m'' matrix.

The consequence of this is that if '''''f''''' is differentiable at '''''p''''', ''all'' the partial derivatives of '''''f''''' exist at '''''p'''''.

However, it is possible that all the partial derivatives of a function exist at some point yet that function is not differentiable there, so it is very important not to mix derivative (linear map) with the Jacobian (matrix) especially in situations akin to the one cited.

==== Continuity and differentiability ====
Furthermore, if all the partial derivatives exist, and are continuous in some neighbourhood of a point '''''p''''', then '''''f''''' is differentiable at '''''p'''''. This has the consequence that for a function '''''f''''' which has its component functions built from continuous functions (such as rational functions, differentiable functions or otherwise), '''''f''''' is differentiable everywhere '''''f''''' is defined.

We use the terminology ''continuously differentiable'' for a function differentiable at '''''p''''' which has all its partial derivatives existing and are continuous in some neighbourhood at '''''p'''''.

=== Rules of taking Jacobians ===
If '''''f''''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''h''(''x'') : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R''' are differentiable at ''''p'''':
* &lt;math&gt;J_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{f}+\mathbf{g}) = J_\mathbf{p} \mathbf{f} + J_\mathbf{p} \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;J_\mathbf{p} (h\mathbf{f}) = hJ_\mathbf{p} \mathbf{f} + \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p}) J_\mathbf{p} h&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;J_\mathbf{p} (\mathbf{f}\cdot \mathbf{g}) = \mathbf{g}^T J_\mathbf{p} \mathbf{f} + \mathbf{f}^T J_\mathbf{p}\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;
Important: make sure the order is right - matrix multiplication is not commutative!

==== Chain rule ====
The chain rule for functions of several variables is as follows. For '''''f''''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''''g''''' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, and '''''g''''' o '''''f''''' differentiable at '''''p''''', then the Jacobian is given by 
: &lt;math&gt;\left( J_{\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p})} \mathbf{g}\right) \left( J_\mathbf{p} \mathbf{f}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Again, we have matrix multiplication, so one must preserve this exact order. 
Compositions in one order may be defined, but not necessarily in the other way.

&lt;!-- come back to this
*===== Higher derivatives ====
If one wishes to take higher-order partial derivatives, we can proceed in two ways:
* if the order is small, calculate the first derivative, and then calculate the derivative of that and so forth, or
* nest using the chain rule as follows:
--&gt;

===Alternate notations===

For simplicity, we will often use various standard abbreviations, so we can write most of the formulae on one line. This can make it easier to see the important details.

We can abbreviate partial differentials with a subscript, e.g.,
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_x h(x,y)= \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \quad \partial_x \partial_y h= \partial_y \partial_x h&lt;/math&gt;
When we are using a subscript this way we will generally use the Heaviside ''D'' rather than &amp;part;,
:&lt;math&gt;D_x h(x,y)= \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} 
\quad D_x D_y h= D_y D_x h&lt;/math&gt;
Mostly, to make the formulae even more compact, we will put the subscript on the function itself.
:&lt;math&gt;D_x h= h_x \quad h_{xy}=h_{yx}&lt;/math&gt;

If we are using subscripts to label the axes, ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;hellip;, then, rather than having two layers of subscripts, we will use the number as the subscript.

:&lt;math&gt;h_1 = D_1 h = \partial_1 h = \partial_{x_1}h = \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_1} 
&lt;/math&gt;

We can also use subscripts for the components of a vector function, '''u'''=(''u&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'') or '''u'''=(''u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'',''u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;hellip;''u&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')

If we are using subscripts for both the components of a vector and for partial derivatives we will separate them with a comma.

:&lt;math&gt;u_{x,y}=\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;

The most widely used notation is h&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.  Both h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and 
&amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;h are also quite widely used whenever the axes are numbered. The notation &amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;h is used least frequently.

We will use whichever notation best suits the equation we are working with.

=== Directional derivatives===
Normally, a partial derivative of a function with respect to one of its variables, say, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, takes the derivative of that &quot;slice&quot; of that function parallel to the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;'th axis.
&lt;!-- needs pic --&gt;

More precisely, we can think of cutting a function '''''f'''''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in space along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;'th axis, with keeping everything but the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; variable constant.

From the definition, we have the partial derivative at a point '''''p''''' of the function along this slice as
:&lt;math&gt;{\partial \mathbf{f} \over \partial x_j} = \lim_{t\rightarrow 0} {\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p}+t\mathbf{e}_j) - \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p}) \over t}&lt;/math&gt;

provided this limit exists.

Instead of the basis vector, which corresponds to taking the derivative along that axis, we can pick a vector in any direction (which we usually take as being a unit vector), and we take the ''directional derivative'' of a function as 
:&lt;math&gt;{\partial \mathbf{f} \over \partial \mathbf{d}} = \lim_{t\rightarrow 0} {\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p}+t\mathbf{d}) - \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p}) \over t}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''d''''' is the direction vector.

If we want to calculate directional derivatives, calculating them from the limit definition is rather painful, but, we have the following: if '''''f''''' : '''R'''&lt;Sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R''' is differentiable at a point '''''p''''', |'''''p'''''|=1,
: &lt;math&gt;{\partial \mathbf{f} \over \partial \mathbf{d}} = D_\mathbf{p} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{d})&lt;/math&gt;

There is a closely related formulation which we'll look at in the next section.

=== Gradient vectors ===
The partial derivatives of a scalar tell us how much it changes if we move along  one of the axes. What if we move in a different direction?

We'll call the scalar ''f'', and consider what happens if we move an infintesimal direction '''''dr'''''=(''dx,dy,dz''), using the chain rule.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{df}=dx\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + 
dy\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}+dz\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the dot product of '''dr''' with a vector whose components are the partial derivatives of '''''f''''', called the gradient of '''''f'''''

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{grad} \mathbf{f} = \nabla \mathbf{f} = 
\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p})}{\partial x_1},\cdots,
\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p})}{\partial x_n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

We can form directional derivatives at a point '''''p''''',  in the direction '''''d''''' then by taking the dot product of the gradient with '''''d'''''
:&lt;math&gt;{\partial \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p}) \over \partial \mathbf{d}} =\mathbf{d} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that grad ''f'' looks like a vector multiplied by a scalar. This particular combination of partial derivatives is commonplace, so we abbreviate it to
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla = \left( \frac{\partial }{\partial x}, 
\frac{\partial }{\partial y}, \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

We can write the action of taking the gradient vector by writing this as an ''operator''. Recall that in the one-variable case we can write ''d''/''dx'' for the action of taking the derivative with respect to ''x''. This case is similar, but '''&amp;nabla;''' acts like a vector. 

We can also write the action of taking the gradient vector as:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla  = \left( \frac{\partial }{\partial x_1},
\frac{\partial }{\partial x_2}, \cdots \frac{\partial }{\partial x_n}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

==== Properties of the gradient vector ====
===== Geometry =====
* Grad '''''f'''''('''''p''''') is a vector pointing in the direction of steepest slope of '''''f'''''. |grad '''''f'''''('''''p''''')| is the rate of change of that slope at that point.

For example, if we consider h(''x'', ''y'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The level sets of ''h'' are concentric circles, centred on the origin, and
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla h = (h_x,h_y) = 2(x,y)= 2 \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;
grad ''h'' points directly away from the origin, at right angles to the contours.

* Along a level set, (&amp;nabla;'''''f''''')('''''p''''') is perpendicular to the level set {'''''x'''''|'''''f'''''('''''x''''')='''''f'''''('''''p''''') at '''''x'''''='''''p'''''}.

If '''dr''' points along the contours of ''f'', where the function is constant, then ''df'' will be zero. Since ''df'' is a dot product, that means that the two vectors, '''df''' and grad ''f'', must be at right angles, i.e. the gradient is at right angles to the contours.

===== Algebraic properties =====
Like ''d/dx'', &amp;nabla; is linear. For any pair of constants, ''a'' and ''b'', and any pair of scalar functions, ''f'' and ''g''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} (af+bg)= a\frac{d}{dx}f + b\frac{d}{dx}g 
\quad \nabla (af+bg) = a \nabla f + b \nabla g&lt;/math&gt;

Since it's a vector, we can try taking its dot and cross product with other vectors, and with itself.

===Divergence===

If the vector function '''u''' maps '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; to itself, then we can take the dot product of '''u''' and &amp;nabla;. This dot product is called the divergence.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}\, \mathbf{u} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 
\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1} + \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_2} + \cdots \frac{\partial u_n}{\partial x_n}&lt;/math&gt;

If we look at a vector function like '''v'''=(1+x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,xy) &lt;!-- Will need diagram --&gt; we can see that to the left of the origin all the '''v''' vectors are converging towards the origin, but on the right they are diverging away from it.

Div '''u''' tells us how much '''u''' is converging or diverging. It is positive when the vector is diverging from some point, and negative when the vector is converging on that point.

:''Example:''
:For ''v''=(1+x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, xy), div '''v'''=3''x'', which is positive to the right of the origin, where '''v''' is diverging, and negative to the left of the origin, where '''v''' is converging.

Like grad, div is linear.
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left( a\mathbf{u}+b\mathbf{v} \right) = 
a\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}  + b\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

Later in this chapter we will see how the divergence of a vector function can be integrated to tell us more about the behaviour of that function.

To find the divergence we took the dot product of '''&amp;nabla;''' and a vector with '''&amp;nabla;''' on the left. If we reverse the order we get
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla = u_x D_x + u_y D_y + u_z D_z &lt;/math&gt;

To see what this means consider '''i'''&amp;middot;'''&amp;nabla;''' This is ''D''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, the partial differential in the '''i''' direction. Similarly, '''u'''&amp;middot;'''&amp;nabla;''' is the partial differential in the '''u''' direction, multiplied by |'''u'''|

===Curl===
If '''u''' is a three-dimensional vector function on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; then we can take its cross product with &amp;nabla;. This cross product is called the ''curl''.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{curl}\,\mathbf{u} = \nabla \times \mathbf{u} 
=\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k} \\ 
D_x &amp; D_y &amp; D_z \\ u_x &amp; u_y &amp; u_z \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Curl '''u''' tells us if the vector '''u''' is rotating round a point. The direction of curl '''u''' is the axis of rotation.

We can treat vectors in two dimensions as a special case of three dimensions, with ''u&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''=0 and D&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'''u'''=0. We can then extend the definition of curl '''u''' to two-dimensional vectors

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{curl}\,\mathbf{u} = D_y u_x-D_x u_y&lt;/math&gt;

This two dimensional curl is a scalar. In four, or more, dimensions there is no vector equivalent to the curl.

''Example:''&lt;br/&gt;
Consider '''u'''=(-''y, x''). These vectors are tangent to circles centred on the origin, so appear to be rotating around it anticlockwise.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{curl}\,\mathbf{u} = D_y(-y)-D_x x= -2&lt;/math&gt;

''Example''&lt;br/&gt;
Consider '''u'''=(''-y, x-z, y''), which is similar to the previous example.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{curl}\,\mathbf{u} = 
\begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k} \\ 
D_x &amp; D_y &amp; D_z \\ -y &amp; x-z &amp; y \end{vmatrix}
=2\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;
This '''u''' is rotating round the axis '''i'''+'''k'''

Later in this chapter we will see how the curl of a vector function can be integrated to tell us more about the behaviour of that function.

===Product and chain rules===

Just as with ordinary differentiation, there are product rules for grad, div and curl.

*If ''g'' is a scalar and '''v''' is a vector, then 
::the divergence of ''g'''''v''' is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot (g\mathbf{v})=g \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) g&lt;/math&gt;
:: the curl of ''g'''''v''' is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times (g\mathbf{v}) = g(\nabla \times \mathbf{v})+

(\nabla g) \times \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;
*If ''u'' and ''v'' are both vectors then 
::the gradient of their dot product is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla ( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} ) = 
\mathbf{u} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{v} ) + 
\mathbf{v} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{u} ) + 
(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}
&lt;/math&gt;
::the divergence of their cross product is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot ( \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} ) =
\mathbf{v}\cdot ( \nabla \times \mathbf{u} ) -
\mathbf{u}\cdot ( \nabla \times \mathbf{v} )&lt;/math&gt;
::the curl of their cross product is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times ( \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} ) =
(\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla ) \mathbf{u} - (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v}
+ \mathbf{u}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}) - \mathbf{v}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u})
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- Anything to be said about these formulae? --&gt;

We can also write chain rules. In the general case, when both functions are vectors and the composition is defined, we can use the Jacobian defined earlier.
:&lt;math&gt; 
\left. \nabla \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{v}) \right|_{\mathbf{r}}=
\mathbf{J}_{\mathbf{v}} \left. \nabla \mathbf{v} \right|_{\mathbf{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;'''u'''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Jacobian of '''u''' at the point '''v'''.

Normally '''J''' is a matrix but if either the range or the domain of '''u''' is  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; then it becomes a vector. In these special cases we can compactly write the chain rule using only vector notation.

*If ''g'' is a scalar function of a vector and ''h'' is a scalar function of ''g'' then
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla h(g) = \frac{dh}{dg} \nabla g&lt;/math&gt;
*If ''g'' is a scalar function of a vector then
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla = (\nabla g) \frac{d}{dg}&lt;/math&gt;
This substitution can be made in any of the equations containing '''&amp;nabla;'''

===Second order differentials===

We can also consider dot and cross products of '''&amp;nabla;''' with itself, whenever they can be defined. Once we know how to simplify products of two '''&amp;nabla;''''s we'll know out to simplify products with three or more.

The divergence of the gradient of a scalar ''f'' is
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 f(x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2}+
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2^2}+\ldots+\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

This combination of derivatives is the '''Laplacian''' of ''f''. It is commmonplace in physics and multidimensional calculus because of its simplicity and symmetry.

We can also take the Laplacian of a vector,
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}(x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n) = 
\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{u}}{\partial x_1^2}+ 
\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{u}}{\partial x_2^2}+ \ldots +
\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{u}}{\partial x_n^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Laplacian of a vector is not the same as the divergence of its gradient
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u})- \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}=
\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt;

Both the curl of the gradient and the divergence of the curl are always zero.
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \nabla f=0 \quad \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{u})=0
&lt;/math&gt;

This pair of rules will prove useful.

==Integration==
We have already considered differentiation of functions of more than one variable, which leads us to consider how we can meaningfully look at integration.

In the single variable case, we interpret the definite integral of a function to mean the area under the function. There is a similar interpretation in the multiple variable case: for example, if we have a paraboloid in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, we may want to look at the integral of that paraboloid over some region of the ''xy'' plane, which will be the ''volume'' under that curve and inside that region.

=== Riemann sums ===
When looking at these forms of integrals, we look at the Riemann sum. Recall in the one-variable case we divide the interval we are integrating over into rectangles and summing the areas of these rectangles as their widths get smaller and smaller. For the multiple-variable case, we need to do something similar, but the problem arises how to split up '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, for instance.

To do this, we extend the concept of the interval, and consider what we call a ''n''-interval. An ''n''-interval is a set of points in some rectangular region with sides of some fixed width in each dimension, that is, a set in the form {'''''x'''''&amp;isin;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;|''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; with ''i'' = 0,...,''n''}, and its area/size/volume (which we simply call its ''measure'' to avoid confusion) is the product of the lengths of all its sides.

So, an ''n''-interval in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; could be some rectangular partition of the plane, such as {(''x'',''y'') | ''x'' &amp;isin; [0,1] and ''y'' &amp;isin; [0, 2]|}. Its measure is 2.

If we are to consider the Riemann sum now in terms of sub-''n''-intervals of a region &amp;Omega;, it is
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i; S_i \subset \Omega} f(x^*_i)m(S_i)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m''(''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the measure of the division of &amp;Omega; into ''k'' sub-''n''-intervals ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a point in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The index is important - we only perform the sum where ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; falls completely within &amp;Omega; - any ''S''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that is not completely contained in &amp;Omega; we ignore.

As we take the limit as ''k'' goes to infinity, that is, we divide up &amp;Omega; into finer and finer sub-''n''-intervals, and this sum is the same no matter how we divide up &amp;Omega;, we get the ''integral'' of ''f'' over &amp;Omega; which we write
: &lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega f&lt;/math&gt;
For two dimensions, we may write
: &lt;math&gt;\int\int_\Omega f&lt;/math&gt;
and likewise for ''n'' dimensions.

=== Iterated integrals ===
Thankfully, we need not always work with Riemann sums every time we want to calculate an integral in more than one variable. There are some results that make life a bit easier for us.

For '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, if we have some region bounded between two functions of the other variable (so two functions in the form ''f''(''x'') = ''y'', or ''f''(''y'') = ''x''), between a constant boundary (so, between ''x'' = ''a'' and ''x'' =''b'' or ''y'' = ''a'' and ''y'' = ''b''), we have
: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b\,\int_{f(x)}^{g(x)} h(x,y)\,dy dx&lt;/math&gt;

An important theorem (called ''Fubini's theorem'') assures us that this integral is the same as 
: &lt;math&gt;\int\int_\Omega f&lt;/math&gt;,
if f is continuous on the domain of integration.

===Order of integration===

In some cases the first integral of the entire iterated integral is difficult or impossible to solve, therefore, it can be to our advantage to change the order of integration.

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b\,\int_{f(x)}^{g(x)} h(x,y)\,dx dy&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int_c^d\,\int_{e(y)}^{f(y)} h(x,y)\,dy dx&lt;/math&gt;

As of the writing of this, there is no set method to change an order of integration from dxdy to dydx or some other variable.  Although, it is possible to change the order of integration in an x and y simple integration by simply switching the limits of integration around also, in non-simple x and y integrations the best method as of yet is to recreate the limits of the integration from the graph of the limits of integration.

In higher order integration that can't be graphed, the process can be very tedious.  For example, dxdydz can be written into dzdydx, but first dxdydz must be switched to dydxdz and then to dydzdx and then to dzdydx (as 3-dimensional cases can be graphed, this method would lack parsimony).

===Parametric integrals===
If we have a vector function, '''u''', of a scalar parameter, ''s'', we can integrate with respect to ''s'' simply by integrating each component of '''u''' separately.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(s)=\int \mathbf{u}(s)\,ds \Rightarrow v_i(s)=\int u_i(s)\,ds 
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if '''u''' is given a function of vector of parameters, '''s''', lying in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, integration with respect to the parameters reduces to a multiple integral of each component.

===Line integrals===
[[Image:Line-Integral.gif]]
In one dimension, saying we are integrating from ''a'' to ''b'' uniquely specifies the integral.

In higher dimensions, saying we are integrating from '''a''' to '''b''' is not sufficient. In general, we must also specify the path taken between '''a''' and '''b'''. 

We can then write the integrand as a function of the arclength along the curve, and integrate by components.

E.g., given a scalar function ''h''('''r''') we write

:&lt;math&gt;\int_C h(\mathbf{r}) \, d\mathbf{r} = 
\int_C h(\mathbf{r}) \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{ds}\,ds =
\int_C h(\mathbf{r}(s)) \mathbf{t}(s) \, ds&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the curve being integrated along, and '''t''' is the unit vector tangent to the curve.

There are some particularly natural ways to integrate a vector function, '''u''', along a curve,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_C \mathbf{u}\, ds \quad 
\int_C \mathbf{u} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \quad 
\int_C \mathbf{u} \times d\mathbf{r} \quad 
\int_C \mathbf{u} \cdot \,\mathbf{n} ds&lt;/math&gt;

where the third possibility only applies in 3 dimensions.

Again, these integrals can all be written as integrals with respect to the arclength, ''s''.

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_C  \mathbf{u} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_C  \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{t} \, ds
\quad 
\int_C \mathbf{u} \times d\mathbf{r} = \int_C \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{t}\, ds
\quad &lt;/math&gt;

If the curve is planar and ''u'' a vector lying in the same plane, the second integral can be usefully rewritten. Say,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=u_t \mathbf{t}+u_n \mathbf{n} + u_b \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''t''', '''n''', and '''b''' are the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors uniquely defined by the curve.

Then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{t}= -\mathbf{b} u_n + \mathbf{n} u_b&lt;/math&gt;

For the 2-d curves specified '''b''' is the constant unit vector normal to their plane, and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; is always zero. 

Therefore, for such curves,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_C \mathbf{u} \times d\mathbf{r} =
\int_C \mathbf{u} \cdot \,\mathbf{n} ds &lt;/math&gt;

====Green's Theorem====
[[Image:Green's-theorem-simple-region.svg|thumb|right]]
Let C be a piecewise smooth, simple closed curve that bounds a region S on the Cartesian plane.  If two function M(x,y) and N(x,y) are continuous and their partial derivatives are continuous, then

&lt;math&gt;\int \int_S  (\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial M}{\partial y})  dA = \oint_C M dx + N dy = \oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

In order for Green's theorem to work there must be no singularities in the vector field within the boundaries of the curve.

Green's theorem works by summing the circulation in each infinitesimal segment of area enclosed within the curve.

====Inverting differentials====

We can use line integrals to calculate functions with specified divergence, gradient, or curl.

*If grad ''V'' = '''u'''
:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{p})=\int_{\mathbf{p}_0}^{\mathbf{p}} \mathbf{u} \cdot d\mathbf{r} + h(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''h'' is any function of zero gradient and curl '''u''' must be zero.

*If div '''u''' = ''V''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{p}) =\int_{\mathbf{p}_0}^{\mathbf{p}} V \, d\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{w}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;
:where '''w''' is any function of zero divergence.

*If curl '''u''' = '''v'''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{p}) =
\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbf{p}_0}^{\mathbf{p}} \mathbf{v} \times d\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{w}(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;
:where '''w''' is any function of zero curl.

''For example'', if ''V''=''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{grad} V = 2(x, y, z) = 2 \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathbf{r}} 2\mathbf{u} \cdot d\mathbf{u} &amp; = &amp; \int_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathbf{r}} 2 \left( udu + vdv+ wdw \right) \\
&amp; = &amp; \left[ u^2 \right]_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathbf{r}} + 
\left[ v^2 \right]_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathbf{r}} +
\left[ w^2 \right]_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathbf{r}} \\
&amp; = &amp; x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2\\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so this line integral of the gradient gives the original function.

Similarly, if '''v'''='''k''' then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{p}) =
\int_{\mathbf{p}_0}^{\mathbf{p}}  \mathbf{k} \times d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider any curve from '''0''' to '''p'''=(''x, ''y', ''z''), given by '''r'''='''r'''(''s'') with '''r'''(0)='''0''' and '''r'''(''S'')='''p''' for some ''S'', and do the above integral along that curve.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{p}) &amp; = &amp; 
\int_0^S  \mathbf{k} \times \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{ds} \, ds \\ &amp; = &amp; 
\int_0^S \left( \frac{dr_x}{ds} \mathbf{j}-\frac{dr_y}{ds} \mathbf{i} \right) \, ds \\ &amp; = &amp; 
\mathbf{j} \int_0^S \frac{dr_x}{ds} \, ds - 
\mathbf{i} \int_0^S \frac{dr_y}{ds} \, ds \\ 
&amp; = &amp; \mathbf{j} [r_x(s)]^S_0 - \mathbf{i} [r_y(s)]^S_0 \\ 
&amp; = &amp; p_x\mathbf{j} - p_y \mathbf{i} =  x\mathbf{j} - y \mathbf{i}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and curl '''u''' is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k} \\
D_x &amp; D_y &amp; D_z \\
-y &amp; x &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{k} = \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

as expected.

We will soon see that these three integrals do not depend on the path, apart from a constant.

===Surface and Volume Integrals===

Just as with curves, it is possible to parameterise surfaces then integrate over those parameters without regard to geometry of the surface.

That is, to integrate a scalar function ''V'' over a surface ''A'' parameterised by ''r'' and ''s'' we calculate

:&lt;math&gt;\int_A V(x,y,z) \, dS = \int \int_A V(r,s) \det J \, dr ds &lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the Jacobian of the transformation to the parameters.

To integrate a vector this way, we integrate each component separately.

However, in three dimensions, every surface has an associated normal vector '''n''', which can be used in integration. We write &lt;b&gt;''dS''&lt;/b&gt;='''n'''&lt;i&gt;dS&lt;/i&gt;.

For a scalar function, ''V'', and a vector function, '''v''', this gives us the integrals

:&lt;math&gt;\int_A V \, \mathbf{dS} \quad \int_A  \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{dS}
\quad \int_A  \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{dS} &lt;/math&gt;

These integrals can be reduced to parametric integrals but, written this way, it is clear that they reflect more of the geometry of the surface.

When working in three dimensions, ''dV'' is a scalar, so there is only one option for integrals over volumes. 

===Gauss's divergence theorem===
[[Image:Divergence_theorem.svg‎|thumb|right|250px]]

We know that, in one dimension,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b Df dx = f|_a^b &lt;/math&gt;

Integration is the inverse of differentiation, so integrating the differential of a function returns the original function.

This can be extended to two or more dimensions in a natural way, drawing on the analogies between single variable and multivariable calculus.

The analog of ''D'' is &amp;nabla;, so we should consider cases where the integrand is a divergence.

Instead of integrating over a one-dimensional interval, we need to integrate over a ''n''-dimensional volume.

In one dimension, the integral depends on the values at the edges of the interval, so we expect the result to be connected with values on the boundary.

This suggests a theorem of the form,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \nabla \cdot  \mathbf{u} \, dV = 
\int_{\partial V} \mathbf{n} \cdot  \mathbf{u} dS &lt;/math&gt;

This is indeed true, for vector fields in any number of dimensions.

This is called ''Gauss's theorem''.

There are two other, closely related, theorems for grad and curl:

*&lt;math&gt;\int_V \nabla u \, dV = 
\int_{\partial V} u \mathbf{n} dS &lt;/math&gt;,

*&lt;math&gt;\int_V \nabla \times  \mathbf{u} \, dV = 
\int_{\partial V} \mathbf{n} \times  \mathbf{u} dS &lt;/math&gt;,

with the last theorem only being valid where curl is defined.

===Stokes' curl theorem=== 

[[Image:Stokes'_Theorem.svg‎|thumb|right|250px]]
These theorems also hold in two dimensions, where they relate surface and line integrals. Gauss's divergence theorem becomes 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \nabla \cdot  \mathbf{u} \, dS = 
\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{n} \cdot  \mathbf{u}\, ds &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is arclength along the boundary curve and the vector '''n''' is the unit normal to the curve that lies in the surface ''S'', i.e. in the tangent plane of the surface at its boundary, which is not necessarily the same as the unit normal associated with the boundary curve itself. 

Similarly, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \nabla \times  \mathbf{u} \, dS = 
\int_C \mathbf{n} \times  \mathbf{u} ds \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''C'' is the boundary of ''S''

In this case the integral does not depend on the surface ''S''.

To see this, suppose we have different surfaces, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, spanning the same curve ''C'', then by switching the direction of the normal on one of the surfaces we can write

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{S_1+S_2} \nabla \times  \mathbf{u} \, dS =
\int_S \nabla \times  \mathbf{u} \, dS - \int_S \nabla \times  \mathbf{u} \, dS 
\quad (2)&lt;/math&gt; 

The left hand side is an integral over a closed surface bounding some volume ''V'' so we can use Gauss's divergence theorem.

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{S_1+S_2} \nabla \times  \mathbf{u} \, dS =
\int_V \nabla \cdot \nabla \times  \mathbf{u} \, dV &lt;/math&gt;

but we know this integrand is always zero so the right hand side of (2) must always be zero, i.e. the integral is independent of the surface.

This means we can choose the surface so that the normal to the curve lying in the surface is the same as the curves intrinsic normal.

Then, if '''u''' itself lies in the surface, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=\left( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n} \right) \mathbf{n} + 
\left( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{t} \right) \mathbf{t}&lt;/math&gt;

just as we did for line integrals in the plane earlier, and substitute this into (1) to get

:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \nabla \times  \mathbf{u} \, dS = 
\int_C \mathbf{u} \cdot d\mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;

This is ''Stokes' curl theorem''

Yo, I added in Green's Theorem and order of integration into Multivariable Calculus, and Projection/derivatives/limits/integral/vector-valued functions/position, velocity, acceleration, tangent, normal, binormal, vectors/curvature into Vector Calculus.  However, I'm not sure how much of this scope from Vector Calculus spills into this Multivariable Calculus, what else should be added (as I don't really want to edit for grammatical errors and ordering nicety, just adding articles, since I suck at ordering and English), and where I can put independence of path or if you have that in here, at one point it looks like you do, but to be honest I can't decipher what you're trying to teach; but then again I just randomly put stuff in here also.  Anyways, what's going on/where can I read about, thanks, feedback?  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 05:52, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
==Comment==
Starting with the topology of R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; feels like an higher level approach than the the other chapters in this section of this book - more suited for the fully formal third section.

I put the div, grad, hyperbolic, parabolic, etc subheadings in to indicate the expected scope of this chapter, and to allow people to fill it in from the middle. Was there any particular objection to doing this?

Does anyone have any comments on the scope of this chapter, and the rest of this book? As I understand it, it's to cover calculus from 16-19, A' Level and 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; year undergrad, mostly without full rigor. At that level, I'd expect a course on multivariable calculus to cover most or all the headings I listed, and nothing beyond.
[[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 04:48, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: You're on the wrong page. Try  [[Talk:Calculus:Multivariable calculus]]. The reason why I'm doing it this way is that I'm trying to be complete, but not especially dryly rigorous. It's not ''that'' bad, is it? Anyway, I'll be getting to divs and grads etc later. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:52, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I hadn't noticed the redirect, left from moving the simple vector stuff to an earlier chapter.

I'd have just relied on intuitive definitions at this level, and maybe a couple of illustrations. Everyone ''knows'' what the edge of a surface or volume is, even if that intuitive notion is incomplete. That was the general approach followed by the textbooks I read at this level.

And why not leave the div, grad, etc headings in? Then people can drop stuff in the middle of the chapter, if that happens to be what they feel like writing, and it gives a better idea of the general level expected.  [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 05:09, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: I'll put in illustrations later. I want to get most of the text out of the way first.
: I also think certain pages should go a bit more &quot;above and beyond the call of duty&quot;. My aesthetic for these sorts of pages is to be complete, rigorous but not formal, or to the point of excessive dryness, and to have gentler language. Maybe it's a bit too much now, so I wouldn't know where else to take it. It's not formal enough to deserve being under the &quot;formal&quot; section on the Calculus intro page. 
: As to the headers, I probably won't be using them exactly, so I don't know how useful it would be. Are you thinking of contributing too? Maybe we can work something out, so you can pitch in at the middle if you so choose. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:29, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

You could start with the intuitive notion of boundaries first, then say this is how we talk about them rigorously.

I am thinking of contributing. That's another reason I put the headers in, as markers of what I intended when I was ready. I've put a section on grad in now, which belongs perhaps a third of the way down the chapter, which should also indicate the lines I was thinking along. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 06:11, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)


Your last edit is better for boundaries, Dysprosia. The problem wasn't precisely excessive rigor, more lack of motivation. We should try and say why we're making these definitions, make it clear we're going somewhere with them and where we;ve plucked them from, or some readers will get lost at this point.

Along the same lines, perhaps you could say something about why the difference between open and closed sets matters in calculus, or why it's interesting in its own right: you, because I'm reluctant to edit a subsection you're currently active in. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 07:32, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: Okay, I've tried to add more motivation to these points, but feel free to pitch in at any time, however. I'll probably continue to add more later on tonight, so you can add some stuff if you want :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:04, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

How common is the notation &amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ''h''? I've seen extensive use of ''h''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, but not the former... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:22, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I've seen &amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; used, (e.g PDE: Erich Zauderer ex 2.1.2), but it isn't that common. Using numbers as subscripts is more common, especially with tensors. The letters are only seem to be used that way where space is short, the names of the axes matter, and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; wouldn't work, e.g  
(&amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-c&amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)(&amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;+c&amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)h=0,  
which compactly exhibits the factorisation. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 12:56, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)~

: That reminds me of the operator form... If so, maybe use the Heaviside &quot;big-D&quot;? I've been using that form in other pages... what do you think? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 13:56, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

That's more common than &amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and needs less typing. I'd use it preferentially, except in fluid dynamics (where the total derivative D/Dt is too similiar). The meaning of &amp;part;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is obvious, there's just no call for it. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 14:21, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

''How'' does a set being open/closed matter for doing ''multi-variable calculus'' at this level? Which theorems will we be quoting that require the distinction? Similarly for the formal defintions of neighbourhoods etc. On reflection, I feel these details are too much of a digression from the main topic of this chapter. They might fit better in the vector chapter, which is more about the structure of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Either that, or a chapter specifically about such topics.

In 1-D, direction of tangent is arctan(f'), the extension to d'''f'''(''t'')/d''t'' is not immediately obvious - principally because the 1-D csae isn't being thought of as parametric.

Lower case L looks too similar to 1, especially when editing, best avoided
Better to premultiply &amp;nabla; by constants, not postmultiply, to avoid ambiguity

&amp;nabla; as vector should be mentioned at first opportunity [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 20:39, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: There ''was'' something that uses open/closed sets, but I can't quite remember it now...I might remember it later, though ;)...Oh, remember now. It may be ''useful'' to mention neighbourhoods in discussing the implicit function theorem later, but certainly isn't ''necessary'' to.
: The change in l/L is fine. There is that funky loopy l but I don't know how to generate that in TeX...[[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:26, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I'd then mention these things just before using them, putting them in the right context. It may slightly out of place, logically, but it should improve readability.[[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 23:17, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)
==layout==
I'm assuming that this wikibook isn't very active? If I'm mistaken, I would like to propose this general layout, if agreed by other editors:

Ch. 1:

*Mostly general vectors. Discuss addition, subtraction, dot product and applications, cross product and applications.
Ch. 2: 

*Vector Valued Functions. 
Discuss Vector Valued functions in planes first (xy plane to be specific). Introduce projectile motion perhaps. Then move on to 3d VVF's. Here we can discuss Unit Tangent, Unit Normals, curvature etc.

Ch. 3:
*Partial Derivatives and Applications.

What partial derivatives are, what they're used for. Fairly self-explanatory. Then of course we need to discuss optimization and LaGrange Multipliers.

Ch. 4:
*Integration with multiple variables.
*Double/Triple Integrals; area/volume.

Ch. 5:
*Vector Fields.

== Topology ==

Is topology really the best way to start a chapter on multi-variable? (assuming that this is supposed to be equivalent to a CAL III course) (answering my own question) I would say no, the more traditional place to start is partial derivation and the implications thereof. --[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:10, 19 June 2007 (UTC)


== Boundary points ==
As someone who recently understood what a boundary point is (I amn studying calculus on my own as prepartion for next year math) I confess that definition you guys used is very hard to understand. Consider definition from the following site, both precise and not:

http://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/MathTutorial/CLNF.HTM

Definitions from this site made me understand what a boundary points are much easier, even easier than it is written in the book I am using (Spivak's Calculus on manifolds). Tank you.

== Errata in the Jacobian Matrix section ==

if you define &lt;math&gt;\left(J_\mathbf{p} \mathbf{f}\right)_{ij} = \left.{\partial f_i \over \partial x_j}\right|_\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;
then  &lt;math&gt;J \in R^{nxm}&lt;/math&gt;, i think this should be corrected. I will do this if no there aren't any objections. --[[User:Drunken sapo|Drunken sapo]] ([[User talk:Drunken sapo|talk]]) 14:24, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

== Approach using vectors ==

I don't like how this page approaches it initially dealing with vectors rather than multi-variable scalar functions. It also fails to discuss how limits and continuity work in multivariate functions.--[[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] ([[User talk:Jasper Deng|talk]]|[[:m:User talk:Jasper Deng|meta]]) 02:41, 19 April 2013 (UTC)</text>

==Different levels of proof==

There are many different levels of proofs. Some people tend to regard everything as a proof, others nothing. Having a good ability to decide what consitutes a good proof is a clear sign of high intelligence. A person who doesn't know anything about scientific proofs is not able to see through pseudo-scientific proofs and might therefore walk around believing things which are not true. One measure of intelligence is the correspondence of a person's models of reality with reality itself.

==Scientific proof==

==Elements of a scientific method== 
&lt;div class=&quot;boilerplate metadata&quot; id=&quot;attention&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFCE6; margin: 0 2.5%; padding: 0 10px; border: 1px solid #aaa;&quot;&gt;  
The essential elements of a scientific method are [[w:iteration|iteration]]s and [[w:recursion|recursions]] of the following four steps:
#[[#Characterization|Characterization]] (Quantification, observation and measurement)
#[[#Hypothesis development|Hypothesis]] (a theoretical, hypothetical [[w:explanation|explanation]] of the observations and measurements)
#[[#Prediction from the hypothesis|Prediction]] ([[w:logic|logic]]al [[w:deduction|deduction]] from the [[w:hypothesis|hypothesis]])
#[[#Experiment|Experiment]] ([[w:test]] of all of the above) &lt;/div&gt;
The above is a [[w:hypothetico-deductive method|hypothetico-deductive method]], and includes [[w:observation|observation]] in the first and fourth steps. 
Each step is subject to [[w:peer review|peer review]] for possible mistakes.

===Characterization===
A scientific method depends upon a careful characterization of the subject of the investigation. (The ''subject'' can also be called ''[[w:list of unsolved problems|the problem]]'' or the ''unknown''.) For example, [[w:Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin]] correctly characterized [[w:St. Elmo's fire|St. Elmo's fire]] as [[w:electricity|electrical]] in nature, but it has taken a long series of experiments and theory to establish this. While seeking the pertinent properties of the subject, this careful thought may also entail some definitions and observations; the observation often demands careful ''measurement'' and/or counting. 

The systematic, careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between pseudo-sciences, such as alchemy, and a science, such as chemistry. Scientific measurements taken are usually tabulated, graphed, or mapped, and statistical manipulations, such as correlation and regression, performed on them. The measurements might be made in a controlled setting, such as a laboratory, or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations. The measurements often require specialized scientific instruments such as thermometers, spectroscopes, or voltmeters, and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and development. 

Measurements demand the use of ''[[w:operational definition|operational definitions]]'' of relevant quantities. That is, a scientific quantity is described or defined by how it is measured, as opposed to some more vague, inexact or &quot;idealized&quot; definition. For example, [[w:electrical current|electrical current]], measured in amperes, may be operationally defined in terms of the mass of silver deposited in a certain time on an electrode in an electrochemical device that is described in some detail. The operational definition of a thing often relies on comparisons with standards: the operational definition of &quot;mass&quot; ultimately relies on the use of an artifact, such as a certain kilogram of platinum kept in a laboratory in France. 

The scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from their [[w:natural language|natural language]] usage. For example, [[w:mass|mass]] and [[w:weight|weight]] are often used interchangeably in common discourse, but have distinct meanings in physics. Scientific quantities are often characterized by their [[w:units of measure|units of measure]] which can later be described in terms of conventional [[w:physical unit|physical unit]]s when communicating the work. 

Measurements in scientific work are also usually accompanied by estimates of their [[w:uncertainty|uncertainty]]. The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity. Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities that are used. Counts of things, such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to limitations of the method used. Counts may only represent a sample of desired quantities, with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken.

===Hypothesis development===
A [[w:hypothesis|hypothesis]] includes a suggested explanation of the subject. It will generally provide a [[w:causality|causal]] explanation or propose some correlation.

Observations have the general form of [[w:existential quantification|existential statements]], stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic. Causal explanations have the general form of [[w:Universal quantification|universal statements]], stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic. It is not deductively [[w:validity|valid]] to infer a universal statement from any series of particular observations. This is the [[w:problem of induction|problem of induction]]. Many solutions to this problem have been suggested, including [[w:falsifiability|falsifiability]] and [[w:Bayesian inference|Bayesian inference]].

Scientists use whatever they can &amp;#8212; their own creativity, ideas from other fields, [[w:induction|induction]], [[w:Charles Peirce#Abductive reasoning (abduction)|systematic guessing]], etc. &amp;#8212; to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. There are no definitive guidelines for the production of new hypotheses. The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a &quot;flash of inspiration&quot;, or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. [[w:Michael Polanyi|Michael Polanyi]] made such creativity the centrepiece of his discussion of methodology.

===Prediction from the hypothesis===
A useful hypothesis will enable [[w:prediction|predictions]], by [[w:deductive reasoning|deductive reasoning]], that can be experimentally assessed. If results contradict the predictions, then the hypothesis under test is incorrect or incomplete and requires either revision or abandonment. If results confirm the predictions, then the hypothesis might be correct but is still subject to further testing.

[[Image:Gravitational lens-full.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[w:gravitational lensing|Einstein's prediction (1907): Light bends in a gravitational field]]]] 

Einstein's theory of [[w:General Relativity|General Relativity]] makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of [[w:space-time|space-time]], such as a prediction that [[w:light|light]] bends in a [[w:gravitational field|gravitational field]] and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field. [[w:Arthur Eddington|Arthur Eddington]]'s observations made during a [[w:1919|1919]] [[w:solar eclipse|solar eclipse]] supported General Relativity rather than Newtonian [[w:gravitation|gravitation]].

''Predictions'' refer to experiment designs with a ''currently unknown outcome''; the classic example was Edmund Halley's prediction of the year of return of [[w:Halley's comet|Halley's comet]] which returned after his death. A prediction (of an unknown) differs from a ''[[w:consequence|consequence]]'' ([[#The precession of Mercury|which can already be known]]). 

Once a prediction is made, an [[w:experiment|experiment]] is designed to test it. The experiment may seek either [[w:confirmation|confirmation]] or [[w:falsification|falsification]] of the hypothesis. Yet an experiment is not an absolute requirement. In observation based fields of science actual experiments must be designed differently than for the classical laboratory based sciences; for example, the observations of the [[w:Chaldea|Chaldea]]ns were utilized in the work of [[w:Al-Batani|Al-Batani]], when he determined a value for the precession of the Earth, in work that spanned thousands of years.

Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those conducting an experiment. Detailed recordkeeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and providing evidence of the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure. They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results. This tradition can be seen in the work of [[w:Hipparchus (astronomer)|Hipparchus (190 BCE - 120 BCE)]], when determining a value for the precession of the Earth over 2100 years ago, and 1000 years before Al-Batani.

The experiment's integrity should be ascertained by the introduction of a ''control''. Two virtually identical experiments are run, in only one of which the factor being tested is varied. This serves to further isolate any causal phenomena. For example in testing a [[w:drug|drug]] it is important to carefully test that the supposed effect of the drug is produced only by the drug. [[w:Doctor|Doctor]]s may do this with a [[w:double-blind|double-blind]] study: two virtually identical groups of [[w:patient]]s are compared, one of which receives the drug and one of which receives a [[w:placebo|placebo]]. Neither the patients nor the doctor know who is getting the real drug, isolating its effects.

Once an experiment is complete, a researcher determines whether the results (or data) gathered are what was predicted. If the experimental conclusions fail to match the predictions/hypothesis, then one returns to the failed hypothesis and re-iterates the process. If the experiment(s) appears &quot;successful&quot; - i.e. fits the hypothesis - then its details become published so that others (in theory) may ''reproduce'' the same experimental results.

===Evaluation and iteration===
===Testing and improvement===
The scientific process is iterative. At any stage it is possible that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject they are considering. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of the experiment to produce interesting results may lead the scientist to reconsidering the experimental method, the hypothesis or the definition of the subject.

===Verification===
Science is a social enterprise, and scientific work will become accepted by the community only if they can be verified. Crucially, experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the science community. Researchers have given their lives for this vision; [[w:Georg Wilhelm Richmann|Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] was killed by [[w:ball lightning|ball lightning]] to his forehead ([[w:1753|1753]]) when attempting to replicate the [[w:1752|1752]] [[w:kite|kite]] [[w:experiment|experiment]] of [[w:Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin]].

====Reevaluation====
''All'' scientific knowledge is in a state of flux, for at any time new evidence could be presented that contradicts a long-held hypothesis. A particularly luminous example is the theory of [[w:light|light]]. Light had long been supposed to be made of particles. [[w:Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton]], and before him many of the Classical Greeks, was convinced it was so, but his light-is-particles account was overturned by evidence in favor of a [[w:wave theory of light|wave theory of light]] suggested most notably in the early 1800s by [[w:Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], an English physician. Light as waves neatly explained the observed diffraction and interference of light when, to the contrary, the light-as-a-particle theory did not. The wave interpretation of light was widely held to be unassailably correct for most of the 19th century. Around the turn of the century, however, observations were made that a wave theory of light could not explain. This new set of observations could be accounted for by [[w:Max Planck|Max Planck]]'s quantum theory (including the [[w:photoelectric effect|photoelectric effect]] and [[w:Brownian motion|Brownian motion]]&amp;mdash;both from [[w:Albert Einstein]]), but not by a wave theory of light. Nor, for that matter, by the particle theory. [[w:Theory of Everything|More ...]]

===Peer review evaluation===
Scientific journals use a process of ''[[w:peer review|peer review]]'', in which scientists' manuscripts are submitted by editors of scientific journals to (usually one to three) fellow (usually anonymous) scientists familiar with the field for evaluation. The referees may or may not recommend publication, publication with suggested modifications, or, sometimes, publication in another journal. This serves to keep the scientific literature free of unscientific or crackpot work, helps to cut down on obvious errors, and generally otherwise improve the quality of the scientific literature. Work announced in the popular press before going through this process is generally frowned upon. Sometimes peer review inhibits the circulation of unorthodox work, and at other times may be too permissive. The peer review process is not always successful, but has been very widely adopted by the scientific community.

===Reproducibility===
The reproducibility or replication of scientific observations, while usually described as being very important in a scientific method, is actually seldom actually reported, and is in reality often not done. Referees and editors rightfully and generally reject papers purporting only to reproduce some observations as being unoriginal and not containing anything new. Occasionally reports of a failure to reproduce results are published--mostly in cases where controversy exists or a suspicion of fraud develops. The threat of failure to replicate by others, however, serves as a very effective deterrent for most scientists, who will usually replicate their own data several times before attempting to publish. 

===Evidence and assumptions===
Evidence comes in different forms and quality, mostly due to underlying assumptions. An underlying assumption that 'objects heavier than air fall to the ground when dropped' is not likely to incite much disagreement. An underlying assumption like 'aliens abduct humans' however is an extraordinary claim which requires solid proof. Many extraordinary claims also do not survive [[w:Occam's razor|Occam's razor]].

===Elegance of hypothesis===
In evaluating a hypothesis, scientists tend to look for theories that are &quot;[[w:elegant|elegant]]&quot; or &quot;[[w:beautiful|beautiful]]&quot;. In contrast to the usual English use of these terms, scientists have more specific meanings in mind. &quot;Elegance&quot; (or &quot;beauty&quot;) refers to the ability of a theory to neatly explain as many of the known facts as possible, as simply as possible, or at least in a manner consistent with [[w:Occam's Razor|Occam's Razor]] while at the same time being aesthetically pleasing.


Everyone has reason to learn what constitutes a scientific proof. Even if you never do scientific work, it will help you to evaluate other's work, and to protect yourself against quackery. Maybe even more importantly, it will enable you to think more clearly in general.

===Statistics===

Whenever you hear an advertisement saying a new soap or lotion is scientifically proven to have a positive effect in some sense, statisitics have been used (or they lied about the scientificness of the proof). The philosophical ideas behind statistical proofs are these:

# Formulate a hypothesis which can be falsified by experiments (measurement)
# Decide what level of certainty you want. 95% and 99% are common choices.
# Perform experiments that might falsify the hypothesis.

Suppose, for instance, that you want to see if there is any connection between drinking alcohol during pregnancy and the intelligence of the child. Then you might start with the following:

Hypothesis: A mother drinking alcohol during pregnancy ''does'' lower the intelligence of her child.

This gives rise to the following anti-hypothesis or null hypothesis:

Null hypothesis: A mother drinking alcohol during pregnancy does not lower the intelligence of her child.

Now we want to be 99% sure of our result. That means the risk of error is 1%. After doing a lot of measurements and putting the measurements through the machinery of statistics, we will be able to conclude either:

# with 1% risk of error we cannot reject the null hypothesis, or
# with 1% risk of error the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of the hypothesis.

If 2 is the case, we have 'proven' statistically that drinking alcohol during pregnancy lowers the intelligence of the child. Of course this example is stylized. What do we mean by drinking alcohol? What amount, and how regularly? How do we measure intelligence? Those must also be specified.

==The Axiomatic Method==

The axiomatic method is fundamental in every mathematical theory. A complete theory is built of axioms and implications.* Other names for &quot;axiom&quot; are &quot;premise&quot;, &quot;postulate&quot;, and &quot;assumption&quot;. An axiom is always assumed to be true, without discussion, for the sake of argument. Each time we say 'suppose', we describe an axiom. When a statement undoubtedly (logically) follows from another statement, we have an implication.

Suppose all human beings have blue eyes. Let that be an axiom. Now suppose that Melinda is a human being. (That's another axiom.) Then Melinda has blue eyes. Any other conclusion about Melinda's eye color would be wrong, because the axioms are defined as true (unless one could prove that the two axioms contradict one another, in which case one would have to be discarded, but that's another story).

People have different axioms. Have a look at this belief: &quot;If we don't throw a pancake in the dragons cave each morning, the sun will not rise&quot;. You might say that this isn't very logical. But it indeed is, with the right axioms.

Axioms:

# There is a dragon in the cave.
# The dragon dies if it doesn't eat pancakes.
# The dragon and only the dragon can make the sun rise.

Now, if nobody gives pancakes to the dragon, then the dragon will die (suppose also that the dragon cannot make his own pancakes). But if the dragon is dead, then nobody makes the sun rise! This conclusion is logically derived from the axioms. The point is that even hard core mysticists may use logic in their thinking; only their assumptions are strange.

Most people don't consciously think about what are axioms and what are implications when they argue with each other. Also, most people would rather die than change any of their axioms of life. People have the strangest axioms like &quot;Different configurations of the stars have different easily detectable effects on human beings&quot;. Maybe they have good reasons to have these axioms. However, having these axioms, they think they are thinking rationally, and they are! As long as the implications follow logically from their axioms, they are thinking rationally! At least, according to one definition of &quot;rational&quot;. Another definition might be &quot;a theory is rational if it has a good correlation with physical reality&quot;. But then many mathematical theories are not rational; for instance, most [[w:non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidian geometries]] (and ordinary [[w:Euclidean geometry|Euclidian geometry]] too, according to [[w:Minkowski-Einstein theory|Minkowski-Einstein theory]]!). And we want mathematical theories to be &quot;rational&quot;, so the latter was not a good definition.

An intelligent being should be aware of the fact that different people and different cultures have different axioms. It might be a good idea to practice believing in strange things. Be aware of your axioms! Don't believe in them, just regard them as axioms! Change axioms each time you change underwear, if you change your underwear reasonably often.

If you have never heard of [[w:Occam's Razor|Occam's Razor]], this is the perfect time to learn what it is. It's a principle which roughly says: If you have to choose between two equally good theories for explaining a phenomena, choose the one with the smallest number of axioms.

A short repetition:

# Try not to believe in the axioms you use in daily life, just regard them as axioms which could very well be changed. This will help you to understand other people.
# Superstitious people can very well be rational, and they often are. They just have some strange axioms.
# Try to assume as little as possible (that is, use Occam's razor). And be careful not to draw too-bold conclusions. If you pray to god, and immediately your prayers are answered, does this imply that the Koran or the Bible is true? Does this imply that what's preached in your local church is true? Or does it imply that the Hindus are right?

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; In mathematical theories, one introduces something called a [[w:formal system|formal system]], which is a little bit more rigorous (for instance the logical rules are not taken for granted). In daily life, however, the axiomatic method is good enough.

==Inductive Reasoning==
'''Induction''' or '''inductive reasoning''', sometimes called '''inductive logic''', is the process of [[w:reasoning|reasoning]] in which the conclusion of an argument is very likely to be true, but not certain, given the premises. It is to ascribe [[w:Category of being|properties or relations]] to [[w:type (metaphysics)|types]] based on limited observations of particular [[w:token]]s; or to formulate [[w:law|law]]s based on limited observations of recurring [[w:phenomena|phenomenal]] patterns. Induction is used, for example, in using specific propositions such as:
*The ice is cold.
*A billiard ball moves when struck with a cue.
to infer general propositions such as:
*All ice is cold.
*For every action, there is an equal and opposite re-action

===Validity===
Formal logic as most people learn it is deductive rather than inductive. Some philosophers claim to have created systems of inductive logic, but it is controversial whether a logic of induction is even possible. In contrast to [[w:deductive reasoning|deductive reasoning]], conclusions arrived at by inductive reasoning do not necessarily have the same degree of certainty as the initial assumptions. For example, a conclusion that all swans are white is obviously wrong, but may have been thought correct in Europe until the settlement of Australia. Inductive arguments are never [[w:validity|binding]] but they may be [[w:cogency|cogent]]. Inductive reasoning is deductively invalid. (An argument in formal logic is valid if and only if it is not possible for the premises of the argument to be true whilst the conclusion is false.)  

The classic philosophical treatment of the [[w:problem of induction|problem of induction]], meaning the search for a justification for inductive reasoning, was by the Scotsman [[w:David Hume|David Hume]].  Hume highlighted the fact that our everyday reasoning depends on patterns of repeated experience rather than deductively valid arguments. For example we believe that bread will nourish us because it has in the past, but it is at least conceivable that bread in the future will poison us.

Someone who insisted on sound deductive justifications for everything would starve to death, said Hume. Instead of unproductive [[w:Philosophical_skepticism|radical skepticism]] about everything, he advocated a [[w:Scientific_skepticism|practical skepticism]] based on common-sense, where the inevitability of induction is accepted.

20th Century developments have framed the problem of induction very differently. Rather than a choice about what predictions to make about the future, it can be seen as a choice of what concepts to fit to observation (see the entry for [[w:Grue (color)|grue]]) or of what graphs to fit to a set of observed data points.

Induction is sometimes framed as reasoning about the future from the past, but in its broadest sense it involves reaching conclusions about unobserved things on the basis of what is observed. Inferences about the past from present evidence (e.g. [[w:archaeology|archaeology]]) count as induction. Induction could also be across space rather than time, e.g. conclusions about the whole universe from what we observe in our galaxy or national economic policy based on past economic preformance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The legislature of the Commonwealth is the Commonwealth Parliament or Parliament of Australia. The Parliament of Australia is a bicameral parliament consisting of the House of Representatives (the &quot;lower house&quot;) and the Senate (the &quot;upper house&quot; or &quot;house of review&quot;). Section 1 of the Constitution of Australia provides that: &quot;The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is herein-after called 'The Parliament,' or 'The Parliament of the Commonwealth'.&quot;

Queen Elizabeth II is, in her capacity as Queen of Australia, Australia's head of state, but her constitutional functions in Australia are delegated to the Governor-General of Australia.

The House of Representatives consists of 150 members elected from single-member constituencies of approximately equal population. The Senate consists of 76 members: 12 Senators are elected from each of the six states and two from each of the two territories.

The principal function of the Parliament is to pass laws, or legislation. Any Member or Senator may introduce a proposed law (a bill), except for a money bill (a bill proposing an expenditure or levying a tax), which must be introduced in the House of Representatives. In practice, the great majority of bills are introduced by ministers. Bills introduced by other Members are called private members' bills. All bills must be passed by both Houses to become law. The Senate has the same legislative powers as the House, except that it may not amend money bills, only pass or reject them.

The Parliament performs other functions besides legislation. It can discuss urgency motions or matters of public importance: these provide a forum for debates on public policy matters. Members can move motions of censure against the government or against individual ministers. On most sitting days in both Houses there is a session called Question Time at which Members and Senators address questions to the Prime Minister and other ministers. Members and Senators can also present petitions from their constituents. Both Houses have an extensive system of committees in which draft bills are debated, evidence is taken and public servants are questioned.

Members of the Australian Parliament do not have legal immunity: they can be arrested and tried for any offence. They do, however, have Parliamentary privilege: they cannot be sued for anything they say about each other or about persons outside the Parliament. This privilege extends to reporting in the media of anything a Member or Senator says.

There is a legal offence called contempt of Parliament. A person who speaks or acts in a manner contemptuous of the Parliament or its members can be tried and, if convicted, imprisoned. The Parliament used to have the power of hearing such cases itself, and did so in the Browne-Fitzpatrick case of 1955. This power has now been delegated to the courts, but no-one has been prosecuted for this offence.

== The House of Representatives ==
The 150 members of the house are elected from single-member geographic districts (popularly known as &quot;seats&quot; but officially known as &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Divisions&quot;) which are intended to represent reasonably contiguous regions, with relatively equal population in each of about 80 000 people. Voting is by the preferential system.

According to Australia's Constitution, the powers of both houses are nearly equal with the consent of both houses needed to pass legislation. In practice, however, the Lower House is far stronger in some ways, and far weaker in others.

By convention, the party or coalition in the lower house with a majority is invited by the Governor-General to form government, and thus the leader of the party in the lower house becomes the Prime Minister of Australia and his senior colleagues ministers responsible for various government departments. Bills appropriating money can also only be introduced or modified in the lower house. Thus, only parties in the lower house can govern. However, in the rigid Australian party system, this ensures that virtually all contentious votes are along party lines, and the government always has a majority in those votes. The Opposition's only real role in the House is to present arguments why the government's policies and legislation are wrong, and attempt to embarrass the government as much as possible by asking difficult questions at question time. 

In a reflection of the color scheme of the United Kingdom House of Commons, the House of Representatives is decorated in green.

== The Senate ==
The voting system for the Senate has changed twice since it was created. The original arrangement was a first past the post block voting mechanism. In 1919, it was changed to preferential block voting. Block voting tended to grant landslide majorities very easily. In 1946, the Australian Labor Party government won 30 out of the 33 Senate seats. In 1948, partially in response to this extreme situation, they introduced proportional representation in the Senate.

From a comparative governmental perspective, the Australian Senate is almost unique in that unlike the upper house in other Westminster system governments, the Senate is not a vestigial body with limited legislative power but rather plays and is intended to play an active role in legislation. Rather than being modelled after the House of Lords the Australian Senate was in part modelled after the United States Senate and was intended to give small rural states added voice in a Federal legislature, while also fulfilling the revising role of an upper house in the Westminster system.

Although the Prime Minister is answerable to, and selected from the House of Representatives (the &quot;lower house&quot;), other ministers are drawn from either house and the two houses have almost equal legislative power. As with most upper chambers in bicameral parliaments, it cannot introduce Appropriation Bills or impose taxation, that role being reserved for the universally elected lower chamber. That degree of equality between the Australian Senate and House of Representatives is in part due to the age of the Australian constitution; it was enacted before the confrontation in 1909 between the British House of Commons and House of Lords, over estate taxes, which ultimately resulted in the restrictions in the powers of the House of Lords in the Parliament Act. The Senate thus reflected the pre-1911 Lords-Commons relationship, namely a house with theoretically wide powers that are by convention not widely used, but which in a crisis could be.

However in one area it possesses a highly sensitive power, namely the right to withdraw or block Supply, i.e. government control of exchequer funding. In most democracies, this power does not exist within upper houses. In the Australian case, probably due to its age and its pre-dating of the British Parliament Act, 1911, that power, once possessed by the House of Lords, is still possessed by the Australian Senate. What it means is that in strict constitutional terms, the Government is also answerable to the Australian Senate, given that the loss of Supply in parliamentary democracies automatically requires the resignation of a government or ministry, or alternatively the calling of a general election, because without access to exchequer funding a government cannot function and would face bankruptcy. However, as in the United Kingdom prior to the 1909 clash over David Lloyd George's budget between the House of Commons and House of Lords, a general convention built up in which the upper house would not use its power to block exchequer funding, leaving that responsibility to the democratically representative lower house. Indeed to break convention in this area is sometimes described as a parliamentary nuclear option because of its political, financial and governmental impact. In 1975, in a dispute strikingly similar to Britain's 1909 clash (an upper House breaking convention by withdrawing Supply on the basis that it was reacting to a breach of another fundamental convention by the government - which the government denied) the Senate did refuse to pass a required financial measure, producing a 'nuclear'-style crisis which resulted in a stand off, a decision of the Prime Minister not to resign or seek a dissolution, and the eventual intervention of the Governor-General to withdraw the commission of the Australian Prime Minister (in effect dismissing him) and the appointment of a minority government from the opposition in the House of Representatives and the calling of a general election.

In practice, however, most legislation (except for &quot;Private Member's Bills&quot;) in the Australian Parliament is initiated by the Government, which has control over the lower house. It is then passed to the Senate, which may amend the bill or refuse to pass it. In the majority of cases, voting is along party lines.

The Australian Constitution is actually the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, which was passed through the United Kingdom Parliament. It provided the new system of government for the new federation, which consisted at its inception on 1 January 1901 of the former separate colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia.

==Head of State==

The Act vested authority in the Queen, making her the Australian head of state similar to other Commonwealth Realms. In 1973, the monarch was formally designated as 'Queen of Australia'. A representative of the Queen was provided for, known as the Governor-General, who in practice fulfils most of the roles normally possessed by a head of state. Some consider the Governor-General of Australia to be the de facto head of state as the British monarch rarely exercises the reserve powers that the constitution grants to the Crown; however the constitution makes clear that the Governor-General is in no sense a head of state, merely a head of state's representative who in the name of the head of state, or in his own name as representative of the head of state, carries out specified functions and exercises certain powers.

==Parliament==

Section 1 (of Chapter I) provided that the legislative power was to be vested in Federal parliament, known as the 'Parliament of the Commonwealth', consisting of the Queen, an upper house, called the Senate, and a lower house, called the 'House of Representatives.

==Executive Authority==

According to Section 61 (of Chapter II):

''&quot;the executive power of the Commonweath is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and the laws of the Commonweath.&quot;''

Article 62 provided for a Federal Executive Council to 'advise' the Governor-General in the governance of the Commonwealth. Though the language indicated that the Executive Council was answerable to the Governor-General, in reality it is answerable to the House of Representatives, though the fact that the Senate possesses the power to withdraw Supply complicates the situation, given that loss of Supply in parliamentary democracies has the most severe implications for a government, given that it in theory should either resign or seek a parliamentary dissolution, should Supply be lost or not granted. ''See:[[Australian Government/The Commonmwealth Executive|The Commonwealth Executive]]''.

==The Judiciary==

The judicial power of the Commonwealth was vested by Section 71 of Chapter III in a federal supreme court to be called the High Court of Australia. It was to be presided over by a Chief Justice. ''See:[[Australian Government/The Judiciary|The Judiciary]]''

==The States==

Section 106 of Chapter V provided for the continuation of the constitutions of the various states, subject to the provisions of the federal constitution.

==Amendments to the Constitution==

Section 128 of Chapter VIII provided that constitutional amendments required

* ''&quot;an absolute majority in both houses of the federal parliament&quot;''

        and 

* ''&quot;the approval in a plebiscite of the proposed amendment by a majority of electors nationwide, and a majority in a majority of the states.&quot;''

Runes are characters in the ancient alphabet used by Anglo-Saxon peoples. Runic inscriptions have been found all over western Europe, on stone monuments and on such objects as metal spearpoints and amulets; the greatest concentrations are in England and Scandinavia. The runic alphabet, called futhark after the sounds of the initial letters, originally had 25 characters.

In English versions the number was eventually increased to 33, whereas in Scandinavia it was reduced to 16 and later expanded to 26. It is believed that runes are derived from a northern Etruscan alphabet used among Italic tribes in the eastern Alps, and that they were developed in the 2nd or 3rd century AD by a Germanic people living in the region of modern Bohemia. The earliest surviving inscription is from the mid-3rd century.

http://www.selfpower.com/runes/images/runes2.gif

Runes were in wide use from the 4th to the 12th century. A form of runes was used in Scandinavia throughout the Middle Ages as an alternative to the Latin alphabet used by the clergy, and runes survived in occasional use in rural Sweden at least until the 17th century. Runes were also used to augment the Latin alphabet for certain sounds, notably the thorn (þ, th) used in Anglo-Saxon England and modern Iceland.

Ancient alphabet enters cyber age 

The alphabet used in Ethiopia and Eritrea is Africa's oldest. Laeke Mariam Demessie reports on the efforts to get the 276-letter script to work on computers. 

Ethiopic script has been in use since 100 BC. It is the only indigenous African alphabet still in use today. 

But it was only in 1991 that the Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission (ESTC) first displayed the Ethiopic alphabet on a computer. 

The greatest breakthrough was to come up with the idea
 Programmer Mesfin Belay  

The reaction of one European was: &quot;It is impossible - how did you do it?&quot; recalls Dr Nega Alemayehu, a lecturer in information technology at Addis Ababa University. 

But as Ethiopian computer programmer Mesfin Belay points out: &quot;The greatest breakthrough was not in developing an Ethiopic alphabet programme or software, it was rather to come up with the idea. 

&quot;Just as you have software in Japanese, Korean or Arabic, there was no reason why one cannot develop Ethiopic script.&quot; 

Quicker than handwriting 

Daniel Admasse, an Ethiopian who studied in Sweden, claims to have been the first person to come up with the idea of computerising &quot;fidel&quot;, as Ethiopians call their alphabet. 

  Three challenges  
 Designing the fonts 
 Keyboard layout 
 Printing 

While studying in Sweden he helped produce materials for an Ethiopian studies conference. Some of the conference texts were in Ge'ez, the ancient language which is the ancestor of modern Ethiopian languages. 
But he found that in Sweden he had no means of printing Ethiopic script. 

&quot;So the burden of writing by hand in Ge'ez letters and reducing them using a camera fall on me,&quot; Mr Daniel recalls. 

&quot;My handwriting was bad. Because of that incident I said to myself why shouldn't I develop an Amharic computer programme?&quot;. 

&quot;I started working on it in 1982 and developed an Ethiopic WordPerfect version 2.01 in one year&quot;. 

Programmes develop 

By 1991, one could take computer courses in Amharic even if one didn't know English
 
Programmer Daniel Admasse  
Mr Daniel returned to Ethiopia in 1987, and set up a team of computer programmers at the ESTC. There they developed Ethiopic software ranging from a disc operating system to a desktop publishing programme. 
&quot;So we had a complete set of Ethiopic computer programmes in Fidel and the Amharic language by 1991, which meant one could take computer courses in Amharic even if one didn't know English.&quot; 

Mr Daniel has since developed an Ethiopic version of WordPerfect 6.0. 

He says the first challenge was to design the fidel characters. This was done using a computer programme known as font manager. 

Lots of letters 

The second challenge was to put the 276 characters onto the English language keyboard designed to accommodate only 26 letters. 

Each character in the Ethiopic alphabet represents a syllable: a combination of consonant plus vowel. There are 33 consonants and seven vowels. 

So 33 of the keys are assigned to the different consonant sounds, which are used in combination with keys such as &quot;control&quot; and &quot;alt&quot; to create the vowel-consonant combinations. 

&quot;The English keyboard was made to recognise only 26 characters, but to make it recognise 276 Ethiopic characters the computer programmers have to override the rules in the computer,&quot; Mr Daniel explains. 

&quot;This was made possible by using the keyboard handler program.&quot; 

Ethiopic characters also have to be attuned to American Standard Coding for Information Interchange (ASCII) which assigns letters to the numerical codes which the computer works with. 

The third challenge was printing. The printing of Amharic characters was complicated in the earlier generations of printers, Mr Daniel says, but has become simpler with more recent laserjet printers. 

Standardisation headaches 

Therefore any Ethiopic alphabet software is a package which deals with the designing of characters, keyboard layout and printer set-up. 

However efficient and fast a keyboard layout is, it is useless unless accepted as a standard
 
IT lecturer Dr Nega Alemayehu  
Some Ethiopian computer engineers in Canada have also been developing Ethiopic software independently, out of a sense of patriotism, Dr Nega says. 
But the enthusiastic rush to develop software led to a new problem: lack of standardisation. Today there are at least 35 Ethiopic software products available, each with its own character set, encoding system, typeface names, and keyboard layout. 

&quot;However efficient and fast a keyboard layout is, it is useless unless accepted as a standard by users,&quot; Dr Nega argues. 

The lack of standardisation also makes it difficult to transfer documents from one computer to another - including e-mail. 

The problems of Ethiopic computing have resulted in the creation of the Ethiopian Computer Standard Association (ECOSA), of which Dr Nega is president, and the North American-based Committee for Ethiopian Computing (CEC). 

The two groups are working on standardisation of the Ethiopic script on the computer. 

&quot;We have come together to face the challenge,&quot; says Dr Nega, who is optimistic about finding a solution. 

&quot;The sooner we standardise Ethiopic script computing, the faster we hop on the global information superhighway.&quot;

ARE THE ANCIENT ALPHABET SYMBOLS SCHEMATICS? 
PLANETARY GRID 

The Morphogenetic Grid - The Builder of Planetary Destiny 

The subject of who influences the Morphogenetic Grid is known as the science of Morphic Energy which has been the province and heritage of the  &quot;Ancient Wisdom and Mystery Schools&quot;. Protected and encrypted in the symbolism of Sacred Geometry, this knowledge has been reserved for the &quot;Awakened&quot; or &quot;Initiated&quot;. 

As these schools have always been dedicated to the study of consciousness and the nature of reality, it is their duty to make known the unknown and to pioneer and communicate other states of reality. Integrating the knowledge thus learned and turning it into an evolutionary educational program is an equally important part of their functions. 

All of this would be fine except for one fact. Throughout history, the mystery schools have deviated into polarized groups at odds with each other in order to control the process of evolution. This has given rise to many different belief systems and religious constructs responsible for the guidance of moral conduct. The resulting conflict has generated war and indifference. 

In such a context, belief systems are created with powerful events such as visions of the Virgin Mary, the resurrection and ascension of Christ, or visions of prophecy. Without even analyzing the exact nature of these miraculous occurrences, it is obvious that an incredible amount of dogma has been generated concerning them. What these miracles or prophecies imply for the future are substantiated only by faith with explicit doctrines designed to maintain them in our civilizations. People are not encouraged to discover and learn the truth but only to believe. &quot;Good Deed Doers&quot;, swept away by their own convictions of faith, solicit others and whole generations are born into illusions of reality with fear and control buttons efficiently installed. Finally, prophecies are created to herd the many into subscribing to a particular creation of reality whatever it may be. 

As there are many different mystery schools and religions, the numbers of people subscribing to each belief system or particular prophecy will have much to do with engineering the final outcome in the future. This is largely influenced by the power of thought feeding the grid. In such a manner, the greatest numbers that have invested into a prophecy will often prevail. 

Based upon the above information, it should be clear that we are  entirely capable of feeding the grid and determining the course of our own destiny. Therefore, evolution is in our own hands and our task becomes to take back that which we have lost. How do we do that. First, by opening what doors are available to us.

In Australia, this alphabet is known as The Panaramitee Tradition

In Australia, this alphabet has been found on many locations and adheres to the grammar and structure of the other known petroglyphs on the other two continents. Ironically, instead of considering the similarity to other archaeological sites around the globe as evidence of a global culture, the scientific community in Australia has denied the possibility that this is any type of &quot;system&quot; at all, either writing or storyboard. 

The concept that these odd shapes somehow formed a system of communication was first put forth by Lesley Maynard. Maynard received overwhelming resistance to his assertion and he finally discontinued his efforts. By the late 1980s, there was virtually no interest in these petroglyphs. In 1995, Bednarik reported the results of his experiment to see how readily the Panaramitee Tradition could be recognized. He sent drawings and pictures of several examples of petroglyphs to various rock art scholars around the globe. Ninety-eight (98%) percent wrongly identified petroglyphs from the United States, Africa and Europe as being Panaramitee Tradition. Bednarik summarized as follows, 

&quot;It is either not possible to identify the Panaramitee style, or... this is a world-wide style.&quot;

The map above shows the myriad locations of this style. It has been noted that this style is also accompanied by petroglyphs and pictographs of strange humanoid beings with large eyes. There are also reportedly collections of carved handprints, similar to those recorded in the canyons of Monument Valley and in Southeast Colorado. Dr. Harris has not reported these types of phenomenon in the Sinai.

Ancient Egyptians and the Futhark Alphabet 

The Futhark Alphabet, which is essentially a set of glyphs representing sounds and ideas, is derived from the Hieroglyphs of the remote Ancient Egyptians. The term &quot;Hieroglyph&quot; was coined by the Ancient Greeks to describe the &quot;Sacred Writings&quot; of the Ancient Egyptians. Hieroglyphs of Ancient Egypt, which represented sounds and ideas, were considered &quot;Sacred&quot; not only in the religious sense, but also because they conveyed a &quot;Secret Meaning&quot;.

Similarly the glyphs of the earliest Teutonic Futhark Alphabet, conveyed a &quot;Secret Meaning&quot;. This is revealed in the term used to describe them ... &quot;Runes&quot;.

The word &quot;Rune&quot; is derived from &quot;Run&quot; (pronounced roon), an Anglo-Saxon word meaning &quot;Secret&quot; or &quot;Mystery&quot;. 

Also, perhaps not surprisingly, the Latin word &quot;Runa&quot; translates as &quot;Dart&quot;, which is descriptive of the Rune writing style, adapted from the Greek, to suit carving.

The Runes are referred to as the Futhark Alphabet because f-u-th-a-r-k are considered to be the first six glyphs of that alphabet. Interestingly however, these first six glyphs are also translated as f-ur-th-o-r-c.

Ogham- the Celtic oracular alphabet 
 
Related Resources 
• Runes 
• Druidry
• Celtic symbols 
• Druid symbols  From Other Guides 
•  Viking Runes and runestones 
•  Runes and Rune Magic 

The Celtic Ogham alphabet dates from the fourth century. The alphabet is named for Ogmos, the Celtic god of knowledge. Ogmos was associated with the Gaulish Ogmios and occasionally the Greek hermes.

The alphabet consists of twenty letters, each named for a different tree believed sacred to the Druids. Each letter is made up of one to five straight or angled lines incised on a straight base line. Because the number of letters, and the number of lines that make up each letter, some scholars have theorized that the ogham may have originated as a system of hand signs. Examples of Ogham writing have been found all over the British Isles, and even as far away as Spain and Portugal. All surviving examples exist as stone carvings, usually on tombstones and road markers.

Although it is commonly used by modern Druids and other NeoPagans as a divination system, there is no real relationship between modern and historical divination systems. When used as a divination method, the letters are usually notched into straight twigs and used much like runes. In this case, I've provided a print version (MS Word) you can print and cut into small cards if you wish to try a simpler way of divining with ogham: A B</text>

==/etc/==

&lt;!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order --&gt;

===/etc/fstab===

The '''fstab''' (for ''[[file system]]s table'') file is commonly found on [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems and is part of the system [[computer configuration|configuration]].  The fstab file typically lists all used disks and disk [[partition (computing)|partition]]s, and indicates how they are to be used or otherwise integrated into the overall system's file system.  

Traditionally, the fstab was only read by programs, and not written to. However, more modern system administration tools can automatically build and edit fstab, or act as graphical editors for it. It is the duty of the [[system administrator]] to properly create and maintain this file.

The file may have other names on a given Unix variant; for example, it is &lt;code&gt;/etc/vfstab&lt;/code&gt; on [[Solaris Operating Environment|Solaris]].

'''Example'''

The following is an example of a fstab file on a [[Red Hat Linux|Red Hat]] [[Linux]] system:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# device name		mount point		fs-type	options		dump-freq pass-num
LABEL=/                 /                       ext3    defaults        1 1
none                    /dev/pts                devpts  gid=5,mode=620  0 0
none                    /proc                   proc    defaults        0 0
none                    /dev/shm                tmpfs   defaults        0 0

# my removable media
/dev/cdrom              /mnt/cdrom              udf,iso9660 noauto,owner,kudzu,ro 0 0
/dev/fd0                /mnt/floppy             auto    noauto,owner,kudzu 0 0

# my NTFS Windows XP partition
/dev/hda1               /mnt/WinXP              ntfs    ro,defaults     0 0

/dev/hda6               swap                    swap    defaults        0 0

# my files partition shared by windows and linux
/dev/hda7               /mnt/shared             vfat    umask=000       0 0
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

( kudzu is an option specific to [[Red Hat Linux|Red Hat]] and [[Fedora Core]] )

The first column indicates the device name or other means of locating the partition or data source.  The second column indicates where the data is to be attached to the filesystem.  The third column indicates the filesystem type, or algorithm to use to interpret the filesystem.  The fourth column gives options, including if the filesystem should be [[mount]]ed at boot.  The fifth column adjusts the archiving schedule for the partition (used by dump).  The sixth column indicates the order in which the [[fsck]] utility will scan the partitions for errors when the computer powers on. A value of zero in either of the last 2 columns disables the corresponding feature (http://www.humbug.org.au/talks/fstab/fstab_structure.html).

To get more information about the fstab file you can read the [[Unix manual|man page]] about it.

The [[Kfstab]] graphical configuration utility is available for [[Using KDE|KDE]] for editing fstab.

===/etc/group===

'''/etc/group''' stores the definitive list of the users groups and their members.

A typical entry is:

 root::0:root,alice

It has four sections which going from left to right are,

*''(root)'' The group name.
*''()'' The group password in a hashed form. Normally not.  When it is, it allows ''any'' user knowing the password access to the group, as such it ''lessens'' security.  Group-passwords may be shadowed and stored in a separate file.
*''(0)'' The unique id assigned to the group. Group ids below 10 are reserved for system use. Some unixs such as HP-UX reserve other groups numbers as well.
*''(root,alice)'' The list of users who are members of that group.

===/etc/passwd===

'''/etc/passwd''' is the user authentication database, it contains a list of users and their associated internal user id numbers. Historically it also included passwords, however as this file needs to world readable (so all programs can use it to convert between username and user id) it is no longer considered secure to keep passwords in this file.

An entry in this file is of the form:

 alice:*:134:20:Alice Monkey:/home/alice/:/bin/bash

It has seven sections which going from left to right are,

*''(alice)'' The username.
*''(*)'' The password in a hashed form. In modern systems a star indicates shadowing is in use and hence the password can be found in /etc/shadow/.
*''(134)'' The unique id assigned to the user. Some unique ids have special purposes. For example the user id 0 is used for the root user.
*''(20)'' The group that the user is assigned to upon login.
*''(Alice Monkey)'' The GCOS field, can be used for anything or left blank. Normally used for personal information abou the user such as full name.
*''(/home/alice/)'' The home directory of the user.
*''(/bin/bash)'' The users default shell.

===/etc/profile===

'''/etc/profile''' contains the system default settings for users who login using the Bourne shell, &quot;/bin/sh&quot;. When these users login, the Bourne shell runs the commands in this file before giving the shell prompt to the user. Most of these commands are variable assignments which configure the behavior of the shell.

Some Bourne-compatible shells also use this file, but other shells, such as the C shell, do not.


===/etc/shadow===

'''/etc/shadow''' contains the passwords for users in systems which use shadowing.

 alice:43SrweDe3F:621:5:30:10:100:900:

The sections are:

*''(alice)'' The username.
*''(43SrweDe3F)'' The password in hashed form.
*''(621)'' date of last password change.
*''(5)'' the mimimum number of days before the password may be changed.
*''(30)'' the maximum number of days before the user is forced to change their password.
*''(10)'' the number of days after which a user is advised to change their password.
*''(100)'' the maximum number of days an account can be inactive for before it is suspeneded.
*''(900)'' the date the account will expire, if left blank the account will remain indefinitely. Most often used for the purpose of temporary accounts.

===/etc/sysctl.conf===

'''/etc/sysctl.conf''' configures the behavior of the running Unix kernel. During system boot, the scripts read this file and use &quot;sysctl&quot; to set the parameters shown in the file. Changing the file has no effect before the next reboot.

===Files to be merged in to the list===
* /etc/aliases - file containing aliases used by sendmail and other MTAs (mail transport agents). After updating this file, it is necessary to run the newaliases utility for the changes to be passed to sendmail.
* /etc/bashrc - system-wide default functions and aliases for the bash shell
* /etc/conf.modules - aliases and options for configurable modules
* /etc/crontab - shell script to run different commands periodically (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
* /etc/DIR_COLORS - used to store colors for different file types when using ls command. The dircolors command uses this file when there is not a .dir_colors file in the user's home directory. Used in conjunction with the eval command (see below).
* /etc/exports - specifies hosts to which file systems can be exported using NFS. Man exports contains information on how to set up this file for remote users.
* /etc/fstab - contains information on partitions and filesystems used by system to mount different partitions and devices on the directory tree
* /etc/HOSTNAME - stores the name of the host computer
* /etc/hosts - contains a list of host names and absolute IP addresses.
* /etc/hosts.allow - hosts allowed (by the tcpd daemon) to access Internet services
* /etc/hosts.deny - hosts forbidden (by the tcpd daemon) to access Internet services
* /etc/group - similar to /etc/passwd but for groups
* /etc/inetd.conf - configures the inetd daemon to tell it what TCP/IP services to provide (which daemons to load at boot time). A good start to securing a Linux box is to turn off these services unless they are necessary.
* /etc/inittab - runs different programs and processes on startup. This is typically the program which is responsible for, among other things, setting the default runlevel, running the rc.sysinit script contained in /etc/rc.d, setting up virtual login terminals, bringing down the system in an orderly fashion in response to &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl][Alt][Del]&lt;/tt&gt;, running the rc script in /etc/rc.d, and running xdm for a graphical login prompt (only if the default runlevel is set for a graphical login).
* /etc/issue - pre-login message. This is often overwitten by the /etc/rc.d/rc.S script (in Slackware) or by the /etc/rc.d/rc.local script (in Mandrake and Red Hat, and perhaps other rpm-based distributions). The relevant lines should be commented out (or changed) in these scripts if a custom pre-login message is desired.
* /etc/lilo.conf - configuration file for lilo boot loader
* /etc/motd - message of the day file, printed immediately after login. This is often overwritten by /etc/rc.d/rc.S (Slackware) or /etc/rc.d/rc.local (Mandrake/Red Hat) on startup. See the remarks in connection with /etc/issue.
* /etc/mtab - shows currently mounted devices and partitions and their status
* /etc/passwd - contains passwords and other information concerning users who are registered to use the system. For obvious security reasons, this is readable only by root. It can be modified by root directly, but it is preferable to use a configuration utility such as passwd to make the changes. A corrupt /etc/passwd file can easily render a Linux box unusable.
* /etc/printcap - shows the setup of printers
* /etc/profile - sets system-wide defaults for bash shell. It is this file in Slackware that sets up the DIR_COLORS environment variable for the color ls command. Also sets up other system-wide environment variables.
* /etc/resolv.conf - contains a list of domain name servers used by the local machine
* /etc/securetty - contains a list of terminals on which root can login. For security reasons, this should not include dialup terminals.
* /etc/termcap - ASCII database defining the capabilities and characteristics of different consoles, terminals, and printers
* /etc/X11/XF86Config - X configuration file. The location in Slackware is /etc/XF86Config.

== /proc/ ==
* /proc/cpuinfo - cpu information
* /proc/filesystems - prints filesystems currently in use
* /proc/interrupts - prints interrupts currently in use
* /proc/ioports - contains a list of the i/o addresses used by various devices connected to the computer
* /proc/kcore - The command ls -l /proc/kcore will give the amount of RAM on the computer. It's also possible to use the free command to get the same information (and more).
* /proc/version - prints Linux version and other info

== /var/ ==
* /var/log/messages - used by syslog daemon to store kernel boot-time messages
* /var/log/lastlog - used by system to store information about last boot (can be read with '''lastlog''')
* /var/log/wtmp - contains binary data indicating login times and duration for each user on system (can be read with '''last''')
* /var/log/btmp - contains binary data indicating ''failed'' attempts to login (can be read with '''lastb''')
* /var/run/utmp - contains binary data indicating ''currently logged-in'' users (can be read with '''who''')

== /boot/ ==
* /boot/vmlinuz - the typical location and name of the Linux kernel. In the Slackware distribution, the kernel is located at /vmlinuz.
* /boot/grub/menu.lst - has configuration settings for users of the GRUB bootloader for the available kernels and OS's which can continue the boot process.

== /dev/ ==
&lt;!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order --&gt;
=== /dev/cdrom ===
'''/dev/cdrom''' is not an actual device, but on many systems it is a symbolic link to the actual CD device. For example, a Linux system with &lt;tt&gt;/dev/hdb&lt;/tt&gt; for its floppy drive is likely to have a link &lt;tt&gt;/dev/cdrom&lt;/tt&gt; which redirects to &lt;tt&gt;/dev/hdb&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== /dev/fd* ===
At Linux, &lt;tt&gt;/dev/fd0&lt;/tt&gt; is the first floppy disk drive at the system. Use &lt;tt&gt;/dev/fd0H1440 &lt;/tt&gt; to operate the first floppy drive in high density mode. Generally, this is invoked when formatting a floppy drive for a particular density. Slackware comes with drivers that allow for formatting a 3.5&quot; diskette with up to 1.7MB of space. Red Hat and Mandrake do not contain these device driver files by default.

Likewise, &lt;tt&gt;/dev/fd1&lt;/tt&gt; is the second floppy disk drive.

=== /dev/hd* ===
At Linux, &lt;tt&gt;/dev/hda&lt;/tt&gt; is the first IDE hard drive. The second drive is either &lt;tt&gt;/dev/hdb&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;/dev/hdc&lt;/tt&gt;, depending on the hardware configuration. Some IDE hardware allows up to four drives, including &lt;tt&gt;/dev/hdd&lt;/tt&gt;.

Many machines have one hard drive (hda) and one cdrom drive (hdc on many machines, but hdb on some). Often, &lt;tt&gt;/dev/cdrom&lt;/tt&gt; is a symbolic link to the cdrom drive.

Partitions are numbered from 1, like &lt;tt&gt;/dev/hda1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/dev/hda2&lt;/tt&gt;, ...

=== /dev/null ===

'''/dev/null''' is a do-nothing device to use when one wants to ignore or delete program output. This file is useful when a program expects to save to a file, but you want not to save anything. This file can also be used as input to a program to represent an empty file.

There is no actual hardware associated with the &lt;tt&gt;/dev/null&lt;/tt&gt; device.

''Examples:''

Deleting file called &quot;x&quot; (command '''rm x''') sometimes causes an error, for example if the file does not exist:

 $ '''rm x'''
 rm: x: No such file or directory

One can hide the error by redirecting it to a file. By using &lt;tt&gt;/dev/null&lt;/tt&gt; as the file, the error never saves to an actual file.

 ''Bourne shell:''
 $ '''rm x &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

In the Bourne shell, the &quot;2&gt;&amp;1&quot; redirects the standard error of &quot;rm&quot; (where the error appears) to standard output, then the &quot;&gt;&quot; redirects the standard output to &lt;tt&gt;/dev/null&lt;/tt&gt;.

One way to make an empty file called &quot;y&quot; is:
 $ '''cat /dev/null &gt; y'''

The &quot;cat&quot; command copies the file &quot;/dev/null&quot; to standard output, and the shell operator &quot;&gt;&quot; redirects this output to &quot;y&quot;. The &quot;/dev/null&quot; file seems empty when read, so the file &quot;y&quot; appears, but is also empty.  (Note that in this case, simply &quot;&gt; y&quot; will do the same thing.)

== Dot files ==

There is some redundancy across these programs. For example, the look and behavior of emacs can be customized by usinng the .emacs file, but also by adding the appropriate modifications to the .Xdefaults file. Default versions of these files are often installed in users' home directories when the software packages that use them are installed. If a program doesn't find its configuration file in the user's home directory, it will often fall back on a system-wide default configuration file installed in one of the subdirectories that the package lives in.

* .bash_logout - file executed by bash shell on logout
* .bash_profile - initialization of bash shell run only on login. Bash looks first for a .bash_profile file when started as a login shell or with the -login option. If it does not find .bash_profile, it looks for .bash_login. If it doesn't find that, it looks for .profile. System-wide functions and aliases go in /etc/bashrc and default environment variables go in /etc/profile.
* .bashrc - initialization command run when bash shell starts up as a non-login shell
* .cshrc - initialization commands that are run automatically (like autoexec.bat) when C shell is initiated
* .emacs - configuration file for emacs editor
* .fvwmrc - configuration file for fvwm window manager
* .fvwm2rc - configuration file for fvwm2 window manager
* .jedrc - configuration file for the jed text editor
* .lessrc - typically contains key bindings for cursor movement with the less command
* .login - initialization file when user logs in
* .logout - commands run when user logs out
* .wm_style - gives choice of default window manager if one is not specified in startx
* .Xdefaults - sets up X resources for individual user. The behavior of many different application programs can be changed by modifying this file.
* .xinitrc - initialization file when running startx. Can be used to activate applications, run a given window manager, and modify the appearance of the root window.
* .xsession - configuration file for xdm

== Directories ==

Different distributions have different directory structures, despite attempts at standardization such as the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) organization.

* /bin - essential UNIX commands such as ls, etc. Should contain all binaries needed to boot the system or run it in single-user mode
* /boot - files used during booting and possibly the kernel itself are stored here
* /dev - contains device files for various devices on system
* /etc - files used by subsystems such as networking, NFS, and mail. Includes tables of disks to mount, processes to run on startup, etc.
* /etc/profile.d - contains scripts that are run by /etc/profile upon login.
* /etc/rc.d - contains a number of shell scripts that are run on bootup at different run levels. There is also typically an rc.inet1 script to set up networking (in Slackwar), an rc.modules script to load modular device drivers, and an rc.local script that can be edited to run commands desired by the administrator, along the lines of autoexec.bat in DOS.
* /etc/rc.d/init.d - contains most of the initialization scripts themselves on an rpm-based system.
* &lt;nowiki&gt; /etc/rc.d/rc*.d - where ``*'' is a number corresponding to the default run level. Contains files for services to be started and stopped at that run level. On rpm-based systems, these files are symbolic links to the initialization scripts themselves, which are in /etc/rc.d/init.d. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* /etc/skel - directory containing several example or skeleton initialization shells. Often contains subdirectories and files used to populate a new user's home directory.
* /etc/X11 - configuration files for the X Window system
* /home - home directories of individual users
* /lib - standard shared library files
* /lib/modules - modular device driver files, most with .o extensions
* /mnt - typical mount point for many user-mountable devices such as floppy drives, cd-rom readers, etc. Each device is mounted on a subdirectory of /mnt.
* /proc - virtual file system that provides a number of system statistics
* /root - home directory for root
* /sbin - location of binaries used for system administration, configuration, and monitoring
* /tmp - directory specifically designed for programs and users to store temporary files.
* /usr - directory containing a number of subdirectory with programs, libraries, documentation, etc.
* /usr/bin - contains most user commands. Should not contain binaries necessary for booting the system, which go in /bin. The /bin directory is generally located on the same disk partition as /, which is mounted in read-only mode during the boot process. Other filesystems are only mounted at a later stage during startup, so putting binaries essential for boot here is not a good idea.
* /usr/bin/X11 - most often a symbolic link to /usr/X11R6/bin, which contains executable binaries related to the X Window system
* /usr/doc - location of miscellaneous documentation, and the main location of program documentation files under Slackware
* /usr/include - standard location of include files used in C programs such as stdio.h
* /usr/info - primary location of the GNU info system files
* /usr/lib - standard library files such as libc.a. Searched by the linker when programs are compiled.
* /usr/lib/X11 - X Window system distribution
* /usr/local/bin - yet another place to look for comon executables
* /usr/man - location of manual page files
* /usr/sbin - other commands used by superuser for system administration
* /usr/share - contains subdirectories where many installed programs have configuration, setup and auxiliary files
* /usr/share/doc - location of program documentation files under Mandrake and Red Hat
* /usr/src - location of source programs used to build system. Source code for programs of all types are often unpacked in this directory.
* /usr/src/linux - often a symbolic link to a subdirectory whose name corresponds to the exact version of the Linux kernel that is running. Contains the kernel sources.
* /var - administrative files such as log files, used by various utilities
* /var/log/packages - contains files, each of which has detailed information on an installed package in Slackware. The same file can also be found at /var/adm/packages, since the adm subdirectory is a symbolic link to log. Each package file contains a short description plus a list of all installed files.
* /var/log/scripts - package installation scripts in Slackware are stored here. You can inspect these scripts to see what special features are included in individual packages.
* /var/spool - temporary storage for files being printed, mail that has not yet been picked up, etc.

==Discussion 2004==
There is a WikiProject in the Wikipedia that aims to produce an annotated table of contents as a guide to learning probability from the Wikipedia.  This may serve as useful starting point for extending this WikiBook.

[[User:Bjcairns|Ben Cairns]] [[Wikipedia:User:Bjcairns|On Wikipedia]] 03:39, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Before I contribute too much to this book, I would like to know what level the other contributors are aiming for in terms of mathematical background required and difficulty of examples/exercises.

Here is my suggestion, on which I invite comments:
*In the earlier chapters, keep the math background required to a minimum.  Perhaps a good guideline would be nothing that wouldn't be covered in a first year college math class.
*However, when an example involving more difficult math would be enlightening to those with the background necessary to understand it, mark the example as advanced.  Possibly put it in a green box to separate it from the rest of the text.
*Include proofs in appendices.  This would also be a good place for more involved examples that require advanced math.

== Book structure ==

Given the scope of probability theory, shouldn't we group combinatorics and permutations in a single chapter?&lt;br&gt;
edit: as I've started working on the combinaorics chapter - and have introduced permutations there -  I changed it. If this causes any probelm, welll, we'll edit it back the way it was.


I think it would make more sense and make the book more accessible if discrete random variables (including examples) were discussed first, and then move on to continuous rvs with pdfs etc. The concept of discrete rvs is far easier to grasp and so separating that out is useful for those uninterested in continuous RVs. Also for people reading the whole book, it allows them to get to grips with the concept of a random variable, the notation etc, without the worrying inclusion of continuous RVs having probability 0 of taking any particular value.

== Introduction to Probability textbook ==

It turns out that there's a 520-page textbook on probability which has been GPL'd and made available as a free download. The text is by Grinstead &amp; Snell. It can be downloaded [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html here]. Perhaps parts of it would make good additions to this wikibook, or perhaps even the entire thing should be wikified? --[[User:NeuronExMachina|NeuronExMachina]] 06:06, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

== Additional Sections ==

There are a number of additional sections that I think should be added to this book, so that it can become a more comprehensive resource. Here is a list of topics that I think we should add, and people can feel free to comment on this list or add to it (or give a good excuse why we shouldnt include them):

#Transformations of Random Variables
#Rician Fading
#Markov Processes
#Error Function, Complimentary Error Function
#(pseudo-)Random Number Generation
#Tests for randomness
#Joint pdf, joint PDF
#Functions of Random Variables
#Systems of Random Variables (Jacobians, etc)
#Moments
#Expectations
#Bounds and estimation (markov bound, chebyshev bound, chernoff bound)
#Entropy
#Moment Generating Function, Characteristic Equation
#Cumulant, Second Characteristic Equations

I am taking a class in this subject now, and I will try and incorporate some of my class notes into this book as I go. If there are any comments, questions, or suggestions, please let me know [[User talk:on my user talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:42, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

: Concerning &quot;Transformations of Random Variables&quot;: got that covered for contiguous random variables [[Probability/Transformation_of_Probability_Densities]] :-) --[[User:LarsWinterfeld|LarsWinterfeld]] ([[User talk:LarsWinterfeld|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LarsWinterfeld|contribs]]) 12:19, 7 September 2015 (UTC)

==Question and answers==
How about adding a small set of questions and answers at the end of each section. This would be helpful.

'''Spaetzle''' (German: ''Spätzle'') means literally translated &quot;little sparrow&quot; and is a Swabian specialty (Germany). It is made from flour, eggs, water, and salt. There are different techniques to makes spaetzles, i.e. using a spaetzle-maker or spaetzle-press (for the more lazy house person). The original technique is to use a kitchen board and a grater.

Spaetzle are served as side dishes with a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] to [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] or as main menu with [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] and [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]].

This recipe is for a cheese spaetzle.

==Ingredients==
* 500 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 150-200 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] water
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]

==Procedure==
# All ingredients are mixed using hands or an electrical mixer. 
# Add enough water to make the dough slightly sticky, yet keeping it elastic and stiff. 
# A large pot with salted water is boiled. 
# If using only a board a spoon of dough is swept over the kitchen board with the grater and then small pieces of the dough is cut/grated with the grater into the hot water. If using a spaetzle-maker, a spoon of the dough is put into the maker and pressed through the holes into the water. 
# The spaetzle are done when they rise and swim on the water surface. 
# The spaetzles can be removed from the water with a slotted spoon and put into a bowl. 
# A thin layer of shredded cheese is put over the noodles. 
# The procedures is repeated until no dough is left. 
# Onions are cut, [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] with [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], and put over the spaetzles.

'''Ghee''', or '''clarified butter''', is butterfat that has been separated from the water, proteins, and salt in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]. Ghee is used heavily in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cuisine]]. It is considered an extremely pure food in South Asia, and may be used to anoint representations of the deities, both in home worship, performed by laity, and in Temple worship, performed by Brahmin priests. 
[[File:Ghee Leila.JPG|thumb|Ghee Leila|right]]

==Ingredients==
*Unsalted butter (depends on how much Ghee you want to make)
 
==Procedure==
#Using a medium saucepan, heat butter on medium heat. 
#Allow butter to melt and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. You will notice that the oil will separate itself. The top will begin to froth; remove froth.
#Allow the oil to become clear. Once clear, remove from heat and allow to cool for 15 minutes. 
#After cooling, strain ghee through a very fine strainer into container or jar, or through 3-5 layers of cheesecloth. 
#Put lid on container and store on shelf.

==Notes==
*Many people refrigerate the Ghee to separate it from solids. The lactose remains with the watery portions and this form can be used by people who are Lactose intolerant.
*Ghee also requires a very high temperature before it smokes, and will keep longer than unclarified butter, as bacteria cannot digest a pure oil.
*Variations of Ghee include Cocoa butter, Dalda and other cooking fats.

The '''chapati''' is the staple flat bread of Northern [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistan]], also known as a '''roti'''. It can be made from many types of grain, but is most commonly made with finely ground [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat flour]]. Sometimes it is cooked in a little oil.

==Ingredients==
* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste, about 1 teaspoon
* water as required (about 1 1/2 cups)

==Procedure==
# Knead flour and water, starting with only a slight dribble of water and adding more as you go until the dough becomes smooth but not too sticky.
# Cover for at least 5 minutes.
# Divide into balls and roll out into disks, slightly thicker than denim material; sprinkle with flour as you roll.
#Place a non-oiled pan on a moderately high fire and test its surface temperature by holding your hand over it.
# When very hot, put a chapati on the pan and press it flat with a spatula or dry cloth to make it rise up.
# Flip and repeat so it becomes lightly browned on both sides.
# Chapatis are often brushed with ghee (clarified butter) after being cooked.

Makes 8 chapatis.

==Variations==
Regional variations abound in the detail of preparing and cooking roti. In most Indian cooking, for example, the roti is finished by toasting it in the open flame of the cooker. The aim of this process is to encourage the roti to puff up. The hot air which builds inside because the water inside the roti begins to turn into steam and cooks the roti inside out. This may also be achieved under a grill, or by using a microwave (try 30 seconds on high power). Universally, however, the aim in rolling is to get the roti to a perfectly round shape (for aesthetics) and to create uniform thickness, which is vital for successful cooking.

It should also be noted that there are Caribbean specific variation of Roti one of which uses boiled, then ground Yellow Split Peas in its preparation.

==Recommended Accompaniments==
Chapatis are usually eaten with cooked dal (lentil soup) or vegetable dishes like Indian curry. Pieces of the chapati are used to wrap and lift bites of the other dishes.

'''Tadka dhal''' is an everyday staple across South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]].

==Ingredients==
=== Dhal ===
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Moong dhal|moong dhal]], washed
* 2 cups water
=== Seasoning===
* 2-3 tablespoon cooking oil
* 3-4 tablespoon finely diced [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped
* a small sliver of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], chopped, or 1/4 teaspoon ginger paste
* 4-5 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mustard Seed|mustard seed]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seed
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek]] seed
* 1/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]] (optional)
* 1-2 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], chopped into 1/8ths
* 1-2 green [[Cookbook:Chilli pepper|chillies]], slit lengthwise
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* 1/4 teaspoon red chilli (hot pepper) powder
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (to taste) 

==Procedure==
# Set the dhal and water in an open pot on moderate heat until quite mushy, adding water if it becomes dry and stirring occasionally. This may take 30 minutes to an hour. A pressure cooker may be used to speed up this part of the process; this should take about 10-12 minutes at 5 psi.
# Heat the oil in a pan.
# Add mustard seed, standing well back (they tend to spatter).
# Add cumin seed, fenugreek, curry leaves, green chillies and onions
# Wait for the onions to turn translucent. Add garlic and ginger, turn the heat low until the garlic changes to a darker shade. Avoid caramelizing the garlic. Add turmeric, red chilli and asafoetida powder.
# Throw in tomatoes, wait for 2-3 minutes, letting the tomatoes fry in the hot oil. This lets the tomatoes pick up the flavors from the spices and also lets the oil-spice (tadka) mixture cool down, stopping the hot frying process that has chilli powder in it. Pour in the mushy dhal, addding salt to taste. 
# Simmer until the tomatoes become soft (5-10 minutes), stirring occasionally. Serve with [[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|rice]] or [[Cookbook:Chapati|chapatis]].

Serves 2.

__NOTOC__
'''Masala chai''' is a spiced version of the typical [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]]. As with much of Indian cuisine, the exact mix of dry [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]] varies greatly and is often handed down in families from one generation to the next. 

==Masala mixture==
===Ingredients===
* 100 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] of powdered [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* 25 grams [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* 100 grams whole black [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorns]]
* 60 grams [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], broken small, or 40 grams ground
* 1/2 seed of [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]], crushed
* 35 grams of green [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods

===Procedure===
Combine all of the spices and blend well in an electric grinder. You only need a small quantity for each cup of chai; store the rest for later. A full recipe will keep you stocked full of chai for months.

1. Select good quality ginger and wash to remove soils and other foreign objects.
2. Cut into thin slices. Spread evenly in trays.
3. Dry under the sun or in oven under moderate heat or 70ºC.
4. If desired. Pulverize using blender or grinder.
5. Pack and seal tightly.

==Chai==
===Ingredients (per cup)===
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3/4 teaspoon dried [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] leaves - to be traditional, a strong Indian tea such as an Assam is best.
* pinch of masala mixture
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

===Procedure===
# Boil water and milk.
# Add sugar, tea leaves and masala until the mixture becomes dark (about 5-10 minutes).
# The longer you boil, the stronger the chai.
# Strain into teacups to serve.

===Optional===
* Let the remaining solids cool and sprinkle them on your plants for an excellent fertiliser.
* Tea masala or garam masala from a store can be used to get around the masala mixture process, however preground spices lose their flavor over time.
* In step one, boil the water and milk separately, and in step two add the tea leaves and masala to the boiling water, boiling until the tea is as strong as you like.  Only then add the milk to the mix.  This can speed up the process without effecting the flavor.  This method is often used by restaurants to serve chai in large quantities quickly as orders are taken.
* Optionally turn off the heat in the end, cover and let sit for about five minutes for a richer flavor.
* Try adjusting the ratio of milk to water.  For a richer milky tea, try two parts milk to one part water.
* Leave out the sugar for a more adult flavor.  Sugar can be added while drinking if so desired.
* Try other combinations of South Asian spices.  Each region in which chai is commonly available has its own popular or traditional spice mix.  One optional addition to masala chai is fennel seeds.
* Add a piece of a lemongrass leaf (called lili cha in Gujarati), while the water is still boiling (before adding milk). This gives a nice flavor to the tea.  Mint,fresh ginger and/or holy basil (tulsi) can also be added.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian]]

'''Baingan bartha''' is an [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant (aubergine)]] dish much loved all over [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. This southern version of the dish is much different from northern varieties, and well suited to the cuisine of the region.

==Ingredients==
* single (1 pound) [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant (aubergine)]]
* 2-6 green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillies]], as desired
* 1 cup fresh ground [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* 1 cup chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander]] (cilantro)
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Paneer|paneer]] (or [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]])
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
# Roast the eggplant directly over a low flame - don't be afraid to set it right on the gas burner - turning it regularly until the skin becomes blackened and brittle and the flesh soft (about 15-20 minutes).
# Set aside to cool.
# Grind the chillies, coconut and coriander together in a food processor to form a paste.
# Peel the eggplant skin off and mash the flesh to a uniform pulp by hand.
# Mix in the coconut paste (and optionally you can then add curds), along with salt to taste.

Serve with [[Cookbook:Chapati|chapatis]], [[Cookbook:Dosa|dosa]] or [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

==Warnings==

Baingan bartha is commonly produced with:

* [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] (seeds)
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (leaves, from the same plant, and thus sometimes confusingly called coriander as well)
* both coriander and cilantro

The &quot;1 cup chopped&quot; in this recipe is suggestive of cilantro, but this is not at all certain.

==Maharashtrian Method==
* 1-2 Large eggplants
* Handful and some more finely chopped green onion including green leaves of it
* (If available and you like- 2 or 3 teaspoons of finely chopped green garlic with its leaves)
* 1/4 cup fresh peas
* 1-2 green chilies broken into 2/3 pieces each
* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric (Optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (Optional)
* Sufficient amount of oil + Cumin seeds + Rai
* Salt to taste

There are two methods for bharta:

;Raw Method
# Wash, then wipe dry eggplant. Apply some oil on the surface of each one of them.
# Roast eggplants over the direct heat (Alternatively , Char-grill in an oven or over a wood / Charcoal fire to infuse smoke)
# Once the skin is blackened and comes away on touch , let them cool a bit and then peel the burnt skin. Reserve the drip also.
# Mash the flesh with hand and make it smooth. Put this in a large bowl.
# Add green onion (garlic if you have), green peas and salt.
# Heat some oil in the pan. Once heated sufficiently add rai &gt;&gt; cumin seeds &gt;&gt; green chilies. Let chilies to fry for 10/12 seconds.
# Pour this mix on to the flesh mix in the bowl. Mix well and serve with bhakri and thecha/ kharda

;Fry Method
# Steps 1 till 5 same as above.
# In the step 6 above add turmeric after chilies then add the flesh to the pan of tadka. Sautè for some time say 1/2 mins. If required add some of the reserved drip to moist the bharta.
# Serve hot.

;Kharda (Accompaniment)
# Wash and dry about 10/15 green chilies and half handful of coriander. Peel 5/7 cloves of garlic; break the chilies in to 2/3 pieces each.
# Heat about 1 - 1 1/2 tbsp of oil on the griddle (tava)
# Once heated sufficiently add chilies and garlic (make sure you have exhaust turned on and working!)
# Fry them for sometime say 30/40 sec over low heat. Turn the heat off. Now add salt to taste. Put this mix in a blender along with chopped coriander and blend it. NOT in a paste but roughly.
# Thecha is ready to serve. While serving put some raw groundnut oil on each serving. This is very very hot dish depending the chilies used. Eat and handle carefully!

;Easy Recipe : serves 4
*2 Medium Dutch Aubergines
*100 Gm Tomato Paste or 4 medium ripe tomatoes finely diced
*1 Medium Spanish Onion Chopped
*1/4 Teaspoon Mustard Seeds
*1/3 Teaspoon Cumin seeds
*1/4 Teaspoon Turmeric Powder
*2-3 Coriander Stems Finely chopped, Reserve the chopped leaves as garnish
*Chopped Green Chilli per taste
*Salt per taste

#Peel and Steam the Aubergine till the flesh is tender.Mash and reserve.
#Heat some Oil (use mustard oil or a blend for best results) and add Mustard and Cumin seeds.Saute for 10 seconds and add finely chopped Garlic and  Ginger.Saute till the ginger / garlic turn yellow.
#Add Chopped Onion and saute till the onion is translucent.
#Add the Aubergine Mash,Turmeric Powder, Coriander Stem and Tomato Paste with Salt.
#cook on medium heat for 20 mins.
#Garnish with chopped Coriander and serve
#To smoke the Bharta for a more robust flavour, light a small piece of charcoal and place it over a piece of foil placed inside the dish.Pour about 1/4 teaspoon of oil and cover the dish immediately.Leave to infuse.

'''Upeseru''' is a rural speciality of the South of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], and villages around the state of Karnataka in particular. The main recipe is for a solid dish of lentils and greens, and the water drained from this is often used in an accompanying wet sauce to be eaten with [[Cookbook:Mudde|mudde]] (ragi balls). The combination of the three is a common complete meal.

==Ingredients==
===Solids===
* 1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Dal|dhal]] or other lentils, cooked but not drained

* 10 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], diced
* 1-6 green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillies]], split lengthwise, according to taste
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

===Broth===
* 1-6 green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillies]], to taste
* 1/2 teaspoon fresh [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind]] per chilli used
* handful of [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* 8 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 2 teaspoons whole black [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorn]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* spinach-lentil water
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]

==Procedure==
=== Solids ===
# Fry the mustard seed, curry leaves, onion and green chillies in oil until the onions are partly browned.
# Meanwhile, set the lentils on the stove. Throw in the chopped spinach and bring to boil until the spinach is tender.
# Drain and set the water aside separately for the next recipe.
# Stir in the spice mixture and salt to taste, keeping on the flame until the flavours have blended.

===Broth===
# Dry-roast the chillies and tamarind slightly, if desired.
# Grind all dry ingredients together with a little water to make [[Cookbook:chutney|chutney]].
# Bring the spinach broth to a boil and let simmer for two minutes.
# When serving, mix in a spoonful of the chutney and squeeze in [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]].

==Serving==
Serves 4-6. Eat with [[Cookbook:Mudde|mudde]] (ragi balls).

[[Image:Ragi mudde2.jpg|frame|Ragi Mudde]]
'''Mudde''' is a compact ball of dough made from finger millet. It is a lunchtime staple of rural communities in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], and an important source of long-lasting energy among the rural poor.

==Ingredients==
* 2 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Ragi|ragi]] (finger millet) flour
* 5 cups water
* [[Cookbook:Ghee|Ghee]]

==Procedure==
# Boil the water and add a little of the flour to make a paste, then add the rest of the flour.
# Stir once with the handle of a wooden spoon and leave it in the pot.
# Keep on a low fire for about 10 minutes until it smells cooked.
# Stir until the mixture turns dark reddish-brown. Once it begins to leave the sides of the pot, remove the pot from the fire and stir vigorously for 5-10 minutes--it's hard work, but the longer you keep at it, the lighter it will be.
# Pull the dough out and form into balls of about fist size.

Makes about 6 balls.

Serving immediately is preferable, but the balls can also be packed and eaten cold later. Before eating, if desired, poke a hole in the ball with your finger and pour in a little ghee. Dip pieces of the ragi dough in a watery sauce like [[Cookbook:Upeseru|upeseru]] broth and swallow; do not attempt to chew. Eat along with the solid upeseru for a complete meal that will keep you going all day.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Cuisine]]

'''Appam''', a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] rice pancake, is a speciality of the South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] coastal state of [[w:Kerala|Kerala]]. It is especially popular among the Christian communities of that state. Appam are often served along with a coconut-flavoured [[Cookbook:Keralan vegetable stew|vegetable stew]]. It is also very popular in Sri Lanka, where it is known as &quot;appa&quot; (or &quot;hopper&quot;) and often served with an added [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]].

==Ingredients==
* 1½ cups uncooked white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 1½ cups fresh grated [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], or to taste
* 2 tablespoons white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], cooked
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] for soaking rice, and 2 to 2½ cups for grinding
* optional: ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] or [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]], to start the [[Cookbook:Fermentation|ferment]]

==Procedure==
# Soak the raw rice in water.
# Grind the soaked rice until about ¼ ground.
# Add the grated coconut along with a little water and continue grinding.
# Add the sugar, cooked rice and yeast or kefir, and keep grinding until the whole mixture becomes smooth. It should be thinner than pancake batter.
# Transfer it to a wide open container and leave it to rise overnight.
# The next morning, add salt and refrigerate the batter until use.
# To fry the appams, use a [[Cookbook:Tava|tava]] or a small bowl-shaped pan with either a non-stick coating or a little oil or ghee.
# Pour a full serving spoon of batter into the middle of the pan and swirl it around a single time so that a little of the batter sticks to the sides.
# Cover the pan with a hot lid and remove the appam with a spatula after 2-3 minutes, when it becomes slightly browned around the edges. It should be round, with a thick centre and thin, lacy edges.

Makes 12.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* The batter ''should'' ferment overnight without any added starter, but often ''won't''. Yeast (or better still, kefir) can be added to help it ferment.
* The grinding can be done in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]. Make sure that there is enough liquid so that it all swirls around in the blender, mixing properly.

This coconut-flavoured '''vegetable stew''' is a famous dish of the South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] coastal state of Kerala. It is often served with [[Cookbook:Appam|appam]] (rice pancakes). Though frequently made with [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], this recipe is for the purely vegetable version of the stew.

==Ingredients==
* ½ [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]], freshly grated

* 10 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* 2 small pieces [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] bark
* 2 pods green [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]]
* 1 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] or [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]] or [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]

* Seasoning:
** pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
** 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] ground black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
** 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard seed]]
** 1 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]

==Procedure==
# Pour ¾ cup of water into the grated coconut. Squeeze out the milk through a tea strainer. Set aside; this is first milk.
# Pour ½ cup of water into the same coconut and squeeze out the second milk. Keep this aside as well.
# In a large pan, heat oil and add the cloves, cinnamon and cardamom.
# Add the chopped onion, ginger, chillies and curry leaves. Fry till the onion is partly brown.
# Add the boiled vegetables and stir for one minute.
# Pour in the second milk and boil for about 5-7 minutes.
# Add salt.
# Dissolve the maida/rice flour in a little water and add it to the gravy.
# When it boils again, add the first milk.
# Remove from the flame when it starts to boil once more.
# Season with the pepper, mustard and shallot.

Best served with [[Cookbook:Appam|appam]].

{{recipesummary|Sauce recipes|4|20 minutes|2|Image=[[File:Tomato Chutney.jpg|300px]]}}

This traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] '''tomato gravy''' can be used as a base for all sorts of vegetables, boiled [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], cubed [[Cookbook:Paneer|paneer]] or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]. This is often referred to as a &quot;[[Cookbook:Curry|curry]]&quot;. It is usually eaten with plain white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] or [[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|rice mixtures]].

==Ingredients==
* 5 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], chopped large
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], diced small
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] paste
* 5 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], pounded
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chilli powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] powder
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
# Fry the onions in hot ghee until they start to brown.
# Add the ginger and garlic and stir, then add the powdered spices. Blend well.
# Throw in the tomatoes and salt to taste.
# Turn the flame down to medium and cover for 10 minutes.
# This will form a spicy gravy to which you can add any mixture of vegetables or chicken. If using cooked vegetables, keep the pot on the flame until they are uniformly heated; for uncooked vegetables, cook as long as necessary. For raw whole chicken, be sure to cook for at least 20 minutes.

Serves 4.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* I like to add a little cayenne and cumin, and leave out the chili powder (though &quot;chili powder&quot; in Indian recipes ''is'' cayenne, i.e., powdered chilis!)
* I tried using lamb with this gravy, but the flavours conflict.  I would recommend sticking with chicken or vegetables for this recipe.  Also, depending on the freshness of your spices, you may want to add extra spices in the same ratio to achieve a stronger flavour.
* Generally for lamb you can use all the above ingredients except the tomatoes. Marination is preferred. Cloves and cinnamon can be added to give an excellent flavour.
* For a vegetarian version of this recipe, substitute the ghee with coconut oil or other vegetable oil.
* You can also use a pressure cooker instead of a stove top- cook it for 6-7 whistles on a medium flame.
* You can also use fried onions to get a gravy with a different flavor- this goes well with chicken.

This very fancy '''pulao''', or mixed rice, is from the Northern [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] state of Kashmir. Although it is a frozen region high in the Himalayas, Kashmir lies along the ancient overland trade routes between Persia and India, and the cuisine is famous for using a huge assortment of nuts and dried fruits from all over Central and Western Asia.

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:kg|kilogram]] [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|basmati]] or other long-grained rice, cooked and drained
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], to taste.
* 5 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* 4 pods green [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon tree leaf]] (or substitute 2 [[Cookbook:Bay leaf|bay leaves]])
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced thin
* 2 green [[Cookbook:Chilli pepper|chillies]], split lengthwise
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste (1 part [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] to 1 part [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]])
* 100 grams dried [[Cookbook:Date|dates]], pitted and sliced thin
* 50 grams white [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
* 50 grams [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashew]] nuts
* 50 grams [[Cookbook:Pistachio|pistachio]] nuts
* 50 grams [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]], blanched and diced
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3-4 strands [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
# Heat ghee or butter in a large wide pan or [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]].
# Add dry spices: cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon tree leaf.
# Throw in the chopped onion and fry until it just begins to turn brown.
# Add ginger-garlic paste and chillies and fry for about 1 minute before tossing in all of the dried fruits and nuts.
# Add salt to taste.
# Turn the flame down to low.
# Soak the strands of saffron in milk, mixing until the milk turns orange.
# Pour the cooked rice into the pan and sprinkle the saffron-milk on top.
# Stir very carefully so as not to break or mash up the rice grains, mixing the flavourings and saffron colour in uniformly and heating the rice.
# Add more ghee according to your preference
# optional adding panneer fried in ghee to the pulao makes it taste better. use chicidi as a sidedish

Serve with a gravy such as the [[Cookbook:Basic Indian Tomato Gravy|basic tomato gravy]]. Serves 4.

[[File:Aesthetic Ven Pongal.jpg|thumb|Khara Pongal]]
'''Khara pongal''' is a savoury porridge-like dish that is traditionally prepared in South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] for the Makar Sankranti festival that heralds the arrival of summer. The [[Cookbook:Sweet pongal|sweet pongal]] variety differs only in the spices added, and the two are often cooked together from the same batch of rice and dhal.

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Moong dhal|moong dhal]]
* 3 cups water
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* 1/4 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashew]] nuts
* 10 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]
* 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
* 2 green [[Cookbook:Chilli pepper|chillies]], split lengthwise
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] (or substitute [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]])
* 1/2 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Mustard Seed|mustard seed]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
# Cook the rice and dhal together with turmeric powder in a pot or pressure cooker until mushy.
# Heat a little ghee in a large pan and brown the cashew nuts. Remove them from the pan.
# Add the rest of the ghee and the oil and heat.
# Throw in all of the spices, starting with the mustard seed and finishing with the cashew nuts.
# Mix in the rice and dhal, warming through. If it is too thick, add a little water.
# Add salt and extra ghee to taste.

It will be very tasty if you add some grated coconut at the end.

Serves 6-8

'''Chinese cuisine''' is actually not a single entity, but instead is made up of the individual cuisines of many provinces and ethnics groups of China. So combined together, there are perhaps thousands of types all over the China. That is why Chinese have a famous old saying &quot;Cuisine is heavenly in first priority&quot; （民以食为天）.However, there are some common ingredients and philosophies about most Chinese foods.

First and foremost, Chinese believe that having a knife at the table is barbaric.  This means dishes are usually prepared in portions to be eaten directly with chopsticks or spoons. Second,  Chinese foods are usually served warm and well-cooked.

Common ingredients include:

* [[Cookbook:Beef|Beef]]
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|Chicken]]
* [[Cookbook:Duck|Duck]]
* [[Cookbook:Pork|Pork]]
* [[Cookbook:Soybean|Soybeans]] ([[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]])
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable|Vegetables]]

== Genres of Cuisine ==
It is a common sense to most Chinese that there are eight main genres (or types) of cuisine in China. They are:
* [[Cookbook:Chuan cuisine|Chuan cuisine]]（川菜）(Combined with Cheng-Du and Chong-Qing regional cuisines;Spicy and hot)
* [[Cookbook:Hui cuisine|Hui cuisine]]（徽菜）(Combined with Wan-nan, Yangtze river drainage area;Very good at pot-roasting and using sugar)
* [[Cookbook:Lu cuisine|Lu cuisine]]（鲁菜）(Combined with Ji-Nan and Jiao-Dong regional cuisines;Garlic and seafood)
* [[Cookbook:Min cuisine|Min cuisine]]（闽菜）(Combined with Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Xiamen; South sea seafood)
* [[Cookbook:Su cuisine|Su cuisine]]（苏菜）(Combined with Yang-zhou,Suzhou and Nanking;Good at braising and soup;Fresh and yum)
* [[Cookbook:Xiang cuisine|Xiang cuisine]]（湘菜）(Specially hot and heavily using of chilly and vinegar)
 
* [[Cookbook:Yue cuisine|Yue cuisine]]（粤菜）(Combined with Guangzhou, Chaozhou and Dongjiang; Simple yet complex, crisp and fresh)
* [[Cookbook:Zhe cuisine|Zhe cuisine]]（浙菜）(Combined with Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shaoxing;Soft and good-smelling)


The genres are mainly based on the provinces of old China.

However, nowadays new cuisine types are created and there could be more than eight types.

'''Sheer Khurma''' is a sweet noodle soup served by many [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian]] Muslims to guests during the holy month of Ramadan. The recipe was originally a Mughal-Afghan dish, imported to Mughal-India.
==Ingredients==
* 200 grams dry [[Cookbook:Vermicelli|vermicelli]]
* 1 1/4 cups [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* 100 grams dried [[Cookbook:Date|dates]], soaked overnight, pitted and chopped thin
* 100 grams [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]], blanched and slivered
* 100 grams white [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
* 100 grams halved [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashew]] nuts
* 12 cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
* 4 cups water
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] powder

==Procedure==
# Pour the ghee in a large pot over a low flame.
# Fry the cashew nuts in the ghee until browned.
# Turn off the flame and add the raisins.
# When the raisins swell up, take both them and the cashews out of the ghee with a spoon and set aside.
# Switch the low flame back on and heat the ghee.
# Fry the vermicelli in the same ghee, stirring so it turns golden-brown. Watch it carefully so it does not burn.
# Pour in the milk and water.
# Add the cashews and raisins back into the mixture.
# Add the sliced dates and almonds.
# Cook for about 2 minutes, or until the vermicelli starts to get flexible; then add sugar.

# Heat just a little longer and mix well.
# Serve hot.

Serves 12.

==On Acoustics and Electrics==

===Body===
The body of a guitar consists of a treble or upper bout, waist bout and a bass or lower bout. The waist is the narrow section that divides them. The body is one of the most important factors in shaping the overall tone of a guitar. It provides the resonance that shapes the tonal qualities. It determines the volume of acoustic guitars and affects the sustain of electric guitars. The resonance is affected by:

*the types of wood used 
*whether the body is made from layered woods (ply) or single pieces 
*whether the body is hollow or solid
*the shape and size of the body 

The woods listed below are used in the construction of both acoustic and electric guitars. 

====Tone wood====

*'''Agathis''' (also known as '''Commercial Grade Mahogany''' or '''Poor Man's Mahogany''') is a tropical pine commonly found throughout south-east Asia. It is a plantation-wood used mainly for building cabinets. Agathis is cheap and usually used in the construction of budget guitars. Its tone is similar to mahogany but more bland sounding with a less complex response.

*'''Alder''' is a lightweight wood that provides a clean balanced tonal response and good resonance. Its soft and tight porous structure is similar to basswood but with a bolder hard grain pattern that adds to the stiffness making it more robust. Alder has a medium light tan color and provides a balanced tone across the frequency range with a slight upper mid-range producing a clean sound. Its resonance provides a good dynamic range.

*'''Ash''' has an open grain pattern which requires a lot of lacquer to seal and this can have a marked affect on the length of the sustain. Ash is typically used in mid-range priced guitars. Ash offers two varieties for guitar construction and they differ in tone:

:(1) '''Northern hard ash''' (also known as '''Baseball Bat Ash''') is hard, heavy and dense. This gives it a bright tone and long sustain.
:
:(2) '''Swamp Ash''' (also known as '''Southern Soft Ash''') comes from swamps in the Southern USA.  Swamp Ash grows underwater which makes the wood lightweight and porous. Many Fender guitars from the 1950s were built with Swamp Ash.  It has hard grain lines between its softer layers and a creamy light tan color with bold darker grain patterns. Its tonal qualities are a balance between brightness, warmth and dynamic range with clear bell-like highs, slightly scooped mids and strong lows. Swamp Ash has good resonance across the whole frequency spectrum and therefore can sound quite complex.

*'''Basswood''' is a lightweight (lighter than Alder) close-grained wood with a consistent and tight grain pattern. Its very soft with light colors that range from almost white to medium tan. It requires a hard finish, such as polyester, for protection and good engineering to allow the screws and screw-holes to hold the parts. The installation of a tremolo system on such a softwood also means the body needs to be thicker to prevent cracking. Tonally, basswood has a warm soft tone which attenuates both the high and extreme low frequencies. It also creates a pronounced midrange fundamental frequency response and a reduced smoother high-end response. The tonal response compared with other softwoods such as ash and alder is less complex with a narrower dynamic range. Basswood doesn't excel in clean sounds though when coupled with distortion and overdriven amplifier produces a metal-lead sound much favoured by some rock guitarists. It is used in the construction of budget guitars and expensive guitars. 

*'''Cedar''' became popular in the mid-twentieth century after master luthier Jose Ramirez III of Madrid pioneered the use of red cedar as a substitute for the increasingly scarce European spruce. It is now considered one of the world's premier tone woods.

*'''Mahogany''' is a highly dense, heavy wood with a fine, open grain and large pores. The color is reddish brown. Tonally, it provides good low frequencies, a compressed mid-range and smooth sounding highs. Overall, its tone is mellow, soft and warm with a full and thick quality. Its density provides excellent sustain and also makes it less susceptible to dents and scratches. Its density and weight have led some manufacturers to experiment with a thinner body as seen on the Ibanez S series. 

*'''Nato''' (also known as '''Eastern Mahogany''') is a native wood from the Caribbean and South America. Nato is not a mahogany though its appearance and tonal similarities to mahogany has led to it being used on guitars as a mahogany substitute. It is also a commercial grade wood used in cabinet building. It has a bright tone with pronounced midrange but lacks in sensitivity and punch compared with mahogany. Nato is used by the manufacturer B.C. Rich for their Assassin range.
[[File:Sawyer bucking spruce log on the Oregon coast.jpg|thumb|right|North-American Spruce|thumb|right|North-American Spruce]]

*'''Maple''' is used for the backs and sides of more expensive acoustics like the J200 series by Gibson. Though not generally used as a table for flat-topped instruments; it is the wood of choice for arched top guitars, mandolins, and the violin family of instruments. Its usually white in color with tight pores and thin grain lines. There are two main types of American maple:

:(1) '''Eastern Hard Maple''' (also known as '''Hard Rock Maple''' or '''Sugar Maple''' and usually associated with maple syrup) is an excellent tonewood. As named, it is very hard and dense with a medium weight which makes it difficult to work and therefore it is usually reserved for necks. When used for the body, it provides a bright sound with very strong highs and upper mid-range but quieter bass frequencies. Overall, hard maple has a very long sustain. Eastern hard maple can exhibit a figure (grain pattern) called the ''bird's eye'' whose aesthetic appeal has led to it being used for guitar tops and backs usually bookmatched.
:
:(2) '''Western Soft Maple''' (also known as '''Big Leaf Maple''') is much lighter in weight than Hard Maple. It has a bright tone with good bite and attack though not as brittle as hard maple. Its tonal qualities produce singing highs with a tight low-end. This kind of maple is often seen with a figure called ''flame'' or ''curl'' and less commonly a figure called ''quilt''.
:
*'''Rosewood''' is used for the backs and sides of acoustics and also for fingerboards. It possesses an extremely high density which makes for an acoustically reflective tone wood. Its color is dark brown with reddish, purple or orange streaks running through it.  There are many varieties of rosewood that are suitable for guitar construction.

*'''Poplar''' is a wood used by manufacturers of budget guitars most notably Danelectro who use masonite (top and back) glued to a poplar frame (sides). Its a closed grain wood with a greyish-green color and similar to alder in weight and tone. Due to the resurgence of interest in budget guitars from the 1950s onwards some modern reissues that use poplar are relatively expensive. 

*'''European Spruce''' is a premium tonewood used in the design of many stringed instruments including the violin, viola and lute. Increasing scarcity has resulted in the use of substitutes such as the North American species of spruce and red cedar.

*'''Walnut''' is a medium hard wood with a strong grain pattern. Its body has a constant density. Walnut is harder, heavier and more dense than mahogany and therefore closer to maple. Tonally, it is warmer than maple with a solid low-end. The mid-range is relatively complex and the high-end is smooth and bright. Due to its density it provides good sustain.

====Body top====
Some electric guitars have an extra top added to the body to blend the tonal qualities of different types of wood together. Maple with figuring is a popular top and produces a pronounced look and tone (adds brightness). Body tops are not used on acoustics since the layering of two pieces of wood for the table would inhibit the resonance and dull the tone.

===Bridge===
[[File:Bridge string thru body.jpg|thumb|right|Bridge]]
The bridge is found on the lower bout of the body and its function is to allow the strings to sit at a relative height to the fretboard. Depending on the guitar, the strings may terminate at the bridge or just pass over it. On electric guitars the bridge can be raised or lowered using two screws (thumbscrews which can be rotated with the fingers or traditional screws requiring a screwdriver) at either end of the bridge. This is discussed further in the [[Guitar/Adjusting_the_Guitar|Adjusting the Guitar]] section.

The bridge of an acoustic consists of two parts: a saddle and the tie block. Saddles are either a piece of plastic or polished bone and like the electric guitar bridge keep the strings at a relative height to the fretboard. Saddles are made with a smooth top edge (no notches) and the base of the saddle is seated in a groove cut into the tie block. The wood tie block of a classical guitar is glued to the lower bout and acts as a string terminator. A classical guitar string is pushed through the hole in the tie block and the string is then brought back under itself three or four times and pulled tight to form a knot. Once the saddle is seated in the groove of the tie block the tension of the strings clamp it. Steel string acoustics also have a saddle and tie block though due to the strings having terminating end balls there is no need to knot. The saddle and tie block on acoustics are not adjustable and are set to the correct height by the manufacturer. Adjustments to the height of the acoustic saddle are possible by  shaving (lowering) the saddle though this job is best left to a luthier since any changes will be permanent.

The design of bridges varies greatly between different manufacturers and the above generic descriptions may not apply to some guitars. Regardless of the design the main purpose of all bridges is to maintain the strings at a relative height to the fretboard.

===Fretboard and Frets===
The fretboard is a piece of wood that is glued to the front of the neck. These are commonly made of rosewood though other hard woods such as ebony may also be used. Embedded in the fretboard are a number of metal ''frets'' (fret-wire) usually numbering twenty to twenty-four. Strings are pressed down behind a fret which changes the length that is left free to vibrate thereby producing a different note. A simple demonstration is to be found on the twelfth fret. On all guitars this is the fret that divides the string exactly in half and produces a note an octave higher than the open note. Any open string that maintains its original tension and is halved produces its octave. This applies to all stringed instruments including the piano and violin. 

There are a variety of fret designs. Jumbo frets are higher and wider than normal frets and require less fretboard contact to sound a clear note. Medium frets are closer to the board and must be firmly in contact with the fretboard to sound a clear note. Some guitarist prefer jumbo frets due to the ease with which you can bend strings and the faster play offered by less fretboard contact. As with many design elements of the guitar this is a subjective area that is more personal preference rather than advantage. Good technique is not dependent on fret size

The first fret is the one nearest the nut. Some manufacturers place a zero fret immediately after the nut and the strings sit on the zero fret. This brings the sound of the open strings nearer to the quality of a fretted note. 

A fretboard may have decorative inlays at the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 12th frets which serve as markers for the positions of the guitar. Fretboard inlays can be highly decorative or simple shapes and on  expensive guitars may be made from exotic material like mother of pearl or abalone.

===Headstock===
[[File:Détail tête guitare.jpg|thumb|right|Headstock]]
The headstock lies at the end of the guitar's neck.  The purpose of the headstock is to support the tuners, which terminates the strings of the instrument. The tuners are attached to tuning pegs and this allows the guitarist to lower or raise the pitch of the string. A secondary purpose of the headstock is identification and many guitar manufacturers choose to use a distinctive headstock shape often in combination with the name of the model and a trademark logo. On some guitars the model name and trademark logo may be created using inlaid materials though decals are also commonly used.

===Neck===
The neck can be a single piece of wood or several pieces glued together and cut to shape. The fretboard is a separate piece of wood that is attached to the neck. Necks can be glued to the body (set neck) or bolted on. Set necks are usually found on acoustic guitars and many other instruments including the violin, lute and cello. The bolt-on neck is a design feature more commonly associated with electric guitars. Most necks are wood though alternative materials such as carbon fibre composites have been used.

===Nut===
All strings pass through a ''nut'' at the headstock end of the fretboard. Its function is to maintain correct string spacing and alignment so that the strings feed into their respective tuning pegs. On acoustic guitars the nut and saddle are usually made of the same material. Electric guitars commonly use plastic or synthetic nuts though sometimes metal is used. As tremolo bars can cause tuning problems, guitars equipped with them usually have some manner of locking nut, where the strings are clamped down.

'''Tip:''' Some guitarists lubricate the nut grooves so that the strings move more smoothly. You can do this at home with a soft graphite pencil. There's no need for excessive marking with the pencil just a few swipes through the groove should deposit enough graphite.

===Pick Guard===
[[File:Gitarre (Mechanik).jpg|thumb|100px|right|Tuning Pegs]]
Guitars, in common with all wood instruments, are prone to dents, scratches and wear. A pick guard (also known as a scratch plate) protects the body of the guitar at the point of most contact. Some electric guitars have raised pick guards so your pick is directed out and away from the pots and strings. Pick guards sometimes need replacing due to wear or damage. In the case of an expensive or rare guitar, which may have a tortoise shell pick guard, the guitar will need to be sent to an experienced luthier.

===Sound Hole===
Sound holes are found on all acoustics. Their purpose is to allow the air pressure to stay equalized so that the soundboard can vibrate. Archtop guitars have f-shaped sound holes - a design feature they share with the violin, viola, cello and double bass. Round sound holes usually have a decorated edge based on a geometrical design known as a rosette. On modern guitars these decorations are machine-made though some luthiers of expensive guitars still use the traditional method of laying by hand small pieces of exotic material like mother of pearl.

===Truss Rod===
Steel-string acoustics and electric guitars have a steel truss rod that runs through the neck under the fretboard. Strengthening the neck with a truss rod counteracts the tension exerted by the strings and allows the curvature of the neck to be adjusted. Classical guitars do not require a truss rod due to the low tensile strength and high elasticity of nylon strings. Some less expensive steel-string acoustics do not have a truss rod. Adjusting the truss rod can have a marked impact on the action, tuning and playability of a guitar and should be left to a luthier. Excessive adjustments to the truss rod should be avoided as this can render a guitar unplayable.

===Tuning Pegs===
Tuning pegs are used to raise and lower the pitch of the strings. Acoustic guitars have two rows of three pegs which, when the guitar is held as normal, presents one row at the top of the headstock and one row at the bottom. Electric guitars may have tuning pegs in a single row running along the top of the headstock (Fender Stratocaster) or use the the acoustic guitar arrangement (Gibson Les Paul).

The tuning pegs act as string terminators and it is essential for tuning stability that they suffer no defects. Tuning pegs that are misaligned, have play or excessive resistance to turning may need repair  or replacing. Tuning pegs can be mounted to a plate, three on a single plate for acoustics, or attached to the headstock as individual pegs. Both designs rely on small screws to fix the pegs or plate to the headstock. Due to the tension of the strings and the constant turning of the pegs these screws may loosen. It is recommended that you check that they are screwed in tightly though avoid over-tightening which may itself cause alignment problems or damage the screw head.

==Electric Guitar==
===Pickups===

[[Image:Pickups Humb 2Single.jpg|thumb|right|Three magnetic pickups on an electric guitar. From left to right they are a humbucker and two single coils.]]

A pickup is a magnet wrapped in a coil of copper wire. When a string is plucked, the vibration of the string causes magnetic flux, which is then amplified and played through a speaker. There are several types of pickups: passive single coils, active single coils, passive humbuckers, and active humbuckers.

Passive single coils are the standard pickup for Fender Stratocasters and their copies. They have a bright and twangy clean sound but traditionally have less output which results in a thinner sound. Due to their design they pick up the background hum caused by the induction of the AC current. Some single coils, such as the P-90, are larger than regular single coils, and thus warmer than a standard single coil. However they still retain more of a single coil sound and still can pick-up background hum. Another single coil design is the Lipstick, commonly found on Danelectro Guitars, where the entire pickup is placed in a metal enclosure with a small gap left between the two metal halves. It tends to be brighter sounding, and the magnetic field caused by the gap in the metal case causes some hum reduction. Active single-coils use battery or phantom power for enhanced sensitivity and longer sustain. 

Humbuckers use two magnetic coils operating in opposite magnetic polarity to cancel out the hum associated with single coils. They provide a warm, fat sound that is popular with metal and blues guitarists. Humbuckers are responsive to overdriven gain which creates a heavy saturated distortion. Some humbuckers allow coil tap (using only one of the coils) or parallel connection, which provides a sound similar to a single coil. Passive humbuckers offer a rich, thick distortion with natural decay. Active humbuckers, like active single-coils, use battery or phantom power as well. 

Although the different types of pickups have become associated with certain genres; guitarists often follow their own tastes. When choosing a guitar the overall sound (including the amplifier) should be the main consideration and it must be borne in mind that all pickups are perfectly capable of producing a tonal palette suitable for any genre the guitarist may wish to play.

===Pickup Arrangements===

There are many different arrangements for pickups. The most basic is a single pickup near the bridge.

*'''S + S''' - the original Telecaster design uses two single coils. Telecasters have a percussive twang with lots of treble. Even when using thick single coils, as found on the Fender Jazzmaster and Gibson Les Paul P90, the tone is more emphasized on the treble side.

*'''S + S + S''' - three single coils are standard on Fender Stratocasters and Stratocaster copies.
 
*'''H + S + S''' - used on Stratocasters which are often called fat strats to distinguish them from the standard three single coil Stratocaster. The pick-up at the bridge is replaced by a humbucker. A favourite with guitarists who want the clean tone of single coils and the hum-free fat tone of a humbucker.
 
*'''H + H''' - the standard configuration for the Gibson Les Paul. Also known as the double fat strat configuration when mounted on a Stratocaster body.

*'''H + S + H''' - found on the Steve Vai signature model by Ibanez and a favourite pickup arrangement for metal guitarists. Stratocasters using this configuration are called ''super strats''.

*'''H + H + H''' - the standard pickup arrangement for the Gibson Firebird VII, SG Custom and Les Paul

===Pickup Selector===

Every electric guitar, except those with a single pickup, has a pickup selector. Guitars with two pickups have a three-way switch which allows the guitarist to select either the neck pickup or the bridge pickup. When the switch is in the middle position both pickups are used.

On guitars with three pickups there is usually a five way switch. The positions are:

*neck pickup
*neck-middle
*middle pickup
*middle-bridge
*bridge pickup

===Tremolo Bar===

A '''tremolo bar''' alters the pitch of the strings. Pushing down on the bar lowers the pitch of the strings and pulling up raises the pitch. Rapidly pushing and releasing will produce a modulation in pitch called ''vibrato''. Vibrato is often confused with tremolo, a volume modulation effect found on amplifiers, hence the misnomer tremolo bar. Originally used just for vibrato; the modern improvements in guitar design, amplifiers and effects has allowed guitarists to create a new palette of tremolo bar sound effects like the popular ''dive bomb''.

[[Image:Stratocaster detail DSC06937.jpg|thumb|left|The Fender Stratocaster shown here has multiple pickups, a whammy bar and volume and tone controls.]]

There are four kinds of tremolo:

*'''Bigsby tremolo''' - fitted at the bottom end of the body and with a limited pitch bend on both up and down. These distinctive looking tremolos are normally found on archtop guitars. Because of its limited range, it ''holds'' its tuning and is more stable than other non-locking tremolos that allow wider pitch bends.

*'''Vintage synchronized tremolo''' - (sometimes called the strat-type tremolo) can only down bend. This type of tremolo is more stable than the floating bridge tremolo though still prone to tuning problems.

*'''Floating bridge tremolo''' - this design allows wide bends of a tone or more in either direction though this greatly affects tuning stability. Poorly designed floating bridges on cheap guitars should be avoided since the flexibility of the design demands the highest quality in construction and components to ensure tuning stability. 

*'''Locking tremolo (Floyd Rose)''' - this design locks the strings therefore ensuring that the original tension of the strings are not affected by the tremolo bar and the strings return to their original tension after use. The locking tremolo makes changing strings and tuning slightly more complicated though once in tune the locking tremolo maintains tuning stability far better than non-locking designs. You still need to check your tuning every time you play since tuning is affected by other factors, such as moving from a cold room to a hot room, and the locking tremolo does not negate these factors.

===Pots===
Almost all electric guitars have at least two pots (potentiometer) which respectively control the volume and tone. Guitars that have four pots, two for volume and two for tone, assign each volume and tone pair to individual pickups. A Fender Stratocaster will typically have one master volume pot and two tone pots for the neck pickup and middle pickup.

===Electric Guitar Necks===
[[File:3-screw bolt-on neck.jpg|thumb|right|3-screw bolt-on neck]]
This section describes the different methods used for attaching the neck to an electric guitar:

'''Bolt-on neck''' - the neck is attached to the body with bolts which are held by a mounting plate for increased stability. The mounting plate can make accessing the higher frets difficult so some manufacturers, notably Ibanez, use a hidden plate. The bolt-on neck is a standard design used by Fender.

'''Set neck''' - the neck is attached to the body with adhesive. This is the method used on acoustics and rarely is it used for mass-produced electrics. Electric guitars that feature a set neck have to be built to a high standard since once glued on the neck is permanent and cannot be adjusted. Set necks are commonly found on more costly electric guitars. Gibson and Epiphone use set necks which is claimed to have these advantages over a bolt-on neck:

* warmer tone
* more sustain
* better access to higher frets

'''Thru-body neck''' - the neck extends the entire length of the body. The strings, fretboard, pickups and bridge are all mounted on the thru-body neck. The ears or wings (the bouts) are attached or glued to the central stick. The wings may be book-matched in order to give a symmetrical appearance. 

The thru-body neck is usually found on high-end guitars since the design is not favoured by mass-production manufacturers. It is more common on basses than guitars. The thru-body neck allows easier access to the higher frets because there is no heel and is considered by some guitarists to offer greater sustain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Protein role and importance==
Proteins are among the fundamental molecules of biology. They are common to all life present on Earth today, and are responsible for most of the complex functions that make life possible. They are also the major structural constituent of living beings. According to the [[/Central Dogma/]] of Molecular Biology (proposed by Francis Crick in 1958), information is transferred from DNA to RNA to proteins. DNA functions as a storage medium for the information necessary to synthesize proteins, and RNA is responsible for (among other things) the translation of this information into protein molecules, as part of the ribosome.

Virtually all the complex chemical functions of the living cell are performed by protein-based catalysts called enzymes. Specifically, enzymes either make or break chemical bonds. Protein enzymes should not be confused with RNA-based enzymes (also called ribozymes), a group of macromolecules that perform functions similar to protein enzymes. Further, most of the scaffolding that holds cells and organelles together is made of proteins. In addition to their catalytic functions, proteins can transmit and commute signals from the extracellular environment, duplicate genetic information, assist in transforming the energy in light and chemicals with astonishing efficiency, convert chemical energy into mechanical work, and carry molecules between cell compartments.

==Functions not performed by proteins==
Proteins do so much that it's important to note what proteins '''don't''' do. Currently there are no known proteins that can directly replicate themselves. Prions are no exception to this rule. It is theorized that prions may be able to act as a structural template for other chemically (but not structurally) identical proteins, but they can't function as a native template for protein synthesis ''de novo''. Proteins don't act as fundamental energy reserves in most organisms, as their metabolism is slower and inefficient compared to sugars or lipids. They are, on the other hand, a fundamental nitrogen and amino acid reserve for many organisms. Proteins do not directly function as a membrane in most organisms, except viruses; however, they are often important components of these structures, lending both stability and structural support.

=Proteins as polymers of aminoacids=

==Composition and Features==
Proteins are composed of a linear (not branched and not forming rings) polymer of amino acids. The twenty genetically encoded amino acids are molecules that share a central core: The &amp;alpha;-carbon is bonded to a primary amino (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) terminus, a carboxylic acid (-COOH) terminus, a hydrogen atom, and the amino acid side chain, also called the &quot;R-group&quot;. The R-group determines the identity of the amino acid. In an aqueous solution, at physiological pH (~6.8), the amino group will be in the protonated -NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; form, and the carboxylic acid will be in the deprotonated -COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; form, forming a zwitterion. Most amino acids that make up proteins are L-isomers, although a few exotic creatures use D-isomers in their proteins. It is important to note that levorotatory (L) and dextrorotatory (D) are not specific to rectus (R) and sinister (S) configurations. A levorotatory form of a protein can be either R or S configuration. Levorotatory and dextrorotatory refer to how the proteins bend light in a polarimeter.
[[Image:AminoAcidball.svg|thumb|The structure of an amino acid.]]

Amino acids polymerize via peptide bonds, which is a type of amide bond. A peptide bond is formed upon the dehydration of the carboxy-terminus of one amino acid with the amine terminus of a second amino acid. The resulting carbonyl group's carbon atom is directly bound to the nitrogen atom of a secondary amine. A peptide chain will have an unbound amino group free at one end (called the N-terminus) and a single free carboxylate group at the other end (called the C-terminus).

The written list of the amino acids linked together in a protein, in order, is called its primary structure. By convention, peptide sequences are written from N-terminus to C-terminus. This convention mimics the way polypeptides are synthesized by the ribosome in the cell. Small polymers of less than 20 amino acids long are more often called peptides or polypeptides. Proteins can have sequences as short as 20-30 amino acids to gigantic molecules of more than 3,000 aminoacids (like Titin,a human muscle protein).

==Genetically-Encoded Amino Acids==
While there are theoretically billions of possible amino acids, most proteins are formed of only 20 amino acids: the genetically-encoded (or more precisely, ''proteogenic'') amino acids. Note that all amino acids except glycine have a chiral center at their &amp;alpha;-carbons. (Glycine has two hydrogens on its &amp;alpha;-carbon, and therefore it is achiral.) Besides glycine, all proteogenic amino acids are &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids, meaning they have the same absolute configuration as &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde. This is the same as the S-configuration, with the exception of cysteine, which contains a sulfur atom in its side chain, and so the naming priority changes. &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are sometimes found in nature, as in the cell walls of certain bacteria, but they are rarely incorporated into protein chains.

The side-chains of proteogenic amino acids are quite varied: they range from a single hydrogen atom (as for glycine, the simplest amino acid) to the indole heterocycle, as found in tryptophan. There are polar, charged and hydrophobic amino acids. The chemical richness of amino acids is at the base of the complexity and versatility of proteins.

==Post-Translational Modification==
There are two major types of post-translational modifications to protein: those that cleave the bonds of the peptide backbone and those that add or remove functional groups to the sidechains of individual amino acids. In the first type of post-translational modification, specialized enzymes called proteases recognize specific amino acids of a protein and break the associated peptide bond, thereby irreversibly modifying the primary structure. In the second major type of modification, the amino acid side chains of a given protein are chemically modified by enzymatic reactions or are spontaneously formed (non-enzymatic). Examples of sidechain modifications are quite numerous, but common ones include oxidation, acylation, glycosylation (addition of a glycan, or sugar), methylation, and phosphorylation. Both types of post-translational modifications are capable of exerting positive and negative control over a given protein or enzyme.

==The importance of protein structure==
Generally speaking, the function of a protein is completely determined by its structure. Molecules like DNA, which perform a fairly small set of functions, have an almost fixed structure that's fairly independent from sequence. By contrast, protein molecules perform functions as different as digesting sugars or moving muscles. To perform so many different functions, proteins come in many different structures. The protein function is almost completely dependent on protein structure. Enzymes must recognize and react with their substrates with precise positioning of critical chemical groups in the three-dimensional space. Scaffold proteins must be able to precisely dock other proteins or components and position them in space in the correct fashion. Structural proteins like [[w:Collagen|Collagen]] must face mechanical stresses and be able to build a regular matrix where cells can adhere and proliferate. Motor proteins must reversibly convert chemical energy in movement, in a precise fashion.

==Protein folding depends on sequence==
As Anfinsen demonstrated in the 1960's, proteins acquire their structure by spontaneous folding of the polypeptide chain into the minimal energy configuration. Most proteins require no external factors in order to fold (although specialized protein exist in cells, called chaperones, that help other, misfolded, proteins acquire their correct structure) &amp;mdash; the protein sequence itself uniquely determines the structure. Often the whole process takes place in milliseconds. Despite the apparent chemical simplicity of proteins, the vast number of permutations of twenty amino acids in a linear sequence leads to an amazing number of different protein folds. Nevertheless, protein structures share several characteristics in common: they are almost all built of a few secondary structure elements (short-range structural patterns that are recurrent in protein structures) and even the way these elements combine is often repeated in common motifs. Nonetheless, it is still impossible to know what structure a given protein sequence will yield in solution. This is known as the protein folding problem, and it is one of the most important open problems in modern molecular biology.

==Protein denaturation==
Proteins can lose their structure if put in unsuitable chemical (e.g. high or low pH; high salt concentrations; hydrophobic environment) or physical (e.g. high temperature; high pressure) conditions. This process is call denaturation. Denatured proteins have no defined structure and, especially if concentrated, tend to aggregate into insoluble masses. Protein denaturation is by no means an exotic event: a boiled egg becomes solid just because of denaturation and subsequent aggregation of its proteins. Denatured proteins can sometimes refold when put again in the correct environment, but sometimes the process is irreversible (especially after aggregation: the boiled egg is again an example). It is finally the proteins which are responsible for susceptibility or resistance to a pathogen or parasite.

==Proteins can fold into domains==
A significant number of proteins, especially large proteins, have a structure divided into several independent domains. These domains can often perform specific functions in a protein. For example, a cell membrane receptor might have an extracellular domain to bind a target molecule and an intracellular domain that binds other proteins inside the cell, thereby transducing a signal across the cell membrane.

The domain of a protein is determined by the secondary structure of a protein there are four main types of domain structures: alpha-helix, beta-sheet, beta-turns, and random coil. 

The alpha-helix is when the poly-peptide chain forms a helix shape with the amino acids side chains sticking out, usually about 10 amino acids long. The alpha-helix gets its strength by forming internal hydrogen bonds, that occur between amino acid 1 and 4 along the length of the helix. A high concentration of Glycine's in a row tend towards the alpha-helix conformation. 

The beta-sheet structure is composed of poly-peptide chains stacking forming hydrogen bonds between the sheets. You can form parallel sheets by stacking in the same direction N-C terminal on top of N-C terminal or form anti-parallel by stacking in opposite directions N-C terminal on top of C-N terminal. Beta-turns link two anti-parallel beta strands by a 4 amino acid loop in a defined conformation. 

A random coil is a portion of the protein that has no defined secondary structure.

Domains of a protein then come from unique portions of the peptide that are made up of these types of secondary structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Amino acid structure and chemistry==
===General features===
Amino acids consist of a primary amine bound to an aliphatic carbon atom (the so-called α-carbon), which in turn is bound to a carboxylic acid group. At least one hydrogen atom is bound to the α-carbon; in addition, the α-carbon bears a side chain, which is different for different amino acids. In a neutral aqueous solution, amino acids exist in two forms. A very small fraction of amino acid molecules will be neutral, with a deprotonated amino group and a protonated carboxylic acid group. However, the overwhelming majority of molecules will be in a ''[[w:Zwitterion|Zwitterion]]'' [[w:tautomer|tautomer]], with a positive charge on the (protonated) amino group and a negative charge on the (deprotonated) carboxylate group.

Amino acids are linked via a [[w:Peptide bond|Peptide bond]]. (From an organic chemistry perspective, a peptide bond is a type of [[w:amide|amide]] group.) A peptide bond consists of a carbonyl group's carbon atom directly bound to the nitrogen atom of a secondary amine. A peptide chain will have an unbound amino group free at one end (called the N-terminus) and a single free carboxylate group at the other end (called the C-terminus).

The peptide bond is planar, because resonance between the carbonyl group and the amino nitrogen lends the C-N bond a partial double-bond character. (It is possible to draw a resonance structure with a double bond between the carbon atom and the nitrogen atom, with a formal negative charge on the oxygen atom and a formal positive charge on the nitrogen.) This prevents rotation around the C-N bond, locking the peptide bond in the ''trans'' conformation, and holding six atoms in a plane: the &amp;alpha;-carbon of one amino acid, the carbonyl carbon and oxygen atoms, the amino nitrogen and hydrogen atoms, and the &amp;alpha-carbon of the second amino acid are all co-planar.

The structure of a peptide chain's &quot;backbone&quot; can be described uniquely by the torsion angles between adjacent peptide units. The [[w:&amp;phi;-angle|&amp;phi;-angle]] is the torsion angle between the &amp;alpha;-carbon and the carbonyl carbon of one amino acid; the [[w:&amp;psi;-angle|&amp;psi;-angle]] is the torsion angle between the amino nitrogen and the &amp;alpha;-carbon.

&lt;center&gt;[[image:amino_acids_1.png|400px|Peptide bond formation]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;center&gt;''Peptide bond formation&lt;br&gt;Two amino acids with different side chains react when the amino-terminus (red) of one joins the carboxy-terminus (blue) of another are linked by an amide bond (green). See also [[Biochemistry/Peptide Bond Formation|the mechanism of peptide bond formation]].)''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

It is important to note that the formation of this peptide bond is highly unfavorable under standard conditions. However, in the human body, there are enzymes that assist in facilitating this reaction, making peptide bond formation and proteins possible.

===Chemical classification of aminoacids===
The 20 amino acids encoded by the [[w:Wikipedia:genetic_code|genetic code]] are:&lt;br&gt;
[[image:amino_acids_2.png|600px|The 20 Genetically Encoded Amino Acids]]

They are not shown in their zwitterionic state for clarity. At physiological pH (~pH 6.8), all would be so, except proline, which is a five-membered ring. Charged side-chains are shown ionic when they exist as such at physiological pH.

=== Protein Electrophoresis===
Protein Electrophoresis is a method in which a mixture of proteins can be separated and analyzed. 
Electrophoresis is based on the mobility of ions in an electric field. The charge distribution of the molecules is critical in the separation of all electrophoresis. In an electric field, electrophoresis is a passage of charged molecules in solution. Positively charged ions have tendency toward a negative electrode and inversely, negatively charged ions have tendency toward a positive electrode. The molecular weight results to a molecular friction which is directly proportional to the molecular charge and its voltage and inversely proportional to a molecule’s mobility in an electric field. 

Gel electrophoresis is performed to analyze the molecular weights and the charge of the protein and is mostly used in electrophoresis of the protein. The gel electrophoresis is carried out in a thin piece of polyacrylamide. The crosslinked of acrylamide and N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide forms the polyacrylamide by polymerization. The size has an important effect in the movement of the protein molecule. The smaller molecules of protein would result in a faster passage of the molecules through the gel pores.

The separation of the protein molecules in the gel affects the protein activity. In this process, first the protein reduces the disruption of disulfide bonding by heating which results in purification and denaturalization. Next, the sodium dodecyl sulfate, abbreviated as SDS, (and ionic detergent) is added. SDS is an anionic detergent which dissolve hydrophobic molecules and denatures protein molecules without breaking peptide bonds. This result in the dislocation of the structure of the protein changes the secondary, tertiary and quaternary to the primary structure with negative charge. Then the protein is passed through the gel. For denatured proteins, SDS can form a steady charge mass ratio in binding with proteins.

The polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is a very sensitive method capable of a bearing a high resolution and it is analytically used in the studies in the separation techniques.

===Isoelectric point===
The [[w:Isoelectric_point|isoelectric point]] (pI) is the pH-value in which a protein is neutral, that is, has zero net charge. To be clear, it is not the pH value where a protein has all bases deprotonated and all acids protonated, but rather the value where positive and negative charges cancel out to zero.

'''Calculating pI:'''
An aminoacid with n ionizable groups with their respective pKa values pK1, pK2, ... pkn will have the pI equal to the average of the group pkas:

pI=(pK1+pK2+...+pkn)/n

Most proteins have many ionizable sidechains in addition to their amino- and carboxy- terminal groups. The pI is different for each protein and it can be theoretically calculated according [[w:Henderson-Hasselbalch equation|Henderson-Hasselbalch equation]] if we know amino acids composition of protein.

In order to experimentally determine a protein's pI 2-Dimensional Electrophoresis (2-DE) can be used. The proteins of a cell lysate are applied to a pH immobilized gradient strip, upon electrophoresis the proteins migrate to their pI within the strip. The second dimension of 2-DE is the separation of proteins by MW using a SDS-gel.
To clearly understand isoelectric point, you have to keep in mind that the positively charged groups are balanced by the negatively charged groups. For simple amino acid &quot; alanine&quot;, the isoelectric point is an average of the PKa of the carboxyl with PK1 of (2.34) and ammonium with PK2 of (9.69) groups. So, the PI for the simple amino acid &quot; alanine&quot; is calculated as:(2.34+9.69)/2 which is equal to 6.02. When additional basic or acidic groups are added as a side-chain functions, the isoelectric point pI will be the average of the pKa's of the most similar acids. Example for this concept could be aspartic acid in which the similar acids are alpha-carboxyl function with pKa of 2.1 and the side chain carboxyl function with a pKa of 3.9. Thus, the pI for aspartic acid is (2.1+3.9)/2=3.0. Another example is arginine, its similar acids are guanidinium on the side chain with pKa of 12.5 and the alpha-ammonium function with pKa of 9.0. Thus the calculated pI for arginine= (12.5+9.0)/2=10.75. pI does not has a unite.

===The peptidic bond===
Two amino acid molecules can be covalently joined through a substituted amide linkage, termed a '''peptide bond,''' to yield a dipeptide. this link is formed by dehydration (removal of the water molecules - one hydrogen atom from one amino acid and an OH group from the other). 
This process can then continue to join other amino acids and yield in an amino acid chain.
When there are few amino acids in a chain, it is called an '''oligopeptide''', when there are many it is called a '''polypeptide'''. although the terms &quot;protein&quot; and &quot;polypeptide&quot; are sometimes used to describe the same thing, the term polypeptide is generally used when the molecular weight of the chain is below 10,000.
An amino acid unit in a peptide is often called a residue.

==Disulfide bonds==
Disulfide bonds form between the sulfur atoms of two cysteine side chains in a protein. The side chains undergo a reversible oxidation of the sulfhydryl groups of the cysteine, wich results in covalent bonding of the sulfur atoms (S-S). This bonding is called a &quot;disulfide bridge&quot;. Typically, disulfides don't form on the surface of proteins because of the presence of reducing agents in the cytoplasm. These bonds are of great importance concerning the shaping of protein structure; their formation guides the folding of peptide chains as the proteins are produced. Structural proteins that have to be rigorously stable (for example, Keratin, which is found in nail, horn and crustacean shell) often contain a large number of disulfide bonds.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DisulfideBondFormation.png|400px|The reaction scheme for disulfide bond formation. Two cysteine residues undergo a two electron oxidation, relaeasing two electrons and two protons. Such reactions are typically catalyzed by flavin-enzymes.]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Post-translational modifications==
After a protein is synthesized inside the cell, it is usually modified by the addition of extra functional groups to the polypeptide chain. These can be sugar or phosphate groups and may confer to the protein special functions such as: the ability to recognize other molecules, to integrate in the plasma membrane, to catalyze biochemical reactions, and various other processes. It is in the interest of the biochemist to understand what proteins are modified, what the modification is, and where it is located. An easy way to do this is by using mass spectrometry. In a sample of protein submitted to mass spectrometry you will see both modified and unmodified protein signals. The change in mass between these signals will correspond to the change in mass of your protein due to your post-translation modification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is protein folding? ==

Protein folding is commonly a fast or very fast process, often but not always reversible, taking no more than a few milliseconds to occur. It can be viewed as a complex compromise between the different chemical interactions that can happen between the amino acid sidechains, the amidic backbone and the solvent. There are literally millions of possible three-dimensional configurations, often with minimal energetic differences between them. That's why we're still almost unable to predict the folding of a given polypeptide chain ''ab initio''.Protein folding problem is that scientist still has failed to crack the code that governs folding. Moreover, the ability of biological polymers such as protein fold into well-defined structures is remarkable thermodynamically. An unfolded polymer exists are random coils, each copy of an unfolded polymers will have different conformation, yielding a mixture of many possible conformation. 

==Folding depends only on primary structure==
In 1954 Christian Anfinsen demonstrated that the folding of a protein in a given environment depends only on its primary structure - the amino acid sequence. This conclusion was by no means obvious, given the complexity of the folding process and the paucity of biochemical knowledge at the time. The process of folding often begins co-translationally, so that the N-terminus of the protein begins to fold while the C-terminal portion of the protein is still being synthesized by the ribosome. Specialized proteins called chaperones assist in the folding of other proteins.
Meanwhile, protein folding is a thermodynamically driven process: that is, proteins fold by reaching their thermodynamically most stable structure. The path followed by the protein in the potential energy landscape is far from obvious, however. Many local and non-local interactions take part in the process, and the space of possible structures is enormous. As of today molecular dynamics simulations are giving invaluable hints on the first stages of the folding process. It is known now that the unfolded state still retains key long-range interactions and that the local propensity of the sequence to fold in a given secondary structure element narrow the &quot;search&quot; in the so-called conformational space. This seems to mean that biological proteins somehow evolved to properly fold. In fact, many random amino acid sequences only acquire ill-defined structures (molten globules) or no structure at all.

There are some general rules, however. Hydrophobic amino acids will tend to be kept inside the structure, with little or no contact with the surrounding water; conversely, polar or charged amino acids will be often exposed to solvent. Very long proteins will often fold in various distinct modules, instead of in a single large structure.

==The Ramachandran plot==

The Ramachandran plot was invented by professor G.N.Ramachandran, a very eminent scientist from India. He discovered the triple helix structure of collagen in 1954 a year after the double helix structure was put forth. In a polypeptide the main chain N-Calpha and Calpha-C bonds relatively are free to rotate. These rotations are represented by the torsion angles phi and psi, respectively.

G N Ramachandran used computer models of small polypeptides to systematically vary phi and psi with the objective of finding stable conformations. For each conformation, the structure was examined for close contacts between atoms. Atoms were treated as hard spheres with dimensions corresponding to their van der Waals radii. Therefore, phi and psi angles which cause spheres to collide correspond to sterically disallowed conformations of the polypeptide backbone

==Intramolecular forces in protein folding==
The tertiary structure is held together by hydrogen bonds, hydrophilic interactions, ionic interactions, and/or disulfide bonds.

==The protein folding problem==

The protein folding problem relates to what is known as the Levinthal paradox. Levinthal calculated that if a fairly small protein is composed of 100 amino acids and each amino acid residue has only 3 possible conformations (an underestimate) then the entire protein can fold into 3&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;-1 or 5x10&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt; possible conformations. Even if it takes only 10&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt; of a second to try each conformation it would take 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; years to try them all. Obviously a protein doesn't take that long to fold, so randomly trying out all possible conformations is not the way proteins fold. Since most proteins fold on a timescale of the order of milliseconds it is clear that the process is directed in some manner dependent on the constituents of the chain. The protein folding problem which has perplexed scientists for over thirty years is that of understanding how the tertiary structure of a protein is related to its primary structure, because it has been proven that the primary structure of a protein  holds the only information necessary for the protein to fold. Ultimately the aim is also to be able to predict what pathway the protein will take.

==Folding in extreme environments==
Most proteins are not capable of maintaining their three-dimensional shape when they are exposed to environmental extremes such as a low or high pH, or a highly variable temperature. 

Changes in the pH of the proteins environment may alter the charges on the amino acid side chains that form the whole protein, so that repulsive or attractive forces may form, altering the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein as a whole, as a result the shape of the enzyme is warped, and the now non-functional protein is said to be denatured.

A high or exceptionally low temperature can cause the constitutive bonds on the protein to be broken, again resulting in the protein being rendered non-functional.

It is important to note that certain proteins, mainly digestive enzymes such as trypsin, are capable of with-standing a pH as low as 1. If the pH of such an enzymes environment were to increase to approximately pH5, it would be inactivated.

==Protein misfolding==
The way that a protein folds is one of the most important factors influencing its properties, as this is what determines which active groups are exposed for interaction. If the protein misfolds, its properties can be markedly changed.
One example of this is in Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, such as BSE, and Scrapie. In these, the prion protein, which is involved in the brain's copper metabolism, misfolds, and starts forming plaques, which destroy brain tissue.

=Protein structural levels=
Biochemists refer to four distinct aspects of a protein's structure:

==Primary structure==
Primary structure is practically a synonym of the amino acid sequence. It can also contain informations on amino acids linked by peptide bonds.  Primary structure is typically written as a string of three letter sequences, each representing an amino acid. Peptides and proteins must have the correct sequence of amino acids.

==Secondary structure==
''Secondary structure'' elements are elementary structural patterns that are present in most,if not all,known proteins.  These are highly patterned sub-structures --alpha helix and beta sheet-- consisting of loops between elements or segments of polypeptide chain that assume no stable shape. Secondary structure elements, when mapped on the sequence and depicted in the relative position they have in respect to each other, define the ''topology'' of the protein.  It is also relevant to note that hydrogen bonding between residues is the cause for secondary structure features; secondary structure is usually described to beginning biochemists as (almost) entirely independent of residue side-chain interactions.


==Tertiary structure==
''Tertiary structure'' is the name given to refer to the overall shape of a single protein molecule.  Although tertiary structure is sometimes described (especially to beginning biology and biochemistry students) as being a result of interactions between amino acid residue side chains, a more correct understanding of tertiary structure is the interactions between elements of secondary protein structure, i.e. alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets.  Tertiary structure is often referred to as the &quot;fold structure&quot; of a protein, since it is the result of the complex three-dimensional interplay of other structural and environmental elements.

==Super-tertiary structure (protein modules)==
Some literature refers to elements of super-tertiary structure, which often refers to elements of folding that, for whatever reason, do not neatly fit into the category of tertiary structure.  Often this level of distinction is saved for graduate level coursework.
Protein denaturation can be a reversible or an irreversible process, i.e., it may be possible or impossible to make the protein regain its original spatial conformation.

==Quaternary structure==
Quaternary structure is the shape or structure that results from the union of more than one protein molecule, usually called ''subunit proteins'' ''subunits'' in this context, which function as part of the larger assembly or protein complex.
 And it refers to the regular association of two or more polypeptide chains to form a complex. A multi-subunit protein may be composed of two or more identical polypeptides, or it may include different polypeptides. 
Quaternary structure tends to be stabilized mainly by weak interactions between residues exposed on surfaces polypeptides within a complex. 

=Secondary structure elements=
==The alpha helix==
[[Image:AlphaHelixBALL.png|thumb|right|Alpha Helix]]
The alpha helix is a periodic structure formed when main-chain atoms from residues spaced four residues apart hydrogen bond with one another. This gives rise to a helical structure, which in natural proteins is always right-handed. Each turn of the helix comprises 3.6 amino acids. Alpha helices are stiff, rod-like structures which are found in many unrelated proteins. One feature of these structures is that they tend to show a bias in the distribution of hydrophobic residues such that they tend to occur primarily on one face of the helix.

The amino acids in an &amp;alpha; helix are arranged in a helical structure, about 5 Å wide. Each amino acid results in a 100° turn in the helix, and corresponds to a translation of 1.5Å along the helical axis. The helix is tightly packed; there is almost no free space within the helix. All amino acid side-chains are arranged at the outside of the helix. The N-H group of amino acid (n) can establish a hydrogen bond with the C=O group of amino acid (n+4).

Short polypeptides usually are not able to adopt the alpha helical structure, since the entropic cost associated with the folding of the polypeptide chain is too high. Some amino acids (called ''helix breakers'') like proline will disrupt the helical structure. 

Ordinarily, a helix has a buildup of positive charge at the N-terminal end and negative charge at the C-terminal end which is a destabilizing influence. As a result, &amp;alpha; helices are often capped at the N-terminal end by a negatively charged amino acid (like glutamic acid) in order to stabilize the helix dipole. Less common (and less effective) is C-terminal capping with a positively charged protein like lysine.

&amp;alpha; helices have particular significance in DNA binding motifs, including helix-turn-helix motifs, leucine zipper motifs and zinc finger motifs. This is because of the structural coincidence of the &amp;alpha; helix diameter of 12Å being the same as the width of the major groove in B-form DNA.

&amp;alpha; helices are one of the basic structural elements in proteins, together with beta sheets.

The peptide backbone of an &amp;alpha; helix has 3.6 amino acids per turn.

==The beta sheet==
[[Image:BetaPleatedSheetProtein.png|right|thumb|200px|Diagram of &amp;Beta;-Pleated sheet and bond structure of protein]]
The '''&amp;beta; sheet''' (also '''&amp;beta;-pleated sheet''') is a commonly occurring form of regular secondary structure in proteins, first proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. It consists of two or more amino acid sequences within the same protein that are arranged adjacently and in parallel, but with alternating orientation such that hydrogen bonds can form between the two strands.  The amino acid chain is almost fully extended throughout a &amp;beta; strand, lessening the probability of bulky steric clashes. The Ramachandran plot shows optimal conformation with angle phi = -120 to -60 degrees and angle psi = 120 to 160 degrees. The N-H groups in the backbone of one strand establish hydrogen bonds with the C=O groups in the backbone of the adjacent, parallel strand(s).  The cumulative effect of multiple such hydrogen bonds arranged in this way contributes to the sheet's stability and structural rigidity and integrity: for example, cellulose's beta-1,4 glucose structure. The side chains from the amino acid residues found in a &amp;beta; sheet structure may also be arranged such that many of the adjacent side chains on one side of the sheet are hydrophobic, while many of those adjacent to each other on the alternate side of the sheet are polar or charged (hydrophilic). Some sequences involved in a &amp;beta; sheet, when traced along the backbone, take a ''hairpin turn'' in orientation (direction), sometimes through one or more prolines. The &amp;alpha;-C atoms of adjacent strands stand 3.5Å apart. In addition to the parallel beta sheet, there is also the anti-parallel beta sheet. The hydrogen-bond still exists in this conformation but the main difference lies in the directionality of the protein. In this conformation the proteins run in opposite directions, but the resulting hydrogen bonds connect directly across from one another instead of the diagonal. In short, beta sheets can be purely parallel, anti-parallel, or even mixed.

==The random coil==
A protein that completely lacks secondary structure is a '''random coil'''. In random coil, the only fixed relationship between amino acids is that between adjacent residues through the peptide bond. As a result, random coil can be detected from the absence of the signals in a multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiment that depend on particular peptide-peptide interactions. Likewise in the images produced in crystallography experiments, pieces of random coil appear simply as an absence of &quot;electron density&quot; or contrast. Random coil is also easily distinguished by circular dichroism. Denaturing reduces a protein entirely to random coil.

==Less common secondary structure elements==

Certain other periodic structures rarely appear in proteins, some of which are similar to the more common types. For example, two variants of the alpha-helix also occur, the 3-10 helix and the pi helix. These have helical pitches of 3 and 4.4 residues per turn respectively, corresponding to hydrogen bonds forming between residue i and i+3 for the 3-10 helix and between i and i+5 for the pi helix. Both are usually very short (1 turn or so) and have been seen only at the ends of alpha helices.

=Tertiary structure elements=

==Alpha-only structures==
Structures that contain only Alpha Helices

==Beta-only structures==

=Common folds and modules=

==The Rossman fold==
The Rossmann fold is a protein structural motif found in proteins that bind nucleotides, especially the cofactor NAD. The structure is composed of three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the topological order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. Because each Rossmann fold can bind one nucleotide, binding domains for dinucleotides such as NAD consist of two paired Rossmann folds that each bind one nucleotide moiety of the cofactor molecule. Single Rossmann folds can bind mononucleotides such as the cofactor FMN.

The motif is named for Michael Rossmann who first pointed out that this was a frequently occurring motif in nucleotide binding proteins.

==The hemoglobin fold==

==The immunoglobulin fold==


==Keratin==
Found in hair and in the palms of human hands.

==Collagen==

      <text xml:space="preserve">There two major methods of right hand (for right handed players) techniques namely, either by using a pick (also called a plectrum) or fingers.  The plectrum is very common in rock, country and pop music, where it is considered convenient for strumming and louder guitar sound. Use of fingers is most common among classical guitarists and flamenco players, as combination of strings better executed using the right hand fingers, and generally have softer sound than the pick. Other than classical guitarists and flamenco players, use of a pick or fingers is a matter of personal preference. 


==Striking==
[[Image:Playing guitar.jpg|thumb|250px|This guitarist is using a pick and bracing his hand against the bridge. ]]
===Using a pick===
The primary advantages of the pick are its speed, its ease of striking large chords and, because the fingernails and fingertips are not involved, its preservation of player's picking hand. Furthermore, use of a pick makes a louder and brighter sound.  Its primary disadvantage is its imprecision, making muting strings necessary.  Also, if the player wishes to switch to the tapping style, he or she can tap with or with out the pick: to tap with the pick just put it on its side and tap it on the desired fret. However, tapping with a pick makes it harder to tap on multiple strings.

===Finger Strumming===
Players wishing not to use a pick may try finger ''strumming''. This is accomplished by holding the picking hand's first finger to the thumb, much as one might hold a pick, and striking the strings with the first fingernail. Another way is to do all down strokes with the thumb and all upstrokes with the index finger; like one is 'petting' the strings.

===Apoyando Strikes===
Apoyando, or splinter rested, involves the finger picking through a string such that the finger stops when resting on the next string. This technique produces a strong, loud tone, and is considered the opposite of Tirando.

===Tirando Strikes===
When performing a tirando, or shooting splinter strike, the finger does not affect the next string at all. This is the opposite of apoyando.

==Fingerpicking==
Fingerpicking is a method of playing the guitar where you use your thumb and at least one other finger to pick or pluck notes, using your fingernails, fingerpicks or fingertips. Talented players can use all five fingers on their picking hand, but many players only use four fingers and use their pinky finger as a brace on the guitar. Most classical guitarists alter the shape of their picking hand fingernails for the purpose of producing a desired sound, however this is not necessary in non-classical music; one can purchase fingerpicks to fit on the hand.

Generally fingerpicking involves picking through [[Guitar/Chords|chords]] organized in a melody. Fingerpicking is used extensively in [[Guitar/Folk Guitar|folk guitar]] and [[Guitar/Classical Guitar|classical guitar]], but it is also common in other genres.

Fingerpicking is surprisingly easy on an electric guitar, which is strange because fingerpicking is often regarded as an acoustic style. The player may hold his or her picking hand's fourth finger against the right edge (left edge on a left-handed guitar), and if it is held straight and steady, this technique may be used to brace the hand.  This technique is called anchoring, and is frowned upon by some players. It is possible on acoustic guitars by using the bridge similarly, but this is not as effective as it will deaden the sound.  Classical guitarists never anchor while playing.

When strumming with individual fingers, general rule is move the wrist only if the thumb is used, while if any other finger is used, only said finger will be used.

When you start trying to learn, your finger coordination will be terrible and it is easy to be discouraged. It takes several weeks to let your muscles develop, but if you practice using all your fingers at once your overall dexterity will increase much faster.

===Classical picking===
In classical guitar repertoire, there will be a &quot;PIMA&quot; marking for the picking hand fingers (right hand for right handed players), which indicate which finger to use:
*'''P'''ulgar, or thumb. 
*'''I'''ndice, or index finger.
*'''M'''edio, or middle finger. 
*'''A'''nular, or ring finger.
These four are the ones that are used most frequently. Sometimes, the fourth finger is used, in which it is marked either '''C''', '''X''' or '''E'''.

Typically, the thumb has a down-picking motion and the fingers have an up-picking motion.

===Clawhammer and frailing===
Clawhammer, sometimes known as frailing, is a method generally used with the five-string banjo and is characteristic of traditional Appalachian folk music of the U.S. It is primarily a down-picking style, and the hand assumes a claw-like shape and the strumming finger is kept fairly stiff, striking the strings by the motion of the hand at the wrist and elbow, rather than a flicking motion by the finger. Typically, only the thumb and second or first finger are used and the finger always downpicks, flicking the string with the back of the fingernail.

A common characteristic of clawhammer patterns is the thumb does not pick on the downbeat, as one might in typical finger-picking patterns for guitar. For example, this is a common, basic time signature|2/4 pattern:
# Pick a melody note on the downbeat (quarter note)
# On the second beat (music)|beat, strum a few strings with your strumming finger or brush with all fingers (roughly an eighth note)
# Immediately following (on the second half of this beat), pick a note with the thumb, usually the shorter fifth string. (roughly an eighth note)

Here, the thumb plays the high drone (fifth string) on the second &quot;and&quot; of &quot;one and two ''and''&quot;. This combined with the second finger strumming provides a characteristic &quot;bum-ditty bum-ditty&quot; sound.

Some people, however, make a distinction between frailing and clawhammer:
*In frailing, the first fingertip is used for up-picking melody, and the second fingernail is used for rhythmic downward brushing.
*In clawhammer, only downstrokes are used, and they are typically played with one fingernail as is the usual technique on the banjo.

===Travis Picking===
Another well known style of finger picking is called Travis picking, named after Merle Travis who was a country singer known for his legendary picking skills. When picking, you use your thumb and first finger to hit notes at the same time, creating a [[Guitar/Double-stops and Power Chords|double stop or interval]], and then continue picking with the first finger. Usually the thumb is responsible for picking the bass line, while the first/second finger is for melody. Skilled players can carry two separate melodies with the upper and lower strings.

You can create impressive rhythms playing with just your thumb and first finger, but to really become talented you must practice using more fingers. For example, Chet Atkins expanded to use all three fingers, with thumb for bass line.

:{{PDFlink|[[media:Guitar - Oh My Darling Clementine - Folkpicking.pdf|Guitar - Oh My Darling Clementine - Folkpicking]]}}

===Rasgueado===
The rasgueado or splinter striking technique originated from Spanish flamenco music, and usually refers to three or four fingers and sometimes the thumb striking the strings in quick succession. The notes quickly follow one another and produce a &quot;rattling&quot; or cascading effect.

===Scruggs style===
[[w:Scruggs style|Scruggs-style]] finger-picking is a syncopated, five-string banjo style used in [[w:Bluegrass music|bluegrass music]]. It is played with thumb, first and second fingers; the fourth and/or third fingers are typically braced against the head of the instrument. The strings are picked rapidly in repetitive sequences or rolls; the same string is not typically picked twice in succession. Melody notes are interspersed among arpeggios, and musical phrases typically contain long series of staccato notes, often played at very rapid tempos. The music is generally syncopated, and may have a subtle swing or shuffle feel, especially on mid-tempo numbers. The result is lively, rapid music, which lends itself both as an accompaniment to other instruments and as a solo.

Scruggs style picking was popularized by [[w:Earl Scruggs|Earl Scruggs]] in the early 1940's in rural North Carolina.

==Tapping==
[[Guitar/Tapping|Tapping]] is a style of playing where notes are created by quickly pressing, or tapping, the string down on the fret that you want to play. Usually tapping involves both hands, and most often it is on an electric guitar. It is possible to tap on an acoustic, but you cannot hear the notes as clearly as on an electric.

==Presentation==

With the vision reality check, you check if your vision is at all different from the norm; for example, if you have perfect vision without wearing glasses.

As well as doing this regularly, you could also do it every time you put on your glasses.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I'm in a room, and my vision is blurry because I'm not wearing glasses. I notice a sheet of paper with writing on it sitting on a table on the other side of the room. I try to read it, but it's too blurry. I look at it again and it comes into focus. A second later, I wonder how I can see it without glasses, but then realize I must be dreaming.
* My vision disagrees with my other senses. Under my bare feet I can see a white carpet and feel a smooth wood floor. I decide that what I'm seeing is a dream, what I'm feeling is real, and therefore I must be sleepwalking. (I wasn't...hmm, is this a success or a failure?)
* When I move, the scenery at the edges of my vision doesn't exactly flow by. It freezes and skips like a streaming video on a slow connection. I realize this is happening because the scenery isn't real - I'm dreaming it.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I &quot;wake up&quot; from a dream, and get out of bed, but then I notice that I can see perfectly even though I don't have my glasses on. I figure my vision must have improved from resting and forget about it.
* I was in front of my computer, with my glasses on, and everything was blurry. At first, I thought my vision had improved, so I removed my glasses, but then, I started thinking that if I could clearly see what was on the computer screen, without my glasses, that would mean I was dreaming. However, as soon as I looked at the screen, a black rectangle appeared just in front of it, and I could not see what was on the screen. I woke up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To properly understand the strings, the guitar must be in [[Guitar/Tuning the strings|tune]]. The strings should be tuned to EADGBE. That is, the thickest string should be a low E, the next an A, and so on. This is called standard tuning. [[Guitar/Alternate Tunings|Other tunings]] exist, but we should not concern ourselves with them yet.



==The fifth (standard A) and fourth (standard D) strings==
The fifth string behaves similarly to the others: each fret is a single semitone up from the previous fret. The fifth fret on the fith string is a D, which is the same note as the open fourth string. Likewise, the fifth fret on the fourth string is a G, the same as the open third string. This is the fret used to tune the string above it.

==The third string==
This string is slightly different from every other string on the guitar. The reason is the ''fourth'' fret on this string, not the fifth, has the same note as the second string.

==The second string==
The fifth fret is an E and the same as the open first string.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Harmonics are fun sounds to produce. They can be quiet and bell-like on an Acoustic or they can be loud and squeally on an overdriven Electric.

==Harmonics Introduction==
[[Image:Harmonic partials on strings.svg|thumb|left|250px|'''Harmonic series''' of a string. Playing harmonics on the guitar uses a technique that stops certain partials from sounding]]
When you strike a note on the guitar, the sound generated is not just one note but a series of notes. The ''fundamental'' (also called the first harmonic) is the loudest and lowest of the series and fainter notes which all have their own frequency of vibration, amplitude, and phase are heard as well. The frequencies are integer multiples of the lowest frequency. Looking at the diagram you will notice that the upper partials (this is the name given to any sine waves associated with a complex tone) follow a pattern 2,3,4,5,6,and 7 and these equal-sized sections resonate at increasingly higher frequencies. The guitar technique described below shows how to play harmonics by lightly touching the string directly over the fret. You are essentially cancelling out certain partials from being heard by not allowing that part of the string to vibrate. Pianists have no means of manipulating strings to produce harmonics unless they lift up the lid of the piano and lightly touch the string. Woodwind instruments can produce harmonics by the technique of ''overblowing''. It must be noted that we all tend to hear or play music as a &quot;single sensation&quot; and that the partials present are not considered or heard as separate during that experience.

===List of natural harmonics===

* '''12th fret''' - octave above open string
* '''7th or 19th fret''' - octave plus a perfect fifth above open string
* '''5th or 24th fret''' - two octaves above open string
* '''4th, 9th or 16th fret''' - two octaves plus four semitones above open string

There are more harmonics than these but these are the easiest to produce and the most audible. They are ordered from lowest to highest in pitch.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
==Natural harmonics==
Natural harmonics are the easiest to produce. A good place to begin is the 12th fret of the high e string. With your fretting hand, lightly touch a finger against the string directly above the 12th fret. Do not hold it down or apply any pressure. Then strike it with your picking hand and immediately release the string; almost simultaneously. If executed properly the result should be a high-pitched, silvery note. Try it again at the 7th and 5th frets; as shown on the Natural Harmonic fretboard diagram. Each harmonic shown on the diagram will produce a sound that is higher in pitch than its fretted note counterpart. Harmonics will sound quieter and the higher harmonics may be nearly inaudible without the overdrive of an amp.

[[File:Guitar Natural Harmonics 5th-7th-12th Frets.png|1700px]]

===Harmonic Chords===
Below are the Harmonic chords of '''Em''' and '''Bm'''. Both chords are first inversion with the third in the bass. You can play Harmonic arpeggios, add the open low E string to the Harmonic Em chord or play a melodic phrase.

[[File:Guitar Fretboard Harmonic Chords Em and Bm.png|1700px]]

Below are the Harmonic chords of '''G''' and '''D'''. Both chords are second inversion with the fifth in the bass.

[[File:Guitar Fretboard Harmonic Chords G and D.png|1700px]]

A good example of the use of natural harmonics is in the song ''Imperium'' by Machine Head. Clear 5th fret harmonics can be heard enforcing the low drop B tuning.

==Pinch harmonics==
Pinch harmonics are also known as Artificial Harmonics though there is really nothing artificial about them. This is an advanced technique and was popularized mostly by [[Wikipedia:Billy Gibbons|Billy Gibbons]] and later [[Wikipedia:Zakk Wylde|Zakk Wylde]], as well as many others as early as the 1970s including many [[Wikipedia:Heavy Metal|Heavy Metal]] artists. These harmonics follow the same principles of physics as a natural harmonic; the difference being how the harmonic is produced.  In this technique a note is struck in a downwards motion with the pick and in the same motion the string is touched (one might really say brushed) with the edge of the thumb that is holding the pick. You can also use the edge of the index fingernail followed by the pick.  

Pinch harmonics are most effective and audible using an Electric guitar with overdrive or distortion. These harmonics are virtually inaudible when using a clean (not distorted or overdriven) amp channel with the Electric guitar or when using an Acoustic.  It can sound good when correctly used even without much overdrive but it's not always clear or detectable.  Use overdrive or distortion for best results especially while learning and practicing this technique.  This technique takes practice to master. Beginners may need to spend some time on scales, soloing, blues, riffing, strumming patterns before they feel comfortable enough to attempt this technique. It is mostly used in soloing and intense expressive riffing.  

As mentioned above, these harmonics are produced by striking a note with the pick and touching the string with the picking thumb.  Grip the pick so that the tip barely peeks out between your fingertips (this is why they are called &quot;pinch&quot; harmonics).  It's easier when you are fretting a note with the left hand. Try fretting the 5th fret of the D string and plucking the string just below the neck pick-up pole pieces (maybe 1/8&quot; toward the bridge from the pole pieces). The position of the plucking along the length of the string is one of the most important parts of this technique.  While with regular picking the position of the picking along the string can make slight variations in the sound of the note, when executing pinch harmonics the right position is vital and tiny positional differences can make entirely different harmonics.  So try adjusting the picking hand just millimeters up and down the string around the area of the pick-ups.  

Try imagining the pick and your picking thumb plucking the string at the same time although the thumb is really just brushing past it.  Consider it to be really one motion.  Try thinking of your thumb and the pick as one entity and instead of picking straight down, pick down and a little bit (millimeters) out away from the face of the guitar so your picking motion is a sort of 'letter J' out from the face of the guitar and so the thumb brushes past the string and remember that the thumb should only touch the string for an instant just like the pick does.

Try executing pinch harmonics while fretting different notes and by striking the string in slightly different places all around the pickup area of the guitar.  Many kinds of harmonic ringing sounds may be produced.

Without a pick, this technique may be simulated by plucking the string with the fingertip and lightly touching it with the fingernail. Classical guitarists use this technique and it is also found in jazz finger-style guitar. 

These harmonics, as opposed to natural harmonics, end up being much more practical to use while playing and when mastered can be used boldly like Zakk Wylde making the harmonic part of the riff, or subtly and possibly unintentionally to add color and character to the notes or chords while playing almost anything.

Pinch harmonics can easily and effectively be combined with other techniques, such as [[../Bending and Vibrato|bending or vibrato]].  

To hear pinch harmonics in action check out the following:
* Ozzy Osbourne's ''Ozzmosis'' (and several other albums) features many different examples of pinched harmonics in various solos.
* In the movie ''Rock Star'' at the beginning, the lead guitarist (Nick Catanese of Black Label Society/SPEED X) in Blood Pollution (the Steel Dragon cover band) is &quot;not hitting the squeal&quot;. The squeal they're speaking of is a pinch harmonic.
* One of the best examples of a bend and a pinch harmonic is Judas Priest's ''Lochness'' off the album ''Angel of Retribution'' at about 1:10.
* In System of a Down's hit song ''BYOB'' it is the first bend in the chorus (''Every bodys going to the party'') part. It is the only PH in the song, so listen carefully

Don't despair if you can't get harmonics as clear as Judas Priest or Zakk Wylde, they've got equipment made just for making sounds like that.  They both have expensive high gain amplifiers and their guitars are equipped with pickups that are naturally very good at pinch harmonics.  Some pickups amplify pinch harmonics better than others (some pickups hardly amplify them at all).  Judas Priest and Zakk Wylde both play guitars with EMG humbuckers, which are some of the hottest pickups and some of the best at amplifying pinch harmonics.  Hot pickups (EMG, Duncan JB, Duncan Live Wire, Bill Lawrence 500XL) do an excellent job of picking up pinch harmonics.  Once you've practiced at home, ask to try out a guitar with &quot;hot pickups&quot; and a &quot;high gain&quot; amplifier at the local guitar shop if you want a taste(warning: it's easy to get spoiled/hooked!).

==Tapped harmonics==
This technique, like tapping itself, was popularized by [[Wikipedia:Eddie van Halen|Eddie van Halen]]. Tapped harmonics are an extension of the [[../Tapping|tapping]] technique. The note is fretted as usual, but instead of striking the string, the string is tapped at one of the frets listed in the natural harmonic list. Do not hold the string down with the tapping hand, just bounce the finger lightly on and off the fret. This technique can be extended by fretting a note, then tapping relative to the fretted note. For instance, hold the third fret, and tap the fifteenth fret, for the twelfth fret harmonic, because 12+3=15.

==Other techniques==
A final technique (known as the harp harmonic) is a sort of combination between the natural and tapped harmonic techniques. Fret the note normally, and place the picking hand index finger on a natural harmonic relative to the fretted note (just as in tapped harmonics). Pluck the string with another finger and release the index finger, just as if producing a natural harmonic.

[[en:Mutual funds|Mutual funds]] come in a variety of different types. Fund managers select and group [[en:managed fund|managed fund]]s by industry sector (technology, international growth, etc.) as well as by risk level. A manager will buy and sell stocks within the area with the aim of getting the highest [[en:return on investment|return on investment]]. 

Mutual funds with potentially higher returns tend to be riskier, so an investor who needs to have his money back into his hands in three years will choose a less volatile fund so as not to risk losing the original investment. However, a person who is more prepared to lose money sometimes will likely gravitate towards the higher-return funds which will over the long term generate higher returns.

== Index funds ==
An [[en:index fund|index fund]] is a mutual fund that holds a portfolio that seeks to match the performance of an index, for example the [[en:S&amp;P 500|S&amp;P 500]]. These funds have lower management costs than actively managed funds and therefore often outperform managed funds.

== Exchange traded Funds ==
ETF's are simply Index funds which can be traded like stocks.  They have the same advantages as the index fund with it's low management fees.  They are superior to index funds because trades can be placed at the same speed of a stock, versus the fund which cannot be purchased until the following morning.

We need to categorize this list better. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 00:53, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)~

:Agreed.  Additionally, it seems that this isn't a guide to the commands, so much as the output of appropos and a benign example.  Most entries don't include any switches.  Ironically, some of the few that do are typically invoked without switches.  As it stands this seems to be a general overview of essential unix commands for new users, but it is not very effective.  Granted it does list several commands which the new user might not be aware, but they would have to read the man page to fully understand the command and its usage.

:--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 09:04, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Crucial Commands Missing? ==

... Perhaps someone should glance at

* ''UNIX Tutorial for Beginners'' by M.Stonebank http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/
* ''Unix Reference Guide'' http://webmonkey.wired.com/webmonkey/reference/unix_guide/

to make sure we haven't left out something crucial ...

chmod needs to be someplace--[[User:Wikiczar|Wikiczar]] 22:39, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

:I recently added chmod and chown to [[Guide to UNIX commands: File system utilities]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:35, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

== Proposed Restructuring ==
I propose renaming all of the [[Guide to UNIX commands]] pages to use the same slash syntax as pages that I recently added to [[Guide to UNIX]]. For example, [[Guide to UNIX commands: System Information]] would be renamed [[Guide to UNIX/Commands/System Information]]. I believe that this causes the wiki software to generate links up to [[Guide to UNIX]] and [[Guide to UNIX/Commands]] on each page. [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] and [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] both suggest that the ''slash convention'' (or alternatively, the ''colon convention'' like &lt;s&gt;[[Guide to UNIX:Commands:System Introduction]]&lt;/s&gt;) be superior to the current colon-space system. [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:40, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

:Before you do that I suggest considering whether we want each command to have its own chapter (e.g. [[Guide to UNIX/Commands/ls]]). [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 11:37, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
That would make them easier to link to. If we do that, then I want that the pages are significantly different from the ones at Wikipedia (like [[w:ls]]). I will try making an example page, but I have not time now, so I will post when it is ready. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:20, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

[[User:Kernigh/chmod]] Example page (compare with [[w:chmod]]). I am not sure whether to split the current chapters (suggested by Uncle G) or keep the current chapters. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:49, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

Also in the page names I want to capitalize the names. Getting Help and System Information are already capitalized, but I would move File system utilities to File System Utilities for example. (Unix command names like &quot;ls&quot; cannot be capitalized.) Also, the colon convention example is [[Guide to UNIX:Commands:System Information]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:35, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

:I personally prefer sentence case to title case. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 11:37, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

Most textbooks use title case, but GNU coreutils manual uses sentence case... --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:51, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

===Categories from GNU Coreutils===
&lt;s&gt;The GNU coreutils manual at http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_chapter/coreutils_toc.html contains 23 categories of commands. We have 15 categories in a different scheme. If [[Guide to UNIX commands]] changed to GNU's categorisation, we could merge material from their manual into ours, following the [[GFDL]]. (Our manual might not document all of the obscure options that GNU coreutils has.) (We would need a few extra cetegories, because some commands are not part of coreutils, and probably not all of them fit into the 23 categories.) This leaves five options for ''renaming the guide to slash convention'':&lt;/s&gt;
*Keep 1 page per category, and keep 15 current category pages
*&lt;s&gt;Keep 1 page per category, and switch to 23 GNU coreutils category pages&lt;/s&gt;
*Split the pages to 1 page per command, and keep 15 current categories
*&lt;s&gt;Split the pages to 1 page per command, and switch to 23 GNU coreutils categories&lt;/s&gt;
*Split the pages to 1 page per command, and have no categories
--[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:51, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

I would need to modify material I took from GNU coreutils, yet still credit them, so I've dropped it as an option. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:18, 21 October 2005 (UTC)
Advard

===Death of a Template===
I am moving it all to slash convention and uppercase titles now. It seems that [[Template:Guide to UNIX commandsTOC]] is leaving. I will insert it below to prevent is complete departure.

{{Guide to UNIX commandsTOC}}

--[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:10, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

== if ==

Why there's no explanation of the '''if''' command, and its &quot;scary&quot; '''test''' options? [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 12:11, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

== merge ==

Pretty much all the commands at [[Linux Guide/Linux commands]] are standard commands on any Unix-like system.
Rather than maintain 2 copies of that information,
I suggest we merge [[Linux Guide/Linux commands]] into [[Guide to Unix/Commands]], leaving behind any Linux-specific commands and a link to &quot;Guide to Unix/Commands&quot;.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 16:50, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

: This sounds reasonable, but we need to be careful as there is GNU, *BSD and other &quot;Unices&quot;, some of who are, or claim to be, POSIX compliant.  I don't know if it is essential to list only POSIX-compliant commands, or simply those that work on the most widely used Unix systems.  In principle, I welcome the merge.  If such a merge will occur I am planning to test the commands under OpenBSD, and change them if necessary (in that case I'll also test the updated commands on a GNU/Linux system).

{{wikipedia|Linux}}
'''Linux&amp;reg;''' is an [[wikipedia:open source|open source]], [[wikipedia:Unix|Unix]]&amp;reg;-like kernel and operating system. The author of the kernel itself is [[wikipedia:Linus Torvalds|Linus Torvalds]], plus a loosely-knit team of programmers who enhance it in a collaborative effort over the Internet. This page provides a brief overview of the main features of the Linux kernel and system, especially in comparison to other Unix-like systems. There are several other Wikibooks about Linux with more information.

===General Introduction===
[[Image:Tux.svg|thumb|200px|After [[wikipedia:Linus Torvalds|Linus Torvalds]] suggested a penguin, [[wikipedia:Larry Ewing|Larry Ewing]] (lewing@isc.tamu.edu) used [[wikipedia:GIMP|The GIMP]] to draw this popular image of [[wikipedia:Tux|Tux]], the Linux mascot. Tux is now also the hero of some Linux games. In [[Guide to UNIX]], &quot;tux&quot; has an account on the example machines.]]
*''Distributions:'' The Linux system that you actually obtain, install, and run, is one of the many available [[wikipedia:Linux distribution|Linux distribution]]s. A Linux distribution (or 'distro' for short) is a bundle of the Linux kernel and applications and a suite of programs for installing and maintaining a Linux system.
** There is much variation between distributions concerning the available packages, the installation procedure, the preferred desktop environment, and even the Linux kernel configuration. Some distributions have different target audiences: these might be home users, enterprise users, [[wikipedia:free software|free software]] supporters, hobbyists, or users of certain applications.
** Typically, distributions are in CD or DVD form. One can download them as a raw disc image in ISO format and burn it. One can also inexpensively purchase a Linux distro as a retail package. Live CDs or DVDs allow users to boot from a disc and run Linux using a [[wikipedia:RAM disk|RAM disk]] rather than a [[wikipedia:Hard disk drive|hard disk]].
** [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]] has a [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/Linux|comparison of Linux systems]].
** Wikipedia has a [[wikipedia:List of Linux distributions|list of Linux distributions]].
*''Packages:'' A complete [[wikipedia:GNU/Linux naming controversy|GNU/Linux]] operating system uses many free software (open source) packages from the [[wikipedia:BSD|BSD]], [[wikipedia:X11|X11]], [[wikipedia:GNU|GNU]], and other projects. There are also non-free packages without source code, or requiring one to buy licenses. Each distro decides which packages to provide.
*''Mascot:'' The official mascot of Linux is [[wikipedia:Tux|Tux]], the Linux penguin.

===Unix Core===
==== Kernel ====
*''Copyright license:'' The Linux kernel and its source code are released under the [[wikipedia:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]]. Many of the userland packages also use this license. If you modify Linux or another package using this license, you can redistribute your modified version, but you must use the same license, which means you must provide source code. Every Linux vendor provides Linux source code.
*''Separate development:'' The Linux kernel is developed and maintained separately from userland.
** With most other Unix-like systems, the kernel is maintained at least with the basic set of utilities, which would include the shell, shell utilities, C compiler, C library, system configuration utilities, and system boot scripts.
** Linus Torvalds and his team can worry about the kernel (and userland programs which query and configure the kernel) and let other teams develop the userland system separately.
** Both kernel and userland maintain extra compatibility so that one can update only the kernel, or only some userland package like the C library. In general, the Linux distro vendors take care of making updates install correctly.
*''Customizable kernel:'' Linux is probably the most customizable Unix-like kernel. There are even several ways to edit the kernel configuration before building the kernel.
**Most builds of Linux use modules aggressively (though use of modules is optional). Modules allow pieces of the monolithic kernel, such as device drivers and network protocol implementations, to reside in separate files, load on demand, and unload when not used.
**Many systems have multiple versions of Linux headers installed, in &lt;tt&gt;/usr/include/linux-''version''&lt;/tt&gt;. Both the Linux kernel and some userland software, such as the C library, need these. On non-Linux systems, &lt;tt&gt;/usr/include/sys&lt;/tt&gt; would sometimes have files used shared by the kernel and userland.
*''Special filesystems:'' Linux has some special filesystems which are not used for normal files.
** &lt;tt&gt;/proc&lt;/tt&gt; holds information about running processes. Other Unix-like systems sometimes provide /proc, but it is not as important as with Linux. Programs that use /proc often have trouble with ports to non-Linux systems.
** &lt;tt&gt;/sys&lt;/tt&gt; holds other information about the running kernel.
** &lt;tt&gt;/dev&lt;/tt&gt; is often a dynamic filesystem where device nodes appear and disappear dynamically, when modules load or unload or when devices are connected or disconnected. However, you can also just have &lt;tt&gt;/dev&lt;/tt&gt; contain static device nodes like on other Unix-like systems.

==== Userland ====
*''GNU project:'' The [[wikipedia:GNU|GNU]] (GNU's Not Unix) project created the shell, core commands, C compiler and build tools for a Unix-like system. However, their kernel, [[wikipedia:Hurd|Hurd]], never worked well, and thus GNU encourages users to use Linux kernel.
** Nearly every Linux distribution uses these programs, which makes them &quot;GNU slash Linux&quot; distributions. But with the exception of the GNU C library and core commands, many GNU tools and applications are also found on other Unix-like systems. In fact, *BSD and Mac OS X, like Linux, depend on the GNU C compiler, assembler, and linker.
** The GNU project always insists on providing their packages as free software, using licenses like the GNU General Public License.
** The GNU project also has a connection to the desktop environment called GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment).
*''/lib:'' The directory &lt;tt&gt;/lib&lt;/tt&gt; exists on Linux and holds libraries needed by &lt;tt&gt;/bin&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/sbin&lt;/tt&gt; because &lt;tt&gt;/usr&lt;/tt&gt; might not be mounted.
*''/usr:'' Stuff provided by your Linux distro often becomes installed in &lt;tt&gt;/usr&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local&lt;/tt&gt;. This frees &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local&lt;/tt&gt; for packages which your Linux distro does not provide.
*''Text editors:'' Most distros provide the traditional Unix editors &quot;vi&quot; and &quot;emacs&quot;, but some install ''neither'' by default. Even &quot;ed&quot; could be missing. Traditional Unix skills for text editing are not necessary when GNU &quot;nano&quot; is the installed non-X11 editor.
*''Package management:'' Most distros provide a package management system such as &quot;apt&quot; (Advanced Package Tool), &quot;rpm&quot; (Red Hat Package Manager), or Portage. These automate the installation and upgrade of packages. Both application packages and base system packages use this system. The package manager is often the biggest difference between distros.
*''Graphical user interface:'' Many of the popular Linux distros now boot the user straight into a desktop environment (GNOME or KDE, both based on X11 window system) immediately after installation. This is in contrast to some Linux distros and most *BSD distros which drop you at a root shell prompt, and expect you to use the root shell prompt to install X11, GNOME or KDE if you want it.
*''Source distros:'' Some Linux distros, such as Gentoo, emphasise building from source. Though every Linux distro with a compiler gives one the opportunity to rebuild the Linux kernel and other packages from source, these source distros provide scripts that not only automate the process, but help the system administrator make customisations and optimisations.

----

A bond is a debt: the issuer of a bond (a company, government, or other entity) borrows money from the purchaser of a bond (bond holder). Until the bond matures (the debt becomes due), the issuer will make periodic [[interest]] payments to the bond holder. On the maturity date of the bond, the issuer pays back the principal (the amount borrowed) to the bond holder, and possibly also makes a final interest payment.

From the point of view of the issuer, bonds may be an attractive alternative to borrowing from a bank (perhaps to avoid restrictive loan terms or to obtain a better interest rate), or to issuing stock (which would dilute the equity or ownership stake of the current owners of a company). From the point of view of the bond holder, bonds may be attractive relative to other investment alternatives, perhaps paying better interest rates than bank deposits or being more certain of retaining their value than stocks. With some exceptions, bonds are freely traded, so that the bond holders are not locked into their investments. (All of these advantages are possibilities and not certainties, as discussed below.)

As an illustration, suppose a company wants to build a factory which will cost US $1,000,000. The company may issue a bond to cover this amount. The bond could either be backed by the factory, or could be a debenture, which is only a call on the future income of the company. The face value of the bond would be $1,000,000, which typically would be sold in increments of $1,000. (The face value of the bond is distinct from the current price in the marketplace, which might be more or less than the face value.) The bond might pay an interest rate of 5% (also known as having a 5% coupon), typically in semiannual payments of 2.5% each, and could have a maturity of up to 30 years. For example, assuming the 5% and 30 year figures above, the bond typically would make 60 payments of $25 per $1000 of face value, with a final repayment of the principal coinciding with the last interest payment.

The purchase price of a bond is often not the price found on the bond itself, but can vary based on the interest rate of the bond, as well as the accrued interest on the bond. An increase in interest rates results in lower bond prices, and a decrease in interest rates results in higher bond prices (this is known as a loss or premium over the face value of the bond).</text>

'''Space Age Tech'''

==Fuel Cell==

The first fuel cell was developed in the 19th century by British scientist Sir William Grove.  A sketch was published in [[1843]].  But fuel cells did not see practical application until the [[1960s]], where they were used in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks). Extremely expensive materials were used and the fuel cells required very pure hydrogen and oxygen.  Early fuel cells tended to require inconveniently high operating temperatures that were a problem in many applications.

Further technological advances in the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], like the use of Nafion as the electrolyte, and reductions in the quantity of expensive platinum catalyst required, have made the prospect of fuel cells in consumer applications such as automobiles more realistic.

[[Ballard Power Systems]] is a major manufacturer of fuel cells and leads the world in [[automobile|automotive]] fuel cell technology. [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[DaimlerChrysler]] are major [[investor]]s in Ballard. As of [[2003]], the only major automobile companies pursuing internal development of fuel cells for automotive use are [[General Motors]] and [[Toyota]]; most others are customers of Ballard.

[[United Technologies]] ([[UTX]]) is a major manufacturer of large, stationary fuel cells used as [[co-generation]] power plants in [[hospital]]s and large [[office building]]s.  The company has also developed bus fleets that are powered by fuel cells.

'''Electricity and Magnetism: 1600-1875'''
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electromagnetism_and_classical_optics]

==Luigi Galvani==
Luigi Galvani (September 9, 1737 - December 4, 1798) was an Italian physician and physicist who lived and died in Bologna.

Dissecting a frog at a table where he had been conducting experiments with static electricity, Galvani touched an exposed sciatic nerve of the frog with his metal scalpel, which had picked up a charge. At that moment, he saw the dead frog's leg kick as if in life. The observation made Galvani the first investigator to appreciate the relationship between electricity and animation--or life. He is typically credited with the discovery of biological electricity.

Galvani coined the term animal electricity to describe whatever it was that activated the muscles of his specimens. Along with contemporaries, he regarded their activation as being generated by an electrical fluid that is carried to the muscles by the nerves. The phenomenon was dubbed &quot;galvanism,&quot; after Galvani, on the suggestion of his peer and sometime intellectual adversary Alessandro Volta.

Galvani's investigations led shortly to the invention of an early battery, but not by Galvani, who did not perceive electricity as separable from biology. Galvani saw electricity instead as the essence or the stuff itself of life, which he regarded vitalistically. Thus it was Volta who built the first battery, which became known therefore as a voltaic pile. While, as Galvani believed, all life is indeed electrical--in that all living things are made of cells and every cell has a cell potential--biological electricity has the same chemical underpinnings as the flow of current between electrochemical cells, and thus can be recapitulated in a way outside the body. Volta's intuition was correct as well.

Galvani's name also survives in the Galvanic cell, the galvanometer and &quot;galvanize&quot;. 

==Alessandro Volta==

Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta (February 18, 1745 - March 5, 1827) was an Italian physicist known especially for the development of the electric battery. Late in life, he received the title of Count.

De vi attractiva ...
Volta was born and educated in Como, Italy, where he became professor of physics at the Royal School in 1774.

His passion had always been the study of electricity, and still a young student he had even written a poem in Latin on this fascinating new discovery.De vi attractiva ignis electrici ac phaenomenis inde pendentibus is his first scientific paper. In 1775 he devised the electrophorus, a device that produced a static electric charge. In 1776-77 he studied the chemistry of gases, discovered methane, and devised experiments such as the ignition of gases by an electric spark in a closed vessel.

In 1779 he became professor of physics at the University of Pavia, a chair he occupied for 25 years. In 1794 Volta married Teresa Peregrini, daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini; the couple had three sons.

In 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Luigi Galvani, he developed the so-called voltaic pile, a forerunner of the electric battery, which produced a steady electric current. Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was zinc and silver. Initially he experimented with individual cells in series, each cell being a wine goblet filled with brine into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped. The electric pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine. (The number of cells, and thus the voltage it could produce, was limited by the pressure, exerted by the upper cells, that would squeeze all of the brine out of the cardboard of the bottom cell.)

Templo Voltiano

In honor of his work in the field of electricity, Napoleon made him a count in 1810; in 1815 the Emperor of Austria named him a professor of philosophy at Padua.

Volta is buried in the city of Como in Italy; the Templo Voltiano near Lake Como is a museum devoted to explaining his work; his original instruments and papers are on display there. The building appeared, along with his portrait, on Italian currency before the introduction of the Euro.

An electrophorus is a simple plate capacitor used to collect static charge produced as a result of friction, devised in 18th century by Johannes Wilcke and Alessandro Volta.

The electrophorus consists of a dielectric plate on a metal surface and a metal plate with an insulating handle. First, the dielectric plate is triboelectrically charged, that is, by friction. Then, the metal plate is placed onto the dielectric plate. The metal plate charges by induction - the side facing the charged dielectric plate charges opposite to the charge of plate, while the side facing away from the dielectric charge attains the same sign of charge as the dielectric plate, thus making the metal plate electrically neutral as a whole. Then, the side facing away from the dielectric plate is momentarily grounded. Finally, the metal plate, now consisting only one sign of charge, is lifted. 

The Voltaic Pile was invented by Alessandro Volta in 1800. He demonstrated that when certain metals and chemicals come into contact with each other they can produce an electrical current. He placed together several pairs of copper and zinc discs separated by paper soaked in salt water, and an electrical current was produced. This was the first chemical battery.

For his contributions to the study of electricity, the SI unit called the volt was named after Volta. 

In 1881 an important electrical unit was named the volt was named in his honor. 

==Heinrich Hertz==

Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (February 22, 1857 - January 1, 1894), was the German physicist for whom the hertz, the SI unit of frequency, is named. In 1888, he was the first to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic radiation by building apparatus to produce radio waves.

Hertz was born in Hamburg, Germany, to a Jewish family that had converted to Christianity. His father was an advocate in Hamburg, his mother the daughter of a doctor. While at school, he showed an aptitude for sciences as well as languages, learning Arabic and Sanskrit. He studied sciences and engineering in the German cities of Dresden, Munich and Berlin. He was a student of Gustav R. Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz. He obtained his PhD in 1880, and remained a pupil of Helmholtz until 1883 when he took a post as a lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Kiel. In 1885 he became a full professor at the University of Karlsruhe where he discovered electromagnetic waves.

Following Michelson's 1881 experiment (precursor to the 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment) which disproved the existence of Luminiferous aether he reformulated Maxwell's equations, to take the new discovery into account. Through experimentation, he proved that electric signals can travel through open air, as had been predicted by James Clerk Maxwell and Michael Faraday, and which is the basis for the invention of radio. He also discovered the photoelectric effect (which was later explained by Albert Einstein) when he noticed that a charged object loses its charge more readily when illuminated by ultraviolet light.

He died in Bonn, Germany.

His nephew Gustav Ludwig Hertz was a Nobel Prize winner, and Gustav's son Carl Hellmuth Hertz invented medical ultrasonography.

==EM waves==
The existence of electromagnetic waves, i.e. microwaves, was predicted by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864 from his famous Maxwell's equations. In 1888, Heinrich Hertz was the first to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves by building apparatus to produce radio waves.

==spectrum==
It was Sir Isaac Newton in 1666 who first used the word spectrum to refer to the celebrated Phenomenon of Colours which can be extracted from sunlight, by a glass prism.

==Infared==
History In 1800 the English astronomer William Herschel held a mercury thermometer in the spectrum produced by a glass prism to measure the heat content of different coloured lights. He found that the thermometer registered an increase in temperature even when held beyond the red end of the spectrum, where there was no visible light. This was the first experiment to show that heat could be transmitted by an invisible form of light.

'''Early days: &lt; 1600'''



==Egyptian Capacitor==

==Baghdad Battery==

The Baghdad Battery is an artifact from between 250 BC and 250, discovered near Baghdad, with a structure similar to that of a modern battery. It also appears that similar batteries can be located around ancient Egypt, where objects with traces of precious metal electroplating have been discovered at different locations.

In 1938, the German archaeologist Wilhelm Konig reportedly excavated the five-inch (13-cm)-long clay jar in Khujut Rabu, near Baghdad, Iraq (though some reports say it was found in the collections of the National Museum of Iraq). The jar contained a copper cylinder, in turn covering and protecting an iron rod, isolated from the copper by asphalt. The artifact had been exposed to the weather and had suffered corrosion.

Konig published paper reporting the mechanism's resemblance to a battery in 1940. Upon publication, Konig's discovery was discounted by the scientific community and soon disregarded. Such ancient knowledge in the history of electricity bears no known continuous relationship to the development of modern batteries. Its form, though, is nearly identical to the principles that are in use today. After the Second World War, Willard Gray demonstrated current production by a reconstruction of the inferred battery design when filled with substances, like grape juice. Subsequent tests found acidic residues in the original, analysed as an electrolytic solution, perhaps vinegar or wine.

Some people regard the Baghdad Battery as an anachronism (appearing to be out of place in time), because of the belief that ancient civilizations did not have electrical power and therefore would not have had a device that operated on the principles of electric power. The practical uses of this battery are uncertain. Some contemporary researchers have renewed interest in interpreting this artifact, and suggested electroplating precious metals as a practical use for early batteries by Baghdad Parthians (who used it to electroplate metallic items; e.g. put a thin layer of gold over an object made out of some other metal). Artifacts from ancient Egyptian sites, similarly resembling batteries, or bearing traces consistent with precious-metal electroplating, may support that.

==Ark of the Covenant==

Speculations that the Ark of the Covenant may have operated as an electrical capacitor are common amongst some electrical engineers (Nikola Tesla being the earliest); they say that the design of it allowed it to store electric charge, and thus could facilitate an electric discharge between the cherubs. The theory suggests that it resembles a capacitor (of radiant energy) in its construction. The biblical accounts of individuals sudden deaths from touching the Ark could correspond to death by a lethal high voltage charge. Louis Ginzberg’s &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot; has ancient oral traditions referring to &quot;sparks&quot; from the cherubim. These &quot;fiery jets&quot; occasionally burned and destroyed close objects. Other biblical accounts could correspond with exposure to some high frequency electromagnetic fields. Jewish legend has occasional records of a &quot;cloud&quot; between the cherubim. The Ark was considered dangerous at these times and Moses would not approach it.

Tesla, in the article &quot;A fairy tale of electricity&quot; (published September 9, 1915), stated in regards to the Ark:

: &quot;''The records, though scanty, are of a nature to fill us with conviction that a few initiated, at least, had a deeper knowledge of amber phenomena. To mention one, Moses was undoubtedly a practical and skillful electrician far in advance of his time. The Bible describes precisely, and minutely, arrangements constituting a machine in which electricity was generated by friction of air against silk curtains, and stored in a box constructed like a condenser. It is very plausible to assume that the sons of Aaron were killed by a high-tension discharge, and that the vestal fires of the Romans were electrical''.&quot; [2] 

Archaeological discoveries of the last century (which include the Baghdad Battery among others), indicate that a working knowledge of energy devices might have been present in ancient Middle Eastern cultures, and therefore it might not have been beyond Moses' specialized training in the house of Pharaoh (Exodus 2:10).

It is known that the acacia wood acts as an insulator, while the gold (the purest available at that time) is known as a good conductor. An electric charge could have accumulated from constant exposure to static electricity in the Middle East climate (among other possible sources). The Ark's upper surface has a rim of gold (a single coil of angels figures). Over the ark, the cherubs could form a spark gap, producing a dynamic radiance that would inspire awe in the observer, and act as a lightning source to kill anyone that touched it.—Num. 7:9; 10:21; 4:5,19, 20; 1 Kings 8:3, 6; Lev. 16:2; Num. 7:89; 2 Sam. 6:6, 7.

Around 1999, author Richard Andrews built a model of the ark. He claims that when tested, it demonstrated that it would act as an electromagnetic accumulator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hammer-ons and pull-offs are two closely related techniques. They are used to play ''legato'', that is, in a smooth manner, and are also used to help the guitarist to play faster. They are most commonly used in electric guitar work, but can be used in acoustic tunes as embellishments.

==The hammer-on==
[[Image:Hammer on.gif|left]]
Hammer-ons can be done anywhere on the fretboard, but for the beginner it is easiest using an open string. To quickly learn, strike an open E on the first string. While the note is still ringing, quickly and firmly press a finger on the third fret. If done properly, a G note should be sounding.

Quickly pressing your finger down and raising the note without hitting the string again is called &quot;hammering on&quot;. Without electric amplification, the hammer-on tends to be quieter than regularly struck notes, especially if you haven't practiced it! Because the strings are closer to the fretboard, hammer-ons are easier to execute on an electric guitar. However, this doesn't make them less common on an acoustic guitar, where they are used frequently to embellish [[Guitar/Open Chords|open chords]]

The hammer-on can just as easily be played with fretted notes: just play the note normally and hammer onto another (higher-numbered) fret on the same string. If you practice hammer-ons, eventually you will be able to move each finger smoothly and independently.

==The pull-off==
[[Image:Pull off.gif|right]]
The pull-off is the opposite of the hammer-on. Again, using the E string, hold it at the third fret. Strike the string and while the note is still ringing, release the fretting finger. If done properly, the G should be followed by an open E. If the note doesn't ring out properly, try hitting the G harder and releasing faster.

Like the hammer-on, the second note tends to be less loud than the first. To help alleviate this, a slight sideways motion of the fretting finger while pulling off will add extra vibration to the string, and give you some extra volume. Often it is hard for a beginner to accomplish, and the sideways movement helps greatly.


A pull-off looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
D|---7p5--5p4--4p2--2p0--|
&lt;/pre&gt;

==The trill==
A trill is two alternating notes, such as an A and A#. Only the first note is struck; the rest are rapidly hammered-on and pulled off

'''Frequency Spectrum'''

==Beam power==
Microwaves can be used to transmit power over long distances, 

and post-World War II research was done to examine possibilities. NASA worked in the 1970s and early 1980s to research the possibilities of using Solar Power Satellite (SPS) systems with large solar arrays that would beam power down to the Earth's survace via microwaves.

==Van allen radiation belt==
The presence of a radiation belt had been theorized prior to the [[Space Age]] and the belt's presence was confirmed by the [[Explorer I]] on [[January 31]], [[1958]] and [[Explorer III]] missions, under Doctor [[James van Allen]]. The trapped radiation was first mapped out by [[Explorer IV]] and [[Pioneer III]].

==FM==

New technology was added to FM radio in the early 1960s to allow FM stereo transmissions, where the frequency modulated radio signal is used to carry stereophonic sound, using the pilot-tone multiplex system.

==UHF==
On December 29, 1949 KC2XAK of Bridgeport, Connecticut became the first UHF television station to operate on a regular daily schedule.

In Britain, UHF television began with the launch of BBC TWO in 1964. BBC ONE and ITV soon followed, and colour was introduced on UHF only in 1967 - 1969. Today all British terrestrial television channels (both analog and digital) are on UHF.

==FCC==
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, created, directed, and empowered by Congressional statute.

The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 as the successor to the Federal Radio Commission and is charged with regulating all non-Federal Government use of the radio spectrum (including radio and television broadcasting), and all interstate telecommunications (wire, satellite and cable) as well as all international communications that originate or terminate in the United States. The FCC took over wire communication regulation from the Interstate Commerce Commission. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. possessions.

Organization
The FCC is directed by five Commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for 5-year terms, except when filling an unexpired term. The President designates one of the Commissioners to serve as Chairperson. Only three Commissioners may be members of the same political party. None of them can have a financial interest in any Commission-related business.

As the chief executive officer of the Commission, the Chairman delegates management and administrative responsibility to the Managing Director. The Commissioners supervise all FCC activities, delegating responsibilities to staff units and Bureaus. The current FCC Chairman is Michael Powell, son of Secretary of State Colin Powell. The other four current Commissioners are Kathleen Abernathy, Michael Copps, Kevin Martin, and Jonathon Adelstein.

History
Report on Chain Broadcasting
In 1940 the Federal Communications Commission issued the &quot;Report on Chain Broadcasting.&quot; The major point in the report was the breakup of NBC (See American Broadcasting Company), but there were two other important points. One was network option time, the culprit here being CBS. The report limited the amount of time during the day, and what times the networks may broadcast. Previously a network could demand any time it wanted from an affiliate. The second concerned artist bureaus. The networks served as both agents and employees of artists, which was a conflict of interest the report rectified.

Allocation of television stations
The Federal Communications Commission assigned television the Very High Frequency, VHF, band and gave TV channels 1-13. The 13 channels could only accommodate 400 stations nationwide and could not accommodate color in its state of technology in the early 1940s. So in 1944 CBS proposed to convert all of television to the Ultra High Frequency band, UHF, which would have solved the frequency and color problem. There was only one flaw in the CBS proposal, everyone else disagreed. In 1945 and 1946 the Federal Communications Commission held hearings on the CBS plan. RCA said CBS wouldn't have its color system ready for 5-10 years. CBS claimed it would be ready by the middle of 1947. CBS also gave a demonstration with a very high quality picture. In October of 1946 RCA presented a color system of inferior quality which was partially compatible with the present VHF black and white system. In March 1947 the Federal Communications Commission said CBS would not be ready, and ordered a contiuation of the present system. RCA promised its electric color system would be fully compatible within five years, in 1947 an adaptor was required to see color programs in black and white on a black and white set.

In 1945 the Federal Communications Commission moved FM radio to a higher frequency. The Federal Communications Commission also allowed simulcasting of AM programs on FM stations. Regardless of these two disadvantages, CBS placed its bets on FM and gave up some TV applications. CBS had thought TV would be moved according to its plan and thus delayed. Unfortunately for CBS, FM was not a big moneymaker and TV was. That year the Federal Communications Commission set 150 miles as the minimum distance between TV stations on the same channel.

There was interference between TV stations in 1948 so the Federal Communications Commission froze the processing of new applications for TV stations. On September 30, 1948, the day of the freeze, there were thirty-seven stations in twenty-two cities and eighty-six more were approved. Another three hundred and three applications were sent in and not approved. After all the approved stations were constructed, or weren't, the distribution was as follows: New York and Los Angeles, seven each; twenty-four other cities had two or more stations; most cities had only one including Houston, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis. A total of just sixty-four cities had television during the freeze, and only one-hundred-eight stations were around. The freeze was for six months only, initially, and was just for studying interference problems. Because of the Korean Police Action, the freeze wound up being three and one half years. During the freeze, the interference problem was solved and the Federal Communications Commission made a decision on color TV and UHF. In October of 1950 the Federal Communications Commission made a pro-CBS color decision for the first time. The previous RCA decisions were made while Charles Denny was chairman. He later resigned in 1947 to become an RCA vice president and general consel. The decision approved CBS' mechanical spinning wheel color TV system, now able to be used on VHF, but still not compatible with black-and-white sets.

RCA, with a new compatible system that was of comparable quality to CBS' according to TV critics, appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and lost in May, 1951, but its legal action did succeed in toppling CBS' color TV system, as during the legal battle, many more black-and-white television sets were sold. When CBS did finally start broadcasting using its color TV system in mid-1951, most American television viewers already had black-and-white receivers that were incompatible with CBS' color system. In October of 1951 CBS was ordered to stop work on color TV by the National Production Authority, supposedly to help the situation in Korea. The Authority was headed by a lieutenant of William Paley, the head of CBS.

The Federal Communications Commission, under chairman Wayne Coy, issued its Sixth Report and Order in early 1952. It established seventy UHF channels (14-83) providing 1400 new potential stations. It also set aside 242 stations for education, most of them in the UHF band. The Commission also added 220 more VHF stations. VHF was reduced to 12 channels with channel 1 being given over to other uses and channels 2-12 being used solely for TV, this to reduced interference. This ended the freeze. In March of 1953 the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce held hearings on color TV. RCA and the National Television Systems Committee, NTSC, presented the RCA system. The NTSC consisted of all of the major television manufacturers at the time. On March 25, CBS president Frank Stanton conceded it would be &quot;economically foolish&quot; to pursue its color system and in effect CBS lost.

December 17, 1953 the Federal Communications Commission reversed its decision on color and approved the RCA system. Ironically, color didn't sell well. In the first six months of 1954 only 8,000 sets were sold, there were 23,000,000 black and white sets. Westinghouse made a big, national push and sold thirty sets nationwide. The sets were big, expensive and didn't include UHF.

The problem was that UHF stations would not be successful unless people had UHF tuners, and people would not voluntarily pay for UHF tuners unless there were UHF broadcasters. Of the 165 UHF stations that went on the air between 1952 and 1959, 55% went off the air. Of the UHF stations on the air, 75% were losing money. UHF's problems were the following:(1) technical inequality of UHF stations as compared with VHF stations; (2) intermixture of UHF and VHF stations in the same market and the millions of VHF only receivers; (3) the lack of confidence in the capabilities of and the need for UHF television. Suggestions of de-intermixture (making some cities VHF only and other cities UHF only) were not adopted, because most existing sets did not have UHF capability. Ultimately the FCC required all TV sets to have UHF tuners. However over four decades later, UHF is still considered inferior to VHF, despite cable television, and ratings on VHF channels are generally higher than on UHF channels.

The allocation between VHF and UHF in the 1950s, and the lack of UHF tuners is entirely analogous to the dilemma facing digital television of high definition television fifty years later.

Regulatory powers
The Federal Communications Commission has one major regulatory weapon, revoking licenses, but short of that has little leverage over broadcast stations. It is reluctant to do this since it operates in a near vacuum of information on most of the tens of thousands of stations whose licences are renewed every three years. Broadcast licenses are supposed to be renewed if the station met the &quot;public interest, convenience, or necessity.&quot; The Federal Communications Commission rarely checked except for some outstanding reason, burden of proof would be on the compaintant. Fewer than 1% of station renewals are not immediately granted, and only a small fraction of those are actually denied.

Note: Similar authority for regulation of Federal Government telecommunications is vested in the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

==Magnetron==

There was an urgent need during radar development in World War II for a microwave generator that worked in shorter wavelengths - around 10cm rather than 150cm - available from generators of the time. In 1940, at Birmingham University in the UK, John Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype of the cavity magnetron, and soon managed to increase its power output 100-fold. In August 1941, the first production model was shipped to the United States.

==FM==

FM radio is a broadcast technology invented by Edwin Howard Armstrong that uses frequency modulation to provide high-fidelity broadcast radio sound.

W1XOJ was the first FM radio station, granted a construction permit by the FCC in 1937. On January 5, 1940 FM radio was demonstrated to the FCC for the first time. FM radio was assigned the 42 to 50 MHz band of the spectrum in 1940.

After World War II, the FCC moved FM to the frequencies between 88 and 106 MHz on June 27, 1945, making all prewar FM radios worthless. This action severely set back the public confidence in, and hence the development of, FM radio. On March 1, 1945 W47NV began operations in Nashville, Tennessee becoming the first modern commercial FM radio station.

Television

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Television is a telecommunication system for broadcasting and receiving moving pictures and sound over a distance. The term has come to refer to all the aspects of television programming and transmission as well. The televisual has become synonymous with postmodern culture. The word television is a hybrid word, coming from both Greek and Latin. &quot;Tele-&quot; is Greek for &quot;far&quot;, while &quot;-vision&quot; is from the Latin &quot;visio&quot;, meaning &quot;vision&quot; or &quot;sight&quot;.

History
Paul Gottlieb Nipkow proposed and patented the first electromechanical television system in 1884.

A. A. Campbell Swinton wrote a letter to Nature on the 18th June 1908 describing his concept of electronic television using the cathode ray tube invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun. He lectured on the subject in 1911 and displayed circuit diagrams.

A semi-mechanical analogue television system was first demonstrated in London in February 1924 by John Logie Baird and a moving picture by Baird on October 30, 1925. The first long distance public television broadcast was from Washington, DC to New York City and occurred on April 7, 1927. The image shown was of then Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover. A fully electronic system was demonstrated by Philo Taylor Farnsworth in the autumn of 1927. The first analogue service was WGY, Schenectady, New York inaugurated on May 11, 1928. The first British Television Play, &quot;The Man with the Flower in his Mouth&quot;, was transmitted in July 1930. CBS's New York City station began broadcasting the first regular seven days a week television schedule in the U. S. on July 21, 1931. The first broadcast included Mayor James J. Walker, Kate Smith, and George Gershwin. The first all-electronic television service was started in Los Angeles, CA by Don Lee Broadcasting. Their start date was December 23, 1931 on W6XAO - later KTSL. Los Angeles was the only major U. S. city that avoided the false start with mechanical television.

In 1932 the BBC launched a service using Baird's 30-line system and these transmissions continued until 11th September 1935. On November 2, 1936 the BBC began broadcasting a dual-system service, alternating on a weekly basis between Marconi-EMI's high-resolution (405 lines per picture) service and Baird's improved 240-line standard from Alexandra Palace in London. Six months later, the corporation decided that Marconi-EMI's electronic picture gave the superior picture, and adopted that as their standard. This service is described as &quot;the world's first regular high-definition public television service&quot;, since a regular television service had been broadcast earlier on a 180-line standard in Germany. The outbreak of the Second World War caused the service to be suspended. TV transmissions only resumed from Alexandra Palace in 1946.

The first live transcontinental television broadcast took place in San Francisco, California from the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference on September 4, 1955.

Programming is broadcast on television stations (sometimes called channels). At first, terrestrial broadcasting was the only way television could be distributed. Because bandwidth was limited, government regulation was normal. In the US, the Federal Communications Commission allowed stations to broadcast advertisements, but insisted on public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a television licence fee (effectively a tax) to fund the BBC, which had public service as part of its Crown Charter. Development of cable and satellite means of distribution in the 1970s pushed businessmen to target channels towards a certain audience, and enabled the rise of subscription-based television channels, such as HBO and Sky. Practically every country in the world now has developed at least one television channel. Television has grown up all over the world, enabling every country to share aspects of their culture and society with others.

TV standards
See broadcast television systems.

There many means of distributing television broadcasts, including both analogue and digital versions of:

    * Terrestrial television
    * Satellite television
    * Cable television
    * MMDS (Wireless cable) 

TV aspect ratio
All of these early TV systems shared the same aspect ratio of 4:3 which was chosen to match the Academy Ratio used in cinema films at the time. This ratio was also square enough to be conveniently viewed on round Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs), which were all that could be produced given the manufacturing technology of the time -- today's CRT technology allows the manufacture of much wider tubes. However, due to the negative heavy metal health effects associated with disposal of CRTs in landfills, and the space-saving attributes of flat screen technologies that lack the aspect ratio limitations of CRTs, CRTs are slowly becoming obsolete.

In the 1950s movie studios moved towards wide screen aspect ratios such as Cinerama in an effort to distance their product from television.

The switch to digital television systems has been used as an opportunity to change the standard television picture format from the old ratio of 4:3 (1.33:1) to an aspect ratio of 16:9 (1.78:1). This enables TV to get closer to the aspect ratio of modern wide-screen movies, which range from 1.85:1 to 2.35:1. The 16:9 format was first introduced on &quot;widescreen&quot; DVDs. DVD provides two methods for transporting wide-screen content, the better of which uses what is called anamorphic wide-screen format. This format is very similar to the technique used to fit a wide-screen movie frame inside a 1.33:1 35mm film frame. The image is squashed horizontally when recorded, then expanded again when played back. The U.S. ATSC HDTV system uses straight wide-screen format, no image squashing or expanding is used.

There is no technical reason why the introduction of digital TV demands this aspect ratio change, however it has been decided to introduce these changes for marketing reasons.

Aspect ratio incompatibility
Displaying a wide-screen original image on a conventional aspect television screen presents a considerable problem since the image must be shown either:

    * in &quot;letterbox&quot; format, with black stripes at the top and bottom
    * with part of the image being cropped, usually the extreme left and right of the image being cut off (or in &quot;pan and scan&quot;, parts selected by an operator)
    * with the image horizontally compressed 

A conventional aspect image on a wide screen television can be shown:

    * with black vertical bars to the left and right
    * with upper and lower portions of the image cut off
    * with the image horizontally distorted 

A common compromise is to shoot or create material at an aspect ratio of 14:9, and to lose some image at each side for 4:3 presentation, and some image at top and bottom for 16:9 presentation.

Horizontal expansion has advantages in situations in which several people are watching the same set; it compensates for watching at an oblique angle.

New developments

    * Digital television (DTV)
    * High Definition TV (HDTV)
    * Pay Per View
    * Web TV
    * programming on-demand. 

TV sets
The earliest television sets were radios with the addition of a television device consisting of a neon tube with a mechanically spinning disk (the Nipkow disk, invented by Paul Gottlieb Nipkow) that produced a red postage-stamp size image . The first publicly broadcast electronic service was in Germany in March 1935. It had 180 lines of resolution and was only available in 22 public viewing rooms. One of the first major broadcasts involved the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The Germans had a 441 line system in the fall of 1937. (Source: Early Electronic TV)

Television usage skyrocketed after World War II with war-related technological advances and additional disposable income. (1930s TV receivers cost the equivalent of $7000 today (2001) and had little available programming.)

For many years different countries used different technical standards. France initially adopted the German 441 line standard but later upgraded to 819 lines, which gave the highest picture definition of any analogue TV system, approximately four times the resolution of the British 405 line system. Eventually the whole of Europe switched to the 625 line standard, once more following Germany's example. Meanwhile in North America the original 525 line standard was retained.


A television with a VHF &quot;rabbit ears&quot; antenna and a loop UHF antenna.
Television in its original and still most popular form involves sending images and sound over radio waves in the VHF and UHF bands, which are received by a receiver (a television set). In this sense, it is an extension of radio. Broadcast television requires an antenna (UK: aerial). This can be an external antenna mounted outside or smaller antennas mounted on or near the television. Typically this is an adjustable dipole antenna called &quot;rabbit ears&quot; for the VHF band and a small loop antenna for the UHF band.

Color television became available on December 30, 1953, backed by the CBS network. The government approved the color broadcast system proposed by CBS, but when RCA came up with a system that made it possible to view color broadcasts in black and white on unmodified old black and white TV sets, CBS dropped their own proposal and used the new one.

European colour television was developed somewhat later, in the 1960s, and was hindered by a continuing division on technical standards. The German PAL system was eventually adopted by West Germany, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, much of Africa, Asia and South America, and most West European countries except France. France produced its own SECAM standard, which was eventually adopted in much of Eastern Europe. Both systems broadcast on UHF frequencies and adopted a higher-definition 625 line system.

Starting in the 1990s, modern television sets diverged into three different trends:

    * standalone TV sets;
    * integrated systems with DVD players and/or VHS VCR capabilities built into the TV set itself (mostly for small size TVs with up to 17&quot; screen, the main idea is to have a complete portable system);
    * component systems with separate big screen video monitor, tuner, audio system which the owner connects the pieces together as a high-end home theater system. This approach appeals to videophiles that prefer components that can be upgraded separately. 

There are many kinds of video monitors used in modern TV sets. The most common are direct view CRTs for up to 40&quot; (4:3) and 46&quot; (16:9) diagonally. Most big screen TVs (up to over 100&quot;) use projection technology. Three types of projection systems are used in projection TVs: CRT based, LCD based, and reflective imaging chip based. Modern advances have brought flat screens to TV that use active matrix LCD or plasma display technology. Flat panel displays are as little as 4&quot; thick and can be hung on a wall like a picture. They are extremely attractive and space-saving but they remain expensive.

Nowadays some TVs include a port to connect peripherals to it or to connect the set to an A/V home network (HAVI), like LG RZ-17LZ10 that includes a USB port, where one can connect a mouse, keyboard and so on (for WebTV, now branded MSN TV).

Even for simple video, there are five standard ways to connect a device. These are as follows:

    * Component Video- three separate connectors, with one brightness channel and two color channels (hue and saturation), and is usually referred to as Y, B-Y, R-Y, or Y Pr Pb. This provides for high quality pictures and is usually used inside professional studios. However, it is being used more in home theater for DVDs and high end sources. Audio is not carried on this cable. 

    * SCART - A large 21 pin connector that may carry Composite video, S-Video or, for better quality, separate red, green and blue (RGB) signals and two-channel sound, along with a number of control signals. This system is standard in Europe but rarely found elsewhere. 

    * S-Video - two separate channels, one carrying brightness, the other carrying color. Also referred to as Y/C video. Provides most of the benefit of component video, with slightly less color fidelity. Use started in the 1980s for S-VHS, Hi-8, and early DVD players to relay high quality video. Audio is not carried on this cable. 

    * Composite video - The most common form of connecting external devices, putting all the video information into one stream. Most televisions provide this option with a yellow RCA jack. Audio is not carried on this cable. 

    * Coaxial or RF (coaxial cable) - All audio channels and picture components are transmitted through one wire and modulated on a radio frequency. Most TVs manufactured during the past 15-20 years accept coaxial connection, and the video is typically &quot;tuned&quot; on channel 3 or 4. This is the type of cable usually used for cable television. 

Advertising
From the earliest days of the medium, television has been used as a vehicle for advertising. Since their inception in the USA in the late 1940s, TV commercials have become far and away the most effective, most pervasive, and most popular method of selling products of all sorts. US advertising rates are determined primarily by Nielsen Ratings

US networks
In the US, the three original commercial television networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) provide prime-time programs for their affiliate stations to air from 8pm-11pm Monday-Saturday and 7pm-11pm on Sunday. (7pm to 10pm, 6pm to 10pm respectively in the Central and Mountain time zones). Most stations procure other programming, often syndicated, off prime time. The FOX Network does not provide programming for the last hour of prime time; as a result, many FOX affiliates air a local news program at that time. Three newer broadcasting networks, The WB, PAX, and UPN, also do not provide the same amount of network programming as so-called traditional networks.

European networks
In much of Europe television broadcasting has historically been state dominated, rather than commercially organised, although commercial stations have grown in number recently. In the United Kingdom, the major state broadcaster is the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), commercial broadcasters include ITV (Independent Television), Channel 4 and Channel 5, as well as the satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting. Other leading European networks include RAI (Italy), Télévision Française (France), ARD (Germany), RTÉ (Ireland), and satellite broadcaster RTL (Radio Télévision Luxembourg). Euronews is a pan-European news station, broadcasting both by satellite and terrestrially (timesharing on State TV networks) to most of the continent. Broadcast in several languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, etc.) it draws on contributions from State broadcasters and the ITN news network.

==Renewable energy==

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Renewable energy is energy from a source which can be managed so that it is not subject to depletion in a human timescale . Sources include the sun's rays, wind, waves, rivers, tides, biomass, and geothermal. Renewable energy does not include energy sources which are dependent upon limited resources, such as fossil fuels and nuclear fission power.

General Information
Most renewable forms of energy, other than geothermal, are in fact stored solar energy. Water power and wind power represent very short-term solar storage, while biomass represents slightly longer-term storage, but still on a very human time-scale, and so renewable within that human time-scale. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, while still stored solar energy, have taken millions of years to form, and so do not meet the definition of renewable.

Renewable energy resources may be used directly as energy sources, or used to create other forms of energy for use. Examples of direct use are solar ovens, geothermal heat pumps, and mechanical windmills. Examples of indirect use in creating other energy sources are electricity generation through wind generators or photovoltaic cells, or production of fuels such as ethanol from biomass (see alcohol as a fuel).

Pros and cons of renewable energy
Renewable energy sources are fundamentally different from fossil fuel or nuclear power plants because of their widespread occurrence and abundance - the sun will 'power' these 'powerplants' (meaning sunlight, the wind, flowing water, etc.) for the next 4 billion years. Some renewable sources do not emit any additional carbon dioxide and do not introduce any new risks such as nuclear waste. In fact, one renewable energy source, wood, actively sequesters carbon dioxide while growing.

A visible disadvantage of renewables is their visual impact on local environments. Some people dislike the aesthetics of wind turbines or bring up nature conservation issues when it comes to large solar-electric installations outside of cities. Some people try to utilize these renewable technologies in an efficient and aesthetically pleasing way: fixed solar collectors can double as noise barriers along highways, roof-tops are available already and could even be replaced totally by solar collectors, etc.

Some renewable energy capture systems entail unique environmental problems. For instance, wind turbines can be hazardous to flying birds, while hydroelectric dams can create barriers for migrating fish ? a serious problem in the Pacific Northwest that has decimated the numbers of many salmon populations.

Another inherent difficulty with renewables is their variable and diffuse nature (with the exception being geothermal energy, which is however only accessible where the Earth's crust is thin, such as near hot springs and natural geysers). Since renewable energy sources are providing relatively low-intensity energy, the new kinds of &quot;power plants&quot; needed to convert the sources into usable energy need to be distributed over large areas. To make the phrases 'low-intensity' and 'large area' easier to understand, note that in order to produce 1000 kWh of electricity per month (a typical per-month-per-capita consumption of electricity in Western countries), a home owner in cloudy Europe needs to use ten square meters of solar panels. Systematic electrical generation requires reliable overlapping sources or some means of storage on a reasonable scale (pumped-storage hydro systems, batteries, future hydrogen fuel cells, etc.). So, because of currently-expensive energy storage systems, a small stand-alone system is only economic in rare cases.

If renewable and distributed generation were to become widespread, electric power transmission and electricity distribution systems would no longer be the main distributors of electrical energy but would operate to balance the electricity needs of local communities. Those with surplus energy would sell to areas needing &quot;top ups&quot;.

Renewable energy history
The original energy source for all human activity was the sun via growing plants. Solar energy's main human application throughout most of history has thus been in agriculture and forestry, via photosynthesis.

Wood
Firewood was the earliest manipulated energy source in human history, being used as a thermal energy source through burning, and it is still important in this context today. Burning wood was important for both cooking and providing heat, enabling human presence in cold climates. Special types of wood cooking, food dehydration and smoke curing, also enabled human societies to safely store perishable foodstuffs through the year. Eventually, it was discovered that partial combustion in the relative absence of oxygen could produce charcoal, which provided a hotter and more compact and portable energy source. However, this was not a more efficient energy source, because it required a large input in wood to create the charcoal.

Animal Traction
Motive power for vehicles and mechanical devices was originally produced through animal traction. Animals such as horses and oxen not only provided transportation but also powered mills. Animals are still extensively in use in many parts of the world for these purposes.

Water Power
Animal power for mills was eventually supplanted by water power, the power of falling water in rivers, wherever it was exploitable. Direct use of water power for mechanical purposes is today fairly uncommon, but still in use.

Originally, water power through (hydroelectricity) was the most important source of electrical generation throughout society, and is still an important source today. Throughout most of the history of human technology, hydroelectricity has been the only renewable source of electricity generation significantly tapped for the generation of electricity.

Wind Power
Wind power has been used for several hundred years. It was originally used via large sail-blade windmills with slow-moving blades, such as those seen in the Netherlands and mentioned in Don Quixote. These large mills usually either pumped water or powered small mills. Newer windmills featured smaller, faster-turning, more compact units with more blades, such as those seen throughout the Great Plains. These were mostly used for pumping water from wells. Recent years have seen the rapid development of wind generation farms by mainstream power companies, using a new generation of large, high wind turbines with two or three immense and relatively slow-moving blades.

Solar power
Solar power as a direct energy source has been not been captured by mechanical systems until recent human history, but was captured as an energy source through architecture in certain societies for many centuries. Not until the twentieth century was direct solar input extensively explored via more carefully planned architecture (passive solar) or via heat capture in mechanical systems (active solar) or electrical conversion (photovoltaic). Increasingly today the sun is harnessed for heat and electricity.

The renewable energy movement
Renewable energy as an issue was virtually unheard-of before the middle of the twentieth century. There were experimentations with passive solar energy, including daylighting, in the early part of the twentieth century, but little beyond what had actually been practiced as a matter of course in some locales for hundreds of years. The renewable energy movement gained awareness, credence and strength with the great burgeoning of interest in environmental affairs in the mid-1900s, which in turn was largely due to Rachel Carson's ?'Silent Spring'?.

The first US politician to focus significantly on solar energy was Jimmy Carter, in response to the long term consequences of the 1973 energy crisis. No president since has paid much attention to renewable energy.

Renewable Energy Today
Around 80% of energy requirements are focused around heating or cooling buildings and powering the vehicles that ensure mobility (cars, trains, airplanes). This is the core of society's energy requirements. However, most uses of renewable power focus on electricity generation.

Geothermal heat pumps (also called ground-source heat pumps) are a means of extracting heat in the winter or cold in the summer from the earth to heat or cool buildings.

Modern sources of renewable energy
There are several types of renewable energy, including the following:

    * Solar power.
    * Wind power.
    * Geothermal energy.
    * Electrokinetic energy.
    * Hydroelectricity.
    * Biomatter, including Biogas Energy. 

Smaller-scale sources
Of course there are some smaller-scale applications as well:

    * Piezo electric crystals embedded in the sole of a shoe can yield a small amount of energy with each step. Vibration from engines can stimulate piezo electric crystals.
    * Some watches are already powered by movement of the arm.
    * Special antennae can collect energy from stray radiowaves or even light (EM radiation). 

Renewables as solar energy
Most renewable energy sources can trace their roots to solar energy, with the exception of geothermal and tidal power. For example, wind is caused by the sun heating the earth unevenly. Hot air is less dense, so it rises, causing cooler air to move in to replace it. Hydroelectric power can be ultimately traced to the sun too. When the sun evaporates water in the ocean, the vapor forms clouds which later fall on mountains as rain which is routed through turbines to generate electrity. The transformation goes from solar energy to potential energy to kinetic energy to electric energy.

Solar energy per se
Since most renewable energy is &quot;Solar Energy&quot; this term is slightly confusing and used in two different ways: firstly as a synonym for &quot;renewable energies&quot; as a whole (like in the political slogan &quot;Solar not nuclear&quot;) and secondly for the energy that is directly collected from solar radiation. In this section it is used in the latter category.

There are actually two separate approaches to solar energy, termed active solar and passive solar.

Solar electrical energy
For electricity generation, ground-based solar power has serious limitations because of its diffuse and intermittent nature. First, ground-based solar input is interrupted by night and by cloud cover, which means that solar electric generation inevitably has a low capacity factor, typically less than 20%. Also, there is a low intensity of incoming radiation, and converting this to high grade electricity is still relatively inefficient (14% - 18%), though increased efficiency or lower production costs have been the subject of much research over several decades.

Two methods of converting the Sun's radiant energy to electricity are the focus of attention. The better-known method uses sunlight acting on photovoltaic (PV) cells to produce electricity. This has many applications in satellites, small devices and lights, grid-free applications, earthbound signaling and communication equipment, such as remote area telecommunications equipment. Sales of solar PV modules are increasing strongly as their efficiency increases and price diminishes. But the high cost per unit of electricity still rules out most uses.

Several experimental PV power plants mostly of 300 - 500 kW capacity are connected to electricity grids in Europe and the USA. Japan has 150 MWe installed. A large solar PV plant was planned for Crete. In 2001 the world total for PV electricity was less than 1000 MWe with Japan as the world's leading producer. Research continues into ways to make the actual solar collecting cells less expensive and more efficient. Other major research is investigating economic ways to store the energy which is collected from the Sun's rays during the day.

Alternatively, many individuals have installed small-scale PV arrays for domestic consumption. Some, particularly in isolated areas, are totally disconnected from the main power grid, and rely on a surplus of generation capacity combined with batteries and/or a fossil fuel generator to cover periods when the cells are not operating. Others in more settled areas remain connected to the grid, using the grid to obtain electricity when solar cells are not providing power, and selling their surplus back to the grid. This works reasonably well in many climates, as the peak time for energy consumption is on hot, sunny days where air conditioners are running and solar cells produce their maximum power output. Many U.S. states have passed &quot;net metering&quot; laws, requiring electrical utilities to buy the locally-generated electricity for price comparable to that sold to the household. Photovoltaic generation is still considerably more expensive for the consumer than grid electricity unless the usage site is sufficiently isolated, in which case photovoltaics become the less expensive.

System problems with solar electric
Frequently renewable electricity sources are disadvantaged by regulation of the electricity supply industry which favors 'traditional' large-scale generators over smaller-scale and more distributed generating sources. If renewable and distributed generation were to become widespread, electric power transmission and electricity distribution systems would no longer be the main distributors of electrical energy but would operate to balance the electricity needs of local communities. Those with surplus energy would sell to areas needing &quot;top ups&quot;. Some Governments and regulators are moving to address this, though much remains to be done. One potential solution is the increased use of active management of electricity transmission and distribution networks.

Solar thermal electric energy
The second method for utilizing solar energy is solar thermal. A solar thermal power plant has a system of mirrors to concentrate the sunlight on to an absorber, the resulting heat then being used to drive turbines. The concentrator is usually a long parabolic mirror trough oriented north-south, which tilts, tracking the Sun's path through the day. A black absorber tube is located at the focal point and converts the solar radiation to heat (about 400°C) which is transferred into a fluid such as synthetic oil. The oil can be used to heat buildings or water, or it can be used to drive a conventional turbine and generator. Several such installations in modules of 80 MW are now operating. Each module requires about 50 hectares of land and needs very precise engineering and control. These plants are supplemented by a gas-fired boiler which ensures full-time energy output. The gas generates about a quarter of the overall power output and keeps the system warm overnight. Over 800 MWe capacity worldwide has supplied about 80% of the total solar electricity to the mid-1990s.

One proposal for a solar electrical plant is the solar tower, in which a large area of land would be covered by a greenhouse made of something as simple as transparent foil, with a tall lightweight tower in the centre, which could also be composed largely of foil. The heated air would rush to and up the centre tower, spinning a turbine. A system of water pipes placed throughout the greenhouse would allow the capture of excess thermal energy, to be released throughout the night and thus providing 24-hour power production. A 200 MWe tower is proposed near Mildura, Australia.

Solar thermal energy
Solar energy need not be converted to electricity for use. Many of the world's energy needs are simply for heat ? space heating, water heating, process water heating, oven heating, and so forth. The main role of solar energy in the future may be that of direct heating. Much of society's energy need is for heat below 60°C (140°F) - e.g. in hot water systems. A lot more, particularly in industry, is for heat in the range 60 - 110°C. Together these may account for a significant proportion of primary energy use in industrialized nations. The first need can readily be supplied by solar power much of the time in some places, and the second application commercially is probably not far off. Such uses will diminish to some extent both the demand for electricity and the consumption of fossil fuels, particularly if coupled with energy conservation measures such as insulation.

Solar water heating
Domestic solar hot water systems were once common in Florida until they were displaced by highly-advertised natural gas. Such systems are today common in the hotter areas of Australia, and simply consist of a network of dark-colored pipes running beneath a window of heat-trapping glass. They typically have a backup electric or gas heating unit for cloudy days. Such systems can actually be justified purely on economic grounds, particularly in some remoter areas of Australia where electricity is expensive.

Solar heat pumps
With adequate insulation, heat pumps utilizing the conventional refrigeration cycle can be used to warm and cool buildings, with very little energy input other than energy needed to run a compressor. Eventually, up to ten percent of the total primary energy need in industrialized countries may be supplied by direct solar thermal techniques, and to some extent this will substitute for base-load electrical energy.

Solar ovens
Large scale solar thermal powerplants, as mentioned before, can be used to heat buildings, but on a smaller scale solar ovens can be used on sunny days. Such an oven or solar furnace uses mirrors or a large lens to focus the Sun's rays onto a baking tray or black pot which heats up as it would in a standard oven.

Wind Energy
Wind turbines have been used for household electricity generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas. Generator units of more than 1 MWe are now functioning in several countries. The power output is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so such turbines require a wind in the range 3 to 25 m/s (11 - 90 km/h), and in practice relatively few land areas have significant prevailing winds. Like solar, wind power requires alternative power sources to cope with calmer periods.

There are now many thousands of wind turbines operating in various parts of the world, with utility companies having a total capacity of over 39,000 MWe of which Europe accounts for 75% (ultimo 2003). Additional windpower is generated by private windmills both on-grid and off-grid. Germany is the leading producer of wind generated electricity with over 14,600 MWe in 2003. In 2003 the U.S.A. produced over 6,300 Mwe of wind energy, second only to Germany.

New wind farms and offshore wind parks are being planned and built all over the world. This has been the most rapidly-growing means of electricity generation at the turn of the 21st century and provides a complement to large-scale base-load power stations. Denmark generates over 10% of its electricity with windturbines, whereas windturbines account for 0.4% of the total electricity production on a global scale (ultimo 2002). The most economical and practical size of commercial wind turbines seems to be around 600 kWe to 1 MWe, grouped into large wind farms. Most turbines operate at about 25% load factor over the course of a year, but some reach 35%.

Geothermal Energy
Where hot underground steam or water can be tapped and brought to the surface it may be used to generate electricity. Such geothermal power sources have potential in certain parts of the world such as New Zealand, United States, Philippines and Italy. The two most prominent areas for this in the United States are in the Yellowstone basin and in northern California. Iceland produced 170 MWe geothermal power and heated 86% of all houses in the year 2000. Some 8000 MWe of capacity is operating over all.

There are also prospects in certain other areas for pumping water underground to very hot regions of the Earth's crust and using the steam thus produced for electricity generation. An Australian startup company, Geodynamics, proposes to build a commercial plant in the Cooper Basin region of South Australia using this technology by 2004.

Water power
Energy inherent in water can be harnessed and used, in the forms of kinetic energy or temperature differences.

Electrokinetic energy
This type of energy harnesses what happens to water when it is pumped through tiny channels. See electrokinetics (water).

Hydroelectric Energy
Hydroelectric energy produces essentially no carbon dioxide, in contrast to burning fossil fuels or gas, and so is not a significant contributor to global warming. Hydroelectric power from potential energy of rivers, now supplies about 715,000 MWe or 19% of world electricity. Apart from a few countries with an abundance of it, hydro capacity is normally applied to peak-load demand, because it is so readily stopped and started. It is not a major option for the future in the developed countries because most major sites in these countries having potential for harnessing gravity in this way are either being exploited already or are unavailable for other reasons such as environmental considerations.

The chief advantage of hydrosystems is their capacity to handle seasonal (as well as daily) high peak loads. In practice the utilization of stored water is sometimes complicated by demands for irrigation which may occur out of phase with peak electrical demands.

Tidal power
Harnessing the tides in a bay or estuary has been achieved in France (since 1966) and Russia, and could be achieved in certain other areas where there is a large tidal range. The trapped water can be used to turn turbines as it is released through the tidal barrage in either direction. Worldwide this technology appears to have little potential, largely due to environmental constraints.

Tidal stream power
A relatively new technology development, tidal stream generators draw energy from underwater currents in much the same way that wind generators are powered by the wind. The much higher density of water means that there is the potetial for a single generator to provide significant levels of power. Tidal stream technology is at the very early stages of development though and will require significantly more research before it becomes a significant contributor to electrical generation needs.

Wave power
Harnessing power from wave motion is a possibility which might yield much more energy than tides. The feasibility of this has been investigated, particularly in the UK. Generators either coupled to floating devices or turned by air displaced by waves in a hollow concrete structure would produce electricity for delivery to shore. Numerous practical problems have frustrated progress.

OTEC
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion is a relatively unproven technology, though it was first used by the French engineer Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval in 1881. The difference in temperature between water near the surface and deeper water can be as much as 20°C. The warm water is used to make a liquid such as ammonia evaporate, causing it to expand. The expanding gas forces its way through turbines, after which it is condensed using the colder water and the cycle can begin again.

Biomass
Biomass, also known as biomatter, can be used directly as fuel or to produce liquid biofuel. Agriculturally produced biomass fuels, such as biodiesel, ethanol and bagasse (a byproduct of sugar cane cultivation) are burned in internal combustion engines or boilers.

Liquid biofuel
Liquid biofuel is usually bioalcohols -like methanol and ethanol- or biodiesel. Biodiesel can be used in modern diesel vehicles with little or no modification and can be obtained from waste and crude vegetable and animal oil and fats (lipids). In some areas corn, sugarbeets, cane and grasses are grown specifically to produce ethanol (also known as alcohol) a liquid which can be used in internal combustion engines and fuel cells.

Solid biomass
Direct use is usually in the form of combustible solids, either firewood or combustible field crops. Field crops may be grown specifically for combustion or may be used for other purposes, and the processed plant waste then used for combustion. Most sorts of biomatter, including dried manure, can actually be burnt to heat water and to drive turbines. Plants partly use photosynthesis to store solar energy, water and CO2. Sugar cane residue, wheat chaff, corn cobs and other plant matter can be, and is, burnt quite successfully. The process releases no net CO2.

Biogas
Animal feces (manure) release methane under the influence of anaerobic bacteria which can also be used to generate electricity. See biogas.

Renewable energy storage systems
One of the great problems with renewable energy, as mentioned above, is transporting it in time or space. Since most renewable energy sources are periodic, storage for off-generation times is important, and storage for powering transportation is also a critical issue.

Hydrogen fuel cells
Hydrogen as a fuel has been touted lately as a solution in our energy dilemmas. However, the idea that hydrogen is a renewable energy source is a misunderstanding. Hydrogen is not an energy source, but a portable energy storage method, because it must be manufactured by other energy sources in order to be used. However, as a storage medium, it may be a significant factor in using renewable energies. It is widely seen as a possible fuel for hydrogen cars, if certain problems can be overcome economically. It may be used in conventional internal combustion engines, or in fuel cells which convert chemical energy directly to electricity without flames, in the same way the human body burns fuel. Making hydrogen requires either reforming natural gas (methane) with steam, or, for a renewable and more ecologic source, the electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen. The former process has carbon dioxide as a by-product, which exacerbates (or at least does not improve) greenhouse gas emissions relative to present technology. With electrolysis, the greenhouse burden depends on the source of the power, and both intermittent renewables and nuclear energy are considered here.

With intermittent renewables such as solar and wind, matching the output to grid demand is very difficult, and beyond about 20% of the total supply, apparently impossible. But if these sources are used for electricity to make hydrogen, then they can be utilized fully whenever they are available, opportunistically. Broadly speaking it does not matter when they cut in or out, the hydrogen is simply stored and used as required.

Nuclear advocates note that using nuclear power to manufacture hydrogen would help solve plant inefficiencies. Here the plant would be run continuously at full capacity, with perhaps all the output being supplied to the grid in peak periods and any not needed to meet civil demand being used to make hydrogen at other times. This would mean far better efficiency for the nuclear power plants.

About 50 kWh (1/144,000 J) is required to produce a kilogram of hydrogen by electrolysis, so the cost of the electricity clearly is crucial.

Other renewable energy storage systems
Sun, wind, tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either reliably continuous base-load power, because of their periodic natures, or peak-load power when it is needed. In practical terms, without proper energy storage methods these sources are therefore limited to some twenty percent of the capacity of an electricity grid, and cannot directly be applied as economic substitutes for fossil fuels or nuclear power, however important they may become in particular areas with favorable conditions. If there were some way that large amounts of electricity from intermittent producers such as solar and wind could be stored efficiently, the contribution of these technologies to supplying base-load energy demand would be much greater.

Pumped water storage
Already in some places pumped storage is used to even out the daily generating load by pumping water to a high storage dam during off-peak hours and weekends, using the excess base-load capacity from coal or nuclear sources. During peak hours this water can be used for hydroelectric generation. However, relatively few places have the scope for pumped storage dams close to where the power is needed.

Battery storage
Many &quot;off-the-grid&quot; domestic systems rely on battery storage, but means of storing large amounts of electricity as such in giant batteries or by other means have not yet been put to general use. Batteries are generally expensive, have maintenance problems, and have limited lifespans. One possible technology for large-scale storage exists: large-scale flow batteries.

Electrical grid storage
One of the most important storage methods advocated by the renewable energy community is to rethink the whole way that we look at power supply, in its 24-hour, 7-day cycle, using peak load equipment simply to meet the daily peaks. Solar electric generation is a daylight process, whereas most homes have their peak energy requirements at night. Domestic solar generation can thus feed electricity into the grid during grid peaking times during the day, and domestic systems can then draw power from the grid during the night when overall grid loads are down. This results in using the power grid as a domestic energy storage system, and relies on ?'net metering'?, where electrical companies can only charge for the amount of electricity used in the home that is in excess of the electricity generated and fed back into the grid. Many states now have net metering laws.

Today's peak-load equipment could also be used to some extent to provide infill capacity in a system relying heavily on renewables. The peak capacity would complement large-scale solar thermal and wind generation, providing power when they were unable to. Improved ability to predict the intermittent availability of wind enables better use of this resource. In Germany it is now possible to predict wind generation output with 90% certainty 24 hours ahead. This means that it is possible to deploy other plants more effectively so that the economic value of that wind contribution is greatly increased.

Renewable energy use by nation
Iceland is a world leader in renewable energy due to its abundant hydro- and geothermal energy sources. Over 99% of the country's electricity is from renewable sources and most of its urban household heating is geothermal. Israel is also notable as much of its household hot water is heated by solar means. These countries' successes are at least partly based on their geographical advantages.

Renewable energy controversies
As with anything, even renewable energy generates controversies.

The funding dilemma
Research and development in renewable energies has been severely hampered by only receiving a tiny fraction of energy R&amp;D budgets, with conventional energy sources getting the lion's share.

Centralization versus decentralization
Frequently renewable electricity sources will be disadvantaged by regulation of the electricity supply industry which favors 'traditional' large-scale generators over smaller-scale and more distributed generating sources. If renewable and distributed generation were to become widespread, electric power transmission and electricity distribution systems would no longer be the main distributors of electrical energy but would operate to balance the electricity needs of local communities. Those with surplus energy would sell to areas needing &quot;top ups&quot;. Some Governments and regulators are moving to address this, though much remains to be done. One potential solution is the increased use of active management of electricity transmission and distribution networks.

The nuclear &quot;renewable&quot; claim
Some nuclear advocates claim that nuclear energy should be regarded as renewable energy. Arguments they put forward include:

    * The view that nuclear energy does not contribute to global warming (although evaporative cooling has a minor effect by introducing additional water vapor into the atmosphere, along with the heat production of the process).
    * Fast breeder reactors can produce more fuel than they consume.
    * The view that uranium and thorium, being radioactive, are not theoretically long-term resources.
    * The view that nuclear waste, since it will eventually become less radioactive than the original ore bodies, is not theoretically a long-term problem. 

This viewpoint is strongly rejected by most renewable energy advocates. The fact that nuclear power uses a depleting resource (uranium or thorium), that the half-life of uranium 238 is 4.5 billion years, and that the decay of the waste to a safe level may take three thousand years or longer (depending on the technology used) means that it cannot be included in such a classification. Breeder reactors consume uranium or thorium to produce fissile fuel, so this particular argument is a simple misunderstanding of the basic processes involved. Similar arguments can also be applied against proposed nuclear fusion power stations using deuterium and tritium, the latter bred from lithium, as fuel.

==Solar power==

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Solar power has become of increasing interest as other finite power sources such as fossil fuels and hydroelectric power become both more scarce and expensive (in both fiscal and environmental terms). As the earth orbits the sun it receives 1,410 W / m2 as measured upon a surface kept normal (at a right angle) to the sun. Of this approximately 19% of the energy is absorbed by the atmosphere, while clouds reflect 35% of the total energy upon average.

After passing through the Earth's atmosphere most of the sun's energy is in the form of visible and ultraviolet light. Plant's use solar energy to create chemical energy through photosynthesis. We use this energy when we burn wood or fossil fuels. There have been experiments to create fuel by absorbing sunlight in a chemical reaction in a way similar to photosynthesis without using living organisms.

Most solar energy used today is converted into heat or electricity.

Types of solar power

Methods of solar energy have been classified using the terms direct, indirect, passive and active.

Direct solar energy involves only one transformation into a usable form.
Examples:

    * Sunlight hits a photovoltaic cell creating electricity. (Photovoltaics are classified as direct despite the fact that the electricity is usually converted to another form of energy such as light or mechanical energy before becoming useful.)
    * Sunlight hits a dark surface and the surface warms when the light is converted to heat by interacting with matter. The heat is used to heat a room or water. 

Indirect solar energy involves more than one transformation to reach a usable form.
Example:

    * systems to close insulating shutters or move shades. Passive solar systems are considered direct systems although sometimes they involve convective flow which technically is a conversion of heat into mechanical energy. 

Active solar energy refers to systems that use electrical, mechanical or chemical mechanisms to increase the effectiveness of the collection system. Indirect collection systems are almost always active systems.

Solar design is the use of architectural features to replace the use of electricity and fossil fuels with the use of solar energy and decrease the energy needed in a home or building with insulation and efficient lighting and appliances.

Architectural features used in solar design:

    * South facing windows with insulated glazing that has high ultraviolet transmitance.
    * Thermal masses.
    * Insulating shutters for windows to be closed at night and on overcast days.
    * Fixed awnings positioned to create shade in the summer and exposure to the sun in the winter.
    * Movable awnings to be repositioned seasonally.
    * A well insulated and sealed building envelope.
    * Exhaust fans in high humidity areas.
    * Passive or active warm air solar panels.
    * Passive or active Trombe walls.
    * Active solar panels using water or antifreeze solutions.
    * Passive solar panels for preheating potable water.
    * Photovoltaic systems to provide electricity.
    * Windmills to provide electricity. 

Solar hot water systems are quite common in some countries where a small flat panel collector is mounted on the roof and able to meet most of a household's hot water needs. Cheaper flat panel collectors are also often used to heat swimming pools, thereby extending their swimming seasons.

Solar cooking is helping in many developing countries, both reducing the demands for local firewood and maintaining a cleaner environment for the cooks. The first known record of a western solar oven is attributed to Horace de Saussure, a Swiss naturalist experimenting as early as 1767. A solar box cooker traps the sun's power in an insulated box; these have been successfully used for cooking, pasteurization and fruit canning.

Solar cells (also referred to as photovoltaic cells) are devices or banks of devices that use the photoelectric effect of semiconductors to generate electricity directly from the sunlight. As their manufacturing costs have remained high during the twentieth century their use has been limited to very low power devices such as calculators with LCD displays or to generate electricity for isolated locations which could afford the technology. The most important use to date has been to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft. As manufacturing costs decreased in the last decade of the twentieth centery solar power has become cost effective for many remote low power applications such as roadside emergency telephones, remote sensing, and limited &quot;off grid&quot; home power applications.

Solar power plants generally use reflectors to concentrate sunlight into a heat absorber.

    * Heliostat mirror power plants focus the sun's rays upon a collector tower. The vast amount of energy is generally transported from the tower and stored by use of a high temperature fluid. Liquid sodium is often used as the transport and storage fluid. The energy is then extracted as needed by such means as heating water for use in stream turbines.
    * Trough concentrators have been used successfully in the State of California (in the U.S.) to generate 350MW of power in the past two decades. The parabolic troughs can increase the amount of solar radiation striking the tubes up to 30 or 60 times, where synthetic oil is heated to 390°C. The oil is then pumped into a generating station and used to power a steam turbine.
    * Parabolic reflectors are most often used with a stirling engine or similar device at its focus. As the single parabolic reflector achieves a greater focusing accuracy than any larger bank of mirrors can achieve, the focus is used to achieve a higher temperature which in turn allows a very efficient conversion of heat into mechanical power to drive a electrical generator. Parabolic reflectors can also be used to generate steam to power turbines to generate electricity. 

Applying Solar Power

Deployment of solar power depends largely upon local conditions and requirements, for example while certain European or U.S. states could benefit from a public hot water utility, such systems would be both impractical and counter-productive in countries like Australia or states like New Mexico. As all industrialised nations share a need for electricity, it is clear that solar power will increasingly be used to supplying a cheap, reliable electricity supply.

Many other types of power generation are indirectly solar-powered. Plants use photosynthesis to convert solar energy to chemical energy, which can later be burned as fuel to generate electricity; oil and coal originated as plants. Hydroelectric dams and wind turbines are indirectly powered by the sun.

In some areas of the U.S., solar electric systems are already competitive with utility systems. The basic cost advantage is that the home-owner does not pay income tax on electric power that is not purchased. As of 2002, there is a list of technical conditions: There must be many sunny days. The systems must sell power to the grid, avoiding battery costs. The solar systems must be inexpensively mass-purchased, which usually means they must be installed at the time of construction. Finally, the region must have high power prices. For example, Southern California has about 260 sunny days a year, making it an excellent venue. It yields about 9%/yr returns of investment when systems are installed at $9/watt (not cheap, but feasible), and utility prices are at $0.095 per kilowatt-hour (the current base rate). On grid solar power can be especially feasible when combined with time-of-use net metering, since the time maximum production is largely coincident with the time of highest pricing.

For a stand-alone system some means must be employed to store the collected energy for use during hours of darkness or cloud cover - either as electrochemically in batteries, or in some other form such as hydrogen (produced by electrolysis of water), flywheels in vacuum, or superconductors. Storage always has an extra stage of energy conversion, with consequent energy losses, greatly increasing capital costs.

Several experimental photovoltaic (PV) power plants of 300 - 500 kW capacity are connected to electricity grids in Europe and the U.S. Japan has 150 MWe installed. A large solar PV plant is planned for the island of Crete. Research continues into ways to make the actual solar collecting cells less expensive and more efficient. Other major research is investigating economic ways to store the energy which is collected from the sun's rays during the day.

'''Radio Astronomy: Looking at space'''

==Schumann Resonance==

The phenomenon is named after W. O. Schumann, who predicted this phenomenon in the 1950s, and helped detect its existence.

==CBR==

The CBR was predicted by George Gamow, Ralph Alpher, and Robert Hermann in the 1940s and was accidentally discovered in 1964 by Penzias and Wilson, who received a Nobel Prize for this discovery. The CBR had, however, been detected and its temperature deduced in 1941, seven years before Gamow's prediction. Based on the study of narrow absorption line features in the spectra of stars, the astronomer Andrew McKellar wrote: &quot;It can be calculated that the 'rotational' temperature of interstellar space is 2 K.&quot;

Of these experiments, the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite that was flown in 1989-1996 is probably the most famous and which made the first detection of the large scale anisotropies (other than the dipole). In June 2001, NASA launched a second CBR space mission, WMAP, to make detailed measurements of the anisotropies over the full sky. Results from this mission provide a detailed measurement of the angular power spectrum down to degree scales, giving detailed constraints on various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from cosmic inflation as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data center for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [ed. see links below],

A third space mission, Planck, is to be launched in 2007. Unlike the previous two space missions, Planck is a collaboration between NASA and ESA (the European Space Agency).

CBR and Non-Standard Cosmologies

During the mid-1990's, the lack of detection of anisotropies in the CBR led to some interest in nonstandard cosmologies (such as plasma cosmology) mostly as a backup in case detectors failed to find anisotropy in the CBR. The discovery of these anisotropies combined with a large amount of new data coming in has greatly reduced interest in these alternative theories.

Some supporters of non-standard cosmology argue that the primodorial background radiation is uniform (which is inconsistent with the big bang) and that the variations in the CBR are due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect mentioned above (among other effects).

A '''fuel cell''' is an electrochemical device similar to a battery, but differing from the latter in that it is designed for continuous replenishment of the reactants consumed; i.e. it produces electricity from an external fuel supply as opposed to the limited internal energy storage capacity of a battery.

Typical reactants are hydrogen on the anode side and oxygen on the cathode side. In contrast, conventional batteries consume solid reactants and, once these reactants are depleted, must be discarded, recharged with electricity by running the chemical reaction backwards, or, at least in theory, having their electrodes replaced. Typically in fuel cells, reactants flow in and reaction products flow out, and continuous long-term operation is feasible virtually as long as these flows are maintained.

Fuel cells are also attractive in some applications for their high efficiency and low pollution. Some applications that have been suggested include
* baseload utility power plants,

== Types of fuel cells ==

There are five generally recognised types of fuel cells, of which two are the main subject of intensive research.

=== PEM ===

'''PEM''' fuel cells have a disputed acronym, meaning either '''proton-exchange membrane''' or '''polymer-electrolyte membrane''', which both are in fact a good description. In this fuel cell, hydrogen is split at the membrane surface in protons, that travel through the membrane, and electrons, that travel through our external electric circuit, and provide our power. The hydrogen ions travel through the water that is entrained in the membrane to the other side, where they are combined with oxygen to form water. Unfortunately, while the splitting of the hydrogen molecule is relatively easy, splitting the stronger oxygen molecule is more difficult, and this causes significant losses that result in a sharp decrease of performance of the fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell is a prime candidate for vehicle and other mobile applications of all sizes down to mobile phones, because of its compactness. However, the water-entraining membrane is crucial to performance: too much water will flood the membrane, too little will dry it; in both cases, power output will drop; water management is a very difficult subject in PEM fuel cells. Furthermore, the platinum catalyst on the membrane is easily poisoned by CO.

PEM systems that use reformed methanol were proposed, as in Daimler Chrysler Necar 5; reforming methanol, i.e. making it react to obtain hydrogen, is however a very complicated process, that requires also purification from the CO the reaction produces. A platinum-ruthenium catalyst is necessary as some CO will unavoidably reach the membrane. The level should not exceed 10 parts per million.

=== DMFC ===

A subcategory of PEM is the '''DMFC''', or '''direct methanol fuel cell'''; here, the methanol is not reformed, but fed directly to the fuel cell. One does not need complicated reforming, and storage of methanol is much easier than that of hydrogen. However, efficiency is low, due to the high permeation of methanol through the membrane, and the dynamic behaviour is sluggish.

The main manufacturer of PEM is Ballard Power Systems of Vancouver, Canada. Efficiencies of PEM are in the range of 40-50%.

=== SOFC ===

'''Solid oxide fuel cells''', or '''SOFC''', are intended mainly for stationary applications (power plants). They work at very high temperatures (some at 1000ºC), and their off-gases can be used to fire a secondary gas turbine to improve efficiency. Efficiency could reach as much as 70% in these hybrid systems. This time, it's oxygen being transferred through a solid oxide at high temperature to react with hydrogen on the other side. SOFC have such a high temperature that they can be fed (provided some modifications) with natural gas, that will react to give hydrogen in the fuel cell itself. SOFC are very resistant to poisoning, and can indeed be run on CO, which is a poison for PEM.

Since SOFC are made of ceramic materials, they tend to be brittle; they are therefore unsuited for mobile applications. Furthermore, thermal expansion demands a uniform and slow heating process at startup, that will cause very long startup times: typically, 8 hours are to be expected. Research is going now in the direction of lower-temperature SOFC (600ºC), which will enable the use of metallic materials with better mechanical properties and heat conductivity.

=== MCFC ===

'''Molten-carbonate fuel cells''' ('''MCFC''') are also high-temperature, but in the range of 600ºC. Their main problem is corrosion, and the need to operate a high-temperature liquid rather than a solid as in the SOFC.

=== PAFC ===

'''Phosphoric-acid fuel cells''' ('''PAFC''') are a mature technology that is commercially available. Unfortunately, the phosphoric acid solidifies under 40ºC, making startup very difficult. They have been used for stationary applications with an efficiency of about 40%, and many believe they do not offer much potential for further development.

=== AFC ===

The '''alkaline fuel cell''' ('''AFC''') is the cell that brought the Man to the Moon. Used in Apollo-series missions and on the Space Shuttle, it is a very good fuel cell but for the fact that it is poisoned by CO&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. This means that the cell will require pure oxygen, or at least purified air. As this process is relatively expensive, not much development is being done on AFC. NASA has decided they will shift to PEM for the next generation of Space Shuttles.

== Science ==

Fuel cells are electrochemical devices, so they are not constrained by the maximum thermal (Carnot) efficiency as combustion engines are. Consequently, they can have very high efficiencies in converting chemical energy to electrical energy.

In the archetypal example of a hydrogen/oxygen polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell, a proton-conducting polymer membrane separates the anode (&quot;fuel&quot;) and cathode sides. Each side has an electrode, typically carbon paper coated with platinum catalyst.

On the anode side, hydrogen diffuses to the anode catalyst where it dissociates into protons and electrons. The protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode, but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit (supplying power) because the membrane is electronically insulating.

On the cathode catalyst, oxygen molecules react with the electrons (which have travelled through the external circuit) and protons to form water.

In this example, the only waste product is water vapor.

Also, there is the possible use of fuel cells at home, to store energy at the cheap off-peak electricity rates and used at peak-use hours. It may even be profitable to sell back some of the energy to the power company, like they do with windmill electric power. Peak power production reaches twice the normal level, which means that the very expensive powerplant capacity is sized for levels used for a short period of time. Also, power plants are most efficient at only one production rate and their efficiency drops off significantly at off-peak rates.

== History ==

The first fuel cell was developed in the 19th century by British scientist Sir William Grove.  A sketch was published in 1843.  But fuel cells did not see practical application until the 1960s, where they were used in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks). Extremely expensive materials were used and the fuel cells required very pure hydrogen and oxygen.  Early fuel cells tended to require inconveniently high operating temperatures that were a problem in many applications.

Further technological advances in the 1980s and 1990s, like the use of Nafion as the electrolyte, and reductions in the quantity of expensive platinum catalyst required, have made the prospect of fuel cells in consumer applications such as automobiles more realistic.

== The fuel cell industry ==

Ballard Power Systems is a major manufacturer of fuel cells and leads the world in automotive fuel cell technology. Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler are major investors in Ballard. As of 2006, the only major automobile companies pursuing internal development of fuel cells for automotive use are General Motors, Toyota and Honda; most others are customers of Ballard.

United Technologies (UTX) is a major manufacturer of large, stationary fuel cells used as co-generation power plants in hospitals and large office buildings.  The company has also developed bus fleets that are powered by fuel cells.

==Pros and cons of fuel cells in various applications==

Their use is controversial in some applications.  The hydrogen typically used as a fuel isn't a primary source of energy.  It is usually only a source of stored energy that must be manufactured using energy from other sources. Some critics of the current stages of this technology argue that the energy needed to create the fuel in the first place may reduce the ultimate energy efficiency of the system to below that of highly efficient gasoline internal-combustion engines; this is especially true if the hydrogen is generated from electrolysis of water by electricity. On the other hand, hydrogen can be generated from methane (the primary component of natural gas) with approximately 80% efficiency. The methane conversion method releases greenhouse gases, however, and the ideal environmental system would be to use renewable energy sources to generate hydrogen through electrolysis.  Other types of fuel cells don't face this problem.  For example, biological fuel cells take glucose and methanol from food scraps and convert it into hydrogen and food for the bacteria.

There are practical problems to be overcome as well.  Although the use of fuel cells for consumer products is probable in the near future, most current designs won't work if oriented upside down.  They currently cannot be scaled to the small size needed by portable devices such as cell phones.  Current designs require venting and therefore cannot operate under water.  They may not be usable on aircraft because of the risk of fuel leaks through the vents.  Technologies for safe refueling of consumer fuel cells are not yet in place.

Among the controversies in the use of hydrogen are: First, the energy used to produce the hydrogen is comparable to the energy in the hydrogen, it is inefficient therefore too expensive. If conventional powerplants were used to produce the hydrogen, at best, there would be no gains in current pollution rates. Second, some have suggested that this is a &quot;stalking horse&quot; to bring back nuclear power, which may be the only commercially viable way to make hydrogen and reduce pollution. Finally, the need to provide the very long, costly and vulnerable thousands of miles of gas lines makes hydrogen too costly without government help.

There are several advantages to hydrogen as well. Clean, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are non-continuous and unreliable through the course of a day. So power from these sources is not always available at the time it is needed. The electricity produced from solar panels or wind generators could be stored in large battery complexes but this can be expensive and batteries have a limited storage capacity and lifetime. If the electricity is used to produce hydrogen however, the energy can be stored more easily. As a gas hydrogen is not hard to store until it is needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Muting==
Muting a string is simple: with the fretting hand, touch the string with a finger, but do not press it down, and strike the string. It is usually best to do this where a [[Guitar/Harmonics|harmonic]] will not result, but strings can be muted at harmonics for special effect. In tablature, muted notes are often marked with an &quot;x&quot; instead of a fret number.
It is also common practice to mute a string with the picking hand after striking a note to create a shortened &quot;staccato&quot; effect. Again touching a string to mute away from harmonic nodes is advised, but sometimes pulling off into harmonics creates interesting effects.

==Palm muting==
[[Image:Palm mute by punkettaro.gif|right]]
Palm muting may or may not make the pitch of the string discernable. Very lightly rest the palm of the hand on or near the bridge, then fret and strike strings normally. Palm-muted notes are sometimes notated the same way as muted notes when the pitch is not discernable; otherwise fret numbers are given normally and the muted notes are marked &quot;P.M.&quot; in tablature.

===The Palm Muting Technique===
The idea is not to mute the strings, but to dampen them, so that the notes are still clear, but with less sustain.  To start, hold your guitar like you normally would, but let your palm brush against the strings, near the bridge.  Remember to &quot;let&quot; the strings brush against your palm, not putting any force on the strings.  The closer to the bridge, the more forgiving it is.  As you get better, try adjusting the amount of muting by keeping your palm at different distances from the bridge.
Very heavy palm muting can raise the pitch of the note(s), especially on guitars with a floating tremolo bar system equipped. Using or not using this effect is at the reader's discretion.

==Finger Muting==
[[Image:Stoppato by punkettaro.gif|left]]
You can also mute strings just by pressing your fingers against the strings, but not so hard that they are fretted and play notes.

==Raking==
Raking is not a kind of muting, but a technique for applying it. It is vaguely related to [[Guitar/Arpeggios and Sweep Picking|sweep picking]], but instead of an arpeggio, the result is usually a single percussive-sounding note. (However, sweep picking is sometimes incorrectly notated as a rake in tablature, and sloppy sweep picking may accidentally become a rake.) Between two and four strings are struck, only one containing the desired note and the rest muted. Rakes may be notated in various ways; the most common way is to add muted grace notes, possibly adding the word &quot;rake&quot; to the tablature for clarification.

== Page blanking ==

Sorry for the inadvertent blanking of the page. I consistently have this problem on Wikipedia as well. I edit a page, and the edit goes through, and on rare occasions MSIE brings up an error page instead of the page I should be viewing. Then no matter what I do, the page gets blanked. I wish I knew how to prevent it...

--[[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 10:32, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:No problem. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 13:48, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== 2d level headers ==

Some of the 2d-level headers on the Lounge page should now probably get their own Wikibooks: namespace page; for instance, a copyrights FAQ.  Those that I made separate pages for (Project ideas, bookshelf ideas, etc.) might be better suited for the Wikibooks: namespace also; le me know what you think, or just move them if the desire strikes you.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 22:20, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Make this page easier to find! ==

I've just spent 10 minutes trying to find this page!  I'm an active contributor to Wikimedia projects, in particular Wikipedia, and still couldn't locate the equivalent of the 'Village Pump'.  I couldn't find it in the help, on the 'wikiversity' page (which I assumed was the equivalent to the 'community portal' on Wikipedia, as it is in the same location on the nav-bar) or at the 'study help desk' which was the first place I tried.  I also tried typing in 'wikibooks:Village pump' to no avail.  Whilst it is nice to have cute names like 'staff lounge' it is not very practical - some sort of consistency across projects would be useful.  At least [[Wikibooks:Village pump]] should be a redirect (which I have just made it).  Having finally found the page (from 'recent changes, and even then it's not necessarily obvious that 'staff lounge' is the place to go) I thought of checking the main page - but even then I couldn't find a link. Please consider making this a little more friendly towards existing Wikimedia users - after all, I imagine that is where most contributors will come from! --[[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 00:50, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I agree. Since http://en.wikiversity.org/ is already reserved, I would also support the idea of moving the Wikiversity there as quickly as possible, and give Wikibooks again a real community portal page. Who has the power of doing this? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 14:34, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Done. It's now one of the first links on the [[Main Page]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:00, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

== Wiki promotion ==
I am in interested in giving public speeches regarding Wikimedia projects, especially this one.  I was unable to find any sort of packet to help promote the project.  It would seem that creating information on how to talk about the Wiki culture and get people interested in Wikibooks.  The goals of a Wiki have obvious answers and many of the ethics that regard wikis are easily found, however a document with answers to pressing questions that one would be confronted with in a presentation would be a worthy endeavor.  Is there a WikiBook regarding the promotion of Wiki, and certain specific Wikis present and I have missed it possibly?  Thanks in Advance.

--[[User:Arckanghel|Arckanghel]] 03:28, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: ''Is there a WikiBook regarding the promotion of Wiki...?'' I think [[Wiki Science]] is intended to discuss promoting and presenting wiki, but it's a long way from being finished. Are there any &quot;pressing questions&quot; that it doesn't answer? Please add those questions to the book, even if you don't yet know the answers. The [http://wiklossary.nearlythere.com/ wiklossary] is also intended to help new people learn about wiki culture. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 08:20, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibook news? ==

I don't want to spend ages searching. I keep coming up against negatiev comments about this venture and [[wikiversity]] and there's little discussion here and of long ago. Is it dying? I'm trying to read and edit Philosophy here and it's very slow compared with [[wikipedia]] and needs work which I don't yet know how to do to move from one page to another more easily. If I am out of order, please excuse: I'm just trying to learn. And why am I 81.86.91.82 and not a name? [[User:81.86.91.82|81.86.91.82]] 08:29, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Wikibooks isn't dying, it's just very, very small compared to Wikipedia. We have maybe a few hundred pages in a few dozen books, they have 500,000 pages! Also, most of the contributors here have already had experience with Wikipedia so don't often have any new questions, leaving this Staff lounge eerily quiet. And the books rarely have unnecessary pages added so there's very little deletion activity either.
:As for how to &quot;be a name, not a number&quot;, you can [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]] and specify a username. Accounts don't carry over between Wikimedia projects, you have to start a new account on each Wiki you want to have an identity on.
:As for how to move information around, it depends. If you want to move a section of text to a different page, just copy and paste from one edit box into the next, ideally saying something like &quot;copied Plato section from Introduction page&quot; or whatnot in the edit box, just to acknowledge you didn't write it but are merely moving it. If you want to put something on a new page just [[create a link to your new page's name]] and click through to edit it. If you want to move an existing page to a new name you will need both an account and a certain number of edits (I think) to unlock the function.
:I hope that's answered everything, and if not you can ask some more. Oh and if you want a page moved but find you don't have the power (again, I forget if a number of edits are required like for WP) just give me a shout [[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|on my Talk page]] and I'll do it for you in a jiffy. :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 13:42, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::In contrast to what Master Thief Garrett says, please do '''not''' copy and paste articles to move them.  Please move them according to [[WB:MOVE|policy]].  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 07:22, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

== Controversial Issues ==

Your site mentions a list but gives no link.  I have a real problem with wikibooks making available information which is ONLY useful to cause harm.  To claim to have a neutral point of view is intellectually vacuous.  Everybody is biased.  English speakers are, humans are and so are warm blooded animals.  Anyway, if Wiki is going to pretend to be above any common sense or judgement then I predict it will fail because sooner or later it will be linked to egregious acts which it contributed to in a reprehensible way.  On the other hand, could you direct me to the wikibooks on hacking, virus writing, getting away with rape and murder and how to run a con on an old lady?  Thanks! - [[User:63.81.122.66|63.81.122.66]]

: First of all, the NPOV debate has been going on forever. Philosophically it's all a bunch of nonsense anyway, so I'd just forget about it. The point they're trying to make is that you should be aware that if you post something too controversial, another user may delete it. That's about all you can really say in practical terms.

: Regarding the other issue, it's fallacious to believe that a book entitled, say, &quot;How to get away with rape and murder&quot;, is only of use to those who may seek to commit those crimes. It would also serve as a guide for those who wish to prevent themselves falling victim to the same crimes, since, without knowing how these crimes work, there is no way to defend yourself against them. Arguably the same information would be available in a book entitled &quot;How to protect yourself from rape and murder&quot;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:55, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

: Has anyone seen my +1 Mace of Troll-Slaying...? :P [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 15:33, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:: First off, the NPOV thing isnt going to cause the downfall of wiki. People might not be perfect, but i see no reason why this project can't try to rise above the mob. Many institutions in this world have risen up out of the nonsense that is &quot;the masses&quot;. Second, we are currently in an undeletion debate over the &quot;Manual of Crime&quot; book here. The general concensus is to delete that book because it is not a good thing to have here. We also, to my knowledge, don't have any books on hacking or virus authoring. We do have a book on software reverse engineering, although that book stresses the legal methods, and not the illegal ones. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 18:41, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

[[WB:NPOV]] is a better place to discuss this.

== Wiki etiquette? ==

I've come across a page with some dreadfully inaccurate information.  I have materials with correct information that I've already written.  Is it considered rude to erase someone else's incorrect info and replace it with a new, correct article?

Thanks, [[User:Enyo|Enyo]] Nov 2 2005, 12:46 PST

: Hello Enyo. I'd say the person or people who compiled the page &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; take umbrage at your rewriting it completely, but if you leave a note on its talk page gently indicating why you did whatever you might do, I'd hope they'd be less likely just to revert whatever contribution you make. Even if they did, you and they would then have the material on record with which to try to reach some consensus. A friendly reminder (to myself as well, as I type it): One person's correct and unbiased info might be another's incorrect and biased  propaganda, so strive for as [[m:NPOV|NPOV]] a presentation as possible. I think that's the idea.

: Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 23:08, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

Hmm....  The subject is a long, extended period in history that currently only has a few paragraphs under a couple of headings.  There are only two paragraphs that I would replace, as each one comprises its own section.  What I would replace it with is much longer, more detailed, and so forth.  I'm wondering if, at this point, perhaps it would be less problematic if I just a.) didn't bother or b.) set it up another page.  Of course, I could always cite sources correcting this info in the talk section, which would assist in making it less of a slap, right?

Thanks for the tip.  Unfortunately, while I *take* criticism very well, I suck at tactfully giving it to strangers.  :P

Thanks, --[[User:Enyo|Enyo]] 00:19, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

: If you're at all worried that altering the current page might open some floodgates of rebuke, I'd say place your version on an alternate page and perhaps add a link to it at (say) the top of the original page. (I happen to've done something along these lines recently, although without adding a link on the original page; see [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight]] and [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity]] - and by all means leave a comment if you wish!). Note however that this would create a fork in the material between the original page and your alternative that would need to be closed before a version of the book could be declared complete.

: I reckon, though, there shouldn't be any great problem if you went ahead and edited/replaced the original; whatever you do, the original will be retained in the history. [[m:Be bold|&quot;Be bold!&quot;]] is, I believe, the order of the day - and I'd say cite your sources on whichever page you use for your material rather than a talk page.

: Should you need any support or a third-party opinion, just give me a shout. Good luck!&lt;/br&gt;
: [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 04:30, 3 November 2005 (UTC)


See, I'm brand spanking new to Wikipedia.  I'd started writing a text on this subject based on my research that I'd collected over the years on the subject for NaNoWriMo.  Generally, when I start some creative endeavor, my husband points out something similar in nature that's already been done and tells me that there's no point in trying to reinvent the wheel.  This time, he pointed out the utter lack of what I'm attempting, and suggested that I add to Wikibooks.  (He believes that wikipedia and her sister projects are the greatest things in the history of the internet.)

So, I don't really know if there's Wiki-cliques and so forth.  I try to not make a huge splash until I get to know the lay of the land (like mailing lists, blog sites, and so forth), and this is kind of my effort to learn wikirules before I start slashing and burning someone *else*'s efforts.  After all, someone took the time to attempt to disseminate information that they, for some reason, believed to be true and correct.  Does a virtual stranger have the right to come in and kick over their sand castle, even if it *is* done in the pursuit of knowledge?  Or does wikiculture place higher status on the correctness of information versus someone's feelings?

You know, I really do appreciate your feedback to this babe in the woods.  :-)  I've already gone ahead and started a new page, since I'd done that without understanding that it *is* okay to edit someone else's work, and it's designed to be done that way.  Until I hear from the project's organizers, I'll just do that.  :-)

*goes and checks out the contributer in question*  Hmm...  Maybe it's not such the big deal that I'd thought it might be.  The author in question has only made three contributions to Wikibooks, all three of them relating only to those two paragraphs.  I might be worrying about hurt feelings for nothing.

--[[User:Enyo|Enyo]] 04:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

: Hello again. Yes, from evidence such as the lists [[m:Wikipedian|here]] I suspect there are &quot;Wiki-cliques&quot;, although I don't know how far supporting a clique (subconsciously) features in members' activites. I'd say a good way to 'learn the rules' &amp;ndash; or rather, 'a constructive way to work' &amp;ndash; is to [[m:Be Bold|be bold]] and see what gives. Don't forget that even if you feel you're &quot;kicking over some's sandcastle&quot;, their magnum opus is only one step back in the history attached to every editable page. I'd also say (hope) that as regards prioritising being correct and being sensitive, wikiculture just doesn't go there (at least not officially) but rather leaves an ever-fluctuating balance to emerge between the two. Well, something like that.

: Congratulations on your unspartan but concise new page, which I think is appropriate as it whets the appetite without expanding everything mentioned. I haven't located the page it's meant to replace, but if that page is as you descibe I'd say you might as well replace it with your work. Remember, the original page will be retained in the history. To aid those who want to read further, how about turning a few keywords into links to other pages in the wikibook, or Wikipedia articles, etc &amp;ndash; even if they are yet to brought into existence (i.e. the links appear in red) ? &amp;nbsp;I've created five within [[Ancient History/Greece/Sparta|the first three paragraphs]] as examples, all but one pointing to Wikipedia articles; if you decide to take up my suggestion (it's entirely up to you; you may prefer the plain text) then these may in turn be better made to point to other relevant pages/sections in the wikibook as it grows. I've also taken the liberty &amp;ndash; shock horror &amp;ndash; &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; (I hope you'll be relieved to hear) to &quot;knock over your sandcastle&quot; but to edit it a little, including changing a couple of phrases that read to me as unattributed [[w:POV|POV]]s. As with everything that happens to an editable page, you're welcome to revert the changes, in this case with the extra knowledge that the person who made the changes won't be offended. You certainly might want to remove the comments (the stuff between and including the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; markings) that I've added as a consequence. Many of my changes are simply alternative suggestions to your turns of phrase (i.e. perhaps more international).

== &quot;source&quot; HTML markup ==

I noticed that the computer science texts generally use indentation for example source code, as follows

 #!/usr/bin/perl

 for ($x = 0; $x &lt; 10; $x++) {
    print &quot;number $x&quot;;
 }

rather than the HTML &quot;source&quot; markup:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

for ($x = 0; $x &lt; 10; $x++) {
    print &quot;number $x&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Is it appropriate to use the &quot;source&quot; attribute?  --[[User:Dinomite|Dinomite]] 17:36, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

:It is appropriate, and if you have the expertise, maybe you could work on updating some of them? The &amp;lt;source&amp;gt; tags are a relatively new addition to the software, so many older books don't have it. I tried to update the python book using bot to use the source tags, but there were so many irregularities among the code examples that I made more of a mess then I fixed. If you can do some, that would be great. Otherwise, maybe we could start making a list of pages that need to be updated, so everybody could participate? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:02, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

== What's up with the over-protection ==

Coming from the most vandalized wiki (the English Wikipedia), I have to say there is an unsettling amount of page protection going on here. This runs counter to the defining quality of wikis, which makes them so great. I saw a couple of simple typos I wanted to correct, but couldn't because they were protected. I don't know if these pages are fully protected or just semi-protected (no anon edits), but it doesn't really matter. As editing Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and Commons, takes up all my time already, I have no plans to be a consistent or even semi-consistent editor for WikiBooks, and thus see no reason to create a user account at this time.
With me, WikiBooks is only losing two trivial edits, but in general is probably losing much much more as far as potential editors go.

A few years ago, I merely read articles on Wikipedia and didn't think to edit them, however after seeing some obvious spelling and grammar errors, that &quot;edit this page&quot; button was just begging to be clicked on. Everytime I ran into an error when reading articles, I would fix it. I found myself going out of my way to correct articles (i.e. going to pages I had no interest in reading). When I got involved to the point where I was going to talk and other namespace pages, I decided to get a username to be part of the community - not to simply edit articles. If I didn't have this open experience, I wouldn't be a Wikipedia editor at all, let alone a very dedicated one. I got involved with Commons and Wiktionary in much the same way, usually because of trans-wiki linking. Likewise, I came here to find a appropriate link to use on Wikipedia, saw a couple of errors I wanted to correct on my way, which could have been my first step into being a full-time editor, but got derailed by all the protected pages. I'm sure others feel the same. This is very unfortunate, as WikiBooks has lots of potential, but desperately needs more editors.

Vandalism sucks, but it's small price to pay for freedom. Vandals are annoying, but editors are more important.

On Wikipedia, we have a behavioral guideline called &quot;[[w:WP:AGF|Assume good faith]]&quot;, I suggest WikiBooks adopt this too.

Sincerely,

one less editor aka [[User:68.74.158.43|68.74.158.43]] 17:48, 11 November 2007 (UTC)
:I'm sorry you won't be editing. I'm not sure which pages you're referring to. So far as I know, Wikibooks actually has far less page protection than Wikipedia. Assuming good faith doesn't mean unprotecting everything; there is a balance to be had. If you like, feel free to tell us where the balance is off.

::''moved to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General#What's up with the over-protection]]

::Pages which are high-profile tend to be protected because of long histories of vandalism and abuse. Due to extensive blocking of open proxies, this may no longer be an issue of concern, but nobody yet has breeched the subject of unprotecting these pages. Some pages which are not high-profile may also have been protected because of some vandalism in the past, and simply never been unprotected as they should have been. In these cases, you should let us know which pages are protected, and mention that they likely shouldn't be. Most pages that are protected against vandalism are only protected against anonymous users. It's a price that we have been willing to pay to help prevent vandalism. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:15, 12 November 2007 (UTC)

:: Too much of a price in my opinion.  One of the very basic principles of Wikis are that ANYONE can edit.  I can possibly understand a temporary protection of hghly vandalised Wikipedia pages like George W Bush but on Wikibooks no page other than the main page or the userpage of highly active admins needs protection.

:::I would tend to agree with you xania. Vandalism has decreased dramatically, and many of the pages that used to be high-traffic (such as the bookshelves) are being rendered obsolete. I think that there are very few pages now that need to be protected, and with few exceptions I think that we can unprotect them as we find them. There are a few pages, such as the main page and some of the policy pages that I think probably should stay protected, but that's a matter of personal preference. Also, I am keeping my own personal user and user talk pages move-protected as insurance against page-move vandalism, but that's also just a personal preference. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:38, 12 November 2007 (UTC)

:::Lately if I protect a page, I have been making use of the expire field to limit the protection to 3 months, so it expires on its own without accidentally forgetting about it. Maybe including an expire time should be encouraged more for any pages that are protected. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:26, 13 November 2007 (UTC)

:::::Expiry is definitely a Good Idea. I'd warn against wholesale unprotection though; pages should be unprotected on a case-by-case basis (just as they are protected on a case-by-case basis).

I agree with both of you.  We should have a short list of highly-vandalised books which can be protected and make sure that any other protections are done with an expiry date or a month or so.  Personal pages obviously are excluded as it's your choice whether you want to protect it or not (I protected mine a while ago so it's probably still protected).

== need help you guys  ==

hello wikibooks,  thank you for helping me help. I am a new student who majored in anthropology in Indonesia. I am very interested in this, I need your help? if you guys could help me to give you a little about why the birth of a sociology of human life, and how sociology can get to another country? and how the thinking of sociology in generally? 
please give me reason 
thank you

I am new to Wikibooks. Can anyone suggest me how to see books?

:Sociology (only applies to human societies, even if structured societies aren't exclusively human). I would venture stating that today we live in a globalized world that social differences are increasingly diminishing making divergences more cultural artifacts than social imperatives.
:Sociology, the reflection or study of social interactions, social institutions and the individual in society is often pointed as rooted in Wester philosophies but I think that it would be safe to state that no society could have been evolved in complexity without proper reflection about the desired structure (the vested interests of participants).
:I do not understand fully your question &quot;how sociology can get to another country?&quot;, the pursuit of social sciences and science in general is not limited by borders. On the other hand sociology lives by access to social data, I guess that in a closed or secretive societies there may some difficulties but as all science today it depends on the academia.

== Bad archive access button ==

[https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1664448 Here] (in 2009) a &quot;kind of link&quot; for getting access to &quot;Current discussions and archives&quot; is supposedly added.  I do not know what it was supposed to do; but the implementation did and does involve a &quot;searchbutton&quot; with the label &quot;Search current discussions and archives&quot;.

Pushing this button yielded (presently) a list of 304 pages with the prefix &quot;Wikibooks:Reading room&quot; in a rather scrambled order. First come a few subpages, then some archives from 2015, then some archives from 2009 and 2010,  When I pushed it again later, the archives from 2015 were gone from the first 40 items, but there were a number of even older archives added; these 40 items now contain some archives from 2003 to 2013 (inclusive). The order they appear inseemingly  has nothing to do with the dates of last changes.

'''The reason for the touble seems to be, that there is a search filter
::''fulltext=Search+current+discussions+and+archives''
'''However, to search pages for the occurrense of the word '''''current''''' is ''not at all'' the optimal way to find the most current pages.''' (:-)

If someone knows how to implement a search by latest date of change instead, that would be great.  Else, that button could preferrably be removed, and perhaps the page [[WB:Reading room/Archives]] instead updated a bit, I think.

==Music==
I have no problem with the move from &quot;Music theory&quot; to &quot;Music&quot; but I'm curious as to the reason. Taking a quick glance at your work so far, I would say most of my concerns may be with your meta-theory, not your theory (as would be expected as accurate basic theory sources abound). For instance: &quot;Theory is the underlying foundation that unites every song. It explains everything.&quot; First, you are partly talking about analysis, but this is a fine point. More importantly &quot;musicology fastidiously declares issues of musical signification off-limits to those engaged in legitimate scholarship.&quot; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_musicology) I would have taken the following paragraph from Wikipedia: &quot;Music theory is a set of systems for analyzing, classifying, and composing music and the elements of music. Narrowly it may be defined as the description in words of elements of music, and the interrelationship between the notation of music and performance practice. The academic study of music is called musicology.&quot; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theory) And I would have added, &quot;Broadly, theory may be considered any statement, belief, or conception of music.&quot; (which I'm doing now).

Hopefully I don't come off as disapproving of this project or your efforts. For now I think I'll talk before I edit, as I don't want to paste of your meanings and intents. [[User:Hyacinth|Hyacinth]] 18:43, 14 May 2004 (UTC)

Heya! I didn't really write that introduction; somebody else did and I revised it (view the history for details), though it is possible, perhaps not unlikely, that I have made a few dubious revisions. I'm not sure about using the longer Wikipedia quote (&quot;Music theory is a set of systems...&quot;) because it doesn't really get to the essence of what I feel music theory to be, essentially, a meta-language of music.

Anyway, you don't need to Talk before editing (unless it's something really drastic), just go ahead and do it. :) It's not as though I own the book, after all. If I wanted to, I wouldn't put it on a wiki. ;)

By the way, since you asked, I moved it to Music since that's where I would have put it myself (in fact, that's how I found out that you already started the book). The reason for that is I would use the &quot;Music&quot; namespace for chapters, and I think it'd be most consistent if the name of the book, as far as the wiki page title goes, matched the namespace. I might reverse it, though, i.e., have Music redirect to Tonal_Music_Theory, but the chapters would still use the Music namespace. The issue is further confused because Wikibooks still hasn't settled on a convention for chapter titles of books.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Tablature and standard notation are two ways that musical information is shared. Sight-reading of standard notation is a requisite skill for teaching careers, session work, and the theater orchestra. Reading music increases your knowledge of music and allows you to notate your musical ideas. Each notation system has its advantages and disadvantages. Tablature does not convey timing and pitch information as well as standard notation does though it is more useful for showing bends and to what degree (1/4, 1/2 or full) they should be executed and other worded instructions such as pick scrapes and whammy bar effects. For these reasons many guitar transcriptions for rock, jazz and blues, use both standard notation and tablature. 

==Tablature==
You do not need to know how to read music to use tablature. Each string is represented by a line and on those lines numbers are used to indicate which fret to press down. 

Below is a simple melody in tablature.

[[Image:First-tune.png]] 

===Lower Section===
In the lower section of the example above, the top line represents the thinnest string of the guitar (high '''e''') and the lowest line represents the thickest string of the guitar (low '''E'''). Each number on a line represents a fretted note on that string. The number zero is an open string, the number one is the first fret, and so on.

The tab is divided into measures using bar-lines but the duration of the notes is not indicated. You can figure out the duration of the notes using the standard notation in the upper section. You can also work out the note values using the time signature; which in this example is four-four time. This means that there are four quarter-notes in each measure. The tempo or style, which is given at the top of a piece of sheet music, is also an indicator of how a song should be played.

The key signature is not shown in the example. Key signatures show which sharps , naturals, and flats are to be used; represented by #'s and b's. Each sharp or flat is shown on their respective line and space after the time signature.

===Upper Section===
The upper section of the example above is in standard notation and shows that the first bar has eight notes. Each note is represented by an oval note-head which indicates which note pitch is to be played. A stem with tails is used to indicate notes duration (how long the note is to be held). In standard notation only the whole-note is written without a stem. Because the notes in the first bar are all eighth notes with one tail they are connected with a single beam as shown in the example. The beaming of the same notes in a bar allows for easier reading. In a bar of music with mixed note values s single eighth note would be shown with a single tail. Sixteenth notes have two tails so a double beam is used when grouping.

The vertical bar-line after the last eighth note marks the end of one complete count of the time-signature. Bar-lines are used to show the pulse of the music and taken overall allows us to describe the form of a piece of music. The usefulness of using bar-lines to describe form is self-evident in the twelve bar blues whose title states that a cyclic group of twelve bars is to be performed. It is common to find musicians describing one complete thirty-two bar cycle of a jazz standard as a chorus. The term chorus is used to indicate how many times a song is to be repeated. A vamp on the thirty-two bar Jazz standard &quot;Misty&quot;, written by the pianist Errol Garner, would by convention start with all the musicians stating the melody with the following choruses dedicated to solo improvisation. The last chorus usually has the musicians stating the melody again without improvisation. The convenience of using the term chorus can be illustrated by imagining a four piece Jazz quartet with piano, saxophone, double bass and drums. If each musician is given a chorus to improvise over and the convention of all the musicians stating the melody on the first and last chorus is utilized then the song will have six choruses. The original hit recording of &quot;Misty&quot; as sung by Sarah Vaughan consisted of only one chorus with a four bar intro. Be aware that four and eight bar codas and intros are very common in Jazz and Blues and need to be taken into account when working out how many bars a chorus contains. 

In some forms of music there is a strong emphasis placed on the first beat of each bar. This is easily demonstrated by the Waltz time signature where the first beat of a count of three is emphasized for the dancers benefit in accord with the dance steps to be performed. If a note is tied over the bar-line with a curved tie-line then the note duration is held over to the next bar. Bars never have more notes in them than is indicated by the time signature. In the next bar there is a whole note which is a white oval with no stem. The two vertical black lines at the end are called a double bar-line indicating that the piece of music has ended.

==ASCII Tablature==
There is a very informal and loose standard of &quot;Internet Tablature&quot; using only ASCII characters. The above example would be written like this:
&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
    e---0-1-3-5-3-1-0----|-----------------||
    B------------------3-|-1---------------||
    G--------------------|-----------------||
    D--------------------|-----------------||
    A--------------------|-----------------||
    E--------------------|-----------------||
&lt;/font&gt;
It has the same disadvantages of tab and contains much less information than the standard notation of the upper section. Rhythm can only be suggested by spacing or by adding symbols above each note (such as Q for quarter note). Much Internet tablature does not even contain bar lines. The timing must be discerned by listening to the original piece. This is the major flaw of online tabs and this style of tab in general.

However, online tabs are often much more convenient than standard notation for precisely conveying a specific finger positioning. Especially with [[Guitar/Alternate Tunings|alternate tunings]] this is a clear advantage. 

Common Tab symbols:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Symbol !! Meaning
|-
| h or ^ || hammer on
|-
| p or ^ || pull off
|-
| b || bend string up
|-
| r || release bend
|-
| / || slide up
|-
| \ || slide down
|-
| v or ~ || vibrato
|-
| t || right hand tap
|-
| x || play 'note' with heavy damping
|}

Chords are often written in the form:
&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
    EADGBE  EADGBE  EADGBE
    xx0232  x32010  320003
&lt;/font&gt;

==Standard Notation==

===Notes On The Stave===
Here are the notes as they appear in standard notation. The set of lines and spaces that run horizontally across the page is called the staff or stave. Notes can be written on the lines and in the spaces. A common mnenomic for remembering the notes of the Treble Clef is:

''&quot;'''E'''very '''G'''ood '''B'''oy '''D'''eserves '''F'''udge&quot; and the word &quot;'''FACE'''&quot;
 
[[File: Notes on the staff.gif]]

The musical alphabet starts at the letter '''A''' and ends on the letter '''G'''. There are twelve sounds in music and seven letters to represent them. The other five sounds are the sharps or flats of these seven notes. Each step up the staff is the next letter, so it goes '''A''', '''B''', '''C''', etc.  The first symbol on the staff is always the clef; which in this case is the treble clef. The word ''clef'' is French for ''key'' and gives you the position of the first note. The treble clef shown here is also called the G clef. It is drawn so that the note '''G''' is indicated as being on the second line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word order in Spanish is not as rigid as it is in English.

It is normally SVO (subject - verb - object):
:''Juan comió una manzana'' (Juan ate an apple)

However, it is possible to change the word order to emphasize the verb or the object:
:''Comió Juan una manzana'' (VSO)
:''Una manzana comió Juan'' (OVS)
Note: To say &quot;An apple ate Juan,&quot; that is, Juan was eaten by an apple, insert the word &quot;a&quot; like this: &lt;br&gt;
:''Una manzana comió a Juan. '' (SVO)

The subject is frequently omitted because the verb ending already gives information about the person:
:''Yo comí una manzana'' (I ate an apple)
:''Comí una manzana'' (I ate an apple)
In the second sentence we know that I ate the apple because the verb ending would be different for all other persons.

If you want to say &quot;Juan ate it,&quot; the word order will have to be changed to accommodate the direct object pronoun:
:''Juan la comió'' (SOV)
This is always the word order when using a direct or indirect object pronoun.

In general, Spanish is very flexible because the core grammatical structure gives you the liberty of changing the order of words. A Spanish sentence can be constructed in a photographic manner so that you put words in the sentence in the same order you tend to think that you're observing them. Spanish tries to make possible the compatibility between the formal logic and the descriptive quality of the message.

The main departure from English grammar is that instead of an adjective-noun form, it's noun-adjective.  So, in English we would say blue car, while in Spanish you would say &quot;car blue&quot; (coche azul).  There are, as in many other languages, exceptions to this rule, particularly when the adjective has a double meaning.  For example, &quot;a poor man&quot; could be expressed as &quot;an unfortunate man&quot; (pobre hombre), or a &quot;wealth-less man&quot; (hombre pobre).  As a rule of thumb, the more permanent meaning dictates that the adjective go before the noun, but when in doubt, place the adjective ''after'' the noun.

==Cells==
[[File:Battery symbol1.svg]]

* Cell: Two materials with a voltage difference between them. This causes current to flow, which does work. Electrons travel from the cathode, do some work, and are absorbed by the anode.

* Anode: Destination of electrons.
* Cathode: Source of electrons.
* ions: An atom with an imbalance of electrons.

* cell operation: The cell runs and electrons are depleted at the cathode and accumulate at the anode. This creates a reverse voltage which stops the flow of electrons.

* irreversible: At some point the voltage difference reactions between the cathode and anode will decrease to a point that the cell in unusable. At this point, in an irreversible cell, the voltage difference is irreplaceably lost, and the cell is of no further use.
* reversible: Able to run the cell backwards.
* rechargeable: In a rechargeable cell, when the voltage difference between the cathode and anode decreases, the cell can be recharged, thereby increasing the voltage difference to a suitable level to allow continued use.
: humid air will discharge cells.
: cells are usually made of toxic or corrosive substances, for example lead and sulphuric acid. Such substances have been known to explode.

* Electronegativity [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity]


''What is the relationship between voltage and electronegativity?''

:Electronegativity is a concept in chemistry used to measure and predict the relative likelihood of a chemical reaction causing electrons to shift from one chemical to another resulting in ions and molecular bonds.  A battery cell operates by allowing two chemicals to react and supply ions to the anode and cathode.  When the supply of a reactant is consumed, the battery is dead.  It no longer produces different electrical potential at the anode and cathode driven by the chemical reaction.

:Voltage is the electrical potential of a point due to surrounding measurable electric charge distributions and points as calculated by application Coulomb's Law.  Voltage difference between two points connected by a conductor results in electron flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''slide''' is one of the simplest guitar techniques. There are two kinds of slides: shift slides and legato slides. In a shift slide, a note is fretted, then struck, and then the fretting finger slides up or down to a different fret, and the string is struck again. A legato slide differs in that the string is struck only for the first note.

[[Image:guitar-slide.png]]

The first slide pictured is a shift slide; the second is a legato slide. A few tablature writers do not distinguish between the two slides, using only shift slide notation. The abbreviation &quot;sl.&quot; for slide may be omitted. When sliding from a higher fret to a lower fret, the slanted lines are usually changed to have a downward slope instead of an upward slope, to emphasize the sliding &quot;down&quot;. It is possible to slide up from an open string, but this often does not sound as clean because this requires a [[../Hammer-ons, Pull-offs, and Trills|hammer-on]] at the first fret (or for really fast slides, a higher fret) before sliding up. Likewise, it is possible to slide down to an open string but it requires a pull-off at the first (or some other) fret.

In Internet tablature, a slide from the third fret to the fifth might be written like any of these:
    3/5
    3&amp;gt;5
    3&amp;gt;s&amp;gt;5
    3s5

Internet tablature rarely distinguishes between the two kinds of slides.

Less commonly, tablature can instruct the guitarist to &quot;slide into&quot; or &quot;slide out of&quot; a note. In printed tablature, they are notated identically except, in the case of slide-into, the first note is omitted, and in the case of slide-out-of, the second note is omitted. In other words, the note slides in from nowhere, or out to nowhere. It simply tells the guitarist to quickly slide from or to an arbitrary point, usually only a few frets away.

Good sliding keeps the new note audible, while keeping the note in tune.  If you don't press the string hard enough, you mute the string or buzz it on the frets.  Too hard and the string bends out of tune. The latter does not happen often, but sounds awful and should be avoided.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''RSA''' is an asymmetric algorithm for public key cryptography, widely used in electronic commerce. The algorithm was described in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman; the letters '''RSA''' are the initials of their surnames.

Clifford Cocks, a British mathematician working for GCHQ, described an equivalent system in an internal document in 1973. His discovery, however, was not revealed until 1997 due to its top-secret classification. 

The security of the RSA system relies on the difficulty of [[:w:Integer factorization|factoring very large integers]]. New fast algorithms in this field could render RSA insecure, but this is generally considered unlikely.

The algorithm was patented by MIT in 1983 in the United States of America. The patent expired 21 September 2000. Since the algorithm had been published prior to the patent application, it could not be patented in other countries.

== Operation ==

=== Key Generation ===

Suppose a user Alice wishes to allow Bob to send her a private message over an insecure transmission medium. She takes the following steps to generate a '''public key''' and a '''private key''':

#Choose two large prime numbers ''p'' &amp;ne; ''q'' randomly and independently of each other. Compute ''N'' = ''p q''.
#Choose an integer 1 &lt; ''e'' &lt;  ''N''  which is coprime to (''p''-1)(''q''-1).
#Compute ''d'' such that ''d e'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod (''p''-1)(''q''-1)). 
#Destroy all records of ''p'' and ''q''.
*(Steps 2 and 3 can be performed with the extended Euclidean algorithm; see modular arithmetic.  Additionally, solving for either e or d may be performed using the diophantine equation &lt;math&gt;ed - k\phi(n) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.)

''N'' and ''e'' are the public key, and ''N'' and ''d'' are the private key. Note that only ''d'' is a secret as ''N'' is known to the public. Alice transmits the public key to Bob, and keeps the private key secret.

You can generate and examine a real RSA keypair using OpenSSL and some Unix utilities.
( [[Cryptography/Generate a keypair using OpenSSL]] ).

=== Encrypting messages ===

Suppose Bob wishes to send a message ''m'' to Alice. He knows ''N'' and ''e'', which Alice has announced. He turns ''m'' into a number ''n'' &lt; ''N'', using some previously agreed-upon reversible protocol. For example, each character in a plaintext message could be converted to its ASCII code, and the codes concatenated into a single number. If necessary, he can break ''m'' into pieces and encrypt each piece separately. He then computes the ciphertext ''c'':

: &lt;math&gt; c \equiv n^e\ (\mathrm{mod}\ N) &lt;/math&gt;

This can be done quickly using the method of [[:w:exponentiating by squaring|exponentiation by squaring]]. Bob then transmits ''c'' to Alice.

=== Decrypting messages ===

Alice receives ''c'' from Bob, and knows her private key ''d''. She can recover ''n'' from ''c'' by the following procedure:

: &lt;math&gt; c^d \equiv n\ (\mathrm{mod}\ N) &lt;/math&gt;

Alice can then extract ''n'', since ''n'' &lt; ''N''. Given ''n'', she can recover the original message ''m''.

The decryption procedure works because

: &lt;math&gt; c^d \equiv n^{e \cdot d}\ (\mathrm{mod}\ N)&lt;/math&gt;

and ''ed'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''p''-1) and ''ed'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''q''-1). Fermat's little theorem yields 

: &lt;math&gt; n^{e \cdot d} \equiv n\ (\mathrm{mod}\ p) &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; n^{e \cdot d} \equiv n\ (\mathrm{mod}\ q) &lt;/math&gt;
which implies (as ''p'' and ''q'' are ''different'' prime numbers)
: &lt;math&gt; n^{e \cdot d} \equiv n\ (\mathrm{mod}\ pq) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Signing Messages ===

RSA can also be used to sign a message. Suppose Alice wishes to send a signed message to Bob. She produces a hash value of the message, encrypts it with her secret key, and attaches it as a &quot;signature&quot; to the message. This signature can only be decrypted with her public key. When Bob receives the signed message, he decrypts the signature with Alice's public key, and compares the resulting hash value with the message's actual hash value. If the two agree, he knows that the author of the message was in possession of Alice's secret key, and that the message has not been tampered with since.

== Security ==

Suppose Eve, an eavesdropper, intercepts the public key ''N'' and ''e'', and the ciphertext ''c''. However, she is unable to directly obtain ''d'', which Alice keeps secret. The most obvious way for Eve to deduce ''n'' from ''c'' is to factor ''N'' into ''p'' and ''q'', in order to compute (''p''-1)(''q''-1) which allows the determination of ''d'' from ''e''. No polynomial-time method for factoring large integers on a classical computer has yet been found, but it has not been proven that none exists. See integer factorization for a discussion of this problem.

It has not been proven that factoring ''N'' is the only way of deducing ''n'' from ''c'', but no easier method has been discovered (at least to public knowledge.) 

Therefore, it is generally presumed that Eve is defeated in practice if ''N'' is sufficiently large.

If ''N'' is 256 bits or shorter, it can be factored in a few hours on a personal computer, using software already freely available. If ''N'' is 512 bits or shorter, it can be factored by several hundred computers as of 1999. It is currently recommended that ''N'' be at least 1024 bits long.

In 1993, Peter Shor showed that a quantum computer could in principle perform the factorization in polynomial time. If (or when) quantum computers become a practical technology, Shor's algorithm will make RSA and related algorithms obsolete.

Should an efficient classical factorization code be discovered or a practical quantum computer constructed, using still larger key lengths would provide a stopgap measure. However, any such security break in RSA would obviously be ''retroactive''. An eavesdropper who had recorded a public key and any ciphertext produced with it (easily found by just recording traffic to that public key's owner), could simply wait until such a breakthrough. And then decipher that cyphertext into the plaintext message. Therefore, it is inherently unsafe to exchange long-term secrets with RSA or any cypher with similar vulnerabilities.

== Practical considerations ==

=== Key generation ===

Finding the large primes ''p'' and ''q'' is usually done by testing random numbers of the right size with probabilistic primality tests which quickly eliminate most non-primes. If such a test finds a &quot;probable prime&quot;, a deterministic test should then be used to verify that the number is indeed prime.

''p'' and ''q'' should not be 'too close', lest the Fermat factorization for ''N'' be successful. Furthermore, if either ''p''-1 or ''q''-1 has only small prime factors, ''N'' can be factored quickly and these values of ''p'' or ''q'' should therefore be discarded as well.

One should not employ a prime search method which gives any information whatsoever about the primes to the attacker. In particular, a good random number generator for the start value needs to be employed. Note that the requirement here is both 'random' '''''and'''''  'unpredictable'. These are not the same criteria; a number may have been chosen by a random process (i.e., no pattern in the results), but if it is predictable in any manner (or even partially predicatable), the method used will result in loss of security. For example, the random number table published by the Rand Corp in the 1950s might very well be truly random, but it has been published and thus can serve an attacker as well. If the attacker can guess half of the digits of ''p'' or ''q'', they can quickly compute the other half (shown by Coppersmith in 1997).

It is important that the secret key ''d'' be large enough. Wiener showed in 1990 that if ''p'' is between ''q'' and 2''q'' (which is quite typical) and ''d'' &lt; ''N''&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt;/3, then ''d'' can be computed efficiently from ''N'' and ''e''.
The encryption key ''e'' = 2 should also not be used.

=== Speed ===

RSA is much slower than DES and other symmetric cryptosystems. In practice, Bob typically encrypts a secret message with a symmetric algorithm, encrypts the (comparatively short) symmetric key with RSA, and transmits both the RSA-encrypted symmetric key and the symmetrically-encypted message to Alice.

This procedure raises additional security issues. For instance, it is of utmost importance to use a strong random number generator for the symmetric key, because otherwise Eve could bypass RSA by guessing the symmetric key.

=== Key distribution ===

As with all ciphers, it is important how RSA public keys are distributed. Key distribution must be secured against a man-in-the-middle attack. Suppose Eve has some way to give Bob arbitrary keys and make him believe they belong to Alice.  Suppose further that Eve can ''intercept'' transmissions between Alice and Bob. Eve sends Bob her own public key, which Bob believes to be Alice's. Eve can then intercept any ciphertext sent by Bob, decrypt it with her own secret key, keep a copy of the message, encrypt the message with Alice's public key, and send the new ciphertext to Alice. In principle, neither Alice nor Bob would be able to detect Eve's presence. Defenses against such attacks are often based on digital certificates or other components of a public key infrastructure.

=== Timing attacks ===

Kocher described an ingenious unexpected new attack on RSA in 1995: if the attacker Eve knows the hardware of Alice and is able to measure the decryption times for several known cyphertexts, she can deduce the decryption key ''d'' quickly. To thwart this attack, the decryption code should decrypt in constant time. This is known as '''RSA blinding'''.

=== Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attacks ===

In 1998, Daniel Bleichenbacher described the first practical adaptive chosen ciphertext attack, against RSA-encrypted messages using the PKCS #1 v1 redundancy function (a redundancy function adds structure to an RSA-encrypted message, so it is possible to determine whether a decrypted message is valid.)  Due to flaws with the PKCS #1 scheme, Bleichenbacher was able to mount a practical attack against RSA implementations of the Secure Socket Layer protocol, and potentially reveal session keys.  As a result of this work, cryptographers now recommend the use of provably secure redundancy checks such as Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding, and RSA Laboratories has released new versions of PKCS #1 that are not vulnerable to these attacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A harmonic interval consists of two notes played at the same time or consecutively. The distance between the two notes is called an [[Music_Theory/Scales_and_Intervals|interval]].

A predominant type of harmonic interval known as the '''power chord''' consists of the root note of the chord and a fifth. An advantage to understanding power chords is their shape can be used to quickly determine the location of perfect intervals.  This improves ones overall understanding of the location of notes on the fingerboard by relation to one another and builds the groundwork for understanding [[Guitar/Scales|scales]].

A chord is named after its root note, which is typically the lowest note. E.g. a C chord consists of the notes C E G, with C most likely to be the lowest note. Chords may be modified by &quot;inverting&quot; them, which means to reorder the pitch of the notes by raising or lowering them an octave, e.g. playing a C chord as E G C, which would be named C\E.  However, the general rule of thumb among guitarists is to refer to a chord by its lowest note. For details on variations, please see the [[Guitar/Chords|chords]] section.

A basic understanding of [[Guitar/Tablature|tablature]] is essential for understanding this, and most other sections of this book.

==Power Chords==
Perfect fifths (e.g., C-G) and their inversion, perfect fourths (e.g., G-C), are the most consonant interval on the guitar (and in all of music for that matter), not counting unison and octaves. For this reason, playing a perfect fifth or fourth is often called a power chord.

It is more difficult to play the octave for a root note on the D string, because the B string is tuned differently than the other strings, and you will need to stretch further to reach the octave. Power chords are most commonly played on the thicker strings, and many songs exclusively use perfect fifth power chords.

===Perfect Fifths===
The simplest perfect fifth power chord uses the same fingering as an [[Guitar/Open Chords|E minor]] chord, except only the thickest three strings are played. Here is the fretting for the E5 power chord:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=1&gt;

File: E5 power chord for guitar (open).png|'''E5 Power Chord'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 

When you play a power chord in the open position (or any power chord), you have to be careful to [[Guitar/Muting and Raking|mute]] the other strings so they do not ring out. In this case, if you also played the G string, you would be playing a full chord, not a power chord. Use your extra fingers to lightly touch the other strings, use your fretting fingers to smother the unnecessary strings, or just avoid hitting the unnecessary strings with your impact hand.

Power chords, and really any chord types, are useful because they can be moved anywhere on the neck, as long as the relationship between the notes is the same. For example, in the E5, the thickest string plays an E, the next string plays a B (which is the fifth note of ''any'' E scale), and the next string plays another E, but an octave above it.

If you take the same chord pattern, and move it up the neck to make a different power chord. For example, take the two fretted notes, then use your first finger and fret the thick E string two frets behind the others. For example, if you were fretting the E string at the third fret, you would be playing a G5 which looks like this:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=1&gt;

File: G5 power chord for guitar (3rd fret).png|'''G5 Power Chord'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 

There are several different fingerings you can use to play a power chord, but it is best to choose one that lets you easily move the power chord up and down the neck.

Here are three most common fingerings for a power chord, in this case, a G5. In the second and third fingering, the two strings are barred at the fifth fret. The numbers indicate the number of finger to use. Finger #1 is the index finger, #2 the middle finger, #3 the ring finger, and finger #4 is the little finger.

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
    EADGBE        EADGBE        EADGBE
    ---xxx        ---xxx        ---xxx
  1 ......      1 ......      1 ......
  2 ......      2 ......      2 ......
  3 1.....      3 1.....      3 1.....
  4 ......      4 ......      4 ......
  5 .34...      5 .33...      5 .44...
&lt;/font&gt;

====Alternate Fingerings====
One common variation on the power chord involved omitting the second, higher octave note. For example, a G5 without the second G would look like this:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=1&gt;

File: G5 power chord for guitar (omit octave).png|'''G5 Power Chord with the octave omitted'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 

These are easier to play because you only need two fingers and the sound is similar to the three string version.

Since a power chord is just playing multiple strings that produce only two tones, it is possible to play all six strings and still be playing a power chord. Some [[Guitar/Alternate Tunings|open tunings]] set the guitar up so that when you strum it open, it plays a power chord. Here is an example of a full G5 chord, where all strings are either playing a G or a D.

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
    EADGBE
    --00--
  1 ......
  2 ......
  3 2...11
  4 ......
  5 .4....
&lt;/font&gt;

This chord can be considered a non-traditional power chord, since in popular music, power chords usually use only two or three strings. This is also a hard fingering for the beginner, but it emphasizes an important fact about double stops: as long as you keep adding octave or unison notes, you will ''always'' be playing the same interval. Playing a non-octave or unison note will instead produce a chord.

Adding unison notes may sound different even though they are supposed to produce the same pitch. This may be because the strings have different tension or thickness. In general, the guitar's thinner strings will have a brighter, more ringing sound.

===Perfect Fourths===

Perfect fourths have a slightly more suspended sound than perfect fifth chords. These are easy to play, because most of the strings on the guitar are tuned in fourths. This means that playing any two of the thickest four strings, when they are beside one another and played at the same fret. For example, a D4 is played like this:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=1&gt;

File:D4 power chord for guitar.png|'''D4 Power Chord with the octave omitted'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
    EADGBE
    xx00xx
&lt;/font&gt;

These can easily be moved up the neck. For example, a G4 or a B4 would be played like this:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=2&gt;

File:G4 power chord for guitar omit octave.png|'''G4 Power Chord with the octave omitted'''
File:B4 power chord for guitar omit octave.png|'''B4 Power Chord with the octave omitted'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
    EADGBE     EADGBE
   (33xxxx)   (x22xxx)
&lt;/font&gt;
Perfect fourths are the same as the upper two notes of the original three-string power chord. It is rare to add a new top octave, but it may done. The following Power chords show the G4 and B4 with the octave added:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=2&gt;

File:G4 power chord with octave for guitar.png|'''G4 Power Chord with the octave'''
File:B4 power chord with octave for guitar.png|'''B4 Power Chord with the octave'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot; &gt;
    EADGBE     EADGBE
   (335xxx)   (x224xx)
&lt;/font&gt;
==Other Double Stops==

You can play a huge variety of different intervals by playing chords, and just plucking two notes at the same time. Often you can add variety to chord strumming by playing a quick fill by playing different sections of a chord, and achieving different intervals.

'''Modak''' is a deep fried [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] sweet that is almost exclusively prepared during the [[w:Ganesha#Festivals_and_Worship_of_Ganesh|Ganesha Festival]] around August, when it is often given as an offering to Lord [[w:Ganesh|Ganesha]], the elephant-headed Remover of Obstacles. Modak is reportedly his favorite sweet.

==Ingredients==
* Dough:
** 1 cup white wheat flour
** 1 cup [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]] flour
** pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
** pinch of [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
** 1 cup warm water
** oil for frying

* Filling:
** 1 [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]], grated finely (makes about two cups)
** 1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Jaggery|jaggery]] (or substitute raw [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]])
** 3/4 tablespoon powdered [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]]
In some parts of the country (coastal Maharashtra), modak is prepared using rice flour, as rice is the main crop of that region. There are slight changes in the preparation method as given below.

==Procedure==
# Prepare the dough; it should be dry but should stay a little sticky.
# Sprinkle it with oil and leave it covered for 1 hour.
# Melt the jaggery with 4 tablespoons of water in a non-stick pan until it is liquid.
# Add coconut.
# [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] for 15-20 minutes, until the mixture becomes very thick and almost dry.
# Mix in the cardamom powder and remove from the fire.
# Spread the mixture out on a metal tray to cool.
# Take a tablespoon-sized ball of dough and roll it out - using flour if it is sticky - into a disc 4 inches across.
# Put a tablespoon-sized lump of filling in the middle (it should be hardening well by now), wet the edges with a finger, and fold up the sides, crimping the dough into a peak at the top to completely seal in the filling.
# [[Cookbook:Deep fry|Deep fry]] the modak in oil until golden brown.

Servings: 20-25.

=== Procedure for rice modak ===

For making '''rice flour modak''', the procedure is the same for making the filling of coconut and jaggery. However, rice flour is used in the dough instead of wheat flour. They are not fried, but steamed.

The recipe

Ingredients

2 cups rice flour

2 1/2 cups water

1 tbsp butter

salt


For the filling

1 cup fresh grated coconut

1 cup jaggery

2 tbsp raisins

2 tbsp cashewnuts, chopped

1 tsp cardamom, powdered

Ghee


Method

For the filling

Method is similar to the one mentioned in the fried modak recipe.

For the steamed rice modak

Heat 2 cups of water in a large pot/vessel and then add salt and butter.

As the water starts boiling, add rice flour to the water. Lower heat. Mix well. The mixture should be a smooth paste; there should be no lumps. If mixture is becoming too dry then add the remaining 1/2 cup water. Keep heating on slow fire till rice flour is cooked.

Now, cover the mixture with a lid and switch of the gas.
Let it cook in its own steam.

While it is still warm rub some ghee on your palms and take a small portion . Make a ball out 
of it. With your thumb shape the ball into a cup. Put two teaspoons of the filling and close the ends in a manner to get the shape of a fresh fig. 

Make 10 modaks and place them in a colander grased with ghee. place the modak in such a way that they do not touch one  another in the colander.

Place the colander in a steamer and steam the modaks for 10 minutes. 

Dribble with a teaspoon of ghee and server hot.

'''Coffee''' beans are best fresh.  They must be roasted in order to be used, a process that typically takes place before the beans are sold. Roasting at home is less common, yet is quite feasible. This roasting starts a degradation process, whereby the oils and flavor compounds break down and generally become bitter and less flavorful.  Surface area is a large part of the degradation, so ground coffee degrades considerably faster than whole-bean coffee. The degradation process is accelerated by oxidation, ergo roasted coffee should be stored in airtight containers to minimize potential for oxidation to occur.

The flavors in coffee are extracted by water, forming a solution that is the coffee beverage; and there are a number of ways by which to extract these flavors. In all extraction methods, Coffee beans and water are combined, with water acting as a solvent to the volatile, aromatic compounds in the roasted coffee. The coffee must be ground specifically for each of these methods -- just as the increased surface area contributes to faster degradation, it also allows the rapid extraction of flavor by water. Grind particle sizes specific to each brewing method optimize the final results, creating more ideally extracted coffee beverages.

|}
&lt;/div&gt;
There are two basic methods by which this is done, either by allowing the grounds to sit in hot water and steep like tea, or by forcing hot water through the grounds.  Generally some combination of these two processes is done. Another process is cold brewing, which replaces the heat component that makes the volatile components of coffee soluble in typical brewing with time. This generally entails steeping ground coffee at room temperature for 8-12 hours (easily done overnight) and then removing the grounds from the prepared beverage by pouring through a strainer.

On the one extreme is the French press (''Figures 1 and 2'').  The grounds are placed into the bottom of a vessel and hot water is poured onto them.  The mixture sits for a few minutes (''A''), then a mesh strainer is pushed down onto the mass (''B'') and the coffee (''C'') is poured off to drink. French presses are also suitable for use in cold brewing, by using the same process with unheated water and steeping the proper amount of time.

The other extreme is espresso.  A fine grind of strong coffee is packed into a small metal container with a hole in the bottom.  Pressurized water is forced through the grounds, where it extracts a &quot;strong flavor,&quot; then falls into the pot below. A higher percentage of coffee solids are dissolved and extracted under pressure, creating an end product with less water by volume. Although some sources say that espresso is made with pressurized steam, no modern espresso machine actually works this way.  The pressure is usually driven by some type of electric pump, but older-style hand-operated pistons are also available. Steam pressure systems predate the modern espresso machine.

In America, the most common brewing method is the drip method, which is halfway between these two.  The grounds are placed in a basket with a non-reactive liner of paper or sometimes gold, with a small hole in the bottom.  Hot water is poured over the grounds, where it soaks the grounds and steeps for a short time while being slowly forced by gravity through the hole into the container below where it is kept warm (or at least insulated) while the brewing process finishes.  

[[Image:MokaCoffeePot.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Figure 3.'' Cross-section of an Italian percolator]]
In Italy, the most common method of brewing coffee is in a moka-style percolator (''Figure 3''), which emulates the function of the aforementioned steam pressure brewing systems. Water is placed in the lower section (''A'') and the raw coffee grounds in the mid-section (''B'') with the spout reaching below the water level. After the top section, initially empty, is affixed, the pot is placed on a heat source. As the water reaches boiling point it turns to steam and eventually creates sufficient pressure to force all the water from the lower section up the tube at once, through the grounds &amp;mdash; which are held in place by a metal filter above and below &amp;mdash; and through a second tube until it hits the lid of the pot and is collected in the upper section (''C''), producing a strong, concentrated coffee. Gaskets and safety valves to ensure a tightly closed unit allow for pressure to safely build up in the lower section and provide a necessary security release if this pressure gets too high.

There are many factors which contribute to the final result of any brewing process. First is the roast and quality of the coffee beans.  Freshly ground, newly roasted beans will always give a better cup of coffee than pre-ground, older beans.  Clean fresh water is necessary, and the temperature of the water will have some bearing on the result.  Cooler water will not extract flavors as efficiently as hot water, but boiling water can be a little too good with a very dark roast.  Lastly, the coarseness of the grind and the ratio of grounds to water are also important, and vary according to the brewing method used.

A good rule of thumb for beginning brewers is to use the simple drip method.  Use 2 tablespoons of finely ground coffee for every 6-7 oz of fresh water.  Bring the water just to a boil, then pour slowly over the grounds, stirring gently.  Stirring will result in the grounds retaining some extra water, but do not try to squeeze the water out.  When it stops dripping, the coffee is ready to drink.

== Use ==

Coffee is most commonly known simply as a beverage. The standard ways to drink coffee are with some combination of milk, cream and/or sugar, or with none of these. Many variations of coffee and milk (or cream) make up the standard fare of espresso bars.

Coffee is sometimes used in recipes, especially desserts, such as the Swedish [[Cookbook:Chokladboll|Chokladboll]]. The flavour of chocolate or cocoa is known to be enhanced by the addition of a small amount of coffee. For recipes using coffee as an ingredient, see [[:Category:Coffee recipes]].

==Everything past this point is notes==

Electromagnets are also used in loudspeakers.  You have a voltage that is dependent on the sound's pitch and volume which turns a magnetic field on and off, setting the loudspeaker vibrating. &lt;!-- so as the distance decreases the voltage increases and as the distance increases the voltage decreases.  The result is the ability to program the loudspeaker according to a vibration pattern. --&gt;

Microphone = Records sound

==The Loud Speaker==


{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Loud speaker.png]]
|-
| A cut through diagram of a typical speaker
|}

A speaker consists of a paper cone attached to a coil which acts as a small electromagnet. The coil is fitted over a permanent magnet, and as the current flows through the coil it is either attracted or repelled depending on which direction the current flows. A typical signal from an amplifier will be a varying a.c. current, and so the cone will vibrate back and forth at the same frequency as the current. As the cone vibrates, it sets up pressure waves in the air, which we hear as sound.

| '''Summary'''
|}

==The electric bell==
Once the battery is connected a current flows in the wire loops around the U shaped soft iron core. 

This turns the core into an electromagnet.

The electromagnet attracts the amateur which is also made of soft iron.

As the amateur moves towards the electromagnet, it causes the hammer to strike the bell. At the same time it breaks the circuit at X.

The break in the circuit causes the current to stop flowing.

The soft iron cores loses it's magnetic field and releases the amateur which springs back to its original position.

The contact screw touches the springy metal and completes the circuit. The whole cycle is repeated over and over until the battery is disconnected or runs down.

== Stopping to smell the roses? ==

&quot;Slowing it down&quot; and &quot;Do not stare&quot; directly contradict each other. In my experience the latter is especially true, and an easy way to end a lucid dream early. Recommending it in the section immediately before seems counterproductive. Any thoughts? [[User:CardboardCup|CardboardCup]] 19:21, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

: I think the problem (at least part of the time) is when you stare only at the point in the center of your vision and don't see anything in your peripheral vision. If you don't pay attention to your peripheral vision while staring at an object, it (your peripheral vision) can start to fade until you can eventually only see whatever it was you were staring at, and then not even that. (Or at least, that's happened to me before.) It also helps to see a lot of detail on whatever it is you stare at. I merged &quot;Slowing it down&quot; and &quot;Do not stare&quot;, but added a note about staring potentially making dreams fade at the end of the section. Let me know if you think &quot;Do not stare&quot; still needs its own section and we can try to find a compromise. :-) —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tharenthel|(Talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Tharenthel|(Contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:25, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== What you can do ==
From related Wikipedia article. I think this belongs to wikibooks. Maybe you can use incorporate it into the LD wikibook.
*[[Supernatural]] acts: Lucid dreamers, realizing they are dreaming, then go on to realize that normal limitations like gravity or &quot;solidity&quot; no longer apply, and it's possible to perform acts that can't be done in real life (e.g.: running faster than 50 miles per hour, or staying underwater for lengthy periods of time).
**[[Flying]]: One of the more common and pleasurable activities of lucid dreamers is flying.  Many lucid dreamers report they are able to float, fly and transport themselves anywhere in the dreamworld at will. With practice, so called &quot;impossible&quot; feats such as flying at supersonic speeds, or flying through objects are possible.
**[[Shapeshifting|Transformations]]: Some people believe that (after some practice) one can transform one's dream-self into real or fictional animals, or any number of other forms, including other people or general sex change. Some also claim to have tried sensory experiences not normally achievable while awake, such as 360 degree [[stereo vision]], [[sonar]] (bat) vision, and being able to modify one's body to try out being a different weight, height, gender, age, etc.
**Superreality observation: Since during a dream the dreamer's senses are not limited by physical or mental constrains, it is possible to observe reality &quot;in high definition&quot;. While looking at a tree from a big distance, for example, the dreamer should be able to see detail in each an every one of its leaves, without even having to &quot;zoom in&quot;.
*[[Spiritual practice]]: Some religions claim that lucid dream states give the dreamer a special kind of access to the spiritual world. By practicing [[prayer]] or [[meditation]] during a lucid dream, the dreamer can gain access to [[mystical]] [[Altered state of consciousness|states of awareness]] that would not be accessible from the waking state. Such practices are sometimes classified as &quot;dream yoga&quot;.
*Real-life rehearsal: Since the mental and physical effects of lucid dreaming are almost indistinguishable from real-life, dreamers can rehearse various things (such as stage performances, soccer moves, etc.) in a lucid dream and readily apply that to real-life. It is possible to essentially repeat the events of a lucid dream as many times as the dreamer desires. As such, the dreamer can explore the effects of any course of action within that dream and/or refine their course of action to get a desired effect without resorting to directly willing the desired effect to happen.
*Experience enjoyable activities (which may or may not be impossible in real life): E.g., having sex in any number of pleasing or fantastical ways, eating impossibly large meals while still enjoying each morsel as if it were the first, conversing with imaginary characters from books or movies, visiting faraway places, etc...
*Playing God: Because a dream is not actually real, it is possible for one to completely alter the nature of the universe within one's dreams and re-shape the reality of that dream however they wish. One can, in effect, become [[omnipotent]] within a lucid dream. This can sometimes be quite a &quot;power trip&quot;. While it is often difficult or impossible to manipulate people in a dream to act as you want, it is normally possible to just force them (physically) to do what you want.
*Creating an environment and letting a story unfold: You can put yourself at a starting environment (after opening this door, behind there will be a dungeon) and explore the place. You don't need (and actually can't) design the whole environment, and the details will pop out without your conscious intervention, and it is common that surprises often occurr in the dream. Be careful not to lose the control of the dream in this situation, as it is very easy to fade into a normal unconscious dream while following a story.
*Artistic Ideas: Looking for or requesting &quot;art&quot;, such as in the form of sculpture, painting or song, allows the dreamer to recall upon wakening new &quot;art&quot; ideas.
*&quot;Dream-time&quot;: It is believed by some that when one is proficient at lucid dream control, a person can extend the dream. A person could spend an entire week in a dream, while only being asleep for one night. Nevertheless, most lucid dreaming (and possibly normal dreaming) occurrs in close to &quot;real time&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

== &quot;Many people have also experienced realistic effects when trying drugs in dreams that they have never taken in real life.&quot; ==

I call BS, this is unprovable. I can't see how you can judge a 'realistic' effect if you dont have a real experience to compare it to. &quot;People claim to...&quot; would be more accurate
*maybe you are the one who claim to!
*It's true, I once got drunk in a dream before I had tried it in real life. It was pretty realistic, only I felt fantastic the next morning!
You could totally do this! Haven't you ever read a book on drugs? Looked at a pamphlet in a doctors office about marijuana? They list the effects! Sure, you might not be able to create the EXACT effect without trying the drug first, but I think drug effects can be emulated from imagination. Nothing is impossible.


I once had a dream that I was swimming underwater while smoking pot, and I felt as if I were melting and I had some sort of huge pressure on my brain....... I would like to wonder if this is an actual side effect of the drug...... [[User:68.190.51.8|68.190.51.8]] 05:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

What's with this?

:Last but not least: Edit Wikipedia/Wikibooks articles (see question 90 of the Wikipediholic Test) and see if the changes remain when you awake!

:Have precognition (your subconscious can be very good at predicting the future with relationships and career)

Why are those in there? I don't understand the point in checking if edits remain, as well as testing precognition - should this be included in the book or not?

== Rodovid.org ==

Thought I'd tell you about [http://rodovid.org Rodovid] which is proposed as a [[Rodovid.org|Wikimedia project]].--[[User:Bjwebb|Bjwebb]] 12:46, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

== France ==

Hello.  I had entered a suggestion about country-specific information in the discussion section of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy Wikipedia page on genealogy], and in response I got a suggestion by user [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ThuranX ThuranX] to come here and contribute to the Wikibook.  So I'm informing you that I'd like to contribute the section on France, currently empty, in the &quot;area-specific&quot; chapter.  For now, I am familiarizing myself with the content of the other pages for inspiration.  I would like to enter more information than just a collection of links.  Feel free to tell me what you think, and of course, once the section is started and has some structure, I'll be happy to see other contributions. [[User:Baudoin1|Claude]] 15:29, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

Claude, I joined Wikibooks just to do what you're doing, that is, improve this book. I'll help you out by working with you as your 'editor' on the france section as you add stuff. Hopefully together we can really make a great section. Some suggestions: A history of the Civil Registration process in france, esp. Napoleon's establishment of a uniform system; The religious records available, and widely encountered trend or problems, like the regions involved inthe Thirty Years' War having lost many parish records; and Records which may be unique to France, prehaps Bastille prisoners, or something like that? [[User:ThuranX|ThuranX]] 21:59, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Accuracy of information ==

I would really like to see a section on how to validate information for accuracy.  I have seen submitted information in geneology, which is completely false, and would like additional tips on how to verify accuracy of information.  Okay, I am becoming redundant, but cannot stress enough how important geneology is in terms to being correct.  I use USA the census records, birth and death records, newspaper clippings etcetera in my research.  What other tools are out there?  B.

:Documentary sources are legion, and there are other sites devoted to listing them.  One thing I would say, however, is that whatever you find, whatever you check: ''document it''!  Reference everything, even when you don't find what you might have been looking for (and thus prove by ''modus tollens'' some otherwise undocumented fact).  We should do all we can to encourage family historian's to cite their sources, because if the people we're researching had done so our job would be so much easier!  Even 'pers. comm.' (with details if possible) is better than having no idea of where or when some fact may have originated!  &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:Users:Samwilson|Sam Wilson]] (Australia) 05:09, 16 November 2007 (UTC)

== Australia == 

I'm planning to have a go at the Australian country-specific information - I've been doing genie researching in Australia for a few years now. I'm a newbie so please be kind if my markup is a bit dodgy to start with!

'''Fortran''' was created by a team lead by John Backus at IBM in 1957.  Originally, the name was written in all capital letters, but current standards and implementations only require the first letter to be capital.  The name ''Fortran'' stands for ''FORmula TRANslator''.  Initially it was specifically aimed at scientific calculations and thereby had very limited support for working with character strings and lacked other provisions important for a general purpose programming language, which it will attain later during its extensive (and still ongoing as of 2013) development that ensued after its successful debut.  Until the [[Programming:C|C]] language became popular, Fortran had been one of the few high level languages with a reasonable degree of portability between different computer systems.  Several websites indicate that the work on Fortran was started in 1954 and released commercially in 1957.  It is believed that the first successful compilation of a small Fortran program took place on September 20, 1954.

There have been several versions of Fortran.  Fortran I, II and III are considered obsolete.  The oldest Fortran versions which are considered of much use today were Fortran IV, and Fortran 66, which, as the name implies, was released in 1966.  All later versions of Fortran are numbered after the year the standard was released.  The versions of Fortran most commonly remaining in use are Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and Fortran 95.

In Fortran II, IF statements had the form:  IF (''numericExpression'') ''lineNumberIfNegative'', ''lineNumberIfZero'', ''lineNumberIfPositive''.  It also had an odd type of string literal, called Hollerith literals (after the inventor of the keypunch and IBM).  Where today one might code 'hello', Fortran II used 5Hhello.  However, there was no string variable type.

Fortran IV added the IF/THEN concept, the concept of logical expressions, with operators .AND., .OR., .EQ., .NE., etcetera.  Complex numbers as a basic type were also added.

Fortran 77 added strings as a distinct type.

Fortran 90 added various sorts of threading, and direct array processing.

Although Fortran became a standardized language early, many companies had their own extensions to it.  Strangely, IBM and DEC had virtually the same set of extensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==CMOS==
'''CMOS''' stands for '''C'''omplementary '''M'''etal-'''O'''xide-'''S'''emiconductor.  Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor refers to the construction method of the component Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), and Complementary means that CMOS uses both n-type (nMOS) and p-type (pMOS) transistors.  Older designs had used only n-type transistors, and are referred to as NMOS logic.

n-type MOSFETs are active (conductive) when their input voltage is high, while p-type MOSFETs are active when their input voltage is low.

All CMOS gates are arranged in two parts: the pull-up network (PUN), built from p-type transistors and connect to source; and the pull-down network (PDN), built from n-type transistors and connected to ground (also called drain).  The two parts are logical duals of each other, so that if the PUN is active, then the PDN is inactive, and vice-versa.  In this way there can never be a direct path between source and ground (in any steady state).

The biggest advantage of CMOS over NMOS is that CMOS has a rapid change from both hi-to-low and from low-to-hi.  NMOS transitions only slowly from low-to-hi (because it uses a resistor in place of a PUN), and since overall circuit speed must take into account the worst case, NMOS circuits must be much slower.

==Logic Gates==

===NOT===
The simplest CMOS circuit: the NOT gate, or inverter.  Although uncomplicated, it demonstrates the basic structure of a CMOS gate; a series of inputs (in this case, one) which are connected to the transistors, the PUN (consisting of a single p-type transistor) connected to source, the PDN (consisting of a single n-type transistor) connected to ground, and the output which is fed from both the PUN and PDN.

When the input voltage is high, the p-type transistor will be inactive, and the n-type transistor will be active.  This creates a connection between ground and the gate output, pulling the gate's output to low. Conversely, when the input voltage is low, the p-type transistor will be active instead, creating a connection between the output and source, pulling the gate's output to high.

===NAND===
The PUN for NAND consists of a pair of p-type transistors in parallel, one with the A input feeding it and one with the B input feeding it.  Therefore the PUN is active, and the output of the gate is high, as long as either of these inputs is low.

The PDN for NAND consists of a pair of n-type transistors in series, also each fed by one of the two inputs.  Therefore the PDN is active, and the output of the gate is low, only if both of the inputs are high.it uses the logic a bar(OR)b bar

A CMOS AND gate is constructed by driving a NOT gate from the output of a NAND gate.

|}

===NOR===
&quot;Upside down&quot; relative to the NAND gate, the NOR gate is made from a PUN of two p-type transistors in series and a PDN of two n-type transistors in parallel.

===OR===
As AND is to NAND, OR is to NOR.  CMOS OR is constructed by feeding the output of NOR to a NOT gate.

|-
| 1 || 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1
|}

===XNOR===
To build an XNOR gate, first we will need easy access to the inverted inputs.  This is accomplished with a pair of NOT gates.  The original inputs are A and B, and their inverted forms we will call NOT-A and NOT-B.  Both the PUN and PDN are made of four of the appropriate type of transistor, in two parallel sets, of series of two transistors each.  In the PUN there is one series fed by A and B and the other is fed by NOT-A and NOT-B; in the PDN one series is fed by A and NOT-B and the other is fed by NOT-A and B.

All told, this takes 12 transistors (4 in the PUN, 4 in the PDN, and 2 for each inverter).  There are more efficient designs for the XNOR circuit, but they require a more detailed analysis than we will go into here.  Instead of serving as an example of an actual XNOR design, this section should instead help to suggest the methods one could use to generate a CMOS circuit for any arbitrary boolean function.

|-

|-
| 1 || 0 || 0
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1
|}

===XOR===
If you've been following along, you may guess that an XOR gate is made by attaching a NOT onto the end of the XNOR; while this will produce ''a'' correct circuit, it is not the ''most'' correct (or efficient) circuit.  Instead, we could use the same 12 transistors and simply shuffle around the wires.  This is left as an exercise for the reader.
it uses the logic a.bbar(OR)abar.b

      <comment>described why meat that undergoes the roasting process should be rested.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}

'''Roasting''' is high-heat [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] with very little moisture. Roasted foods get drier and browned on the outside by initially exposing it to a high temperature. This keeps most of the moisture from being cooked out of the food. Temperature is then lowered to cook the meat through. The flavors of both [[cookbook:meat|meats]] and [[cookbook:vegetable|vegetables]] are retained and enhanced by roasting. A typical roasting temperature is 425-450 °F, with an initial temperature of over 500 °F for a period of 15 to 20 minutes.

You can either roast in an [[cookbook:oven|oven]] or over an open fire. Spit-roasting is a variation where the meat is impaled on a spit and rotated as it roasts.

Once meat has been removed from the roasting environment it should be allowed to rest, this ensures that the juice inside the meat returns to the outer edges. The even distribution of juice allows each slice to retain more moisture. Un-rested meat is typically dry around the edge and over saturated in the middle, leading to a loss of moisture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Recall that in your study of vectors, we looked at an operation known as the ''dot product'', and that if we have two vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, we simply multiply the components together and sum them up. With the dot product, it becomes possible to introduce important new ideas like length and angle.  The length of a vector,&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;, is just &lt;math&gt;||\mathbf{a}||=\sqrt{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt;.  The angle between two vectors,&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;, is related to the dot product by 

&lt;math&gt;\cos{\theta} = \frac{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}} {||\mathbf{a}||||\mathbf{b}||}&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that only a few properties of the dot product are necessary to define similar ideas in vector spaces other than '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, such as the spaces of &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices, or polynomials.  The more general operation that will take the place of the dot product in these other spaces is called the &quot;inner product&quot;.  
== The inner product ==
Say we have two vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{b}=\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If we want to take their dot product, we would work as follows
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3 = (2)(6)+(1)(3)+(4)(0) = 15&lt;/math&gt;

Because in this case multiplication is commutative, we then have '''''a'''''&amp;middot;'''''b''''' = '''''b''''' &amp;middot; '''''a'''''.

But then, we observe that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}\cdot(\alpha\mathbf{a}+\beta\mathbf{b}) = \alpha\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{a} + \beta\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
much like the regular algebraic equality ''v''(''aA''+''bB'')=''avA''+''bvB''.
For regular dot products this is true since, for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, for example, one can expand both sides out to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(\alpha v_1a_1+\beta v_1b_1)+(\alpha v_2a_2+\beta v_2b_2)+(\alpha v_2a_2+\beta v_2b_2)=\\
(\alpha v_1a_1+\alpha v_2a_2+\alpha v_3a_3)+(\beta v_1b_1+\beta v_2b_2+\beta v_3+b_3)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, we can notice that '''''v'''''&amp;middot;'''''v''''' is always positive or greater than zero - checking this for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; gives this as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v}=v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2&lt;/math&gt;
which can never be less than zero since a real number squared is positive. Note that '''''v'''''&amp;middot;'''''v''''' = 0 if and only if '''''v''''' = '''0'''.

In generalizing this sort of behaviour, we want to keep these three behaviours. We can then move on to a definition of a generalization of the dot product, which we call the ''inner product''. An inner product of two vectors in some vector space ''V'', written &lt; '''''x''''', '''''y''''' &gt; is a function that maps ''V''&amp;times;''V'' to '''R''', which obeys the property that
* &lt; '''''x''''', '''''y''''' &gt; = &lt; '''''y''''', '''''x''''' &gt;
* &lt; '''''v''''', &amp;alpha;'''''a'''''+&amp;beta;'''''b''''' &gt; = &amp;alpha; &lt; '''''v''''', '''''a''''' &gt; + &amp;beta; &lt; '''''v''''', '''''b''''' &gt;
* &lt; '''''a''''', '''''a''''' &gt; &amp;ge; 0, &lt; '''''a''''', '''''a''''' &gt; = 0 iff '''''a''''' = '''0'''.

The vector space ''V'' and some inner product together are known as an ''inner product space''. 

&lt;!--
=== Examples ===
In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt; '''''x''''' , '''''y''''' &gt; =  --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bending''' and '''vibrato''' are two related effects which help give extra &quot;life&quot; to notes, especially sustained notes, by changing their pitch. The techniques are not commonly used on the acoustic guitar or general rhythm playing. However, they are ''extremely'' important to many styles involving distorted guitar, e.g., rock or metal, even when playing rhythm (though, in that case, bends and vibratos are usually embellishments). Bending or an equivalent effect is not possible on all instruments; the piano, for example, cannot have notes that change in pitch. This is one reason why it is important to know how to bend: because you can!

This section deals with bending and vibrato using your fingers, not the different technique of using the vibrato bar. The two techniques do the same basic thing, but using the vibrato bar as a substitute for fretting-hand bending is not good practice; it is best used for very heavy bends or heavy vibratos, not slight embellishments like finger bending. It is more difficult to be subtle with a vibrato bar, and it is usually a bit out of the way for the picking hand to reach, making it harder to use. In short, while in some cases which style of bending or vibrato is used is a matter of taste, the two techniques are not interchangeable and are used for different effects.

==Bending==
[[Image:Guitar bending animated.gif|right|thumb|A string as it looks during a two fret bend. Notice how the player is using three fingers to help bend the string.]]
Bending is exactly as it sounds: bending the string to the side by pushing it (towards the sixth string) or pulling it (towards the first string), often while a fretted note is ringing. The first three strings are normally pushed, and the others are normally pulled. This is particularly important on the first and sixth strings, as you do not want the string to fall off the fretboard. Whether the string is pushed or pulled, the note will be raised in pitch.

Many aspiring guitarists cannot bend properly. The ''sound'' of a bend is more important than how it is actually executed or how it looks, but a bad bending technique usually leads to a bad sound. Your favorite guitarist might bend using just his or her fingertips and you might be inclined to copy this &amp;mdash; don't! Your hands can sound every bit as good as your hero's without copying his or her technique. There are two keys to bending properly: proper thumb positioning, and bending with the proper muscles. Do not keep your thumb behind the neck, where it usually is, but bring it up perpendicular to the neck (a position that is ''normally'' incorrect, but not in the case of bending). Keep the fingers firm. Do not bend your fingers, but push or pull with your forearm. You will hardly see your forearm move, possibly just see a couple of muscles flex. It will feel awkward at first, but if you can bend with the thumb in the proper position and without bending the fingers, you are probably doing it correctly.

Many guitarists will have trouble bending more than 1/4 step (half a semitone) or perhaps 1/2 step (one semitone) with only one finger, especially on frets close to the nut and on the thinner strings. It is much easier to bend with more than one finger, for instance, with the index finger on the first or second fret and the ring finger on the third, and pushing or pulling with both fingers in order to bend at the third fret. More fingers may be used if this is not enough. It should be possible to bend at least a full step (the pitch difference of two frets) this way.

==Pre-bending==
Bending, whether by pushing or pulling the string, raises the tension in the vibrating portion of the string, and thus always ''raises'' the pitch of the note. This means it is easier to slide up rather than down in pitch. To create the impression of bending down, the guitarist uses a technique called ''pre-bending'', that is, bending ''before'' the string is struck, then releasing the bend (either gradually or quickly, depending on the intended effect).

==Bend and Release==
The ideas of bending and pre-bending can be combined for a &quot;bend and release&quot;, that is, striking a note, bending it up, then releasing it as you would with a pre-bend. This will often be perceived as a &quot;bounce&quot; in pitch, especially if played quickly. The reverse is also possible: pre-bend, release, and bend. Repeatedly and steadily bending and releasing is called ''vibrato''.

==Vibrato==
Players of many instruments, including the human voice, use vibrato to help add expression to sustained notes. Vibrato is performed in two major ways, the first by rapidly bending the string back and forth, causing a modulation in pitch; therefore, all of the information above about bending applies here, except it is performed faster or more prolonged. Or it can be performed in a 'classical' style where one applies pressure parallel to the string towards the neck then towards the bridge repeatedly, which allows one to achieve vibrato upward and downward in pitch, albeit with a smaller change. A small, subtle vibrato might not require the assistance of other fingers; the fretting finger should be sufficient. However, for sustained vibrato or vibrato on the first or second frets, using multiple fingers for bending is a good idea.

Hi,

You will need to resubmit the drawings without the copyright notices.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Rodolfo. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Rodolfo~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
