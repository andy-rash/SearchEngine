[[User:Robinson0120|Robinson0120]] This page could do with a few graphs and maybe a few different explanations of why the identities exist (i.e., unit circle example of x^2 + y^2 = 1 and addition of opp/hyp instead of A/C off the top of my head). I'll get started on the explanations a little later, but the graphs are out of my hands. If whoever added the previous trigonometric function graphs could help out here, that would be great.

*Secondary Note: Link at bottom fixed.

==Misleading page name &amp; Merger proposal==

The page name &quot;Using fundamental identities&quot; implies that the page will show examples of how to use them.  Instead, it just lists the fundamental identities and in one case derives it.  As the page stands now, I think a better page name would be &quot;Fundamental identities&quot;.

Also, I think this list of identities should appear earlier in the book -- I think it would be a good idea to merge this page into the page entitled Trigonometric Identities, which currently does nothing more than define &quot;identity&quot;.

== Nemonic for trig identities ==

I know Soh-Cah-Toa is the popular one today; but I wonder if possibly others should be given in case some finds one easier than the another.  Not everyone will find the same nemonic works for them.

For instance, the one I learned gives the formulas for all 6 identities: Sin, Cos, Tan, Cot, Sec, Csc  and is:  oh ah oh-ah ah-oh ha ho;  where for example the spoken 'oh' is for o/h -and- 'oh-ah' is oh over ah or o/a.

Just the 1st 3 are easy to say; oh ah oh-ah.  Saying all six is not as easy for some people.  You need to practice saying it for some 10-15 min.  But I still remember it after 45 years and personally prefer it.  I am sure there must be others.

===Mid (Statement)===

Sets a given number of characters in the middle of a string equal to the same number of characters from the beginning of another string

''Usage''

&lt;code&gt;Mid(mystring, start, length)&lt;/code&gt;

mystring = the string to take characters from
start = character to start at (1 is the first character)&lt;br&gt;
length = number of characters&lt;br&gt;

''Example''

&lt;tt&gt;
mystring = InputBox(&quot;Enter a string&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
Mid(mystring, 2, 3) = &quot;abcd&quot;&lt;br&gt;
MsgBox &quot;Your string with abc as the second, third, and fourth characters of your input are &quot; + mystring&lt;/tt&gt;

''Usage''

&lt;code&gt;Trim(string)&lt;/code&gt;

string = string to use

''Example''

&lt;tt&gt;

== Mathematical Functions ==
===Abs===

Returns the absolute value of a number

Usage

Abs(number)

Example

msgbox &quot;The absolute value of -4 is &quot; &amp; abs(-4)

Important note!

The Abs function only accepts numbers.  Non-numeric values generate an error.

===Cos===

Returns the cosine of a number

Usage

Cos(integer)

Example

msgbox &quot;The cosine of 4 is &quot; &amp; cos(4)

Important note!

The input angle for all VB trigometric functions should be in [[w:radian|radians]]. To convert degrees to radians, multiply degrees by pi / 180.

===Sin===

Returns the sine of a number

Usage

Sin(integer)

Example

msgbox &quot;The sine of 4 is &quot; &amp; sin(4)

Important note!

The input angle for all VB trigometric functions should be in radians. To convert degrees to radians, multiply degrees by pi / 180.

===Tan===

Returns the tangent of an angle

Usage

Tan(integer)

Example

msgbox &quot;The tangent of 4 is &quot; &amp; tan(4)

Important note!

The input angle for all VB trigometric functions  should be in radians. To convert degrees to radians, multiply degrees by pi / 180.

===Val===

Returns the numeric value of a string

Uses &quot;.&quot; as decimal separator. ( It does not depend on the Regional Settings ) 

Usage

Val(string)

Example

&lt;code&gt;Val(&quot;5&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

The return value will be 5

&lt;code&gt;Val(&quot;10.6&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

The return value will be 10.6

&lt;code&gt;Val(&quot;Hello World&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

The return value will be 0 (zero)

&lt;code&gt;txtOutput.Text = Val(txtNumber1.Text) * Val(txtNumber2.Text)&lt;/code&gt;

The text box txtOutput will contain the product of the numbers in the txtNumber1 and txtNumber2 text boxes. If either of the text boxes contains a value that cannot be evaluated to a number then the output will be 0 (zero).

===Rnd===

Returns a floating point number less than 1 but greater than or equal to 0.

Usage

&lt;code&gt;Rnd[(&lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt;)]&lt;/code&gt;

You can change the seed the random number generator uses by providing a value as a parameter e.g. Rnd(500) will use the number 500 as the seed in generating random numbers.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you provide a value less than zero then the same number will be returned by the Rnd() function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A value of zero will return the most recently generated random number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing no value will generate the next random number in the sequence.
&lt;li&gt;Providing a positive number will generate the next random number in the sequence using &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt; as a seed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Example

&lt;code&gt;myvar = Rnd() * 10&lt;/code&gt;

myvar will become a random number between 0 and 10.

&lt;code&gt;myvar = (Rnd() * 15) + 25&lt;/code&gt;

myvar will become a random number between 25 and 40.

&lt;code&gt;myvar = (Rnd(12345) * 50) - 25&lt;/code&gt;

myvar will become a random number between -25 and 25 and 12345 will be used as the seed to generate this number.

===Int===

Returns the integer portion of a number.

Usage

Int(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;)

Where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the number to return

Example

&lt;code&gt;Int(10)&lt;/code&gt;

Returns 10

&lt;code&gt;Int(5.1)&lt;/code&gt;

Returns 5

&lt;code&gt;Int(5.86)&lt;/code&gt;

Returns 5

&lt;code&gt;MsgBox &quot;The integer portion of &quot; &amp; myvar &amp; &quot; is &quot; &amp; Int(myvar) &amp; &quot;.&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

NOTE: No rounding will be performed, the decimal portion of the number will simply be removed. If you want to round a number to the nearest whole integer then use CInt. One interesting point to remember about CInt is that if the decimal portion of the number is exactly .5 then it will be rounded down if the number is odd and rounded up if it is even. For example CInt(1.5) and CInt(2.5) will both return 2.

== Input and output ==

===MsgBox===

Displays a message box

Usage

MsgBox prompt,buttons,title,helpfile,context

where
prompt = the text displayed on the message box
buttons = combination of keywords to set out the layout of buttons and icons on the message box
title = the title displayed in the message box titlebar

Where the output from the message box is being assigned to a value (such as when there is a choice to be made, use parenthesis thus:

string=MsgBox (prompt,buttons,title,helpfile,context)

If no title is defined, the program name will be used instead. Button combination defaults to vbOKOnly if none is defined, and no icon will be displayed.

Button Combinations

vbOKOnly
vbOKCancel
vbAbortRetryIgnore
vbYesNoCancel
vbYesNo
vbRetryCancel

Icon Display

vbCritical
vbQuestion
vbExclamation
vbInformation

Default Button

vbDefaultButton1
vbDefaultButton2
vbDefaultButton3
vbDefaultButton4


''Examples''

MsgBox &quot;An error has occurred!&quot;,vbExclamation,&quot;Error&quot;

''Note that since the message is fixed, quotation marks have been used.''

Response=MsgBox(&quot;Yes or no?&quot;,vbYesNo + vbQuestion,&quot;Choose one&quot;)

''Note the parenthesis and how the vbYesNo and vbQuestion constants have been combined''

MsgBox &quot;An error has occurred on line &quot; &amp; lineno, vbExclamation, &quot;Error&quot;

===InputBox===

Displays a simple input box for user to enter data

''Usage''

Variable=InputBox(Prompt,Title)

Variable = variable to which the input value will be stored
Prompt = text displayed to the user in the input box
Title = title of the input box

Examples

myint=InputBox(&quot;Enter a number&quot;,&quot;Enter a number&quot;)

== Date and Time ==

===Date===

Returns or sets the current system date

Example

MsgBox &quot;Today 's date is &quot; &amp; Date &amp; &quot;.&quot;

===Time===

Returns or sets the current system time

Example

MsgBox &quot;The time now is &quot; &amp; Time &amp; &quot;.&quot;


''Sidenote: be wary of changing date and time in your program. Many other programs will depend upon the system's date and time being set correctly, so altering it could have a knock on effect. Use date and time changes sparingly, and notify the user if this is being done.''

===Timer===

Returns the number of seconds since midnight

Example

NumHrs=Int(Timer / 3600)
MsgBox &quot;Currently in hour &quot; &amp; NumHrs

===WeekdayName===

Returns the name of a day of the week

Usage

WeekdayName(x,FirstDayOfWeek)

x = integer between 1 and 7
FirstDayOfWeek (OPTIONAL) = the day counted as the first in the week. The default is Sunday.

Example

DayName=WeekdayName(i,vbMonday)

==Miscellaneous==
===IsNull===
Returns true if an expression is null and false otherwise.

Example:
 If IsNull(vntMyVariantVar) Then
     Debug.Print &quot;vntMyVariantVar is null&quot;
 Else
     Debug.Print &quot;vntMyVariantVar is NOT null&quot;
 End If

== File Handling ==
===Open===
Open &quot;&quot; &amp; namefile&amp; &quot;.dat&quot; For Binary As #ff

== Selection ==

'''If... Then... Else...'''
Performs selection based upon criteria. A cornerstone of any VB program.

'Usage'

Single Line Selection

&lt;pre&gt;
If condition Then action&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that only one line can be used with this style of statement

Multi Line Selection

&lt;pre&gt;If condition Then

[code to execute if condition is true]

EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

Using Else

&lt;pre&gt;If condition Then

[code to execute if condition is true]

Else

[code to execute if condition is false]

EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

Condition is a condition which must be met for the code within the statement to be executed. It can make use of the modifiers AND, NOT, OR and XOR (e.g. x=4 AND y &gt; 6). See also the Examples section.

===Examples===

''Simple one-line selection:''
&lt;pre&gt;If x &lt; 10 then MsgBox &quot;The number is below 10&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

''Slightly more complex one-line selection, using the AND modifier to check two conditions at one time.''
&lt;pre&gt;If x &gt; 10 AND x &lt; 20 then MsgBox &quot;The number is between 10 and 20&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

''Simple multi-line selection. The code between the If... and EndIf statements will be executed only if the condition is met.''
&lt;pre&gt;If Date = 25/12/2006 Then
    MsgBox &quot;The date is Christmas Day&quot;
    Call ChristmasDay
EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

''Using the Else statement. If the variable i is over 4, the program will exit the subroutine. Otherwise, it will go to the label SaveFile.''
&lt;pre&gt;If i &gt; 4 Then
    Exit Sub
Else
    Goto SaveFile
EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

''Two If... Endif statements are used, one nested within the other. If i is 6 or 7, the code between the inside If...Endif statements is executed. Then if i=7 the first message box will be shown; otherwise (i.e. if i=6) the other will be displayed. For both cases, the final message box will be shown. When nesting selection statements, it's often a good idea to indent them as shown here.''
&lt;pre&gt;If i = 6 OR i = 7 Then
   If i = 7 Then
       MsgBox &quot;Today is Sunday&quot;
   Else
       MsgBox &quot;Today is Saturday&quot;
   EndIf
   MsgBox &quot;Today is the Weekend&quot;
EndIf&lt;/pre&gt;

The normal translation of ''I want to write'' is ''θέλω να γράψω''. I think that the [[w:grammatical aspect]]s should be learned together with the subordinate cluases.
In general, there are many mistakes in this book. Before giving an example, ask a native speaker or look the sentence up in Google if it is really used that way. [[User:70.52.2.61|70.52.2.61]] 20:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
:Thanks for the correction! I've been soliciting help from native speakers, and am grateful for your work! --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 17:13, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

=cases=
I've changed the terminology for the cases back from nom/gen/acc/voc to subj/gen/obj/voc. I would like to minimize the number of new grammatical terms that the reader has to learn, and &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;object&quot; will already be familiar from English grammar. I've also rearranged things a little so that the genitive isn't presented until lesson 3, and the vocative until lesson 4. Again, the idea is to avoid overwhelming the reader.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 17:15, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

=about over-simplification=
I very much appreciate your effort (you started the whole thing in the first place), but I still cannot understand your over-simplification approach. The cases should be always referred to with their proper names.

It's one thing to slowly introduce Greek and another thing to slowly introduce Grammar itself!

Now in terms of the order of the chapters, perhaps we should reconsider it all along. Here is a link that I find very useful, from the German-Hellenic School of Greece (it is in Greek):

http://www3.ellinogermaniki.gr/artemisTool/grammar/

In terms of a native speaker pronunciation, although I'm a native speaker myself, there is some excellent work already done in Φιλογλωσσία

http://www.xanthi.ilsp.gr/filog/ch1/alphabet/alphabet.asp

In general their whole course material is excellent and we can take an example from there about the structure of these lessons.

== Speed ==

Your explanations are good, but I think you are trying to teach too much in one lesson. I have studied Greek for almost one year at university now, I can manage everyday situations without spending a lot of time thinking of words and yet I still don't know some of the grammar concepts or vocabulary introduced in this lesson - which is supposed to be for people who have only done one lesson of Greek so far?? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I believe the amount of things you introduce in one lesson force students to spend too much time on one lesson. They will feel like they never progress, they will get frustrated and stop learning Greek. Learning a language in self-study isn't easy in any case, but this is bound to discourage even avid language learners. Perhaps you might want to have a look at a new approach in language courses that I developed and that I'd now like to introduce to Wikibook creators: see [[Bite-sized language lessons]] . You may also want to read the Wikibook on language-course creation. This is not to diminish the work you have obviously put in this, I just think that precisely because of the effort involved, you should make sure that learners can get the most out of these lessons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Gender ==
The ος ending is described for masculine nouns, which helps us recognize masculine nouns. However the same is not done for feminine and neutral. That would be appreciated.

== Modern pronunciation ==
I was taught that in the modern language the characters μ, and ν were pronounced &quot;mi&quot; and &quot;ni&quot; (etc. for other letters), not &quot;mu&quot; and &quot;nu&quot; as seems to be implied on this page. Am I missing something here? --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 18:04, 20 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

If you have the time it would be great if you could simplify this page a tad, just because its a children's book. I would do it myself, but i find it works out better if the original author does it! 
Thanks,     [[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 22:26 4 February, 2006
*&lt;s&gt;I guess that's me, I've written most of it.  I realise it's a bit complicated, but I just didn't have the time to simplify it at the time of writing.  I will do that when I get the time, and of course I don't mind if anyone else does it.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 06:16, 6 February 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
*I have made some changes now, probably still needs a lot of work though.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 09:26, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lesson 11: Irregular verbs, the genitive, family, the body, prepositions

=The genitive=
What English expresses using possessives or the presposition &quot;of,&quot; Greek expresses using the genitive case. The following example shows the noun σκύλος in all the subject, genitive, and object cases.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ο σκύλος
| the dog (subject form) 
| οι σκύλοι
| the dogs (subject form) 
|-
| του σκύλου
| of the dog (genitive form) 
| των σκύλων
| of the dogs (genitive form) 
|-
| τον σκύλο
| the dog (object form) 
| τους σκύλους
| the dogs (object form) 
|-
|}

Example:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το πόδι του σκύλου
| the dog's foot (literally, the foot of the dog)
|}

The genitive plural is easy, because it's always formed with -ων, and the article is always των.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| τα πόδια των σκύλων
| the dogs' feet
|}

The genitive singular is formed according to a greater variety of patterns, of which three of the most important are shown here:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ο σκύλος
| του σκύλου
|-
| η ώρα
| της ώρας
|-
| το βιβλίο
| του βιβλίου
|-
| το παιδί
| του παιδιού
|}


== Accentuation ==

In some nouns, when the antepenult is accented, the genitive is accented at the penult and when the penult is accented the genitive is accented at the ultimate. There is a set of rules to distinguish in which cases this happens. Most of the rules derive from Ancient Greek and have to do with either long and short vowels or Ancient Greek declensions. This is an issue with Modern Greek itself, since most of the nuances of Ancient Greek are lost in Modern Greek. People in most cases put the accent intuitively and at some instances even native speakers have great difficulty in accentuating correctly. This is why it is often said that in order to properly speak Modern Greek, one has to have at least a basic level of Ancient Greek.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| τα πόδια των ανθρώπων ('''ά'''νθρωπος/ανθρ'''ώ'''πων)
| the men's feet (genitive plural)
|-
| τα πόδια του ανθρώπου ('''ά'''νθρωπος/ανθρ'''ώ'''που)
| the man's feet (genitive singular)
|-
| τα πόδια των ανδρών ('''ά'''νδρας/ανδρ'''ώ'''ν)
| the men's feet (genitive plural)
|-
| '''but'''
|-
| τα πόδια των πατέρων (πατ'''έ'''ρας/πατ'''έ'''ρων)
| the fathers' feet
|-
| τα πόδια του άνδρα ('''ά'''νδρας/'''ά'''νδρα)
| the man's feet (genitive singular)
|}

The accent can also advance two positions, from antepenult to ultimate between nominative plural and genitive plural. The noun το χάδι (the caress) presents the following declensions:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το χ'''ά'''δι
| τα χ'''ά'''δια
|-
| του χαδι'''ού'''
| των χαδι'''ώ'''ν
|-
| το χ'''ά'''δι
| τα χ'''ά'''δια
|}

==Genitive indefinite article==
The following list shows the indefinite article in all three of the cases covered so far:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ένας
| ''one,'' masculine subject
|-
| ενός
| ''of one,'' masculine genitive
|-
| έναν
| ''one,'' masculine object
|-
|-
| μία or μια
| ''one,'' feminine subject
|-
| μίας or μιας
| ''of one,'' feminine genitive
|-
| μία or μια
| ''one,'' feminine object
|-
|-
| ένα
| ''one,'' neuter subject
|-
| ενός
| ''of one,'' neuter genitive
|-
| ένα
| ''one,'' neuter object
|-
|}

=Genitive pronouns=
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| μου
| μας
|-
| σου
| σας
|-
| του, της, του
| τους
|}

When indicating possession, the genitive pronoun follows the noun it modifies.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Στην υγειά σας!
| To your health (Cheers!)
|-
| το βιβλίο μου
| my book
|-
| Το κεφάλι του είναι μεγάλο.
| His head is big.
|}

When greeting a person you either say ''Γεια σας'' (the polite plural) or ''Γεια σου'' (friendly address, more often than not the ''σου'' is omitted). Γεια is a short form for υγεία (health → &quot;hygiene&quot;). For a group of people except the abovementioned ''Γεια σας'', the salutation ''Χαίρετε'' (rejoice) is also utilized.

When a noun followed by a possessive pronoun has the accent on the third syllable from the end, it gets a second accent on the final syllable:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το γόνατό μου
| my knee
|}

In Greek, rather than saying that you like something, you say that it is pleasing to you, using the verb αρέσω:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Μού αρέσει το αυτοκίνητο.
| I like the car (lit. &quot;The car is pleasing to me.&quot;)
|}

This form is a remnant of the ancient dative case (δοτική πτώση). Something similar happens with certain prepositions (see below).

=Prepositions=
The following are some common prepositions:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| με
| with, by means of
|-
| μαζί με
| together with
|-
| χωρίς
| without
|-
| για
| for
|-
| από
| from (moving away from)
|-
| σε, εις
| in, at, on, moving to
|-
| μέσα σε
| into
|- 
| πάνω σε
| on
|-
| πάνω από
| above, over 
|-
| κάτω από
| below, under
|-
| ύστερα από
| after
|-
| πρίν
| before (~&quot;pre-&quot;)
|-
| πρό
| before, in front of (~&quot;proactive&quot;)
|-
| ενάντια σε
| against
|-
| εναντίον
| against
|-
| εκ, εξ
| from, out of (~&quot;ex-wife&quot;)
|}

Examples:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Το κλειδί της Άννας είναι κάτω από το τραπέζι.
| Anna's key is under the table.
|-
| Είμαι από την Αμερική.
| I'm from America.
|}

If the preposition ''σε'' is followed by a definite article, the joint form στο(ν)/στη(ν)/στο (σε plus το(ν)/τη(ν)/το) is used:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Το κλειδί της Άννας είναι στο τραπέζι.
| Anna's key is on the table.
|-
| Ο Παύλος είναι στο θεάτρο.
| Paul is at the theater.
|}

As a remnant of ancient Greek's more complex case system, certain prepositions (πρό, εναντίον, εκ/εξ) are supposed to take the genitive case rather than the object (accusative) case. In these constructions, the genitive is really being used as the dative (indirect object) case, as in the use of the genitive with the verb αρέσω. This is a usage that is dying out, and a beginner doesn't need to worry about it too much. There are, however, certain fixed phrases that will seem inexplicable otherwise:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| πρό Χριστού, π.Χ.
| before Christ
|-
| εν τάξει
| OK
|}

==Prepositions used as prefixes==

It is extremely common for Greek verbs to be formed by adding a preposition as a prefix to a simpler verb. However, the preposition
may be in a different form than the ones given above, e.g., εις rather than σε. A common prefix is συν-/συμ-, from the ancient Greek preposition συν, ''with, together.'' Two other suffixes based on ancient Greek prepositions are δια, ''for, because of, relating to'', and υπό, ''under'' (~&quot;hypodermic&quot;).
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|-
| βάλλω
| to shoot; in ancient Greek, to throw
|-
| '''εισ'''βάλλω
| to invade: σε (modern εις)+βάλλω, 'throw in'
|-
| '''συμ'''βάλλω σε
| to contribute to: συν+βάλλω σε, 'throw together'
|-
| '''εκ'''βάλλω
| to debouch
|-
| '''απο'''βάλλω
| to expel
|-
| '''κατα'''βάλλω
| to pay, put down money, buckle to
|-
| '''δια'''βάλλω
| to slander someone, put someone down
|-
| '''υπο'''βάλλω
| to submit something, subject to, suggest
|-
|
|
|-
| πνέω
| to blow (~&quot;pneumatic&quot;)
|-
| '''εισ'''πνέω
| to inhale something
|-
| '''εκ'''πνέω
| to exhale, die, expire, terminate something
|-
| '''δια'''πνέω
| to run through
|-
|
|
|-
| λείπω
| to be away, to be lacking
|-
| '''κατα'''λείπω
| to leave something behind
|-
| '''εκ'''λείπω
| to vanish, be in eclipse (~&quot;eclipse&quot;)
|-
| '''δια'''λείπω
| to be intermittent (also ''διάλειψη'' = lapse of memory)
|-
| '''υπο'''λείπομαι (passive)
| to fall short of (also υπόλοιπο = the rest, residual)
|}

=Family=

Vocabulary:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ο πατέρας
| the father
|-
| η μητέρα
| the mother
|-
| ο άντρας
| the man, the husband
|-
| η γυναίκα
| the woman, the wife
|-
| ο γιος
| the son
|-
| η κόρη
| the girl, daughter
|-
| ο αδελφός
| the brother (~&quot;Philadelphia&quot;)
|-
| η αδελφή
| the sister
|-
| ο παππούς
| the grandfather
|-

| the grandmother
|-
| ο θείος

|-
| η θεία
| the aunt
|-
| ο ανιψιός
| the nephew (~&quot;nepotism&quot;)
|-
| η ανιψιά
| the niece
|}

Examples:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ο πατέρας μου
| my father
|-
| ο γιος σας
| your son
|-
| Η Ελένη είναι η κόρη μου.
| Helen is my daughter.
|-
| Είναι η μητέρα της Αννας.
| She's Anna's mother.
|-
| Είναι το σπίτι των αδελφών.
| It's the brothers' house.
|}

Note that in Greek, a definite article is used with a person's name.

=Grimm's law=
The words ''πατέρας'' and ''μητέρα'' are actually closely related to the English words ''mother'' and ''father.'' When English and Greek words are derived from the same root in their common ancestral language, Indo-European, the consonants are related as follows:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
| π
| τ
| κ
| β
| δ
| γ
| φ
| θ
| χ
|-
| f
| th
| h
| p
| t
| k
| b
| d
| g
|}

This is known as Grimm's law (after a linguist from the same family that collected the Grimm's fairy tales).
Sometimes it can help you to learn words in Greek.

Examples:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
| δύο
| τρία
| πόδι
|-
| two
| three
| foot
|}

In some cases, the Greek word that's cognate to the English one is ancient rather than modern. For example, ''brother'' corresponds to the ancient ''φρατήρ'' (e.g. &quot;fraternity&quot;), not the modern ''αδελφός'', and ''door'' to the ancient ''θύρα'' rather than modern ''πόρτα'' (which is a loan from italian).

=Nouns in -ας and -ης=

[[Image:Astronaut-EVA.jpg|right|caption|thumbnail|400px|ο αστροναύτης]]

Other than -ος, the most common endings for masculine nouns are -ας and -ης.

Ο πατέρας, the father:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| subject
| ο πατέρας
| οι πατέρες
|-
| genitive
| του πατέρα
| των πατέρων
|-
| object
| τον πατέρα
| τους πατέρες
|}

Ο μαθητής, the student, pupil:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| subject
| ο μαθητής
| οι μαθητές
|-
| genitive
| του μαθητή
| των μαθητών
|-
| object
| το μαθητή
| τους μαθητές
|-
|}

These endings are particularly common in nouns referring to professions, e.g., ο αστροναύτης, the astronaut.

=People=

|-
| Ο βασιλιάς είναι πλούσιος.
| The king is rich.
|-
| Ο δάσκαλος έχει τριάντα μαθητές
| The teacher has 30 students.
|}

=The letter ''ν'' at the end of a word=

You might have noticed above that while both ο πατέρας and ο μαθητής are masculine nouns, the definite article at the accusative (object) case is different:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το'''ν''' πατέρα
|-
| το μαθητή
|} 

There is a general rule that applies not only to the definite article but to most words ending with a ''ν''. According to this rule if the '''next''' word does '''not''' start with a vowel or any of the voiceless plosives (''κ, π, τ, ξ, ψ'') then the ''ν'' is often omitted. 

Thus, the avoidance of complex consonant combinations helps in producing a smooth flow of speech.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Granny Knot is basically an incorrectly tied [[Scouting/Knots/Bends/Reef knot|Reef knot]].  On the Reef Knot page is a blue and red graphic representing that knot.  A Granny Knot is similar, except for one thing.

In a Reef Knot, the two blue ends cross underneath the red loop on the right side and the two red ends cross over the blue loop on the left side of the knot.  In a Granny Knot, the top blue end would be over the red loop on the right side and the top red end would be under the blue loop on the left side of the knot.

Also, the red rope part at the top of the knot would cross over the blue part of the rope, rather than under it.

The Reef Knot is criticized as an unstable knot.  The Granny Knot is much, much more unstable and should never be used for any purpose.

style='font-size:12.0pt'&gt;'''Fish Symbol'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
style='font-size:9.0pt'&gt; &amp;#8722; the most elemental Christian art in the form of a doctrinal statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
:'''Definition'''
:The '''acrostic''' in Greek, ''Ichthys'', is &quot;Jesus-Christ-Of God-Son-Savior. '''Jesus:''' The Hebrew &quot;Joshua&quot; or Aramaic&lt;br&gt;&quot;Yeshua,&quot; means &quot;God is Salvation.&quot; '''Christ:''' Being equal to the Hebrew/Aramaic word &quot;Messiah,&quot; means the&lt;br&gt;Sent One, the Anointed of God. The word points to redemption and reconciliation between God and man. '''Of God:'''&lt;br&gt;Reminds Christians of the deity of Christ. Christ is triune [[Image:ICHTHYS.jpg|left]]with God and the Holy Spirit. Together &lt;br&gt;the 3 are 1 God with 3 differing roles. &quot;Of God&quot; signifies that God is the Head of Christ. God is&lt;br&gt; Father, Christ is Son. '''Son:''' As heir, Jesus is not inferior to the Father, but has a different role in&lt;br&gt; the redemption of humanity. The Son is the heir of the Father, and God has given all power and authority to Jesus.&lt;br&gt; As Son and heir, Jesus was obedient to God the Father. '''Savior:''' Jesus' death on the cross for the redemption of&lt;br&gt;all heaven and earth represents the culmination of the obedience of Jesus towards God the Father. Jesus provides&lt;br&gt;salvation based on His sacrificial broken body and blood at the cross to everyone who trusts in His righteous life.&lt;br&gt;Jesus lays claim as rightful God of the New Covenant who can die for sin, judge sin, yet be blameless from sin.

==History==
The fish was well known in ancient times as a symbol of fertility. The interlocking arcs have become a modern day Christian amulet, even the subject of various parodies. The exact date or reason for the Christian church assimilating the simple art form and the soteriological formula behind it, is not known. There is no clear evidence for the use of the IXTHYS acrostic in early Christianity much before the late second century C.E. The New Testament contains many details about fish and fishermen, much more than in the Old Testament. The origin of ''ichthys'' is thus closely related to the idea of “fishers of men,” baptism of water, dividing the fish and loaves, or the last meal on the shore which enumerated the catch of 153 fish. Usage is described as a pointer to secret meetings during the period of persecution, a primitive password or handshake in the sand where when two meet each one supplies an arc, or simply a theological statement inscribed under trying circumstances and signifying a certain perseverance above all else. The earliest known reference in Christian literature (ca. 193 C.E.) quotes Tertullian, De Baptismo 1.3, &quot;we, little fishes, after the image of our &amp;Iota;&amp;Chi;&amp;Theta;&amp;Upsilon;&amp;Sigma;, Jesus Christ, are born in the water,&quot; where only the word for fish is written in Greek instead of Latin and so most assuredly alludes to the acronym for fish, IXTHYS. 

A grave-yard remains something of a broken record of the church to which it belongs. The catacombs exhibit many such monumental inscriptions, Greek and Latin, or oddly mixed (Latin words in Greek uncial characters), often rudely written, of bad spelling, mutilated, and almost illegible, with and without symbolical figures. Christianity appealed to the poor and illiterate of the time. Fish imagery was very popular in early Christianity, and is mentioned in patristic literature. Clement of Alexandria (ca. 202 C.E.) sanctions the use of the image as art in the form of a seal for a signet ring in Paedogogus 3.11. The popular motif found on Christian gems of the later third century contains a pair of fish flanking an anchor or a cross-like object, also, fish and anchors are drawn beside funerary inscriptions datable at the earliest to the late second or early third centuries. The acrostic and fish symbols are found in tombs beneath the church of San Sebastiano, Rome, but, while highly probable, it's not universally accepted that these tombs are Christian. They date from the late second/early third century as well. Fish imagery from this period also occurs in the catacombs, the best known example being a crude painting commonly called the &quot;Eucharist fish&quot; showing a basket of five loaves of bread on the fish's side in the Lucina crypt in the Catacomb of Callixtus, Rome.[[Image:Fish_bread5.jpg|right|Eucharist fish]]

The acronym for fish is in wide use by the fourth and fifth century C.E., for Augustine relates that “these five greek words” mean &quot;Christ&quot; (Jesus Christ, of God the son, saviour) because, in Augustine’s words, &quot;He was able to remain alive &amp;#8722; that is, without sin &amp;#8722; in the abyss of our mortal condition, in the depths, as it were, of the sea&quot; (City of God 18.23, part of a discussion of Sibylline Oracle 8.217). Many early references to the fish mention baptism and may have foundation in the period use of the term &quot;piscina&quot; when referring to the baptismal font.

The acronym for fish obviously influences a passage in the epitaph of Abercius, an enigmatic Phrygian inscription, now in the Vatican, which probably dates from the late second century.  The inscription is in Greek:&lt;br&gt;
:''My name is Abercius, the disciple of the Holy Shepherd... I followed Paul and everywhere Faith was my leader and she gave me food in every place &amp;#8722; the Fish from the fountain, a mighty Fish and pure which a holy maiden took in her hands and gave to her friends to eat for ever, having goodly wine and giving it mixed with water and also bread...''

Similar language is used in the inscription of one Pectorius, which was found near Autun, France and kept in the museum there.  It has not been accurately dated &amp;#8722; probably third to fourth century.  The inscription has some gaps which must be filled out by conjecture. The first portion seems to be older. Schultze conjectures that it is an old Christian hymn. This inscription is also in Greek, but it's written in a form resembling verse and the first letters of the first five lines spell out the '''acrostic''' IXTHUS:&lt;br&gt;

:1 Thou, the divine child of the heavenly Fish 
:2 Keep pure thy heart among the mortals 
:3 Once thou hast been washed in the fountain of divine waters.&lt;br&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Refresh thy soul, friend, 
:4 With the ever flowing waters of wealth-giving wisdom. 
:5 Take from the Saviour of saints the honey-sweet food; 
:6 Eat with joy and desire, holding the Fish in thy hands. 
:7 I pray thee, Lord Saviour, satisfy his hunger with the Fish. 
:8 May my mother rest peacefully, I beseech thee, Light of the dead. 
:9 Aschandius, father, my heart's beloved 
:10 With my dearest mother and my brothers 
:11 In the peace of the Fish remember thy Pectorius. 


:Summary (in Modernity)
 
:''Divine race of the heavenly Fish preserve a reverent mind when you partake of the immortal fountain of wondrous waters that springs up among us here. Friend, let your soul be comforted with the ever-flowing waters of treasure-bestowing wisdom. Take the honey-sweet food of the Redeemer of the saints and eat it eagerly, holding the Fish in your hands. Satisfy me thus with the Fish I pray you, My Lord and Savior... be mindful of all those abiding in the peace of the Fish''.&lt;br&gt;
:''Yours, Pectorius''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If I'm not mistaken, this should be 8 lasagne noodles -- two isn't enough for two layers. --[[User:209.242.5.195|209.242.5.195]] 00:17, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

:I've changed it to read &quot;one package&quot; of noodles, which I realize is a bit vague, but lasagna noodles are commonly sold in packages containing the right amount for a lasagna of this size - here in the US, at least. Anyway, it's better than saying &quot;six,&quot; which it did before I changed it, which couldn't possibly be right, unless it meant &quot;six layers' worth.&quot; [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 22:25, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

Another Italian American recipe.

Please put these in the appropriate place: Italian-American cuisine. 

Italian recipes are always identified by the region, town or village they come from and the inclusion in one dish of both Parmigiano Reggiano ( Emilia-Romagna ) and Mozzarella ( Lazio and Campania ) gives away that this is not a traditional Italian recipe.  But glad you got &quot;Lasagne&quot; right and did not call it &quot;Lasagna&quot; !</text>

== IF statement ==

The if statement executes the command between &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;. If the command returns not 0 then the commands between &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; are executed - otherwise the command between &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fi&lt;/code&gt;.

   if test &quot;${1}&quot; = &quot;red&quot; ; then
     echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
   elif test &quot;${1}&quot; = &quot;blue&quot; ; then
     echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
   else
     echo &quot;Access granted.&quot;
   fi

   if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;red&quot; ]
   then
     echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
   elif [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;blue&quot; ]
   then
     echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
   else
     echo &quot;Access granted.&quot;
   fi 

==== Test Syntax Variations ====

Most test commands can be written using more than one syntax. Mastering and consistently using one form may be a programming best-practice, and may be a more efficient use of overall time.

==== String Tests ====

String Tests are performed by the &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; command. See &lt;code&gt;help test&lt;/code&gt; for more details. To make scripts look more like other programming languages the synonym &lt;code&gt;[ ... ]&lt;/code&gt; was defined which does exactly the same as &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! | Command
! | Effect
|-
| test &quot;$shvar&quot; = &quot;red&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$shvar&quot; = &quot;red&quot; ]
| String comparison, true if match.
|-
|test &quot;$shvar&quot; != &quot;red&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$shvar&quot; != &quot;red&quot; ] 
| String comparison, true if no match.
|-
|test -z &quot;${shvar}&quot;&lt;br&gt;
test  &quot;$shvar&quot; = &quot;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$shvar&quot; = &quot;&quot; ]
|        True if null variable.
|-
|test -n &quot;${shvar}&quot;&lt;br&gt;
test  &quot;$shvar&quot; != &quot;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[ -n &quot;$shvar&quot; ]&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$shvar&quot; != &quot;&quot; ]
|       True if not null variable.
|}

==== Arithmetic tests ====

simple arithmetics can be performed with the &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; for more complex arithmetics the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; command exists. See &lt;code&gt;help let&lt;/code&gt; for more details. Note that for &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; command variables don't need to be prefixed with '$' and the statement need to be one argument, use &lt;code&gt;'...'&lt;/code&gt; when there are spaces inside the argument. Like with &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; a synonym - &lt;code&gt;(( ... ))&lt;/code&gt; - was defined to make shell scripts look more like ordinary programs.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! | Command
! | Effect
|-
|test  &quot;$nval&quot; -eq 0&lt;br&gt;
let 'nval == 0'&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$nval&quot; -eq 0 ]&lt;br&gt;
(( nval == 0 ))
|        Integer test; true if equal to 0.
|-
|test  &quot;$nval&quot; -ge 0&lt;br&gt;
let 'nval &gt;= 0'&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$nval&quot; -ge 0 ]&lt;br&gt;

|        Integer test; true if greater than or equal to 0.
|-
|test  &quot;$nval&quot; -gt 0&lt;br&gt;

[ &quot;$nval&quot; -lt 0 ]&lt;br&gt;
(( nval &lt; 0 ))
|        Integer test; true if less than to 0.
|-
|test  &quot;$nval&quot; -ne 0&lt;br&gt;
let 'nval != 0'&lt;br&gt;
[ &quot;$nval&quot; -ne 0 ]&lt;br&gt;
(( nval != 0 ))
|        Integer test; true if not equal to 0.
|-
|let 'y + y &gt; 100'&lt;br&gt;
(( y + y &gt;= 100))
|        Integer test; true when &lt;math&gt;x + y \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==== File tests ====

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! | Command
! | Effect
|-
|test  -d tmp&lt;br&gt;
[ -d tmp ]
|               True if &quot;tmp&quot; is a directory.
|-
|test  -f tmp&lt;br&gt;
[ -f tmp ]
|               True if &quot;tmp&quot; is an ordinary file.
|-
|test  -r tmp&lt;br&gt;
[ -r tmp ]
|               True if &quot;tmp&quot; can be read.
|-
|test  -s tmp&lt;br&gt;
[ -s tmp ]
|               True if &quot;tmp&quot; is nonzero length.
|-
|test  -w tmp&lt;br&gt;
[ -w tmp ]
|               True if &quot;tmp&quot; can be written.
|-
|test  -x tmp&lt;br&gt;
[ -x tmp ]
|               True if &quot;tmp&quot; is executable.
|}

==== Boolean tests ====

Boolean arithmetic is performed by a set of operators. It is important to note then the operators execute programs and compare the result codes. Because boolean operators are often combined with &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; command a unifications was created in the form of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ ... ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
! | Command
! | Effect
|-
|test  -d /tmp &amp;&amp; test -r /tmp&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ -d /tmp &amp;&amp; -r /tmp ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| True if &quot;/tmp&quot; is a directory and can be read.
|-
|test  -r /tmp &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt; test -w /tmp
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ -r /tmp || -w /tmp ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| True if &quot;tmp&quot; can be read or written.
|-
|test ! -x /tmp&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ ! -x /tmp ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| True if the file is not executable
|}

== CASE statement ==

   case &quot;$1&quot; 
   in
     &quot;red&quot;)      echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
                 exit;;
     &quot;blue&quot;)     echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
                 exit;;
     &quot;x&quot;|&quot;y&quot;)    echo &quot;Illegal code.&quot;
                 exit;;
     *)          echo &quot;Access granted.&quot;;;
   esac

== Loop statements ==

   for nvar in 1 2 3 4 5
   do
     echo $nvar
   done 

   for file            # Cycle through command-line arguments.
   do
     echo $file
   done

   while [ &quot;$n&quot; != &quot;Joe&quot; ]     # Or:   until [ &quot;$n&quot; == &quot;Joe&quot; ]
   do
     echo &quot;What's your name?&quot;
     read n
     echo $n
   done

There are &quot;break&quot; and &quot;continue&quot; commands that allow you to exit or skip to
the end of loops as the need arises.

Instead of [] we can use test.
[] requires space after and before the brackets and there should be spaces between arguments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sima==
The part about &quot;Sima&quot; was pretty messy. I cleaned it up a bit, but I don't think it belongs here. It isn't mead; it has no honey in it. Mead by definition has honey in it. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:24.147.141.127|24.147.141.127]] ([[User talk:24.147.141.127|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/24.147.141.127|contribs]])  on 2006-02-06.&lt;/small&gt;

:I agree, Sima isn't mead so perhaps should have its own article. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 08:55, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

==another recipe==
I havn't made mead for some time, but I used to use apple juice instead of water (500g honey / liter apple juice). You don't need yeast nutrient in this case and it also adds some acidity to make the taste somewhat richer. (This is the internet, so: I'm talking about real, pure apple juice made of apples and nothing else.) [[User:212.202.2.123|212.202.2.123]]
:What you are describing is called a ''cyser''. I agree, they are very nice, and easy to make (easier than a straight mead). [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:20, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

==Requests==
Please describe what it is to &quot;rack&quot; and a link to proper airlocks would be nice.</text>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The main characteristics in community acquired pneumonia 
Aim: To evaluate the main characteristics of adult inpatients with community acquired pneumonia  
Methods: We performed a retrospective study using the medical records completed between 1 January-31 December2004. The study group was composed of 333 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, 61.6% male. The average age was 56.5±16.9 years. The risk-class was estimated calculating the Fine score.
Results: In study group we found that 6.3% were in class V, 27.6% in class IV, 22.8%in class III, 24.6% in II and18.6% in class I respectively. The general mortality was 3%, 23.8% in class V. An important aspect of the group was their socio-economic status. About 67% of patients had income under  70 euros. An intriguing finding is a relatively high number of patients with blood urea nitrogen over 30 mg/dL. Hepatic disorders were the most frequent among co-morbid illnesses (this could be partially explained by alcohol abuse, 18.3% patients used more than 21 units/week).
Conclusion: There were a high number of low risk patients (I and II risk class) admitted. This situation is explained by low income of the patients. Only 8 out of 21 patients in risk class V were admitted to Intensive Therapy Unit. Despite this class V mortality was 23.8% comparable with anterior studies.</text>

Using the &quot;shift&quot; variable in the subroutine at the end of this page without mentioning it previously in the instructional is confusing.

Make it so...

__NOTOC__
== Ingredients ==
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 large onion,(Optionally: 2 Carrots and 2 Celery) finely chopped 
* 3 lbs (1.5 kilo) minced (ground) beef
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped or crushed
* 1 can (400 g) quality chopped plum tomatoes
* 10-15 basil leaves, chopped or torn (or 1 tsp dried basil)
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano
* 5 crushed black peppercorns (or to taste)
* 1 tsp sea salt (or to taste)
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* (Optionally) 150-200 ml red wine
* One pack of lasagne sheets

* 1.5 pints (850 ml) [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|béchamel sauce]]

* Finely grated parmesan

== Equipment ==
* One small pan for the bechamel sauce (preferably non-stick)
* One large, deep pan for the ragu
* A shallow oven-proof dish

== Procedure ==
# Heat the olive oil in a heavy base or non-stick pan over a medium-high heat. If the oil browns, turn the heat down.
# Add the onion and fry until golden brown
# Increase heat to high and add the meat and garlic. Fry until brown. Minced/ground beef takes some time to cook well. Fry until there is little moisture left in the pan. If necessary, spoon out any excess fat.
# Add the tomatoes and sugar, cover the pan and lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel sauce.
# Pre-heat the oven to 375F/190C
# Mix the basil, oregano, salt &amp; pepper into the ragu.
# Place a thin layer of ragu in the base of the ovenproof dish and cover with a single layer of pasta sheets. Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the pasta. Repeat this until you run out of meat, making sure that you have enough bechamel sauce left to cover the top layer of pasta.
# Sprinkle the grated parmesan over the top.
# Place the dish in the oven on the top shelf and cook for about 45 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and the sauce is bubbling.

== Hints &amp; tips ==
* Get good beef. This is the most important part of the dish. The best beef will produce little fat and a great flavour.
* Try using goats cheese and milk for the béchamel sauce. Sainsbury's and Safeways both sell a goat's cheese that's almost like cheddar in consistency. Perfect for béchamel sauce.
* Look for canned tomatoes in 'rich tomato juice'. They're a bit more expensive, but definitely worthwhile
* Fresh basil and pepper are a must.
* Try it with minced lamb

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome to PHP ==

PHP started off as a collection of Perl scripts used to aid in the maintaining of personal home pages. Hence, it originally stood for &quot;Personal Home Page.&quot;  However, the language has grown into a huge open source initiative, used by thousands of amateur and professional programmers world wide. It now is officially known as &quot;PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor,&quot; which is a recursive acronym (For some strange reason, open source programmers seem to love recursive acronyms).

The reason it is known as a preprocessor and not merely as a processor, is due to the fact that the php files are sent by the webserver to the PHP preprocessor to be processed. the resulting HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), is then sent across the internet to the web browser requesting the php page.

PHP has traditionally been used for adding dynamic content onto previously static webpages; however, due to the rapid development of the language, it is now used for writing command line tools, and now has GTK bindings allowing the programmer to write GUI applications!

Since the beginning of version 5 of PHP, with the inclusion of Zend Engine II as PHP's foundation, PHP now can be used to write Object Oriented applications.

You can download PHP free of charge (as it is an Open Source programming language) from http://www.php.net

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">As with most programming languages, file handling is very important for storing and retrieving a wide variety of data.

== Opening and Closing Files ==

To open a file, we use the fopen() function. This function takes in two parameters. Firstly, a String containing the name of the file, and secondly, the mode with which to open the file with. It returns a filehandler. e.g. :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $filename = &quot;text.txt&quot;;
 $f = fopen($filename, 'r');
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code assigns the file name of &quot;text.txt&quot; to a variable called $filename. Then it uses the fopen function to open up &quot;text.txt&quot; with 'r' mode (meaning &quot;read mode&quot;) and returns a filehandler to $f.

To close a file, we simply call the fclose() function, and pass it the filehandler. e.g. :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 fclose($f);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Including a File ==
It is very easy, in PHP, to include code (be it PHP or HTML) from one file into another. This is achieved by means of the include() function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 include (&quot;objects.php&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example, the PHP code will look within the current directory of the PHP file calling the include function, it will then open the objects.php file, and include its content at of that file at the position of the include() function.

== Writing to a File ==

The procedure for writing to a file is:
# Create a file handler.
# Use the file handler to open up an input stream from a file.
# Write Data to the file handler.
# Close the file handler.

Here is an example of writing two lines of text to a file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $filename = &quot;file.txt&quot;;
 $f = fopen($filename, 'w');
 fputs($f, &quot;Bonjour Madame.\n&quot;); // Hello Madam.
 fputs($f, &quot;Bonjour Monsieur.\n&quot;); // Hello Sir.
 fclose($f);
&lt;/source&gt;

fputs() is used to write data to the file. It takes 2 variables, firstly, the file handler, and secondly, a String to write to the file handler.

== Reading from a File ==
Reading from a file goes along much the same format as writing to one. The function used to read from a file is fgets() function. Which takes in two variables. Firstly, the filehandler from which to read, and secondly, the amount of data to retrieve.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $filename = &quot;text.txt&quot;;
 $f = fopen($filename, 'r');
 $line = fgets($f, 1024);
 print $line;
 print $total_contents;
 fclose($f);
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code opens up a file, reads the first line of the file, and then displays it. If we wanted to rather read the entire contents of the file into a variable, we could replace the $line=fgets() line with : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
  $total_contents = fread($f, filesize($filename));
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Info|This was a Case Study in progress, now linked to by the main page when it is complete. [[User:matt73]] was working on this.}}
== Case Study 1B - C front-end (Lex and Yacc) ==
The purpose of this case study is to give an example of a compiler/interpreter front-end written in C using Lex and Yacc. An interpreter is used since it allows a working program to be created with minimal extra effort (after the construction of the front-end). This code could be developed into a compiler by replacing the last phase with a compiler back-end.

The code is shown in an order which underlines the processes of creating a compiler, so the same file will be shown multiple times as it is developed.

The case study develops an interpreter for Very Tiny Basic, which is specified in the [[Compiler Construction/Case Study 1|Case Study 1]] section of the book.

The following steps shall be taken to complete the interpreter:
*Lexical Analysis
*Syntax Analysis
*Lexical Analysis with Semantics
*Abstract Syntax Trees
*Generating Abstract Syntax Trees
*Interpreting

Many important features of a useful compiler/interpreter have been left out, for brevity and simplicity, including:
*Dealing with Errors
*Optimization

Also some processes do not apply to such a simple language as Very Tiny Basic, for example Name Tables do not apply since only single characters are used to name variables.

'''Requirements'''
*A C compiler 
*[[w:Lex programming tool|Lex]] or equivalent ([[w:Flex lexical analyser|flex]]).
*[[w:Yacc|Yacc]] or equivalent ([[w:GNU bison|bison]]).
*(preferred) The [[w:Make|Make]] utility. 

=== Lexical Analysis ===
The first draft of the lex file identifies different tokens by returning a certain value in the associated C action. For keywords and operators this is simple, however identifiers, values and comments are trickier.

'''VTB.l''' - Version 1
&lt;pre&gt;
%{

%}

DIGIT [0-9]
LETTER [A-Z]

%%
&quot;LET&quot;           {return LET;}
&quot;IF&quot;            {return IF;}
&quot;THEN&quot;          {return THEN;}
&quot;PRINT&quot;         {return PRINT;}
&quot;REM&quot;[^\n]*     {return REM;}
&quot;GOTO&quot;          {return GOTO;}
&quot;GOSUB&quot;         {return GOSUB;}
&quot;RETURN&quot;        {return RETURN;}
&quot;STOP&quot;          {return STOP;}
&quot;FOR&quot;           {return FOR;}
&quot;TO&quot;            {return TO;}
&quot;STEP&quot;          {return STEP;}
&quot;NEXT&quot;          {return NEXT;}
\&quot;[^\&quot;]\&quot;       {return STRING;}
&quot;=&quot;             {return EQUAL;}
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;            {return NEQUAL;}

&lt;/pre&gt;

This file can be processed using one of the following
 lex VTB.l
 flex VTB.l

You may wonder where all those values we returned are coming from. They will be created by Yacc grammar file when it is processed.

There are some differences from the ''Very Tiny Basic - Specification'' in [[Compiler Construction/Case Study 1##Very_Tiny_Basic_-_Specification|Case Study 1]], for instance MULT and DIV in place of MULDIV. This is because we need to know the difference between the two. LineNumber and WholeNumber are lexically identical, and so cannot be separated at this time. Defining the use and category of tokens is left until the next stage.

=== Syntax Analysis ===

        | variable
        | NUMBER
        | STRING
        ;

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Lexical Analysis with Semantics ===
In this version of the lexer, the header file generated by yacc/bison is included. The header file defines the return values and the union that is used to store the semantic values of tokens. This was created according to the ''%token'' declarations and the ''%union'' part of the grammar file. The lexer now extracts values from some types of tokens, and store the values in the ''yylval'' union.

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Abstract Syntax Trees ===
[[wikipedia:Abstract syntax tree|Abstract syntax trees]] are an Intermediate Representation of the code that are created in memory using data structures. The grammatical structure of the language, which has already been defined and has been written down as a YACC grammar file, is translated into a tree structure. Using YACC &amp; C, this means that most grammar rules and tokens become nodes. Comments are an example of what is not put in the tree.

The grouping of operands is clear within the structure, so tokens such as parentheses do not have to be present in the tree. The same applies to tokens which end blocks of code. This is possible because the rules in the grammar file can use these tokens create the tree in the correct shape. 

''Illustration of grouping in abstract syntax trees''
 (1+3)*4     1+3*4
   
   *            +
  / \          / \
 4   +        1   *
    / \          / \
   1   3        3   4

In this interpreter the Primary/Secondary expression structures could be discarded by collapsing them. This would add complexity to the code, so it is currently not implemented. Rem statements are also kept (without the comment text) since the definition of VTB implies that they are a valid target for Goto. In fact, a goto to a non-existent line is undefined, so this interpreter will issue an error.

==== absyn.h ====
Using pointers and dynamic allocation is a must for the tree structure, or else it would be infinite in size and thus use too many resources (think about it). In order to keep the code nice and neat,

==== Makefile ====
Since we are working with standard *nix tools and the normal build system used on *nix is make, it is useful to write a Makefile for the interpreter. Keep in mind that most compilers/interpreters are very large and need a more advanced build system than this example. They may require CVS, autoconf and many makefiles distributed across different directories. Since this one only uses five files, it is quite trivial.

&lt;pre&gt;DEBUG_CFLAGS      := -Wall -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Wno-format -g -DDEBUG -O0
DEBUG_LDFLAGS    := -g 
RELEASE_CFLAGS   := -O3
RELEASE_LDFLAGS :=

#Comment out following line if you need optimization ;-)
DEBUG := YES

#Comment out following line if you're not using Windows/Dos
POSTFIX := .exe

ifeq (YES, ${DEBUG})
   CFLAGS       := ${DEBUG_CFLAGS}
   LDFLAGS      := ${DEBUG_LDFLAGS}
else
   CFLAGS       := ${RELEASE_CFLAGS}
   LDFLAGS      := ${RELEASE_LDFLAGS}
endif

.PHONY : all clean

all : vtbi${POSTFIX}

vtbi${POSTFIX} : vtbi.o y.tab.o lex.yy.o absyn.o
	gcc ${LDFLAGS} ${CFLAGS} -o vtbi vtbi.o y.tab.o lex.yy.o absyn.o

clean :
	-rm *.o y.tab.h y.tab.c lex.yy.c *.exe

y.tab.c : VTB.y
	bison -yd VTB.y -r state

y.tab.h : y.tab.c
	echo &quot;y.tab.h created by Bison as well as y.tab.c&quot;

lex.yy.c : VTB.l
	flex VTB.l
    
%.o : %.c
	gcc -c ${CFLAGS} $&lt; -o $@

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Generating Abstract Syntax Trees ===
'''VTB.y''' - Version 2
The lexer is now giving values for tokens and the abstract syntax tree structure has been written. Next the grammar file is updated to construct the trees from what the rules and semantic values. All the tree node types are added to the union declaration. Rules must be given types and return the correct type.

'''This tutorial needs some more explaining as to what is going (and why) in section 4.'''

In the following tutorial, you will use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;polygon mesh
&lt;li&gt;face loop cutting
&lt;li&gt;spin dup
&lt;li&gt;subdivision surfaces
&lt;li&gt;subdivision creases
&lt;li&gt;bevel
&lt;li&gt;set smooth
&lt;li&gt;multiple materials
&lt;li&gt;extrusion
&lt;li&gt;merge vertices
&lt;li&gt;remove doubles
&lt;li&gt;constraints
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

1. Press '''NUM'''-'''1''', '''7''' or '''3''' then '''SPACE''' ''&amp;rarr;add&amp;rarr;mesh&amp;rarr;cube'' to
make a cube aligned to the axes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

2. Hit tab to go into edit-mode and select all faces to prevent bevel
messing up normals. Hit '''WKEY'''-&amp;gt;bevel, recursion-&amp;gt;1 (you'll see why
later) then choose bevel size. Bevel of 0.15 is ok. &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay2.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

3. In editmode, go to the Editing tab ('''F9''') and look at the mesh tools 1
panel. In Blender 2.37, there is a set of buttons for edge measuring.
Turn on Edge Length and note the length of one of the sides of the
square faces. This should be 1.7 if the
above settings were used.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay3.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

4. A typical die has a grid of 9 possible positions for the dents and
the gap between the dents is the dent radius (or half the diameter). So, there are
conveniently 10 units on each edge of the square faces, where the gaps
use 4 of the units and the 3 dents use two each. This means the gaps are of
size 1.7/10 = 0.17 and the dents (1.7x2)/10 = 0.34.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:9 posiciones.jpg|341px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:muescas y espacios.jpg|341px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

5. To make these segments, use the face loop cut tool. Press '''KKEY'''-&amp;gt;face
loop cut and select one of the edges.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay5a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;

click and you get a blue line to position.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay5b.png|200px]]

Because it's very difficult to position using percentages, especially
after the first segment is made because you then have to work out
percentages of what's left but also because you can't seem to input
exact values, place the blue line to the far left edge and click once.
Do not click again because this line is on top of another one and it
will be tricky to select it again. If you make a mistake, hit '''UKEY''' or '''CTRL'''+'''ZKEY''' to undo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now press '''GKEY''' then '''YKEY''' to move the line along the axis (this is why the
cube needed to be aligned to the axes first). I'm using '''YKEY''' because of
the way my cube is setup - the blue line moves along the green axis. If
you've done it another way round, use the appropriate axis.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After hitting '''GKEY''', '''YKEY''', enter the exact value of the gap that we measured
(0.17) and hit return - if you make a mistake before hitting return,
hit delete and retype the number or press '''UKEY''' or '''CTRL'''+'''ZKEY''' after hitting return.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Select the remaining segment to the right of the line, cut this and
move the blue line as far as you can, which will be to the line you
just made. Move this line to 0.34 along y because it is where the dents
go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

6. Repeat step 5 with the remaining segment until you have made 6 cuts
of alternating size (0.17, 0.34, 0.17, 0.34, 0.17, 0.34) and get
something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay6.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

7. Now turn the cube round and do step 5 for the adjacent edge until
you get the grid forming. Note, you move the cuts along the x-axis now
so do '''GKEY''', '''XKEY''', 0.17 etc. Don't worry if the last edge says 0.169 instead of
0.17.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay7a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
You can see the grid of 9 squares mentioned earlier:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay7b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

8. The problem here is that it is very time consuming to do this for
the remaining 5 sides of the die. Instead, we will just duplicate the
one we have done already. But first the rest needs to be deleted. So go
into front view ('''NUM1''') and orthographic mode ('''NUM5'''). Also turn
off depth buffer clipping. Use vertex select mode and select the bottom
vertices:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay8a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Make sure these are the right ones by rotating your view with the
middle mouse button. Now press x and select 'vertices'. This should
leave
only the top side of the die:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay8b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
We now have to duplicate and rotate this side. There is a very handy
tool to save doing this manually called spin dup located in the editing
tab ('''F9''') in the mesh tools panel. We want to duplicate the side 3 times
in both the x and y axes to complete the cube - 3 times isn't necessary
in the second axis because we will already have a bottom side but it's
easier that way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Spin Dup works relative to your camera and the cursor.
So, put the camera into front view ('''NUM1''') and orthographic mode
('''NUM5'''). If you haven't moved the cube, the 3D cursor should be at
the center of the cube (at the pink dot). If not, go into object mode
('''TAB''') and select what's left of the cube and press '''SHIFT+S''' and select
'cursor to selection'. You can also manually move the cursor by going to
the view menu -&amp;gt; view properties and editing the 3D cursor position.
In this tutorial, it should be at (0,0,0).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The settings for spin dup are that we need 3 duplicates over a 270
degree rotation with 1 turn. Now press spin dup to get the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay8c.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay8d.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You will see the currently selected side is no longer the top side.
This means we have to go into top view and duplicate around the z-axis
so go into top view ('''NUM7''') and hit spin dup again to fill the
remaining sides.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

9. There will now be a few overlapping points. To get rid of these, go
to the editing tab again ('''F9''') and in the mesh tools, there is a button
called rem doubles. Select all the vertices by pressing '''AKEY''' and select
remove doubles. This may leave some overlapping points because the
threshold for removing doubles is set at 0.001 and some points might be
just outside that value. Setting it to 0.003 should get rid of all the
doubles to leave the die with 384 vertices (this information is at the
top of the Blender window). You can check by counting that each side has 8x8
vertices and there are 6 sides on the cube.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay9.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

10. The die needs the dents added. Select one of the faces where a dent
would go and extrude the face by hitting '''EKEY''' and then '''ESC'''. Do not
click after hitting '''EKEY'''. Collapse this face by using '''ALT+M''' to merge the 4
corners of the extruded face into the centre where it will tell you you
have removed 3 vertices. You should get the following:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay10a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;Do this for the configuration of the dots on that side. So for
example, 5 would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay10b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

11. Select one of the edges of the dents to check the size is 0.34.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay11a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Remember the dent radius was 0.17. We need to use this value to lower
the centre point of the dents down. Select all the 5 centre points at
once to save time and move them inwards by 0.17. The side I put the 5
dents on here was the top so I move the vertices inwards by pressing '''GKEY''',
 '''ZKEY''', -0.17 and hitting '''ENTER'''. I then get this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay11b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

12. '''TAB''' out of editmode. If you haven't done this already, hit set
smooth in the editing panel and turn on subdivision surfaces&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay12a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
It should look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay12b.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

13. On a die, the edges of the dents are usually sharp so we'll use
subsurface creasing to do that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go back into editmode and with the edge select mode on, select all the
perimeters of the dents like so (it may help to turn off subsurf for
the moment):&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay13.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Press '''SHIFT+EKEY''' to enable creasing and move the mouse until the display
says crease is at 1.&amp;nbsp; After pressing '''SHIFT+EKEY''', you can then set
crease values in the information box that you get by pressing '''NKEY''' when
objects are selected. This can be useful to check if all the edges have
the right crease because it gives you the average crease value and if
it is less than 1, there is an edge wrong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

14. Repeat steps 10,11 and 13 for all the sides of the die. REMEMBER, a die is
numbered so that opposite sides add up to 7. In my example, that means
I put 2 on the bottom etc. Once you finish, if you turn on subdiv level 2,
you will get something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay14.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

15. You can make a test render now to see that the dents look the right
size and the bevel is right. So, turn the subdivision level for the
rendering up to 3. To help position the camera so that you centre the
die, you can make the camera look at the die by adding a track-to
constraint to it. I prefer to track an empty though, because it is more
flexible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Make an empty by going into top down view ('''NUM7''') and hitting
'''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; add &amp;rarr; empty. It's always best to go into one of the set
orthographic views so as to align new objects to the axes. If you add
something misaligned, just go to the object menu then clear/apply &amp;gt; clear
rotation (or '''ALT+RKEY'''). Because the empty was created at the origin, you
might not be able to see it as it is inside the die. Hit '''ZKEY''' to enable
wireframe mode and select the empty. Just move it outside the cube
until we get the constaint set up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To add a track-to constraint, select the camera first then '''SHIFT+RMB'''
the empty and press '''CTRL+TKEY''' and choose track-to from the list. Move the
empty back inside the die. You edit constraints in the object tab ('''F7''').
Add a couple of lamps (both intensity 1) to get the scene like this or feel free to experiment with a more advanced lighting setup:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay15.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

16. To render, set the size of the image you want. 800x600 is a decent
size so put these settings in the format panel in the Scene tab ('''F10''').
In the render panel, make sure 100% is selected. If it's 50%,
the render will come out as 400x300. For preview renders, don't turn on
OSA, which is anti-aliasing because it slows your renders down
significantly. Try to only use it for a final render.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another way to position the camera is by selecting it and then looking
through it as you move it. Look through the camera by pressing
'''NUM0'''. Use the '''GKEY''' to pan across and rotate around the local axes
of the camera by pressing say '''RKEY''','''XKEY''','''XKEY''' to rotate in x axis. To zoom in and out
press '''GKEY''', '''ZKEY''', '''ZKEY'''. The '''mouse wheel''' zoom moves your view towards and away from
the camera.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another important point is to set the image format. This is done in the
format panel. The listbox has a number of image types. I find
that png is generally the best because it is lossless and offers the
highest compression among the lossless formats. It also supports an
alpha channel for transparency. When rendering an animation, it is
better to render as an image sequence than as a movie because it is
easier to edit these and repair broken frames. Quicktime supports
loading of image sequences and you can save as a movie using
a wide range of compression formats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To save the render, go to the '''file menu &amp;rarr; save image''' and type in the
full name of the image including the extension e.g. die.png.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The output should now be looking something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay16.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

17. To give it some colour, we will need to use multiple materials
because a typical die has dents that are a different colour from the
die itself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go to the editing section in the button panel again and make sure the die is selected. In
the links and materials panel, there is a section for materials and the
number in the box should be at zero. It may be at 1 if you have
assigned a material to the object already. Add enough to make 2
materials in total.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go back to the Shading panel ('''F5''') and there is a box at the very top of
the material panel with the number 2 beside it. Click this number to
make the two materials you've just created independent. Use the arrows
to the right of the ME button to switch materials.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Make material 1 bright red by just picking red in the colour picker or
by setting the RGB sliders. Make material 2 white by doing the same. Or
pick whatever colour you prefer and material settings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

18. These colours need to be assigned to the right parts of the die.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go into editmode and turn off subsurf to help. Select the inner faces
of the dents - if you accidentally don't press the '''SHIFT''', press
'''CTRL'''+'''ZKEY''' or '''UKEY''' to undo. Once they are all selected, go to the Editing
tab again and the material panel. Select the colour for the dents.
There is a button that says assign - press it and it will make the
dents white but the die remains red. Turn subsurf back on and render
with OSA (only put it up as high as you need for the resolution of the
image you are rendering):&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay18.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Extra:&lt;br&gt;
The reason I modelled the die this way is because it is also very easy
to change the sizes of the components e.g. the bevel and the dent size.
You do this by selecting the vertical or horizontal segments and just
scaling them in one axis. Here we will reduce the dent size and the
bevel by half.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go into front view ('''NUM1'''), turn off clipping and select a line
containing dents. Then just scale in one axis e.g. '''SKEY''', '''XKEY''', 0.5. Remember to
have your pivot point set to median:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWayE1.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Do this horizontally and vertically around the die. You should need to
scale 9 times for the dents and 6 times for the bevel:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWayE2.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
You may need to add extra geometry once you are satisfied with the
sizes of the dots and the bevel so that the edges of the die don't look
warped due to the subdivision. You can use face loop cut again for that
and add extra lines in the middle of the gap segments.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section includes miscellaneous tips that are of use during your test. These tips apply to the whole test unless otherwise noted.

== Pace wisely ==
While taking the ACT, make sure to answer each question quickly and give yourself ample time to finish the test. This is especially true in the English section which has more questions than any other section in the test. For this purpose it is recommended that you bring a watch to the exam in order to pace your time. Make note of the length of time in each session as each session has different timing and glance at the watch every 5 questions or so to keep up with pace. Make sure the watch does not have any alarms set on it. Any alarms going off during the test will get you disqualified, so make sure that  they are deactivated. Also, it may be preferable to lay the watch on the table opposed to wearing it, for the sake of comfort.

== Attempt to finish questions in order ==
Time is used most conservatively when questions are answered in order. It is still acceptable not to answer a difficult question, but keep in mind that this is where most of your time is lost. If the question is too hard then move on, but if you have a conflict between two answers, make a guess quickly and then move on. Either way, it is important to make a decision and commit to it. If the question takes more than 2 guesses, you should immediately move to the next one. Either way, never linger on a question for more than 10 seconds.

== Read materials first ==
When coming across a reading or science question always read through the materials before answering. This is especially important during the reading section. This is important, because if you do not read the materials, it will take you longer to answer the questions and you will have a greater chance of getting them wrong. Make sure you read, but read quickly, as the test does not allot you much time. For the science section, a quick skimming of the chart and graph heading should help you out while answering questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Perhaps the first thing we should look at is just what a video codec is.

Well, it's simple. '''Codec''' stands for '''CO'''mpressor - '''DEC'''ompressor. Choosing the right codec to use is the hard part for many. As the name suggests, a codec Compresses and Decompresses a file, Video, Audio or otherwise. There are many codecs out there, and many variations of those too. So this article is not aimed at informing you, the reader of all the codecs available, but rather to make it easier to select the right codec for the right job using the most common codecs.

When it comes to Video Codecs, much of it is personal preference. Some people do not mind compressing video until it looks pixilated just so long as they can fit more on a disc. Others will accept nothing less than perfect quality and the slightest blemish on an otherwise fine video sends them into a fit. This range of opinion makes it hard to give a definite answer as to what codec is &quot;best.&quot; And in all truth, none of them are. Every codec has a different use and was designed with that use in mind, even if it is used for other things today.


== 1. Compressing Codecs: What are they good for? ==
CODECS allow us to compress video and audio so that more can fit onto a disc. Whether it be a Hard Disk, Compact Disc, Digital Versatile Disc or the small memory cards used in portable media players. A common misconception is that compressing video can make it poor quality. This is only half true, it's all a matter of what CODEC is used and how the codec was configured. For example, DVD-Video uses MPEG 2 compression, this is a high quality compression CODEC that was made for DVD. If you were to make a [[SVCD]] (Super Video CD), you would still be using MPEG 2 but it would be configured in a different way to fit the data on a CD instead of a DVD. Same CODEC = different quality.
In short, CODECS allow us to fit more data on a storage device, but the more we want to fit, the more it has to be compressed. The more you compress, the more quality you are losing, although how apparent the quality loss is depends on the CODEC used.


== 2. They had them first... ==
For many years, we have used CODECS in every day life. DVD-Video uses MPEG 2. VCD uses MPEG 1. Videos we watch on the internet can use any number of CODECS. But for a long time, the use of CODECS to encode video was the domain of professionals with large workstations and even larger budgets. As more and more technology is made available to consumers, we now have the chance to do what the big guys have been doing for years. A few years ago, making your own DVDs was only on the drawing board. But the hardware and software required to do it is now available for all. And now the market is flooded with free codecs such as the Windows Media and OGG-Vorbis formats. And while some, like MP3, require payment to buy the codec, there is no shortage of codecs for consumers and even professionals on a budget to use.

== 3. The Main Formats ==
Unlike the VHS-BETA and DVD+/- wars, codecs do not commonly war with each other. They all try to make a better product, but in the end one codec is going to replace them all. So you can use a codec with confidence that it will not soon become unsupported or obsolete. Here is a guide to the main CODECS used.

'''MPEG 1''': Seen sometimes for Internet downloads but is more commonly used for the Video CD standard. It offers roughly the same or better video quality than VHS but not as good as DVD or SVCD.

'''MPEG 2''': Used on [[DVD]] and in another form for SVCD. When used on a standard DVD, it offers great picture quality and supports widescreen. When used on SVCD, it is not as good but is certainly better than VCD. Unfortunately, SVCD will only fit around 40 minutes of video on a CD, VCD will fit an hour.

'''WMV (Windows Media Video)''': Once only used for Internet streaming and distribution, it is now one of the hottest codecs available. It can do anything from low resolution video for dial up internet users to High Definition video to view on an HD TV. Files can be burnt to CD and DVD or output to any number of devices. It is also useful for Media Centre PCs.

'''Real Video''': Once the leader in internet video, it is now losing some ground to WMV but is still very common.

'''QuickTime''': A file format developed by Apple, also used for internet video. QuickTime also refers to software for playing video.  QuickTime for Windows is the Windows version.  QuickTime available directly from Apple supports about 12 codecs such as Animation codec, Apple Intermediate codec, Apple Pixlet codec, Cinepak, Component, DV (many flavors), Motion JPEG codec, Photo JPEG codec, and Sorenson.  The quality of older codecs were not usually as good as WMV and Real Video and downloads took longer.  Now Apple emphasizes the much more efficient MPEG 4 and MPEG 4 H.264 codecs but older codecs still play with the QuickTime software.  QuickTime '''Pro''' ($30) will compress iPod movies (MPEG 4) and H.264.  The iPod movies look great but Apple's H.264 compresses the color so that files are half the size of WMV files.

'''MPEG 4''': The latest MPEG codec can be used for internet and on disc like WMV.

'''DivX &amp; Xvid''': Types of MPEG 4.

'''H.264''': Type of MPEG 4 used on next-generation HD-DVD and BluRay discs.

'''DV Stream''' A codec and file format used for miniDV tapes and DV camcorders.

There are many more codecs available. To find out which is right for you, you should test each one and see what best suits your needs.

== 4. Case Study in Codecs ==
The [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop] creates Editing Workshops for beginning film students to learn to edit scenes from television dramas and motion pictures.  The Star Movie Shop locates all the film dailies for a scene from a television drama as NTSC video (29.97 frames per second), digitizes the dailies, then removes the extra frames added during the telecine (inverse telecine), then adds the scene name and frame number to every frame using a window burn and finally compresses the dailies for editing on personal computers.

To compress the clips, the Star Movie Shop must decide which codec to use.  This has not been easy.

The Star Movie Shop started developing these products eight years ago when most schools still used Adobe Premiere 4.2 and had extremely limited disk space.  The Adobe Premiere editing program works with movies of any frame size but the most common for schools was 320 by 240 pixels at 24 frames per second (which is the standard speed of motion picture film.) 

At that time, QuickTime was the most popular file format for digital video and the current version was '''QuickTime 3''' (it is now up to version 7).  With QuickTime 3, Apple introduced the Sorenson 2 codec which was extremely slow to compress but looked better than any other codec on the market.  It also offered a variable bit rate option which made the files for movies very small.  The Sorenson 2 codec is extremely efficient.  While it would be impratical to compress full-frame scene with the Sorenson 2 codec, it works fine for half size frames.

===Very Simple; Very Easy===
Therefore, for Disk #02 which has '''24 Unedited Scenes''' on a single DVD-Data disk, the Star Movie Shop used the Sorenson 2 codec which works with any version of QuickTime manufactured in the last ten years on both the Macintosh and Windows computers.  This was good!

===Fat and Awkward===
A few years later, the DV format became very popular.  Dozens of terrific, new editing programs became available (including iMovie and Movie Maker) but they only work with DV movies.  The DV codec is very popular because it was the first codec to be used as a standard for digital camcorders.  But the DV codec compresses only 5 to 1 and only at full frame size which is 720 by 480 (non-square) pixels for NTSC video at 29.97 frames per second. (This is NOT film speed.)  This makes DV very inefficient... but faster, specially for compression.  With this DV format, only one (1) scene can be stored on an entire DVD-Video disk for a two minute scene with a 5 to 1 shooting ratio.

Now users with DV editing programs cannot use Disk #02 from the Star Movie Shop.  Using the Movie Player that comes with QuickTime Pro or QuickTime for Windows Pro, users can convert the Sorenson 2 movies from Disk #02 to the DV format but unfortunately, only by stretching the clips so they looked really ugly.  QuickTime Movie Player does not letterbox movies when it enlarges them.  Also, it has to double some frames to convert from 24 fps to 29.97 pfs.  That makes the movies bigger and more awkward to edit.  Very bad news!!!

Therefore, on the new DVD disks from the Star Movie Shop, there is only one scene per disk.  The DVD-Video section has the clips in the MPEG 2 format compressed 200 to 1.  But in the DVD-Data section the clips must be in the DV format if people have a DV Editing program.

If QuickTime Pro was able to rip the MPEG 2 movies from the DVD-Video section, that would save a huge amount of disk space.  But it cannot.   That is why the dailies must be in two different formats (two different codecs) on the same disk.  Really dumb!!!

===Incompatibility===
This would not be too bad except there is an even greater problem.  Different editing programs prefer different formats.  iMovie prefers DV movies in the DV Streaming file format while Final Cut Express prefers DV movies stored in the QuickTime file format (not the streaming format), compressed with the DV codec.  Neither of these works at motion picture speeds of 24 frames per second which is the speed of all film dailies.   And since NTSC video and PAL video have different frame rates and frame sizes, this adds another degree of complexity in providing the film clips in a format that people can use.

Only Final Cut Pro can work with movies (usually in the Photo-JPEG codec) at full frame (640 by 480 square pixels) at 24 frames per second.   (The Sorenson 2 codec could not be used because it is too slow for compressing full frame scenes.  Sorenson 3 only works with new versions of QuickTime.  The only universal codec that works well at this size is Photo-JPEG.)

===Options Equally Awkward===
If the user is sophisticated, the user can convert the clips from one file format to another (within limits).  The problem is this is sometimes very awkward.  Apple's newest version of QuickTime does not correctly convert clips from film dailies (at 24 fps) to 29.97 frames per second when using the QuickTime option.  If you do this, the DV clips compressed in the QuickTime file format, store the clips at 24 fps which is unusable in all DV editing programs, even Apple's Final Cut Express.  Therefore, users must convert the dailies to DV Streaming which converts correctly to 29.97 fps and then convert DV Streams to QuickTime movies... in two separate steps.

===Today===
The Star Movie Shop still sells [http://www.starmovieshop.com/pages/disk2.htm Disk #02 - 24 Unedited Scenes] to young filmmakers who want to see how movies are filmed in Hollywood but the disk '''cannot''' be used as an editing workshop since beginning filmmakers cannot afford an editing program which will work with this frame size and frame rate. (Final Cut Pro costs too much for kids and Adobe Premiere 4.2 is no longer available.)

The newest disk from the Star Movie Shop is an unedited scene called &quot;Home Wrecker&quot; from ''Buffy, the Vampire Slayer''.  Fortunately, this scene is so short, the dailies can be stored in a variety of formats on the disk.   By carefully searching for very short scenes, the Star Movie Shop has found two other scenes (&quot;Hearing Voices&quot; from ''Law and Order'' and &quot;Fireworks Display&quot; from ''Northern Exposure'') which will fit on one disk each.

However, longer scenes from the Star Movie Shop require up to 3 DVD disks (and that is just with the NTSC DV codec video clips, not PAL.)  This is expensive and awkward.  So rather than solve problems, new and better codecs are creating new problems.  The disks come with MPEG 4 clips but since the clips are compressed with Apple's QuickTime Movie Player, the color is not good so these are only for situations where nothing else will work.  (And they require QuickTime 7 Pro which very few people have.)

It will be interesting to see if Blue Ray disks will make this easier or more complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An interjection is a short word used solely to express emotion. They help to make your Portuguese sound more authentic, and expand your expressive capabilities. They give your language more flavor.

Portuguese speakers are very expressive, so a familiarization with at least some of these terms is a must. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''então''' - When used as an interjection, '''então''' can mean the same as &quot;Anyway!&quot; It normally means &quot;Then...&quot; or &quot;So...&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Ah!''' - Is used as it is with most languages. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Socorro!''' - Means the same as &quot;Help me!&quot;, as it is used when there is an immediate danger of some kind. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Vamos!''' - Used in place of '''então''', similar to &quot;anyway&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Puxa!''' - Expresses admiration, like &quot;Wow!&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Perdão!''' - Literally, &quot;Pardon!&quot;, used to convey an apology. Typically less formal than its literal English translation. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Arre!''' - Expresses impatience. Like &quot;Come on!&quot;, &quot;Move&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To create an interjective expression from an adjective, use the combination ''Que + adjective!''. This is the equivalent of saying &quot;How [ajective]!&quot; in English. For example: &lt;br&gt;
*''Que bom!'' - &quot;How nice!&quot;
*''Que medo!'' - &quot;How frightening!&quot;
*''Que terrível!'' - &quot;How terrible!&quot;

==Misinformation==
The article states ''&quot;Scientists now know that the back bones of the Apatosaurus grew together as the animal gets bigger.&quot;'' I think it would be misinformation to say scientists &quot;know&quot;.  It took them nearly a hundred years to figure out the wrong head was on the body.  And in another hundred years they'll probably change their minds again.  The most that can be said is that scientists speculate about these things since they weren't there to make the observations first hand.  Saying the scientists know is carrying it too far.

Even thought the head has not been spoted it may never be found

== Apatosaurus picture ==

I'm trying to obtain an accurate Apatosaurus picture, featuring the whole body, without the neck tilted up(because it's disputed whether they really could tilt their heads up) and with the right head. A couple of days I have contacted the author of [http://www.psychosaurus.com/dino/images/apatosaurus.jpg http://www.psychosaurus.com/dino/images/apatosaurus.jpg] asking for permission, but no response yet.  It would be appreciated if someone could find one.  --[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 07:38, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

== Split this Article ==

Shouldn't this article be split? There should be an article on Apatosaurus, and a second brief article about the Brontosaurus naming mistake. It's confusing to mix them together IMO.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User: Dora Nichov| Dora Nichov]] ([[User talk: Dora Nichov|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/ Dora Nichov|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;
:I brought this up before actually.  And the general opinion seemed to be that ''Brontosaurus'' is a much more well known name.  I remember when I was a little kid learninga bout dinos I definitely learned about the amphibious ''Brontosaurus'', and I still have the book displaying it proudly.  The discussion was here: [[Talk:Wikijunior Dinosaurs#Brontosaurus  rename .28.3F.29]].  What you are suggesting is what the English-language Wikipedia does (see [[w:Brontosaurus]] and [[w:Apatosaurus]]), but I think because this is for kids it would just create unnecessary confusion.  Anyway the article here is really not long enough on its own to warrant a split in my view.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 01:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
::IMO the article should definitely be split. Kids are much more likely to learn about apatosaurus than brontosaurus these days. Just because we learned about brontosaurus when we were kids doesn't mean that todays kids learn the same thing (and in fact, they don't.) There should be one regular article on apatosaurus, and one 'special' article on brontosaurus. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 13:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

== Is &quot;Deceptive&quot; an adequately simple word? ==

Topic. I'm not sure, I want some opinions. Perhaps &quot;tricky&quot; (although that lacks some of the meaning, and could lead to misinterpretation)? As I said, I'm not sure. [[User:24.205.34.217|24.205.34.217]] 23:23, 7 May 2007 (UTC)
Also, on the article on Brontosaurus, is it correct to use emotive language to describe the degree of the mistake made (&quot;This was a &lt;b&gt;bad&lt;/b&gt; mistake&quot;)? Not sure, just asking. [[User:24.205.34.217|24.205.34.217]] 23:28, 7 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Note that every leaf of the call tree has the value 0 or 1. All of these ones are summed together to give the final answer, so for any n the number of leaves in the call tree is actually Fn itself!&quot;

Did the author mean to say that there are F(N+1) leaves? If we take the example given, F(6), there are F(6+1) = F(7) = 13 total leaves, *not* F(N) = F(6) = 8. It might also be helpful to mention at this point that there are 2*F(N+1) total nodes and, consequently, 2*F(N+1) total recursive steps required to calculate the Nth number in the sequence.

Please point out where I am wrong.

== Calculating fib(n) using its closed form ==

The author made mention that fib(n) can be calculated efficiently from its closed form. Theoretically I see no problem but I think you have to remember that practically the computer would store the value of the golden ratio in floating point variables which keeps limited precision. Therefore I don't think such an algorithm will be [[w:Numerically_stable|numerically stable]]. See [[w:Fibonacci_number#Computation|fibonacci computation]] for a further discussion of this. Of particular interest is that with standard IEEE 64-bit floats the results break down as early as n=75 and obviously for the standard IEEE 32-bit floats the results breaks down for even smaller n.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
'''Anaconda''' is a variant of seven card stud and has an initial phase of card swapping that gives it its name because the cards in your hand may &quot;snake&quot; their way around the table. It is also known as '''Pass The Trash''' because of this initial passing of cards, but that name does not always do it justice because some strategies expect trash to be passed and, therefore, pass higher cards in hopes of making a good hand with low ranked cards. The most descriptive name for this game is '''3-2-1 Left''' because it describes the passing rules in this initial phase.

==How to Play==
The dealer deals 7 cards down to each player, one at a time, starting with the player to his left. Each player, after looking at his hand, passes three cards to the player on his left. Each player then picks up the three cards from the player on his right. Each player now passes two cards to the player on his left and picks up the two cards from the player on his right. Finally, one card from each player is passed to the left and each player picks up the card from the player on his right. During each passing phase it is important that no player ever has more than seven cards in his hand and therefore must make sure that he passes his card before picking up the cards from his right. Each player now makes the best five card hand from his hand and discards two cards. Each player arranges his hand in whatever order he wishes and then places the hand face down on the table. The top card of each player's hand is &quot;rolled&quot; up and then there is a round of betting until four cards from each player's hand are showing. At this point each player declares whether his hand is a low hand, high hand, or both. This is done by placing a number of chips secretively in your hand and then all players reveal at the same time. A low hand is indicated by an empty hand, a high hand is declared by revealing one chip, and a high and low hand is declared by revealing two chips. Once it is clear what the nature of each hand is, the last card is flipped up.

==Who Wins==
In games where hands are declared high, low, or both it may be difficult to figure out who wins the pot. Generally, if any player declares &quot;both&quot;, that player's hand must beat (not tie) every low hand and every high hand. If a hand declared as &quot;both&quot; does not beat all other hands in the showdown then he does not win anything! If a hand then declared &quot;both&quot; does not win the pot then the pot is split in half. The highest hand of all hands that were declared &quot;high&quot; wins one half of the pot, and the lowest hand of all the hands declared &quot;low&quot; wins the other half of the pot. If there is only one type of hand (&quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;) then the entire pot goes to the winner of the best hand of that type. Also, if there is a tie for high or low then each of the players receives half of the pot that was allocated for that type of hand.

where do you get the bubble tea pearls, or how at least do you make them?
: The real dark-colored pearls can be purchased from a number of bubble tea-specific internet vendors.  See the Wikipedia entry for some decent links.   However, if you are willing to settle for the white pearls, you may be able to find them at your local grocery store, near where you would find Jell-O puddings. Get real tapioca pearls, not instant, 'minute', or granules.  They are normally soaked overnight in water, then cooked for about an hour in fresh water.  A tea shop near me uses a slow cooker (crock pot) to cook them.  When they are done, they are drained and I believe they are ready for use.  Some people store them in a [[simple syrup]].--[[User:Mdwyer|Mdwyer]] 23:53, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

I worked out that a cup size is 237ml but I have added the metric sizes and altered the serving sizes accordingly [[User:Sweetie candykim|Sweetie candykim]] ([[User talk:Sweetie candykim|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sweetie candykim|contribs]]) 12:30, 2 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

== MediaWiki subpages and http://www.editthis.info/virtualsoil/index.php/A_New_Story/1 ==

Hi. You asked in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] &quot;a question about Wikibooks setup&quot;; you wanted to enable subpages (slash in titles) on your wiki.

I am not sure exactly how to do this, but using [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/wikipedia/phase3/includes/DefaultSettings.php?rev=1.365.2.17&amp;view=markup DDefaultSettings.php in MediaWiki 1.5.5 in CVS] as a reference, I think that I know what to do.

I believe that you need to ask the web server administrator to edit LocalSettings.php and add &lt;tt&gt;NS_MAIN&lt;/tt&gt; to the list of namespaces in &lt;tt&gt;$wgNamespacesWithSubpages&lt;/tt&gt;. You will need to ask this of whoever set up editthis.info. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

==hey==
dont you think we should make copies of the pages from wikipedia and have them here too, instead of linking back to wikipedia? like all the character bios and stuff? i looked and most of the final fantasy pages are pretty bare and kinda sad, so i have planned to improve them alot, over time, when i have some free time... -[[User:Xornok|Xornok]] 02:36, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Illustrated Guide to the world of Spira (FFX and FFX-2)]] ==

On VFD you asked for a week to transfer this book to another site before it is deleted here. Could I ask whether this has now happened, especially as I don't want to delete it until you've had a chance to move or copy the material? Many thanks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:47, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

== RE: Deletion of Games from Wikibooks ==

Regarding your message left on my [[User Talk:DanielBC|talk page]], firstly I'm not a member of any particular project on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|Harry Potter guide]], I am actually brand new at Wikibooks.  But also, I don't understand why Harry Potter would be deleted due to &quot;Games on Wikibooks are being evicted&quot; concerns.  It's not a game, it's a series of books.  Why would it be deleted?  --[[User:DanielBC|DanielBC]] 23:18, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

In previous sections, we discussed some numbers that were very large. In astronomy, the appearance of such huge numbers is common. This is one reason astronomers and other scientists use '''scientific notation''' when working with very large or very small numbers. Scientific notation is a system for writing and working with numbers that makes it much easier to deal with numbers that are very small or very large.

[[Image:Schoty_abacus.jpg|thumb|150px|left]]

For example, the Milky Way Galaxy contains roughly three thousand billion billion billion billion tons of material. That is a rather cumbersome number. (Astronomers would never actually write this. Instead, they would say that the Milky Way contains one trillion times the mass of the Sun, which is somewhat easier. We'll use this much larger number for our demonstration.) You could also write this number as
:3 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 tons,
but that's even worse. Scientific notation makes the number much more compact and readable:
:3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; tons.
This number is verbally expressed as &quot;three times ten to the 39 power tons.&quot; This is numerically equivalent to the first two expressions.


[[Image:Scientific Notation Cubes.svg|thumb|right|Using an exponent to represent a number allows that number to grow very big very fast. This makes it convenient to represent very large or very small numbers using exponential notation.]]

A number written correctly in scientific notation has two parts. The first is a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10 (but it can be either positive or negative). This is sometimes called the '''mantissa'''. The second part is the number ten raised to a whole number power. The exponent of the second number is called the '''power'''. Some examples of numbers written correctly in scientific notation are:
:2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;
:-1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:7.656 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;
:2.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;
These, on the other hand, '''are not''' valid examples of numbers written in scientific notation:
:0.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; '''is wrong''' because the mantissa is less than 1
:12 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; '''is wrong'''  because the mantissa is not less than 10
:8.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2.2&lt;/sup&gt; '''is wrong''' because the power is not a whole number
Remember that
:10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 10 × 10 × 10 × ... for ''n'' times,
which means that ten raised to ''n'' power is the same as 10 multiplied by itself ''n'' times, which is the same as a 1 with ''n'' zeros written after it. For example, 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is 10 × 10 × 10, or 1000. That means that our earlier number, 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; tons, is equivalent to
:3 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 tons,
which is a three followed by 39 zeros. A number written in scientific notation with a negative power corresponds to a small number. For example, the number 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; is written as 0.001 in conventional notation. In general,
:10&lt;sup&gt;-''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/10 × 1/10 × 1/10 × ... for ''n'' times.

|[[Image:Scientific Notation Big.svg|thumb|left|These are the steps in converting a large number expressed in scientific notation into standard notation. Write the mantissa and find the location of the decimal point, and shift the decimal point by the number indicated in the power. Here, the power is 9, so the decimal is moved nine digits to the right.]]
[[Image:Scientific Notation Small.svg|thumb|right|These are the steps in converting a small number expressed in scientific notation into standard notation. The steps for converting a small number are the same as for a large number, but the decimal point should be shifted to the left instead of to the right.]]
|}

Since scientific notation relies on powers of ten, it's simple to convert a number from scientific notation to standard notation or vice versa. To convert a large number (with a positive power) from scientific notation to standard notation, first identify the decimal point in the mantissa, then shift the decimal to the right by the number indicated by the power. To convert a number from standard notation to scientific notation, just reverse these steps. Find the decimal point in the number, and move it until the number is at least 1 but less than 10. Count the number of places you moved the decimal point and use that number as the power. If you moved the decimal point to the left, make the power positive. If you moved the decimal point to the right, make the power negative.

Scientific notation also makes it simpler to do multiplication and division. To multiply two numbers in scientific notation, multiply the mantissas and add the powers:
: (3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) × (4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;)
: (3 × 4) × 10&lt;sup&gt;4 - 2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 12 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
In some cases, such as the one shown here, you may need to shift the decimal point again ensure that the number is in correct scientific notation. It should never be necessary to shift the decimal point by more than one digit. When dividing numbers in scientific notation, divide the mantissas and subtract the powers:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{3 \times 10^4}{4 \times 10^{-2}} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(3/4) \times 10^{4 + 2}&lt;/math&gt;
: 0.75 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;
: 7.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
Here also, it may be necessary to shift the decimal point and change the exponent.

Scientific notation makes it easy to compare numbers that have very different values because all the zeroes have been replaced with the much more readable exponent. Numbers with a greater exponent are ''always'' bigger than numbers with a lesser exponent.

If one of the exponents is bigger than the other by more than a couple, the difference between the two is clearly very big. Recognizing a huge difference between two numbers can sometimes be a very useful insight, so it often makes sense to take a moment to develop an intuitive feel for a math problem before attacking it. In some cases, it's useful to see roughly by how much one number is larger than another. Scientific notation makes this much simpler. For a rough estimate, you only need to find the difference in the exponents. For example, 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, since 7 - 3 = 4.

:Some tourists in the Chicago Museum of Natural History are marveling at the dinosaur bones. One of them asks the guard, &quot;Can you tell me how old the dinosaur bones are?&quot;

:The guard replies, &quot;They are 73 million, four years, and six months old.&quot;

:&quot;That's an awfully exact number,&quot; says the tourist. &quot;How do you know their age so precisely?&quot;

:The guard answers, &quot;Well, the dinosaur bones were seventy three million years old when I started working here, and that was four and a half years ago.&quot;

:(From the Science Jokes Web page[http://www.xs4all.nl/~jcdverha/scijokes/])

In science, measurements are never perfect and numbers are never exact. As a result, every measurement we make has some '''uncertainty''' associated with it. Scientific notation makes it easy to express how precisely a number is known. Suppose a paleontologist discovers ancient dinosaur bones and finds that they are 73 million years old. Of course, the paleontologist doesn't know exactly how old they are. Maybe they're 73,124,987 years old, but the paleontologist only knows the age within 1 million years, so the age is written as 73,000,000 years, or 7.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; years. Either of these expressions imply that the bones aren't ''exactly'' 73 million years old, but are 73 million years old, give or take a million years. 

But what if the paleontologist knows the age within 200,000 years, and is sure that the bones aren't, say, 73.4 million years old? In that case, the standard notation is ambiguous — the number is still written as 73,000,000 years. In scientific notation, we can write the number as 7.30 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; years. If we write this, we mean that the third digit is '''significant'''. The paleontologist might have calculated that the bones are 72,954,332 years old, but it would be useless to report these numbers, since the error on this measurement was 200,000 years. The extra digits are insignificant. The number of '''significant figures''' in a number are a reflection of the precision expressed in the number. In this case, the number of significant figures is three. The first significant figure is 7, the second is 3, and the third is 0.

Scientific notation gives the trailing digits written after the decimal point of a number special meaning — they tell that the number is exactly 7.30 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; years. This is unlike the usual use of numbers in mathematics, where trailing zeroes after the decimal point have no special meaning.

In the story about the museum guard, the guard hadn't thought about the precision of the age of the bones. It doesn't make sense to add the four years to 73 million years because the uncertainty in the age quoted to the guard was a ''lot'' more than 4 years. When working with numbers that have uncertainties, we must be sure not to express better precision in the results of our arithmetic than we had in the first place.

When doing arithmetic, numbers being added or subtracted are treated differently from numbers being multiplied or divided.
:'''When multiplying or dividing numbers with uncertainties, make sure that the answer has as many significant figures as the least precise of the original numbers.'''

For example, in (2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) × (1.21 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the number 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has two significant figures and the number 1.21 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has three significant figures. The result should have two significant figures: 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. We assume that there was some uncertainty in the measurement that gave us 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and this leads to some uncertainty in the result of the computation.

Addition and subtraction work differently. When adding 23.14 and 2.2, for example, the number 2.2 has uncertainty beginning in the tenths place. This uncertainty makes it pointless to report the hundredths place in the sum. To see this, try adding some uncertainty to 2.2 and see how this affects the sum.
:'''When adding or subtracting numbers with uncertainties, round the result to the last significant place of the original number with the greatest uncertainty.
For example, 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be written as
:{|
| || 2300
|-
| + || align=&quot;right&quot; |  110
|- style=&quot;height:0px&quot; bgcolor=&quot;black&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|- 
|  || 2410
|}
But we don't know the real value of the tens place in 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, so we really only know the answer to the hundreds place. We should write
:{|
| || 2300
|-
| + || align=&quot;right&quot; |  110
|- style=&quot;height:0px&quot; bgcolor=&quot;black&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|- 
|  || 2400
|}
or 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This may seem incorrect, but we're really only rounding off. Since we don't know the result to better than two significant figures, it makes no sense to report the extra digits — that would be like the museum guard who tells visitors that the dinosaur bones are 73 million and four years, six months old.

Almost every number has a '''unit of measurement''' attached to it. The number we used as our first example carried units of tons, and we expressed the age of the dinosaur bones in years. The units a number carries are part of the number itself. Units can also be multiplied or divided just like numbers.

As an example, consider a simple equation:
:distance = velocity × time.
Suppose you drive in a car with a speed of 100 kilometers per hour (60 miles per hour) and you go in a straight line for one hour. The distance you will travel is 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{distance} = 100 \frac{\mathrm{kilometer}}{{\mathrm{hour}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!/}}
\times 1 {\mathrm{hour} 
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!/}
&lt;/math&gt;
or 60 miles. We have cancelled hours as though it were a number.

This trick is also useful when you need to convert units. If you have a result in one system and you'd like to convert to another, you can set up a ratio, such as 1,000 meters/1 kilometer. Since 1,000 meters is equal to 1 kilometer, the ratio 1,000 meters/1 kilometer equals one. Because of this, multiplying any number by 1,000 meters / 1 kilometer will not change the value of the number. If we want to know what 100 kilometers is in meters, we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
100\mathrm{\ kilometers}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!/ 
\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\times
\frac{1000\ \mathrm{meters}}{
\mathrm{kilometer}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!/},
&lt;/math&gt;
or 100,000 meters.

Other units of measurement used in astronomy are '''kilograms''' (mass), '''Newtons''' (force), and '''Joules''' (energy).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In all forums, it is vitally important to have good clear pictures.  See [[Budget Watch Collecting/Watch Photography]] for help with this.  Ebay charges extra for extra pictures, and many watch forums have limited picture space.  In those cases, it is often easier to use a free hosting service like [[http://photobucket.com Photobucket]] and post links.  Mechanical watches should usually show the movement if possible.  If the watch is running, show pictures with the second hand in different positions.  If a watch is not running, check the balance--If there is no play, report that.  

With inexpensive watches, you need to balance your time with the extra bids better pictures will generate.  I place my watches on a stand, take them to the wall of my porch outside, and take a fairly standard series of photos--Full face, then I rotate the watch to 5 or 6 positions showing all sides and back.  I'll then take a picture of the back,  and a movement picture for mechanicals.  I'll try to get two pictures of any flaws--One with lighting adjusted to make the flaw stand out, another &quot;actual view&quot; with the flaw how it really looks in normal lighting.   If the watch glows strongly in the dark, I try to get a picture of that.  

Don't's:  Make sure a calendar watch isn't photographed in the middle of a date change--Fairly common, that is where the watch is most likely to stop on its own, but it makes it look like the calendar is misaligned.  Chronographs should be photographed both reset and with the chrono running.   LED's should be photographed without flash, with the digits lit. 


Outlets:

So far, my selling has been done on Ebay.  I almost always start with a starting bid a small fraction of the expected price, no reserve and take my chances.  Sometimes I'll set a &quot;buy it now&quot; of about 20% more than I expect the watch to sell for. Occasionally I'll get a buy-it-now, often I'll get a low starting bid but a final price higher than the buy-now price.  

Many watch forums have associated trade forums. Rules vary, and in general expectations are higher, with no &quot;don't know what I'm doing&quot; excuses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:parsons_unit_act.gif|center|The elements of action]]

To many theorists, the locus of interest lies in actors, actions, and interactions between persons. But before any research can be done on those issues, the basic points of discussion that are involved in the above topics need to be laid out. In other words, it must first be asked, &quot;What is a human action?&quot;

The American sociologist [[w:Talcott Parsons|Talcott Parsons]] created a model of human action which stressed that the most basic interesting event to recognize is ''goal-directed action''. It was further refined by his student [[w:Robert K. Merton|Robert K. Merton]]. In this model, human actions are made up of and involve:
* '''The actor or agent''' performing an action (including their intentions, schemas, knowledge, motives, and identity);
* '''The goal''', or a future [[w:state of affairs|state of affairs]] that is desired (which may be a ''means to another end'' or an ''end in itself''; involve ''human communicative action'' or be an ''object-oriented action''; and be either ''a creative goal'' or ''reaction to a dilemma'');
* '''The situation''' in which action is located, including both:
** The ''conditions of action'' (the things about a situation that the actor cannot influence or change). This includes such things as the '''normative background''' (or the relevant norms), the ''obstacles'' in the way of achieving the goal, and the ''[[w:human ecology|human ecology]]'' of the setting
** The ''means of action'' (which the actor has some degree of control over)

* And to this, we can also include:
** the ''actual consequences'' of the action (which may be ''foreseeable or unforeseeable'', and either ''intended or unintended'').

Though immediately intuitive and common-sensical, this model is useful as a preliminary guide by which research can be structured. (In semantics, the analytical tool of '''[[w:thematic role|thematic role]]s''' bears many of the same characteristics. This sort of model is one concern in [[w:action theory|action theory]].)

On its own, the above model describes all voluntary ''human action''. However, social psychologists are more interested in describing a narrower subject matter: namely, '''social actions''' and '''aggregate actions'''. A &quot;social action&quot; was defined by Max Weber as any action that &quot;takes account of the behaviour of others and is thereby orientated in its course&quot;; that is to say, another person may be involved in the ''means, goal, or context'' of action (1947). Broader still, social psychologists may be interested in ''aggregate action'', when there are multiple actors attempting to achieve the same ends independently of one another.

Of parallel interest at this level of analysis are the issues involved in '''socialization'''. What are the forces that cause people to learn their social roles? What are the mental processes that produce a socialized person? What is the role of biology in determining a person's development?

== Self ==
One important question is &quot;What does it mean for me to have a self?&quot; It is a question that has been given treatment in a number of theories.

:'''''Philosophical approaches.''''' Philosopher [[David Hume]] regarded the Self as the feeling of continuity of one's experiences, roughly akin to the conscious mind. His theories can be seen as an early prelude to postmodern identity theories ([[Gergen]], [[Harré]]) for they both speak of the notion of the Self in very minimal terms. The common rejection of [[essentialism]] relies upon the idea that the self is something that is in a state of constant change rather than a fixed trait.

:'''''Psychodynamic approach.''''' Psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] understood the Self to be composed of a number of different selves, each of which was tailored to fit their own unique demands of social life. These &quot;selves&quot; were sometimes conscious, sometimes not.

:'''''Social behaviorism.''''' This is a theory developed by [[George Herbert Mead]] that emphasizes the relevant social context of the learning environment. 

:Social behaviorism is influenced by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theories, [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and the [[pragmatism|pragmatic philosophy]] of the [[Chicago school]] ([[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], [[Charles Peirce|Peirce]], Shibutani, etc.). Yet social behaviorism contrasts with cognitive psychology and Darwinian theories in one important aspect. Social behaviorism doesn't consider mind as something that is pre-existing to interaction.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...We find no evidence for the prior existence of consciousness as something which brings about behavior on the part of one organism that is of such a sort as to call forth an adjustive response on the part of another organism, without itself being dependent on such behavior. We are rather forced to conclude that consciousness is an emergent from such behavior; that so far from being a precondition of the social act, the social act is the precondition of it. (Mead, 1934) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Although this theory carries within it the word ''[[behaviorism]]'', it has very little if anything to do with the behaviorism of [[John B. Watson]] or [[B.F. Skinner]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; Behaviorism in this wider sense is simply an approach to the study of the experience of the individual from the point of view of his conduct, particularly, but not exclusively, the conduct as it is observable by others. (Mead, 1934) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

:'''''Other sociocultural theories.''''' The social behaviorist's perspective resembles the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]], which places learning in the context of social interaction.

==Personality and personal identity==
One of the areas of research in social psychology is [[personality psychology]]. It is a subfield that engages in the study of people and the meanings they associate with themselves. Of interest to this area are questions like, &quot;What is my [[personal identity]]?&quot; and &quot;What are the factors and influences that make me who I am?&quot;. In this article, and by the standards of current research, one's personality is their ''personal identity'', both self-perceived and perceived by others (Cote and Levine). It is a kind of ''meaning''.

:'''''Meaning and self-concept.''''' Some researchers use tools borrowed from the symbolic interactionist tradition, such as the notions of ''self-concept'', the ''looking-glass self'' and the ''ideal self''. The &quot;self-concept&quot; is the idea that people actually have of a person, while the [[looking-glass self]] is the ideas and judgments that the actor thinks others have of them. The [[ideal self]] is the standard to which people aspire to be like, often influenced by [[role model]]s.

:'''''[[Big five personality traits]].'''''

:'''''Applications.''''' One topic of concern is the manner in which people are susceptible towards becoming dominators or victims because of aspects of their personalities. In order to help explain the effects that personality might have in acts of coercion and violence, social psychologists created the notions of [[Social dominance orientation|Social Dominance Orientation]]. This concept has also been used to facilitate critical-political tools, such as that of [[Right Wing Authoritarianism]].

:'''''Implicit personality judgments.''''' Another question of earnest importance is, &quot;Why do other people see me the ways that they do?&quot;. One answer comes from '''[[Implicit personality theories]]''. This set of theories postulates that people have abstract ideas about personality traits that they cluster into positive and negative sets, and which are used implicitly to evaluate others. For instance, a person (Bob) may receive some cues from another person (Joe) which reflect a positive or negative trait about them (Joe). If the judger, Bob, makes a judgment about the other (Joe) without reflecting upon their reasons for the judgment, it will often lead to assumptions and true inferences about other unseen personality traits. For example, a person who is wasteful might also be seen as clumsy, unintelligent, or irresponsible; while a person who is skillful might be assumed to be determined, industrious, and intelligent. In effect, then, this model predicts that Bob will implicitly assume that any person who has one negative trait, also has a number of other negative traits.

=== Identity and identity formation ===
:'''''The [[sense of community]]'''''. Involves the subjectively perceived sense of the traits of members of a social group. Is the conceptual center of [[Community psychology]].

:'''''[[Social identity]]'''''. A person's social identity is their position within a particular social structure. One explanatory attempt in this field has been [[Social identity theory]], which argues that people will cluster themselves and others into meaningful groups. Related notions include [[role]]s, which denotes a person's concrete place in a particular organization, and [[stereotype]]s, which are a collection of traits that is attributed to members of a certain social set.

:'''''[[Place attachment]]'''''. An actor feels a bond to a certain place, usually through extensive interaction with it. Through enough exposure to a certain environment, the actor may begin to associate their social and personal identity with that place.

:'''''Identity formation strategies.''''' ''How do people develop their identities? What kinds of identities are there? When will an identity be more resilient across a life-span?'' These are all questions worth considering.

: Writing in a quantitative branch of the psychodynamic tradition is [[James Marcia]], author of the [[identity status paradigm]]. He argued that identity across the lifespan of a person could be attributed to two elements: their ''commitment'' to an identity, and their conscious choice (involving ''exploration'' of alternatives). From these two variables, four identity statuses can be established, which describe actors in varying states of identity consolidation:
:*Identity ''Diffusion'', when a person has neither chosen nor committed to any identity;
:*Identity ''Foreclosures'', when a person has committed to an identity to which they never chose;
:*Identity ''Moratorium'', when a person entertains a number of identity choices, but expresses no commitment; and
:*Identity ''Achievement'', when a person has committed to an identity of their own choosing.

:The formation and development of personal and social identity depends both on biological and environmental conditions. Sometimes, these conditions are not ideal; people grow up with certain functional handicaps and dispositions, or they grow up in poor social environments. In these cases, what results is a malformation of identity. There are three kinds of persons who hold malformed identity strategies: 
:*''Refusers'', who outright refuse to enter adulthood, and shun any behavior that would place them within a social system;
:*''Drifters'', who similarly fail to integrate into a social system, and do not place emphasis upon particular identity traits, but seem to pick up and harness their skills in a discontinuous way; and
:*''Searchers'', who are willing to integrate into social systems, but either cannot find an appropriate community, or suffer from low self-esteem which blinds them to the available communities.
: There are also two other identity-formation strategies which seem at least overtly functional:
:*''Guardians'', who have succeeded at integrating into a social system, but without their personal reflection or consent;
:*''Resolvers'', who have both succeeded at integration into a social system and have done so of their own will and cognition. (Cote and Levine)

:A different set of identity strategies have been postulated by postmodernist [[Kenneth Gergen]]. He identifies:
:*''The strategic manipulator'', who feels alienated from previous sources of their identity, and who suffers a burden of having to maintain inauthentic, false impressions with others;
:*''The pastiche personality'', who disregards identity altogether, sees identity as a mere tool, and lives instead upon continuous experience in the world; and
:*''The relational self'', where the actor is seen as merely a part of a greater social whole.

:'''''Topics.''''' Related issues which require explanation are those of [[race]], [[religion]], [[gender]], and [[sexual orientation]].

[[image:stick-action.gif|thumb|70px|right|Social action]]
The subject of &quot;human nature&quot; often comes up in social philosophy and political discussion. One of the key questions that the topic raises is, &quot;Is humanity inherantly good or bad?&quot;. In other terms, &quot;Is humanity prone to violence, or to peace?&quot; To the extent that an answer can be provided, it will be in shades of grey.

:'''''[[Helping]] (or [[Pro-social behavior]]) and [[apathy|Indifference]]'''''. Why do people sometimes help those in need, and sometimes do nothing? A number of explanations have been created.

:The [[arousal/cost reward model]] claims that the decision to aid is based on a weighting of the costs and rewards involved, both for oneself and others. If the costs outweigh the benefits, then this model predicts that the actor will fail to act. A related model is the ''evolutionary theory of pro-social behavior'', which postulates that helping behavior may have found an instinctual place within human nature in order for parents to aid their children and thus preserve the genetic line. 

:However, the cost-reward and evolutionary theories might at first blush seem to have trouble in showing how and why some people go out of their way to help total strangers, regardless of cost. A contrasting explanation is that of the [[empathy-altruism model]], which explains helping behavior through ''empathy with the victim'' and subsequent ''empathic distress''.

:Both ''cost'' and ''empathy'' models seem to fall short in explaining the [[bystander effect]]. This effect is the social fact that people in crowds are less likely to help someone in need than they would be  were they alone with the victim. Despite feeling empathic distress, and despite  condrelatively low cost in helping, people in crowds seem to suffer from a ''diffusion of responsibility''.

:But what is happening at the cognitive level when people engage in helping behavior? There are two big perspectives on this matter: theory-theory and simulation-theory. [[Theory-theory]] states that empathy is a product of using a rule-oriented &quot;theory of mind&quot;. On the other hand, there is [[simulation-theory]], which argues that empathy occurs when a person imagines the experience of putting themselves in the victim's position.

:Empirical study has shown that there are certain characteristics of a target, context, and situation which make helping more likely. A ''target'' is more likely to be helped if the actor has a positive acquaintanceship or liking to them, the actor sees themselves as similar to target, and the target seems to deserve aid. Helping is most likely to occur when the normative environment smiles upon helping behavior by beneficient rules and expectations in common currency, and if the actor sees helping as a strong part of their identity or role. Also important are the effects of modelling, whereby an actor sees a third party helping the target, and is inspired to copy the act; personal mood; and sense of guilt.

:The consequences of receiving aid depend upon the sort of aid that is given. In many instances, the result is a feeling of gratitude. However, if the aid is excessive, it may create a sense of indebtedness, low self-esteem, and possible resentment in the target.

:'''''[[Aggression]]'''''. Just as we may study the causes of helping behavior, we may also study the reasons and motives behind acts of hostility initiated by one person on another. Suitably, the theories in this field are highly controversial.

:Thinkers in the psychoanalytic tradition have suggested that humanity does have an innate drive towards destruction called Thanatos, or the [[death instinct]] hypothesis. These outlooks tend to see some violence as [[catharsis]].

:Another outlook is the [[frustration-aggression hypothesis]], which is a highly controversial hypothesis that states that all aggression stems from frustration and vice-versa.

:More recent approaches include the [[Aversive emotional arousal]] model and the ''social learning theory of aggression''.

:Research into the causes of '''anti-social personality disorder''' (frequently known as ''psychopathy'') may yield insight into this subject.

:'''''[[Suicide]]'''''. The classic sociological work of [[Emile Durkheim]] on suicide has produced items of worthwhile study for social psychology. According to his theory, suicide may be motivated by the level of integration that the actor has in their social setting. He categorized suicide into  four categories, which reflect four degrees of integration into a social group: [[anomic]], fatalistic, egoistic, and altruistic.

== Communicative action ==
A number of disciplines and subdisciplines examine various facets of communication. Some of these disciplines include: Communications studies, Pragmatics, Semantics, Semiotics, Linguistics, Rhetoric, Sociolinguistics, Sociology of language, and so on. Social psychology may borrow the tools needed to explain social behavior from the work of these other disciplines.

[[image:Soc-psy_comm-persua.gif|center|Communication-persuasion paradigm]]

: '''''Communication-persuasion paradigm.''''' In attempting to understand the ''objective factors'' that are in play when people communicate with one another, the ''communication-persuasion paradigm'' begins with this model of what goes on in human communication:
:* The ''source'' is the person who is trying to influence another person. What makes a good persuader are how credible, trustworthy, attractive, and competent they are. (In linguistics and pragmatics, the intentions of the speaker to make something understood is referred to as the utterance's [[illocutionary force]]);
:* The ''message'' is what the source is trying to convince the target of. Relevant factors include how far the message departs from the target's ideas, whether or not there is an appeal to emotion, and whether or not there is a balance of perspectives;
:* The ''target'' is the person who the source is trying to convince of something. Important to them are the relevance of message to person, their personal desire for cognition, and amount of distractions present;
:* The ''channel'' is the venu that the message is delivered;
:* The ''impact'' is the reaction from the target. This may include an attitude change, a rejection of the message, a counterargument, a suspense of judgment, and/or an attack on the source. (In linguistic and social philosophy, this is often referred to as an utterance's [[perlocutionary force]].)

: In all cases, the plight of those suffering from '''[[aphasia]]''' is of research interest to those who study communication.

One topic of great concern within the scope of communication is the issue of ''[[persuasion]]'', which can be understood as whenever an actor attempts to change another's thoughts or behaviors based on the ''charismatic and/or reasoned'' input. 

:'''''[[Elaboration likelihood model]].''''' This model is one attempt to explain how the process of persuasion works. It states that there are two methods by which a person may be persuaded of some message: through the ''central route'', when the listener logically processes and considers the message and all its implications, or through the ''peripheral route'', when the listener is persuaded for non-rational peripheral cues (such deference to authority, succinctness of message, or if others accept message as well). The model predicts that whether or not a message will provoke an attitude change in the listener depends on whether or not it is interpreted via the central or the peripheral route. If a message provokes an attitude change on the basis of superficial information, it may be temporarily adopted, but is less likely to be resilient or defended in the face of criticism. On the other hand, if a message goes through the central route, and passes the subject's reasonings, it will be more resiliently held in the future.

:'''''[[Social impact theory]].''''' Trying to explain the objective conditions where any particular message will have social influence, Latane, Jackson, and Sedikides emphasized the importance of three characteristics of the sources in their ''social impact theory''.
:* ''Social Strength'' of the actors involved, for example power and social status
:* ''Immediacy'', or the physical / psychological distance between actors
:* ''Number of Sources Present''

:'''''[[Functionalism (sociology)]].''''' For ''functionalism'', the achievement of goals relative to the normative background is important. To the extent that a) an action is beneficial towards the achievement of a goal, and b) the goal and/or means are compatible with the normative goals and means of some group or society, the act is considered ''functional'' in that respect / relative to that goal. Conversely, to the extent that a) the act is an obstacle to achieving a desired goal, and b) the goal fits the normative background of some group or society, the act is considered ''dysfunctional'' in that respect.

:'''''Subjective factors in persuasion.''''' ''Symbolic interactionism'' stresses the importance of the way the actor ''subjectively perceives'' persons in the world in order to explain how persuasion occurs. Following their models, a person may be more likely to be persuaded when the persuader is more in line with the thoughts and opinions of:
:* the '''[[generalized other]]''' - the actor's notion of the normal expectations of others;
:* the opinions of '''[[significant other]]s''' - the actor's idea of the expectations of special persons; ie, parents, children, spouse, friends.
:Erving Goffman wrote in the same tradition, making sense of human interaction using insights gained from the theories and methods of '''''dramaturgy'''''. For Goffman, two crucial concepts are those of the ''front region'' and ''back region'', which are the &quot;on-stage&quot; and &quot;off-stage&quot; personae which a person has -- those roles which are played for the benefit of others, and those played without others as much in mind.

For the purposes of this article, a ''relationship'' is any ''association'' between persons, amounting to ''mutual familiarity'', ''mutual awareness of one another's identities'', and ''meaningful understanding of their relations to one another''. In some literature, the word &quot;relationship&quot; is meant to be synonymous with &quot;romantic relationships&quot;, but this category will use the word in a variety of senses. There are a variety of sub-areas within this field of social psychology. The two primary area are interpersonal attraction and close relationship theories. 

:'''''[[Interpersonal attraction]]  

How do people become friends? Lovers? What makes an individual like one person, but not another? How could two people who live on the 3rd floor of a dorm and not be friends, but both are friends with the people who live by the mailboxes on the first floor? Studies on interpersonal attraction have explored both how people become friends and romantic partners. In general, the factors involved with interpersonal attraction are the same regardless of the type of relationship. In this section, we explore the various factors that impact interpersonal attraction.

:''''''''''[[Physical attractiveness]]'''''''''' (under construction)

:'''''''''''''''[[Evolutionary theory]]''''''''''''''' (Buss, 198X)

:'''''''''''''''[[Sociocultural theory]]'''''''''''''''

:'''''''''''''''[[Integrated theory]]''''''''''''''' (Eagly &amp; Wood, 1999; 2013; Wood &amp; Eagly, 2002; 2013) - 2013 dates may be inaccurate, should reflect articles in American Psychologist and Current Directions in Psychologcal Science

In the late 1990s, Eagly and Wood attempted to find common ground between the evolutionary and sociocultural extremes that had been argued throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. They argued that both perspectives admit some limitations, but both perspectives have been slow at accepting this new theoretical perspective - the biosocial theory. Despite the promise of this approach, this theoretical perspective is often often misinterpreted and labeled as sociocultural (see later Eagly and Wood papers mentioned above).  

:''''''''''Propinquity''''''''''  (under construction)

How could two people who live on the 3rd floor of a dorm and not be friends, but both are friends with the people who live by the mailboxes on the first floor? The concept of propinquity explains this phenomena. Specifically, people become attracted to others who are functionally closer to them. By functionally closer, it is meant that the situation forces two persons paths to cross regularly. Using the initial example, two people who live at opposite ends of the hall in a dorm may rarely, if ever, cross paths if they are able to use opposite staircases to leave the building. However, both may be friends with the people by the mailboxes because having to check the mail regularly forces each of the 3rd floor residents to regularly cross paths with the individuals living near the mailboxes. 

This form of attractiveness relies on the '''mere exposure effect'''(citation needed). Research on the mere exposure effect found that people who were regularly exposed to another individual, regardless of if they ever spoke, would find the the person they were exposed to as more attractive. The commonly cited study (citation need) found that students in an introductory psychology course rated a picture of a confederate as more attractive at the end of the semester if that semester sat in on the course for half of the course meetings, or even a quarter of the meetings, than those who never had any exposure to the confederate. This was the case despite the fact that the confederate never had any interaction with any of the students in the courses she sat in on. (this needs to be edited for detail accuracy, but the general study is properly described)

:''''''''''Similarity'''''''''' (under construction)

People with similar opinions, political or otherwise, tend to be more attracted to each other.

:'''''Maintaining Relationships'''''

:''''''''''Attachment Theory'''''''''' (under construction) (Bowlby, 195X; Ainsworth, 197X; adult - Shaver, 198X-200X; Mikulincear, 200X; Feeney, 199X-201X)

:''''''''''''''''Anxious Attachment''''''''''''''''

:'''''''''''''''Avoidant Attachment''''''''''''''''

:''''''''''Interdependence Theory'''''''''' (under construction)

:''''''''''''''''Investment Model of Commitment'''''''''''''''' (Rusbult et al., 1970s to 2014) 

One form of relationship is the romantic relationship. Studies into human dating and attraction investigate the way that norms, [[propinquity]], threat, familiarity, availability, similarity, [[attractiveness]], trust, and dependence have on creating friendly relationships. One theory in this field is the [[matching hypothesis]], which postulates that an actor will attempt to find a mate who matches their level of social desirability.

:'''''[[Power (sociology)|Power]]'''''. Power is the ability to cause an actor to behave or think in a way despite their internal desire to do otherwise. This subject involves an investigation into the nature and causes of [[authority]], which may involve investigation into the [[authoritarian personality]]. There are, in general, six techniques in the use and maintenance of power: the viable promise to provide ''rewards'', the ability to provide viable threats, [[referent power]], an appeal to roles within a social structure, the power of information, and a viable appeal to expertise.

:Power is also established by ''[[Dependency (sociology)|dependency]]'' of some actor(s) upon other(s) for the provision of their wants and/or needs.

:'''''[[Trust (sociology)]]'''''. Trust is the actor's belief in the competence and/or benevolence of another actor. In social cognition, it is important to understand how trust impacts how actors behave and think based on the behaviors and words of others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:soc-psy_mass_behavior.gif|center]]
In the theory of collective behavior, it is important to separate the ''organized'' action of a group from the ''diffuse, aggregated'' actions of individuals. Both are of interest to social psychologists, since they have to do with a mass of people. However, groups have common interactions and relationships within it, while the interactions and relationships within an aggregate are diffused.

For the purposes of social psychology at the wider level, there are two fundamental worries. First, what acts as the '''catalyst for emergence''' of groups and norms, and what maintains those social forms? Second, how do '''social perceptions''' occur, especially with respect to primary socialization?

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:soc-psy_aggregate.gif|thumb|70px|right|Aggregate action]]
:'''''[[Collective behavior]]''''' is any instance of a large collective (either group or aggregate) engaging in some action. Of special attention are the behaviors of ''[[Social movement]]s'' and ''[[Aggregate behavior]]s'', which shed some light into the fundamental questions of what causes, maintains, and structures a society. One sort of such behavior is [[herd behavior]]. [[J-curve theory]] predicts social revolutionary change to occur when an intolerable gap develops between people's ''expected satisfaction of needs'' and their ''actual satisfaction of needs''.

:'''''[[Self]] in social context ([[social structure]], [[population density]])'''''. Examines the influence of personal factors (personality, health, alienation, status, and values) on one's position in various kinds of group structures.

:'''''[[Dissent]], [[Deviance]] and reactions to deviance'''''. Examines the role of habitual mindsets and social functions on the existence of norms, as well as the impact of labeling and social controls on deviance. Deviance is always relative to norms, which are revealed via [[breaching experiment]]s.

:This field has aroused many explanations. [[Anomie theory]] considers some deviance to be a result of persons trying to achieve a cultural goal but lacking the appropriate resources or means to do so. [[Strain theory (sociology)]] explains deviance in terms of social strain. [[Differential association theory]] understands deviance to occur when the definitions and meanings that support deviant acts are learned. [[Control theory (sociology)]] explains deviant behavior as a product of being influenced by other persons. [[Labeling theory]] believes that the reaction that people have to rule violations can have a compelling effect on deviants, either in reinforcing or discouraging it. Finally, the [[routine activities perspective]] considers how deviance occurs out of the routines of everyday life.

== 1.  Explain the difference in food value between whole wheat flour and white flour. ==
Whole wheat retains the bran and germ as well as the endosperm, in contrast to white flour which retains only the endosperm. 

Whole wheat foods are nutritionally superior to refined grains, richer in dietary fiber, antioxidants, protein (and in particular the amino acid lysine), dietary minerals (including magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and selenium), and vitamins (including niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin E). 

The greater amount of dietary fiber, as much as four times than found in refined grains, is likely the most important benefit, as it has been shown to reduce the incidence of some forms of cancer, digestive system diseases, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Some of these protective effects occur because carbohydrates from whole grains are digested and enter the bloodstream more slowly, avoiding the &quot;sugar rush.&quot;

== 2. Describe the effects of yeast in bread making. ==
Yeast interacts chemically with sugar in warm water to provide leavening.  This allows the bread to &quot;rise&quot;.

In more detail, yeasts make up a group of single-celled fungi, a few species of which are commonly used to leaven bread.  In the absence of oxygen, yeasts produce their energy by converting sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol. In baking, the carbon dioxide raises the bread and the ethanol evaporates.

== 3.  Give one Old Testament and one New Testament incident where leavening is mentioned. ==

'''Old Testament:'''
[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2012:34-39;&amp;version=31; Exodus 12:34 &amp; 39] -- The Israelites prepared unleavened bread for the first Passover

'''New Testament:'''
Jesus mentioned leavening several times including:  [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:33&amp;version=31 Matthew 13:33]; 
[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2013:20-21;&amp;version=31; Luke 13:20, 21]

Jesus compares the Pharisees to leaven in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:6-12;&amp;version=31; Matthew 16:6-12]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208:15;&amp;version=31; Mark 8:15]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:1%20;&amp;version=31; Luke 12:1]

== 4.  Prepare whole grain bread (can be wheat, rye, oatmeal, etc.). ==

{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe
| name = Whole Wheat Bread (Vegan)
| ingredients =     
* 1 C warm water (105-115 degrees F)
* 2 T (or 2 packages) of active dry yeast
* 1 pinch unrefined sugar
* 1 C soy milk
* 1/3 C (packed) unrefined sugar
* 3 T vegan butter or margarine
* 1 T salt
* 1 1/2 C walnuts (optional)
* 1/4 C soft tofu (mashed), stir until chunks are minimal (egg replacer or 1 T ground flax seed also works)
* 2 1/2 C cups fine-milled or medium-milled whole wheat flour
* 3 7/8 C unbleached all-purpose white flour
| procedure = 
#In a small bowl stir up the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water, add a pinch of unrefined sugar. Let the yeast activate for 10 minutes.
#To a large mixing bowl add the other 1/2 cup water, milk, unrefined sugar, melted vegan margarine, salt, tofu, and whole wheat flour. Stir with wooden spoon until creamy.
#Add the yeast mixture which should be foamy by now. Add walnuts. Add in the unbleached wheat flour a little at a time. Stir until the dough is too thick for the spoon then put the dough on a lightly fluored cutting board or counter top and mix by hand. When all the flour is added, knead dough for around 5-7 minutes. Cover dough with a towel and let rise for around 1 to 1.5 hours. Dough should double in size.
#Knock the dough down once then place 2 equal portions of the dough into 2 greased pans. If you want the loaves to look fancy do this: roll dough into 4 separate dough &quot;snakes&quot;. Twist 2 of these together to make a nice looking intertwined loaf. Let rise about 45 minutes.
#Brush tops of loaves with melted margarine (keeps them from drying out) and dust with cinnamon, uncooked oatmeal or white flour (aesthetics). Bake in oven preheated to 375F for around 35 minutes. When done, loaves will sound hollow when tapped.

== 6.  Explain why the use of baking powder and soda should be avoided and why the mixture of milk, sugar, and eggs is harmful to health. ==

;Baking soda and baking powder: In ''The Ministry of Healing'', Ellen White wrote that baking  soda and baking powder should not be used for making bread.  She wrote, &quot;Soda causes inflammation of the stomach and often poisons the entire system.&quot;

;Milk, sugar, and eggs: When these ingredients are mixed and eaten, they ferment in the abdomen, giving the same effect as alcohol products.

== 7.  How do you test a cake for being done? How do you keep a cake from &quot;falling&quot;? ==

You can test to see if a cake is done by inserting a toothpick or butter knife carefully into the ''center'' of the cake.  If it comes out clean without any &quot;cake goo&quot; attached, then the cake is done.  

You can keep a cake from falling by not introducing a cake to temperatures drastically different from the oven too quickly and by not slamming the door on the oven before the cake is done.

== 8.  Prepare two of the following ==
===a. Cake from basic ingredients (any flavor)===
See the Wikibook [[Cookbook]] recipes for [[Cookbook:Dessert#Cakes, Cupcakes|Cakes and Cupcakes]].  Remember that you can use soymilk instead of cow's milk.  In cake recipes calling for eggs, you can substitute a half banana and a quarter cup of apple sauce.

===b. Cake from a mix (any flavor)===
The best advice we can give here is to buy a mix and follow the directions on the package.  Cake mixes were introduced to the market in the 1950s, though they were not initially well received.  At that time, the only thing the homemaker needed to do was add water, blend, pour it in a pan, and bake.  Marketeers determined that homemakers did not like this because it did not feel enough like &quot;homemade&quot; so they omitted powdered eggs from the mix and had the homemaker add fresh eggs along with the water.  As soon as this change was made to the formulation, sales skyrocketed.

It should be noted however, that it is perhaps impossible to find a cake mix that does not use either baking powder or baking soda, or the combination of eggs, milk, and sugar (see requirement 6).  However, 3 tablespoons of water plus 1 tablespoon of either cornstarch or ground flax seed makes a good egg-substitute.

===c. Fruit or nut cake or loaf cake===
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe
|name = Fruit Nut Cake
|ingredients=
* 4 ounces dark raisins
* 4 ounces mixed dried fruit (dates, cranberries, or raisins)
* 8 ounces lightly toasted and chopped nuts
* 1 cup orange juice
* 1 cup packed brown sugar or maple syrup
* 1⅔ cups water
* 4 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce

* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 tsps orange or lemon zest
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* oil to grease the pan
* Powdered sugar to dust
|procedure =
* Soak the dried fruit in orange juice in the refrigerator overnight.
* Transfer the fruit to a pot containing 1⅔ cups water
* Add sugar, applesauce, orange zest, and spices.
* Bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes, and turn off the heat
* Preheat oven to 350°F
* Add lemon juice and vanilla to the fruit mixture and allow it to cool to room temperature
* Grease a bundt pan
* Fold in the flour, baking soda, and nuts
* Spoon the batter into the bundt pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.  This can take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour.
* Cool for a few minutes, and then turn it out onto a cooling rack.
* Dust the cake with powdered sugar.

== 9.  Make one pie in each of the following categories ==
===a. Baked, any fruit, including lemon===
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe
|name = Berry Pie
|ingredients =
* Double crust
** 2 cups all-purpose flour
** 1/3 cup shortening
** 5-6 Tablespoons water
* Pie filling
** 5 cups blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, or a mix of them (fresh or frozen)
** 3/4 cup sugar
** 1/3 cup flour
** 1.5 Tablespoons lemon juice
|procedure = 
'''Double Crust'''
# Cut the shortening into the flour until it is reduced to pea-sized chunks
# Add a tablespoon of water to the center, and mix it in with a fork.  Move the dampened mix to the side and add another tablespoon of water.  Repeat until you have used 5-6 tablespoons of water.
# Divide the dough in half, and form into two equal-size balls.
# Lightly flour your work surface and roll one dough ball out into a 12&quot; circle.
# Pick up the dough by wrapping it around the rolling pin.  Transport it to a 9&quot; pie pan and lay it in, being careful to not stretch the dough.

'''Pie filling'''
# Mix the sugar, flour, and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl.
# Add the berries, and toss until they are coated.
# If the berries were frozen, allow them to sit for 15-30 minutes (but don't let them completely thaw).
# Pour the filling into the pie pan (previously lined with the bottom crust).  The filling will mound to an alarming height, but do not worry - it will compact as it bakes.
# Roll out the top crust until you have another 12&quot; circle.
# Pick up the top crust with the rolling pin and carefully lay it over the berry mound.

By definition, refrigerator cookies are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to become even stiffer. The dough is typically shaped into cylinders which are sliced into round cookies before baking. Refrigerator cookies are any type of cookie where the dough needs chilled before baking the cookies.

Examples of refrigerator cookies include:
*Gingerbread cookies
*Most &quot;cookie cutter&quot; cookies
*Some types of chocolate chip cookies.

:Yes, it definitly needs some more work. Please feel free hack out and change as much as you want. If you don't want to edit it don't worry, I'll get around to it at some point :) --[[User:H2g2bob|H2g2bob]] 00:48, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

== wrong powers == 
&lt;pre&gt;
Loops can be nested. The following code prints powers 2 through 4 of the integers from 1 to 10
 do i=1,10
    do ipower=1,3
       print*,i,ipower,i**ipower
    end do
 end do
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't you mean powers 1 through 3?

== missing logical statement ==

there's a .NE. (not equal), I would put it in myself, but don't remember off-hand what the symbolic representation is (might be /=).

== Good code practice ==

This is part of the article:

Arguments to the do loop don't have to be numbers, they can be any integer that is defined elsewhere in the program. ''start, end,'' and ''increment'' can be any variable name.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 do i=start,end,increment
     ''code goes here''
 end do
&lt;/source&gt;

I don't know whether this will even compile or not, but using ''end'' as a variable name is not the greatest idea. Consider changing this in the article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Style==

Older versions of Fortran had strict guidelines on how a program was formatted. Fortran 90 lifted this restriction and would accept ''free format'' code as well as historical ''fixed format'' code.

=== Fixed Format ===

Prior to Fortran 90, Fortran code followed a well-defined ''fixed format''. Comments are indicated with a 'C' in the first column, columns 2-5 were reserved for an optional numerical statement label, a non-blank character in column 6 indicated the current line was a continuation from the previous one, and columns 7 through 72 were available for program statements. Columns 73 through 80 were ignored and often contained line sequence numbers. Blank lines were not allowed. This rigid formatting was the result of Fortran being developed in the era of batch computing and punched card input. The sequence number was used in the case a program 'deck' was dropped; program order could be recovered if the punch cards were placed in a card reader and sorted on columns 73-80. Compiler vendors offered extensions to this formatting, but it was rarely portable (for example, interpreting tab characters as 6 spaces.)

Note that while column position was significant, white space was not. The following program illustrates legal use of white space in fixed-format Fortran:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
      PROGRAM Z
C2345678901234567890
      GOTO11
   11 CONTINUE
      GO TO 780
 780  CONTINUE
      G OTO3 60
 360  CONTINUE
      STOP
      END
&lt;/source&gt;

While this code is technically legal, it is strongly encouraged to use white space to separate keywords, labels, and data to maintain readability

Fortran was developed before the standardization of the ASCII character set and traditionally Fortran code has been written in all-caps. Variable names were limited to six characters, but this was often extended by compiler vendors.

=== Free Format ===

Originally Fortran required all statements to be in ALL CAPS, and in fact the language itself was called FORTRAN (in caps). It remains a bit customary, though completely unnecessary, to put Fortran commands in ALL CAPS.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 PROGRAM test
 IMPLICIT NONE
 INTEGER four
 four = 4
 WRITE (*,*) four
 END PROGRAM
&lt;/source&gt;

Whitespace and empty lines usually won't matter in F90 or above, but in rare cases errors will pop up. However, unlike many other languages such as C, C++, and Java, the line delimiter ';' is optional, so each line of code may stay on its own line! Note that the use of the command separator character ';' is strongly discouraged.

==Structure==

*There is a GOTO command, but don't use it too much.
*Use DO loops early and often. 
*Encapsulate your code into functions and subroutines making it easier to program at higher levels, and allowing others to understand whats going on. 
*Comment your code well. Don't comment every line, but explain how everything works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Existence of God

In this world, many beliefs exist about God. As a result, people understand God in their own way and often in their own imagination. But what is required is the understanding God as He is, what He is and how He is. The correct understanding about God has to be given by God Himself!

There are some who don't believe in the existence of God, often the reason being His existence cannot be proved like that of human beings. But because we cannot see God with the gross eyes, it doesn't mean that God doesn't exist. Just like wind, which cannot be seen but can be very much felt, it is possible to experience God's presence through Godly knowledge and meditation.

Who is God and what is His form and name? 
We shall now try to understand who God or the Supreme Soul is. The term 'Supreme Soul' means He is supreme among all souls. It implies that, He is also 'a soul', though He is the Highest of all. He is above birth and death. God is the Supreme Father-Mother, Supreme teacher and Supreme Preceptor to all the human beings and He himself has no father-mother, teacher and preceptor. 

God is a subtle, infinitesimal point of Light. He is not visible to the naked eye but it is very much possible to experience His presence and proximity in meditation. He is incorporeal in the sense that he does not have a body of his own. He is not a human being nor does He have a human form. He is immune to pleasure and pain unlike human beings.

Names are a means of identification of human beings after they are born. They do not speak of qualities and actions of the person; they are simply proper nouns and are not attributive names. But the name of the supreme soul or God is based on His qualities and actions. His self-revealed name is 'Shiva'. 'Shiva' means doer of good or benefactor. God does good to all and therefore He is called Shiva. All souls ask for salvation and beatitude i.e. peace and happiness from Him. People remember Him by many other expressive names.

His Virtues
God is the Supreme Father of all. He is called the creator. He is oceanic in his virtues - the ocean of peace, the ocean of love, the ocean of bliss, the ocean of knowledge, the ocean of happiness, the ocean of mercy, etc. He is the truth. He is the Almighty and Authority. He is reputed to be the preserver or sustainer of virtues and the destroyer of all evils. He is also the liberator, the guide, and the bestower of salvation, therefore the sadguru. He dispels sorrow, bestows joy. God is perfect in all ways and absolutely detached and loving. He is very benevolent and helpful and so souls ask all things of him. When in sorrow and losing all hope, souls turn to him intuitively and inevitably. 

Many are the religions and paths that souls take in their quest for reaching God. Many wars have been waged in his name. However, he does not exclusively belong to anyone. He belongs to everyone equally.

The Supreme Father of all Souls
God is the father of all souls in this world. It is observed that all religions have images, idols or memorials bearing one name or another to represent the form of Light that God is. All over India, the images of the form that Shiva has is found installed; these images are without any human form, in the form of linga, which is the symbol of an incorporeal Being. At Mecca, in the holy place of Kaaba, a stone image with oval form is called &quot;Sang-e-Aswad&quot;. The devotes who go for Haj kiss this holy stone. Jesus Christ said, &quot;God is Light&quot;. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism also sang the praise of Him who is 'All-Light' ( ek Omkar) and is incorporeal. In olden days, the Jews held a stone of this shape in their hands while taking a solemn oath and it is believed that Moses had vision of this form of God when he saw a flame behind the bush. The Zoroastrians worship God as fire. The ancient Egyptians worshipped the sun as god. A Buddhist sect in Japan focuses the mind on a small oval shape. They call it Karni, the peace giver. 

It seems therefore that human beings, without realizing, have all been worshipping and trying to discover the same God. There is only one God and His form is a point of light. He is called by different names in different religions. 

The Divine Abode of God
Where does God live? Is there somewhere one can go to see Him, to be with Him? God is a subtle point of light, and He does not pervade the physical universe. Nor does he live in the heart of any human being or in any matter. Neither is He omnipresent; nor is He having a human form. His home is the incorporeal world, an infinite expanse of golden-red light, which is beyond this physical world we live. It is the original abode of all souls as well. The incorporeal world is known as Paramdham or Brahmlok. Knowing where the Supreme Father is, we can establish connection with Him through thoughts during meditation.

The Divine Descent of God
God descends into this world when it is under the spell of extreme darkness of ignorance, unrighteousness, moral turpitude, spiritual lassitude and religious decrepitude. This is described in scriptures as &quot;Dharma Glani&quot;. Looking at the state of affairs today, it should not be difficult for us to conclude that the time the world is undergoing at present is indeed the Dharma Glani. This is the period of darkness when sins and crimes of all kinds usually take place; when man gropes around for want of clear vision. It is at this time that God intervenes in the affairs of mankind. The divine intervention takes place at the darkest hour of human history when the human soul is groping in the darkness of ignorance about the self, the creator and the creation; when the souls are blinded by the vices of lust, arrogance, anger, greed and attachment. 

It is in this time that God descends in the body of an ordinary man to reveal the Godly Knowledge, which paves way to victory over vices and cultivate divine qualities in life. This enables human beings to transform into divine beings again.</text>

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Informal Conventions =

Our predicate language, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, like &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is fairly ugly and difficult to read.  The superscripts and subscripts are distracting, and we have multiplied parentheses well beyond necessity.  As with sentential logic, will informally use a less cumbersome variant.  The official language, however, is still used for definitions formalities and other formalities.  Most of the rules for generating informal variants of will be familiar from sentential logic.

== Transformation rules ==

We create informal variants of official &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; formulae as follows.  The examples are cumulative.

* We drop a subscript if it is '0'.  Thus we write &lt;math&gt;a^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;a^2_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and write &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  We cannot drop the subscript from &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^0_1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

* The official grammar requires operation letters and predicate letters to have the superscript indicating the number of places.  For example, &lt;math&gt;a^2_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a two-place operation letter and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a three place predicate letter.  In most cases, we can drop the superscript and let the context show the number of places.  For example, we can write

:: &lt;math&gt;a(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Here we observe from the context that the operation letter has two places, thus leaving it understood that &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an informal variant of &lt;math&gt;a^2_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, we observe from the context that the predicate letter in

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x, y, z)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: has three places.  This makes &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, as used in this context, an informal variant of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This convention assumes our &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to be grammatically correct.  In general, we will not be trafficking in grammatically incorrect expressions.  We will also try to avoid, for example, using &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^1_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^3_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in close proximity.  Otherwise, their informal variant could cause confusion.

* We will omit outermost parentheses.  For example, we will write

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: instead of

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(y_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* We will let a series of the same binary connective associate on the right.  For example, we can transform the official

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land (\mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{H^1_0}(x_0)))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: into the informal

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x) \land \mathrm{H}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: However, the best we can do with 

:: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \land \mathrm{H^1_0}(x_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:is

::&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)) \land \mathrm{H}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* We will use precedence rankings to omit internal parentheses when possible.  For example, we will regard &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as having lower precedence (wider scope) than &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This allows us to write

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \mathrm{H}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: instead of

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow (\mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0) \lor \mathrm{H^1_0}(x_0)))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: However, we cannot remove the internal perentheses from

:: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \lor \mathrm{H^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Our informal variant of this latter formula is 

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)) \lor \mathrm{H}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Precedence and scope ==

Precedence rankings indicate the order that we evaluate the sentential connectives and quantifier phrases.  &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has a higher precedence than &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, in evaluating

: &lt;math&gt;(1) \quad \mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \mathrm{H}(x)\ ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we start by evaluating

: &lt;math&gt;(2) \quad \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \mathrm{H}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

first.  Scope is the length of expression that is governed by the connective.  The occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1) has a wider scope than the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1) governs the whole sentence while the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1) governs only the occurrence of (2) in (1).

The full ranking from highest precedence (narrowest scope) to lowest precedence (widest scope) is:

{| cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lnot,\ \forall x,\ \exists x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || highest precedence (narrowest scope)
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\land\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || lowest precedence (widest scope)
|}

Quantifier phrases have the same precedence as negation signs.

== Examples ==

The following examples are predicate logic variants of the examples at the sentential logic [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Informal Conventions|Informal Conventions]] page.  First,

: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \leftrightarrow ((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \lor ((\lnot \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be written informally as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Second,

: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \leftrightarrow ((\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \lnot \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be written informally as

: (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x) \lor \lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \lnot \mathrm{G}(x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Some unnecessary parentheses may prove helpful. In the two examples above, the informal variants may be easier to read as

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)) \leftrightarrow (\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{F}(x) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)) \leftrightarrow (\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \land \lnot \mathrm{G}(x))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Note that the informal formulae

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists x \mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are restored to its official form as

: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\forall x_0 \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\exists x_0 \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \land \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

By contrast, the informal formula

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (\mathrm{F}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{G}(x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists x (\mathrm{F}(x) \land \mathrm{G}(x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is restored to its official form as

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Cuba LomaCunagua Ecotourism.jpg|right|400px| Cuba, Loma de Cunagua Nature Reserve.]]

In industrial countries, mass tourism and recreation are now fast overtaking the extractive industries as the largest threat to indigenous communities, and 'pristine' environments.  These are destinations that tourists now want to visit. Attractive landscape sites, such as sandy beaches, lakes, riversides, and mountaintops and slopes, are often transitional zones, characterized by species-rich ecosystems. Typical physical impacts include the degradation of such ecosystems. The ecosystems most threatened with degradation are ecologically fragile areas such as alpine regions, rain forests, wetlands, mangroves, coral reefs and sea grass beds. The threats to, and pressures on, these ecosystems are often severe because such places are very attractive to both tourists and developers. Since 1945, visits to the 10 most popular mountainous national parks in the United States have increased twelvefold. In the European Alps, tourism now exceeds 100 million visitor-days. Every year in the Indian Himalaya, more than 250,000 Hindu pilgrims, 25,000 trekkers, and 75 mountaineering expeditions climb to the sacred source of the Ganges River, the Gangotri Glacier. They deplete local forests for firewood, trample riparian vegetation, and strew litter. Even worse, this tourism frequently induces poorly planned, land-intensive development. 

Negative impacts from tourism occur when the level of visitor use is greater than the environment's ability to cope with this use within the acceptable limits of change. Uncontrolled conventional tourism poses potential threats to many natural areas around the world. It can put enormous pressure on an area and lead to impacts such as soil erosion, increased pollution, discharges into the sea, natural habitat loss, increased pressure on endangered species and heightened vulnerability to forest fires. It often forces local populations to compete for the use of other critical resources. Tourism development can put pressure on natural resources when it increases consumption in areas where resources are already scarce. Water, and especially fresh water, is one of the most critical natural resources. Tourism can also create great pressure on other local resources like energy, food, and other raw materials that may already be in short supply. Greater extraction and transport of these resources exacerbates the physical impacts associated with their exploitation. Because of the seasonal character of the industry, many destinations have ten times more inhabitants in the high season as in the low season. A high demand is placed upon these resources to meet the high expectations tourists often have (proper heating, hot water, etc.).  Important land resources include minerals, fossil fuels, fertile soil, forests, wetland and wildlife. Increased construction of facilites for tourism and recreational has increased the pressure on these resources and on scenic landscapes. Direct impact on natural resources, both renewable and non-renewable, in the provision of tourist facilities can be caused by the use of land for accommodation and other infrastructure provision, and the use of building materials.

Tourism can cause the same forms of pollution as any other industry: air emissions, noise, solid waste and littering, releases of sewage, oil and chemicals, even architectural/visual pollution. Transport by air, road, and rail is continuously increasing in response to the rising number of tourists and their greater mobility. To give an indication, the number of international air passengers worldwide rose from 88 million in 1972 to 344 million in 1994. One consequence of this continuing increase in air transport is that tourism now accounts for more than 60% of air travel and is therefore responsible for an important share of air emissions. One study estimated that a single transatlantic return flight emits almost half the CO2 emissions produced by all other sources (lighting, heating, car use, etc.) consumed by an average person yearly.  Transport emissions and emissions from energy production and use are linked to acid rain, global warming and photochemical pollution. Air pollution from tourist transportation has impacts on the global level, especially from carbon dioxide emissions related to transportation energy use. And it can contribute to severe local air pollution. Some of these impacts are quite specific to tourist activities. For example, especially in very hot or cold countries, tour buses often leave their motors running for hours while the tourists go out for an excursion because they want to return to a comfortably air-conditioned bus. 

In areas with high concentrations of tourist activities and appealing natural attractions, waste disposal is a serious problem and improper disposal can be a major despoiler of the natural environment - rivers, scenic areas, and roadsides. For example, cruise ships in the Caribbean are estimated to produce more than 70,000 tons of waste each year. Today some cruise lines are actively working to reduce waste-related impacts. Solid waste and littering can degrade the physical appearance of the water and shoreline and cause the death of marine animals. 

Construction of hotels, recreation and other facilities often leads to increased sewage pollution. Wastewater has polluted seas and lakes surrounding tourist attractions, damaging the flora and fauna. Sewage runoff causes serious damage to coral reefs because it stimulates the growth of algae, which cover the filter-feeding corals, hindering their ability to survive. Changes in salinity and siltation can have wide-ranging impacts on coastal environments. And sewage pollution can threaten the health of humans and animals.

Often tourism fails to integrate its structures with the natural features and indigenous architectural of the destination. Large, dominating resorts of disparate design can look out of place in any natural environment and may clash with the indigenous structural design. A lack of land-use planning and building regulations in many destinations has facilitated sprawling developments along coastlines, valleys and scenic routes. The sprawl includes tourism facilities themselves and supporting infrastructure such as roads, employee housing, parking, service areas, and waste disposal.

Tourists using the same off road trail over and over again trample the vegetation and soil, eventually causing damage that can lead to loss of biodiversity. Such damage can be even more extensive when visitors frequently stray off established trails. Wildlife viewing can bring about stress for the animals and alter their natural behavior when tourists come too close. Safaris and wildlife watching activities have a degrading effect on habitat as they often are accompanied by the noise and commotion created by tourists as they chase wild animals in their trucks and aircraft. This puts high pressure on animal habits and behaviors and tends to bring about behavioral changes. In some cases, as in Kenya, it has led to animals becoming so disturbed that at times they neglect their young or fail to mate. 

After decades of sustained growth in volume and visibility, tourism is now one of the leading global industries (11% of global GDP) and one of the major migratory movements in modern society (about 700 million international travelers in 2001), producing significant impacts on resource consumption, pollution, and social systems. It can be compared in its deleterious impacts and environmental risks to any other major industry. On the other hand, tourism is a unique tool for awareness building and learning for guests and hosts alike. Sound natural and cultural environments are its basic assets, while peace is one of its basic requirements.

Fortunately there is an encouraging 'greening' of mainstream tourism.   Greater sustainability in the industry as a whole will have the largest impact on overall wildlife protection, and on communities and individuals. But 'nature-based tourism' will play a crucial role in the communities and natural environments under the greatest pressure from the development of tourism. 

Nature Tourism, often referred to as Ecotourism, was introduced to the tourist industry in the early 1980s. Nature tourism attracts tourists with an interest in temporarily living in, and coming to better understand a specific, novel, relatively natural ecosystem. Its primary focus is on experiencing natural areas that fosters environmental and cultural understanding, appreciation and conservation. Nature tourism was initially connected with outdoor travel to remote, unique, and/or scenic areas. Although in its early stages there was a strong educational aspect, this was not a crucial or required element to the industry or the consumer. However, as the demand has increased, the inclusion of ecology as an integral educational element has become increasingly important.  This is why nature tourism is an important topic in applied ecology.

Since its conception, nature tourism has grown to include an entire methodology of planning, conservation management, and economics. It is becoming a robust and encompassing process that not only includes site information, but also considers the sustainability of the ecosystem, conservation management, education, equitable social benefits, and community responsibility. Nature Tourism now includes several major principles:

* Education about the area 
* Sustainable use of resources, and avoidance of degradation 
* Enhancement of local community and assistance in development 
* Respect for cultural/social/political aspects of local people 
* Profit from the tourism industry providing a boost to the local economy 

Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife. Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem. An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about organgatuangs in Borneo.  The returns to an individual from the experience have been described as potentially life-changing or at least memorable, and the development of new skills and knowledge.  Since the mid-1990's nature tourism has emerged as a human activity distinct from adventure travel.  Packages tend to be marketed as a more politically correct, environmentally and culturally aware&quot; form of tourism, e.g., responsible travel to natural areas that conserve the environment and improve the well-being of local people.  In this sense nature tourism is being increasingly recognized as a tool for sustainable development. Achieving this aim is a challenge, because high standards have to be met. But when it is achieved, communities and natural environments are the immediate beneficiaries. 

However, despite their &quot;green image&quot;, few nature tourism packages contribute a positive benefit to the global environment.  A major contradiction comes from considering the environmental impact of the energy consumed in transportation to the exotic location. One study estimated that a single transatlantic return flight emits almost half the CO2 emissions produced by all other sources (lighting, heating, car use, etc.) consumed by an average person yearly.  Arrival also introduces its own set of problems. As in any tourist activity, adverse impacts are ever present, such as cultural erosion and atmospheric pollution, and the drain on local natural resources to provide Western living standards as enclaves in Third World countries.  Problems of sustainability are also evident in the developed countries.  For example in winter 2000, 76,271 people entered Yellowstone National Park on snowmobiles, outnumbering the 40,727 visitors who came in cars, 10,779 in snowcoaches and 512 on skis. A survey of snowmobile impacts on natural sounds at Yellowstone found that snowmobile noise could be heard 70% of the time at 11 of 13 sample sites, and 90% of the time at 8 sites. At the Old Faithful geyser, snowmobiles could be heard 100% of the time during the daytime period studied. Snowmobile noise drowned out even the sound of the geyser erupting. In Yosemite National Park, the number of roads and facilities have been increased to keep pace with the growing visitor numbers and to supply amenities, infrastructure and parking lots for tourists. These actions have caused habitat loss in the park and are accompanied by various forms of pollution including air pollution from automobile emissions; the Sierra Club has reported &quot;smog so thick that Yosemite Valley could not be seen from airplanes&quot;. This occasional smog is harmful to all species and vegetation inside the Park. Such issues are being addressed by planning and managing destinations, setting up institutional partnerships and the continued development of environmentally friendly technology. 

The concept of ecotourism has come into common use in the last decade.  It describes a goal towards which tourism entrepreneurs, government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities have been aiming at for much longer. A definition put forward by The Ecotourism Society in 1991 describes it as 'responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and sustains the well-being of local people.' Professionals working within the field of ecotourism generally agree that 'ecotourism' stands out within the area of nature tourism by: 

*Travel to a natural area. 
*Travel that supports the conservation of biodiversity. 
*Travel that brings benefits to local host communities. 
*Travel that leads to greater understanding of the natural or cultural environment visited. 

Including these four components in a travel package significantly restricts the number of tourism products that can genuinely be labelled ecotourism. To some people, ecotourism is regarded as one niche market within the larger, and rapidly expanding market of nature tourism. Here it has been estimated that nature-based tourism now comprises 20 per cent of the world travel market, and ecotourism 7 per cent. A package labelled ecotourism has some inbuilt constraints; the main one being that participants are responsible and benefit conservation efforts and local communities, and the visitor has participated in some learning experience. One example might be camping at a national park, paying an entry fee, following park rules of conduct, buying supplies at a gateway community outside the park, and participating in a natural history lesson. However, these kinds of constraints are what all kinds of nature tourism are aiming for.  In this respect, it is perhaps better to retain the term nature tourism as an umbrella for all packages that involve the softer interaction of people with habitats and species as a primary objective of the holiday.  

Nature tourism requires interactions and partnerships with conservation NGOs, government tourism and resource management agencies, community groups and the private sector.  Above all it requires the management of the many impacts of massed humans introduced into species rich ecosystems.  Even better would be the integration of nature tourism into international strategies for sustainable development.  In this context, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has been appointed by the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) as the Interagency Coordinator or lead agency responsible for implementation of Agenda 21 issues on tourism. Together with the World Tourism Organization (WTO/OMT), UNEP is the main focal point on sustainable tourism for CSD and the Convention on Biological Diversity for devising global strategies for tourism can contribute to environmental conservation

Computer Engineering) materials.  Neither Software Engineering nor Computer Engineering are even acknowledged as legitimate engineering disclipines by either classification system.  Oh, you can get to them, and they do have classification codes, but it is very obscure.  Computer Science is considered a sub-disclipline of Mathmatics for the LOC classification and is a sub-disclipline of &quot;General knowledge&quot; for the Dewey Decimal system... right next to Encyclopedias in fact.

I think ontology should concern itself more with groups of things
as they actually exist and need to be dealt with, and less with
assorted numbering and classification systems. When I look at that
dmoz.org space, the first thing i think of is the same thing i always
think when i see that kind of list, (similar ones which are used by google and yahoo and msn, etc.) Its obviously a list generated by
a person who wanted large umbrellas and no political fallout. The list is cognicentrically biased to put religion, for instance, as
a subheading under &quot;society.&quot; And so forth. This isn't a reasonable
organization schema, and i doubt that the people who generated it
were even slightly interested in ontology as much as they were in
just making the list quickly and getting it done with.
A realistic list of that many topics should be significantly longer,
and ordered with many more subdetails. Sociology and Religion are not
meant to be squeezed together into one category, just as many of
those categories are hard squeezes. I hate the dewey decimal system.
It was generated so long ago that its usefulness is entirely archaic.
If we are going to number things, lets at least make 30 slots instead
of ten, so that we spread things out a little more realistically.
Think of it this way; we want people to be able to make simple and
predictable causitive leaps of understanding, to guess easilly which
topic heading is the one the subtopic they are looking for is under.
This is a user interface issue, even more than an ontological one, and the problem with these systems is that they aren't user friendly,
they are librarian friendly and sysop friendly respectively.

In addition to the current disorganized state of Wikibooks content, we also could look at the [http://www.dmoz.org/ Open Directory Project], where quite a bit of thought has gone into ontological organization of more modern content.  Their purpose is to catalog web pages, and they do have some more unique pressures such as trying to deal with commercial content that is not so much of a big deal here on Wikibooks either.  The number of weblinks for that project is larger than the number of Wikipedia articles, although I think Wikipedia is catching up (hardly a fair comparison, however, and the ODP has been running quite a bit longer).  I think this is a good example, however, of what a mature group of links with typical internet users is going to look like, especially for the top categories.

Still, I think your approach is going to be better than what we currently are doing.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
It is an approach that with your help could get a lot better. Its a very simple ontological approach. Make the categories that simply do
exist, put them in some kind of order relative to each other, and then make subcategories as the need arises.

The main point i'd like to make is that the list was generated by simply viewing the content you have on the main page allready, and
generating categories that umbrella that content. All of these systems put the cart before the horse. The first question here is
&quot;How easilly can a user judge where to look for or insert content?&quot;
The currrent page is a mess at least in part because those divisions
are too vague and thus unclear.
Don't go looking around the net or at other systems. Look at your content and organize it.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

=== A request for input ===

Since you are interested in ontological issues as well, I would like to get your opinion on how I've tried to work with the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{catalog|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template that is going to be a tool to help us out with the classification of the various Wikibooks.  The idea here is that we will not be having to update each page whenever a new Wikibooks is added, but instead take advantage of the catagory system (significantly underused here on Wikibooks) to help with the classification work instead.  This template is intended to be added to the &quot;main page&quot; of the Wikibook, perhaps the title page.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
I think that the pages i have spotted with categories lists are a good feature, but that their actual use shows you that they aren't
very user friendly, at least not yet. A meta is needed to organize
assorted subcategories, and while it is nice to have a list with alphabetical order, the list most people will use is the one in ontological order. Rather than having a large tree of main categories and subcategories on different pages, what you need is
a category/ sub category on a single page, linked to from the main
page. Keep the old pages, and update them, but realize that most
people won't use them, its too much like a labyrinth.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

For an example of how this might be used, see [[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] (a Wikibook where I'm a principle author) to see how an individual Wikibook might be classified.  Discussion about this was done on the [[WB:CCO]] talk page, but I've tried to put it into actual practice, which revealed a few flaws in its execution.  I need to work a little bit more on the template as well, to make some parts &quot;optional&quot; for inclusion, but this is a good place to start.  I'd like to eventually put one of these templates on every Wikibook, and perhaps even expand the practice to include some of the content on Wikisource or even Gutenberg.org.  That is more ambitious, but the Wikibooks content is certainly a higher priority.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
I think a wikibook on reference materials is a great idea. Lets
get to that after we solve our own problems.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)


  This is also to help &quot;arrange&quot; books to be &quot;close&quot; to related books, and using classification schemes that many people are already familiar with (notably the LOC and Dewey classification codes).  More can easily be added to this template, and we need to work on what constitutes a &quot;related work&quot; as well.  
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
A &quot;related&quot; work covers similar ontological turf. say, 20 axioms worth. 
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
In addition to all of this, I would like some input on [[Wikibooks:LOC Classification]].  I've been trying to add the search heirarchy for the Library of Congress catalog onto Wikibooks, and create a bunch of categories that can be used with the catalog template mentioned above.  Dispite all of the problems with this classification system, it is one that is commonly used and familar to people from outside of Wikibooks. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:51, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
I think having multiple classifications systems in use is a great way
to go. People who are deweyists ought to be able to link to the dewey
meta, at their leisure. However, the Dewey system is an archaic system, and doesn't serve your primary needs. What you need in the primary list, and on the main page, is an ontological list which simply takes the obvious categories and then derivates the obvious subcategories, not of fictional, hypothetical, or paradigmal content,
but of the content that you have.
(or, the content you would like to have.)

Another main point here is that if you do a good job on the front end, nobody will be pestering you for where to put their book, it will be self evident. That is the thing we should shoot for, a system
in which the location of specific content is self evident, within
a single page +1 click.

Lastly, there are obvious holes in content on Wikibooks, and this is
how I think that should be handled. For each of the Categories, (listed say in bold and red,) 4 or 5 examples of assumed content could be listed to fill out that line (in black italics, for instance.) Actual book entries would then go
on the lines underneath. (in link purple/blue) In this way you can generate a very lucid map of content.

== Some personal thoughts and replies ==

First off, from reading your main user page, you say you were raised LDS and born in Provo?  Do you still consider yourself to be LDS?
-----------
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 22:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC) well, yes and no, mostly no. I'm Eclectic, with a heavy emphasis
on integrating &gt;everything&lt;. In as much as I have done that and come
full circle, I think its an honest point to make that the Essenes, if
compared to modern Christian movements, would most closely resemble Mormonism. Since that is a Scholarly observation, I don't know if
it qualifies. If the Church could fullfill its mission and use modern
Scholarship to fully re-instate Essene Theology, I might come back on
board. As it is, they put Beef in their vegetable soup despite the book of mormons admonishment to eat meat only in times of winter or
famine. This compares favorably with the fact that the Essenes were
vegetarian. As an example, it illustrates both the fact that Smith
was on to something, and the fact that the Modern Church lost sight of exactly what that was.
------------

I currently live in Logan, Utah and am currently the Ward Webmaster (strange calling at that).  I was also born in Provo, but I moved around a bit as well, including about 4 years (about 30 years ago) in Santa Barbara, or more exact I lived in Carpenteria but my dad attended Brooks Institute and graduated with a B.S. in Photography from that school.  I loved the Botanical Gardens and the Santa Barbara Mission, and loved to go and play in the ocean as well in Santa Barbara.  I didn't know how good it was at the time, and would move back if I ever had a chance or a reasonable professional opprotunity.  It was a far better experience than where my parents moved from Santa Barbara, which was Inglewood, CA.  Talk about a change of environment.
---------
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 22:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC) interesting coincidences. If that was inglewood colorado, it
would be even more. Myself, I have moved sufficiently past mormonism
that i wouldn't be able to survive emotionally in Utah. This area is
paradise, but i see myself moving North to find that demographic of even more &quot;liberal&quot; folks. 
------------
On to Wikibooks business....

Go ahead and simply start the Wikibook project as you are suggesting.
------------
yeah! kewl!
------------

  Something that I think you might want to check out first is this Wikibook:

[[Colonising Mars]]

They have a mailing list that I am also involved with that has touched some very interesting points, including many of the space colonization issues that you have brought up.  I hope this gives you some framework to consider, or something to compare and contrast with what ideas that you have.  This book, Colonising Mars, is currently on the Miscellaneous bookshelf, but that may be misplaced or certainly could be part of a much larger collection of books on that topic.  You may want to dig up the archives of the mailing list as well for some other ideas to include as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:50, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
----------
I will look that up. As a side note, I had envisioned linking to as many other wikibooks as were relevant, and to as many wikipedia articles as possible.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 22:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 00:33, 17 March 2006 (UTC)huh. You'd think they would have like an RSF or some such thing
set up to link a new wiki to its parent networks like that.
I have asked at the bot request wikipedia zone. Is there somebody else or someplace else to go look?

==Brain dump of material for the &quot;thinkstarship&quot; project==

Here's a short brain-dump of items that may be useful for your &quot;thinkstarship&quot; project. 
---------------------
wow! Thank You!
------------------


I don't have a WikiBooks account, and don't plan to get one in the near future. If you need to contact me, it's best to do so on my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Christopher_Thomas user talk page] at Wikipedia.


* You're going to need a lot of delta-v to colonize the outer solar system, or to colonize anywhere quickly.
------------
True, and excellent point. This observation organizes as a point
over to the &quot;Map&quot; page, and the Physics page.

ThinkStarship has several main key points here allready covered.
We propose to use a combination of many different tools available
to us, and are trying to do it in an ecologically and economically
sound way also. Due to economics, I think most of the plans on the
table currrently would be moderate thrust systems. I'm not looking
to win races as much as get there safely in a reasonable amount of time.
That in mind, I'm proposing to use Air augmented rockets till out of
atmosphere, chemical rockets to orbit, nuclear powered rockets to
break orbit, space ramrockets for primary acceleration and deceleration,
and a very studious use of the interplanetary transit network.

---------------




* You're going to need at least moderate thrust to colonize anywhere quickly.
------------------
Nuclear powered rockets are the strongest thrust we have. There are a lot of people who have issues with their use, and this is why 
I have been very careful to insure that they would never fire while
in range of our ecosystem. Magnetic space breathing microwave ignition
ramrockets will give a pretty low delta V, but provide a lot of thrust
over a long and steady period as compared to the Nuclear powered rockets.
---------------------



* Combining these gives a fairly arbitrary requirement of a delta-v of 100-300 km/sec and an acceleration of at least 0.01 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This will let you get just about anywhere in a year or less (Neptune or Pluto in about 2 years).
* Relaxing this window to 10-20 years gives you a delta-v of 10-30 km/sec and a thrust of 0.001 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and allows gravity assists. Simpler engines, but much, much more complicated environment systems, so probably a no-go.
--------------------
One primary operational axiom here for me is that we are going for
the closest targets first and colonizing in a slow motion wave
using the planetary gravity assists. Colonizing the entire Solar System in the next 50 years sounds preposterous to some people, until you
realize we could do that t minus 15 years to first launch date, and then
a slow drift actually into the solar system for the next 35 years.
If some enterprising entreprenuers want to plant their flag on some
rock before ThinkStarShip gets there, it won't be that hard cuz most of
what we will have done will be pretty public record. ThinkStarship isn't
trying to get to Mars in under 3 Years, Jupiter probably about 5 or maybe even 10, because the rings are going to be a big project. Saturn another 5 after that, things start to speed up as the designs start calling for larger and more expensive engines. But by then we are using
the asteroid mining endeavor for spare mass, so building monstrous sized
things isn't a big deal to us.
--------------



* Drive options that we know how to build at present are iffy for these constraints:
**A pebble-bed fission reactor that you run hydrogen through as reaction mass gives you a high-thrust drive with an exhaust velocity in the range of 4-5 km/sec when run as hot as you possibly can. This and a 90% fuel fraction give you a delta-v of around 10 km/sec with a single-stage fully reusable craft. Thrust is relatively high (potentially enough for soft-landings on the moon or even Mars, if most of the rest of the mass is engine). Drawback: delta-v is bad.
**A fission-electric engine has as much delta-v as you want it to, but is very low-thrust, due to the power to weight ratio of the reactor. Pulling numbers straight out of my tail gives a thrust of 0.0001 N/kg for 100 km/sec delta-v. You can probably reach ten times this, but a hundred times this will be very difficult. Delta-v and thrust are inversely proportional for this kind of drive.
**I get about 0.001 N/kg for 100 km/sec delta-v with solar-electric in Earth's orbit. This number is on a bit firmer ground than the fission-electric one. Farther out, it's far less useful. It's marginal for a Mars trip, and to do that at all you'd have to reduce delta-v.
* The &quot;electric&quot; end of an electric drive would probably be a Hall-effect thruster, as that avoids electrode erosion problems, and is high enough thrust that it's used for stationkeping for satellites, and is well-understood.
-------------------
Thats good information for our physics and Propulsion page.
I'm not sure that i could go for any thrust device with a nuclear
radioactive thrust. Nuclear power for a magnetic system seems like a more realistic alternative for several reasons, asides from calming
the nerves of environmentalists. I'm not an Algebra guy, but what I understand here is that the specific delta V you end up with is going
to be a product of different burns of different engines. As long as you
have a very high delta V burn for a sufficient duration, a very low delta v burn for a much longer time will afford the kind of speed that
is useful. I think using many different types of thrust systems, whilst
being mindful of what eaches strengths and weaknesses are, is the key here.
--------------------


* The habitat for the trip will contain dried food and medicine as things that _must_ be stored as disposables. Air and water are easily recycled if you're willing to spend a lot of power to do it, but for short trips (1-2 years) it might not be worth the added mass. The mass of air required will be at most about three times the dry weight of the food. The mass of water required is on the order of a couple of kg per person per day, tops.
------------------
&lt;Pan&gt;
The X1 Starship, which is the ship doing all of the long trips in
my currernt hypothetical fleet, will be unto itself an experiment in
a balanced ecosystem. It is also designed to assume that the fully funtional ecosystem completely fails, and to provide air, water, and food for as long as it would take to get back to Earth, or an emergency
assist payload. Believe me, I was hesitant at first to think of having
a payload requirement of a whole grocery store, a large swimming pool,
and a busload of oxygen, but you are right, they are requirements for
the safety of the adventure.
---------------------
* The colony itself will need several heavy pieces of equipment:
**Power plant. Either solar or fission-based (you can use ship drive reactors for this, but they'd have to be pretty beefy). Solar is only really practical in the inner solar system, without exotic construction techniques.
----------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt; I keep finding myself in the position of explaining how useless
Solar is in the outer Solar system. Thanks for the back up. I am pretty
much relying here upon Nuclear power for most of my energy needs. However, I am a SOFT Nuclear Proponent. Have You heard of it? Are you
familiar with its Political issues?
I do think that Solar Powered sattelites in earth orbit is a great way
to generate power for Earth. 
--------------
**Universal smelter. This would be a combination chemical and electrochemical widget that breaks down rock/dirt into oxygen and metals/metalloids, and then separates out desired metals present in few-percent quantities (aluminum, iron, and titanium, mostly). This can be an open-cycle system if you have a source of water to get hydrogen from. A closed-cycle system would do its best to recycle hydrogen, but would still need to be topped up periodically.
------------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
The ThinkStarship answer to this is two fold; First, there would be a main device of this sort in the asteroid capture payload. Second, there
would be Robots whose task this would be. 
----------------
**Really good machine shop. This must be capable of fabricating spare parts for everything in the machine shop.
------------------
Right, and again, the plan here is to have a payload of robots and droids of both macro and nanite sizes specific to the tasks of mining
Asteroids, repairing ships, and fabricating space stations.
--------------
**Airmaker. This is slightly easier to make if it can work in an open-loop cycle. You can get oxygen from the smelter, if on a waterless world, but getting it from water is easier. In a pinch, an air recycler that's periodically topped up will work.
--------------
First, The ThinkStarship plan calls for having balanced ecosystems to provide most of the air needs. This is an air cycle issue, and there is
to be an entire set of pages devoted to solving that problem.
Secondly, redundantly, 3 to 5 years worth of extra air will be stored
for each astronaut. And lastly, yes, there are a variety of ways to get
air out of the environment, and this will be one of the things that will
be covered as droid tasks.
--------------
**Watermaker. You'll need to recycle water on a hydrogen-poor world like the moon or an asteroid. You'd do this by distilling what you can out of waste, and then burning the residue in a hydrogen atmosphere and electrolyzing any resulting water. The hydrogen would then be reclaimed (unless you're on a reducing world like Titan). On Mars, you can condense water from the air in trace amounts, or mine it from the ice caps. On any given world, you'll have either lots of oxygen or lots of hydrogen for the taking, given power. The other will have to be conserved if you're not on a water world.
----------------
&lt;&lt;pan&gt;&gt;
Distillation is certainly one techniqe that we will have available to
use, however, the biocycle itself will attempt to cycle water naturally.
I am curious to know and don't what &quot;Reducing world like Titan&quot; means?

--------------
**Greenhouse. This will be Bloody Huge, but can mostly be built from on-site materials. Fertilizer will have to come from nonmetals extracted from your smelter, though.
--------------
&lt;Pan&gt;
Yes, it will be very large, about the same size space for biocycle as for the rest of the cabins spaces. In other words, the ecosystem doubles
or triples the necessary size of the cabin space.
Thats just for vehicles tho. Colonies will be another matter, and a smelter is again one thing we will have, but extrusion at complicated
levels is more complicated than just a smelter, and we will need a lot
of other devices, including assorted forms of heating and cooling centrifuges, tubing, chambers, etc, etc. Mad scientist gear etc.
-------------
*Humans are an integral part of this system. We don't know how to build a completely automated manufacturing plant, and even if we did, humans would likely be much cheaper.
-------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
We are close to knowing how, there are several key AI heuristics and only a few real robotics problems left to solve. Humans will probably be increasingly useful to design things and increasingly irrelevant to build or repair them.
--------------
*Some items, like medicines and integrated circuit chips, will have to be imported until the colony grows big enough to have enough of an industrial base to build a hundred-million-dollar facility to produce that type of thing. This also includes things like diamond-impregnated tool bits, really good scientific equipment, and so forth. You're going to need lots and lots of spares for this type of supplies.
---------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
I'm assuming that the robotics colonization format for large moon
or planet will be that the a full cities infrastructure will be put mostly in place before the colonists arrive. Self sufficiency is going
to be very important here. It is going to be very expensive to import something and increasingly less expensive to build something on site
once you have a robot army working.
Short of this, the list of things for cabin payload for use in transit
is indeed immense.
--------------------
*Everything else can be bootstrapped with a sufficiently kickass machine shop. The very first things made will be spare equipment for the machine shop (ideally, several machine shops). Second things made will be extra smelters and airmakers and watermakers, so that you can shut these down for regular maintenance or have one fail on you without losing the colony.
-------------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
Agreed, Robots build other most useful Robots to triple redundancy levels for any system that involves a survival failsafe.
----------------


*Light things that you're going to have will be a kickass library, and a kickass entertainment system, both on the ship and colony-side. You need to be able to train people up to be experts in a diverse variety of subjects, and you're going to need to keep people happy for years on end. This wasn't possible during the Apollo era. It's easily possible now.
-----------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
That  library is now being generated by Wikipedia in infancy stage. ThinkStarships &quot;Education&quot; page should and will reflect the need
to generate a long term, every topic library, with a textbook format useful to educating any child to educated astronaut status. That is in a sense what we are doing here; generating the knowledge base that will
be carried to the Stars.

The one thing you don't want me to do is design the recreation department. I know we need one, but I'm a Geek, not a Jock. I do design
really very nice hot tubs tho.
-------------
 *You'll want a high-bandwidth communications link to Earth to keep your library and video collection up to date, as well as sending back status and survey and scientific information. Big dishes are cheap, if you're already hauling a hundred or more tonnes of stuff for a colony.
--------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Again, this is another argument in favor of slow but thoughrough exploration. That way, you are creating a trail of link-ups and substations behind you as you go. However, I would limit off ship
communications intentionally because i think that each Ship and colony
should to some extent accept its isolation, and focus on itself.

Asides, contigous evolution isn't that desirable. The best thing
about many different groups leaving earth is the capacity for each to evolve into its own unique culture. Those differences will be enhanced
if people are motivated to create their own entertainments and so forth
inside of the closed system.

I think a rational limit here is about a maximum of 1 hour a day time
dealing with information from external to the colony per Astronaut.
--------------



I guestimate the bare minimum colony base being 100 tonnes and 10 people. Add another 100 tonnes of supplies, and you can keep them alive for a few years, covering travel and colony-establishment. Add another hundred tonnes of engine and fuel tank, and 3000 tonnes of reaction mass, and you have yourself a ship that might be buildable. It would cost about $100 billion to launch at current market prices. Minimum manned survey craft is about a tenth this for all numbers. Unmanned survey craft a hundredth this or less.
-----------------
I don't think 10 people is large enough crew from a sociology perspective. As I have Aspergers Syndrome, I am particularly mindful of the need to counter Pack psychology with a sufficiently large size population. My minimum crew is 12, and I wouldn't ever send out such crews in groups of less than 3 ships. A better option is about 40.
Trust me, the social and psychological stability factor more than makes it worth it.
My tonnage estimates for ships was in the hundreds ranges. For Colonies
I think we are talking more thousands. However, many of those tons could
probably be mined; Again, my idea here is to send a group of ships to say mars, each with a crew of 12, have them colonize diemos and phobos first, turn those into serious machine shops, and then execute a remote
controlled landing of droid armies from Phobos and Diemos to then land on Mars and build the Colony.The Colonists arrive late in the assembly schedule. Fuel costs are low for Nuclear powered
Ramrockets.
------------------

If you're building somewhere close by, like the moon, you can reduce costs in the short term by sending regular supply craft from Earth, but you'll still need bootstrapping equipment for the colony. Say about $20 billion to launch at current market prices. With a moonbase, colony craft cost goes down to about $30 billion, as you can supply your reaction mass from the moon for far less expense than from Earth.
--------------------
&lt;&lt;Pan&gt;&gt;
Again, Self sufficiency is the goal we probably won't attain, which is why the colonization wave should move slowly.
We should find materials to use and successfully mine them in order to
learn how to do it better and as we go. Cuithne, and other Near Earth
Asteroids are targets which are even more important than the Moon. The Moon is mostly useful in my mind as the new center of our artificial captured asteroid system.
ThinkStarship pretty much wants the nearest objects first in the order of closeness and usefullness. In some ways, we might even think of it as brooming up the Solar system of anything that might get perturbed and take a close swipe too close to the earth in the next billion years.
Mars in comparison is a distant and long term project compared to cruithne.
---------------
*You'll want chemical rocket shuttles to use as landing craft, ferries, and so forth. If delta-v is in the 2-5 km/sec range, you can do this quite easily with single-stage reusable methane+LOX craft.
--------------
&lt;Pan&gt; 
My y2 and y3 designs call for shuttle craft with both chemical and nuclear powered rocket thrust.
------------
Both methane and LOX are very easy to make in-situ if you have carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen available, and will in fact show up at various stages in your airmaker and smelter, so you don't need extra equipment to produce them. The components used in these craft are well-understood and are for the most part already in use. These can probably even be built and maintained with colony equipment, though building them on Earth and transporting them (without fuel) is probably cheaper.
------------------------
&lt;&lt;pan&gt;&gt;
Thanks again. I'll have to let this sit in my mind for a bit and
then start parting some of it out to the actual document.

That about covers it. For further conversation, contact me at Wikipedia. --[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Christopher_Thomas Christopher Thomas] 04:34, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

==First response to brain dump commentary==

I'll keep this relatively short, as we could end up discussing this all day without accomplishing much, as we seem to have different views on a lot of things:
-------------
&lt;pan&gt;
So far it seems like we mostly share pretty similar perspective on most things. Also, as opposed to some other people i have been chatting with, say, for instance, in Yahoogroups, you have been
very civil and very forthcoming with useful information. I'm not an
expert in everything, so some useful input from a person like yourself is greatly appreciated.

Where we seem to differ the most is the specifics of implementation
in the plan I'm proposing. Unlike most people, I'm not so attached to any part of it that I wouldn't let go of some parts of it if somebody were to show good cause why a a particular aspect is a bad idea, or, some better way to go about doing things. All I claim to have done with the general plan is to have strung in a general way together the basics of what is possible in some sort of realistic
but fast paced timeline. My expectation is that the plans details will evolve and grow as experts weigh in on things that I'm just an amatuer at. I'd rather be wrong and corrected than right in my own
mind and wrong in any other reality.
On the other hand, I'm more lucid by an order of magnitude than any of the guys over at YahooGroups.

*You seem to be uncertain about what thrust and delta-v mean. Thrust is the force your engines generate at any given instant. Divide it by craft mass to get acceleration. Delta-v is the total change in velocity that your craft can attain by spending all of its fuel (doesn't matter how quickly or slowly it does this). The delta-v to get between various parts of the solar system is well-known. It depends on what type of course you use (minimum-energy elliptical transfer, or a complicated path that uses slingshot maneuvers, or a very complicated path that attempts to use both liberation points _and_ gravity assists, which seems to be the type you're looking at).
-----------------
Thanks, I am a non-mathemetician.
-----------------



*Figure 100-300 km/sec delta-v to get anywhere in single-digit years, 10-30 km/sec to get anywhere in double-digit years using slingshot assists, and forget about the &quot;interplanetary superhighway&quot;. That takes far too long to get manned craft anywhere, and doesn't save you that much delta-v.
---------------
&lt;pan&gt;
remember, I'm going slowly out in an expansion wave.
I think you are right if i start from earth with the intention
of getting immediately next stop pluto. 
In either case, I visualize not as fast as the first figure and
not as slow usually as the second. Thanks for the sense of spectrum
and range.
-------------


*You're putting way, way too much faith in automated robots. I'm a computer engineer. We have no clue how to build a completely automated factory. We hope we'll know how to do it in 50 years, but I'm pretty skeptical. The NASA proposal for an automated moonbase is mostly useful because you can use it to figure out what you'd have to do with humans instead of robots running the place. Don't be fooled into thinking it's something we can actually build without several very fundamental advances in computer science. I think it was Werner von Braun who said, &quot;a human is the best computer we can put into a spacecraft, and the only one that can be mass-produced by unskilled labour&quot;. Humans are expensive to maintain, but they pay off big time in flexibility. If you're doing anything complicated, it'll be done by humans.
-------------
&lt;pan&gt;

My Expertise is in psychology. I am well aware that the heuristics
problems are huge. However, I think that the best solutions for this
are things that I'd like to explore here.
You are correct, we don't have the Heuristics down yet, and often,
I brush this aside. I think i have more faith in a near term set of solutions than you do, but I am aware of the serious obstacles.
------------
*Any outer solar system colony will already be culturally isolated by the time delay for messages. You won't need to enforce bandwidth caps on people.
-------------
&lt;Pan&gt; Again, I am thinking much more near term than that. The nearest rocks first. Inner solar system. I wouldn't &quot;enforce&quot; anything in any case, I'd suggest, strongly, and take issue with people if they became unproductive or apparently fixated.
-----------
*The minimum size for a self-sustaining colony is about 100 people at the time of establishment. This is due to the 50/500 rule for population genetic diversity (you need at least 50 people to avoid inbreeding in the short term, and at least 500 for mutations to feed new genes into the gene pool as fast as they're lost by random selection). I used 10 people as the minimum number of people needed to _build_ the colony, and to keep it running until you can ferry more colonists over.
------------
&lt;Pan&gt; For genetics purposes, I think we are definitely coming up with
about the same numbers. My concern with 10 people is that this is right at or under the Threshold level for pack psychology to take hold. I want to keep tribal psychology going. Its sort of an esoteric
Sociology problem.
-------------
*You need far more greenhouse space than colonist space. Look at the ratio of farmland to city land on Earth to see why. You're not going to be able to carry this on your ship - it's much, much too heavy to have around when you can just pack enough military rations, granola bars, or what-have-you to keep people fed for a trip that takes less than 10 years. Food would mostly be low-moisture, as you can rehydrate it from the water supply, which gets recycled with at least 80% efficiency, and more if you're willing to pay for it.
------------
&lt;Pan&gt; I have some notes on the Sociology page regarding this. In theory you could cram a batch of people into a much smaller space than the area used to create a functional biosphere for them. The problem is, they won't stay mentally healthy for very long. My plan calls for space allowances per person that are really very large.
Also, with permaculture and aquaculture and tray stacking methods,
a single person can in theory eat from a tray stack system only 5 feet wide and long and 6 feet tall. They'd be eating nothing much other than sprouts and soybeans, but you get the point.
------------
*This is also why your airmaker and watermaker are going to be mechanical, not biological. A biological system doing this, in addition to being suceptible to disease, weighs far too much. The closest we've gotten to doing this was a Russian system that tried to use algae grown on wet canvas to recycle air, and that experiment was done for a relatively _short_ time, on Earth, not in space. You're going to end up with mildew and other crud competing with the algae long before you reach your destination, and will need a lot of algae. The mechanical systems for this are very straightforward to build and maintain, and are lighter than the supplies they conserve for trips over a year or two. They just take power, which you'll have lots of from the drive.
------------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Very good point i hadn't given that much thought to. I had assumed
that the waste systems, for instance, on the X1 would rely on mechanical processes because theres too little overall room. Thanks
for an important point.
----------------

*&quot;Reducing atmosphere&quot; means an atmosphere rich in hydrogen, as opposed to oxygen. In a reducing atmosphere, you have mostly methane and ammonia and water. In an &quot;oxidizing atmosphere&quot;, by contrast, you have free oxygen, free nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water. Earth and Mars have oxidizing atmospheres. Titan has a reducing one. If I recall correctly Venus has an oxidizing atmosphere, but it's inhospitable enough to never be colonized (very high pressure, very high temperature, very corrosive due to sulphur dioxide forming sulphuric acid in combination with atmospheric water). Most airless bodies in the inner solar system give you the same chemicals as an oxidizing atmosphere (the moon is aluminum and silicon oxides, mostly, with a few percent iron, titanium, chromium, phosphorus, and so on). In the outer solar system, you get icy worlds, which are oxygen-rich but have hydrogen bound into water. They're perfect for colonization, because hydrogen is probably the thing you'll run out of most.
-----------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Wow, Thanks, thats fascinating.
------------------

*Don't bother with small asteroids and ring particles until much later. You want something big enough to have gravity, but small enough that you can launch from it cheaply. The moon is about as big as this gets. An asteroid like Ceres is about as small as this gets. The icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn are perfect. Mars is big enough that it's expensive to launch from, but it has all of the elements you need, and an atmosphere, so it's probably also a good colony site.
-----------------
&lt;pan&gt;
I was thinking of centripetal force and not going after any rock smaller than a few hundred meters in diameter. Large gravity wells
are a pain in the but, and Mars is actually a very poor Colonization
Target because it has just enough gravity to make centripetal artificial G systems seriously problematic, and just too little enough gravity sos that muscle atrophy is an issue.
The best objects, I agree, for instance, the most ideal sort
of object is Ceres, the moons of Jupiter and so forth are great
targets also.
----------------

*Launch from any world will probably be via chemical rockets, because they're the only really high thrust drive we have. That's why it's so expensive (Earth is _barely_ small enough that we can get off it with chemical rockets at all). Anything the size of the moon or smaller can be launched from with a reusable LOX/methane craft, which is simple enough to build and fuel with the equipment your colony ship will already have.

*Exhaust from the fission drive won't be very radioactive. A small fraction of the hydrogen will get transmuted to deuterium, but deuterium isn't radioactive either. You'll get trace contamination from erosion of carbon and tungsten from your PBR fuel pellet casings, but this is _not_ desired, because it reduces the life of your engine. A nuclear engine isn't quite high thrust enough to launch from Earth, and isn't politically usable on Earth, but anywhere else you don't have to worry about it (as long as jetwash isn't pointed directly at your colony). Background levels of radiation from space will be much, much higher.
-----------------
&lt;Pan&gt; 
I am not a rocket scientist, but my understanding was that &quot;Nuclear
Powered&quot; Rocket is really a very large category with a lot of very different outcomes. The thrust systems which I had looked at were primarilly very high thrust, but with the serious drawback of generating radioactive backwash. This may not be what you are thinking of, I doubt it is. If its just nuclear _powered_ and not
actually nuclear in the ignition chamber, then you get what you seem
to be talking about.
Nuclear Thrust of the first type is even stronger than chemical thrust. But then theres the other problems.
-------------
*Fission drives have to be much more carefully maintained than chemical rockets, so you won't have many of them if you can avoid it. They'll be the big drives on interplanetary ships. All shuttles will be based on chemical rockets. Colonies will have fission plants, which were probably the drive reactors from the ships that founded the colonies, plus extra equipment for electricity generation if the drive was originally a NERVA-style hydrogen-through-PBR design.
---------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Interesting. Others had led me to believe that Nuclear power
was a good solution for small craft. I'm not committed either way,
but I do know that the ramrocket engines i favor would require a nuclear power source. I'm not a rocket Scientist, just a Psychologist and a Sociologist and an Ecologist.
----------------

*Launching from an airless world will in the long run be done with a mass driver (think &quot;maglev train run at several km/sec off an open-ended track&quot;). This is expensive enough to build that it won't happen until your colony has a GDP in the range of at least $1 billion, but it's how you'd get large amounts of building material for a permanent space station colony or what-have-you. You can't do this from any world that has an atmosphere, even one as thin as Mars's.
-----------------
&lt;pan&gt;
I had visualized that for small moons, somehow it seemed odd for larger moons. Space Elevators was also a pretty good option in my mind. Cost seems to be a non-issue if you can get those robot armies
to work. Big if, but hey, IF, then its really just a matter of getting the bots there and getting them started.
----------------
*Mining asteroids is a royal pain in the tail. If at all possible, mining will be done where there's gravity and an atmosphere. Planets are great big balls of metals and useful minerals, so I just don't see the advantage. The only exception is that you might break off a tiny chunk of an icy body and tow it to an established colony on the moon, to give you carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. It might be cheaper just to haul up refined chemicals from a colony elsewhere and ship them, though.
-----------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Yes, mining in microgravity would be highly problematic. There are
a number of different groups working on the theories of the problem,
and a lot of interesting answers out there. If we are going to make
large Colonies or ships, materials will proove to be cheaper to mine
from Asteroids than lift from Earth or the Moon.
-------------
*Almost all of the mass of an interplanetary ship will be mass that has to be thrown away: reaction mass used by the drive. Even for an electric drive, travel time requirements mean working with as low an exhaust velocity as you can, which means higher thrust but higher mass consumption. Take the mass of anything that doesn't have to be thrown away, and multiply it by 10 to get the reaction mass you need to carry. That's why the colony ships I specced had 300 tonnes dry weight but 3000 tonnes of fuel. For a high-thrust nuclear drive, the reaction mass has to be hydrogen. Otherwise you lose the exhaust velocity advantage over chemical rockets. For a Hall effect thruster, it can in principle be anything, so you can use oxygen or nitrogen or what-have-you from lunar rock. However, I don't think a nuclear-electric craft will get you to the outer solar system in a reasonable length of time if it's a colony ship. Colonizing incrementally doesn't help you much - you still have several AU between outer-system planets, so every step is a very big one.
-------------------
&lt;pan&gt;
Are you taking into account the ramscoop principle here?
I think you are right on if you are talking a Ship thats destined to
leave our solar system and possibly a bit over the top for a ship whose destination is sedna.
---------------


*Equipment breaks down. Complicated equipment breaks down faster. This is why I don't think automated colony ships will work (besides being incredibly complicated and ludicrously expensive), and why I don't think trips with a travel time above about 5 years are practical with humans on board (the systems maintaining the environment are as simple as we can make them, but still pretty complicated).
----------------
&lt;pan&gt; 
I had encountered this issue before, and its a complicated one.
I think that things do break down, but that they can be built in theory to last at least as long as 5 or 10 years. In any case, I'm using a plan that essentially uses 3-7 year hops from orbit level to
orbit level, so I think that is doo-able.
You do have a good point in that total automation won't be a very good idea- You still want human oversight on Robot activity.

Something to think about- IF Robot armies of self replicating
and construction types do become reality, &quot;cost&quot; becomes a very different thing to define than it is now.
------------
*Cultural problems and mob-tyrrany among the crew are far less of a problem than simply keeping them from getting bored out of their skulls, or hating each other because they're all effectively sharing an apartment that they can't get out of for years on end. The key to this, besides carefully screening crew for conflicts before launching, is to give each person personal space they can retreat do and rearrange, and to give everyone the best library, computer, gaming system, and TV you can. These are relatively light, and let people entertain themselves when they're sick of the group. You'd also have a &quot;living room&quot; type of space with an entertainment centre as well, for group entertainment, as well as board games and what-have-you for social relaxation. There'll be a (compact, lightweight) gym, to reduce bone loss and similar problems, but most people don't entertain themselves physically that way, and a facility for swimming or sports is far, far too heavy to put on a spaceship.
---------------
I had forseen a lot of entertainment, including games and video games. I wouldn't put a swimming pool on a ship, thats just the emergency water tanks i was talking about. That wouldn't be for swimming, but it would be as large as a small swimming pool.
------------

*Similarly, happily-married couples are a good idea. Otherwise you'll get sexually-driven tension between crew members either on the ship or once the colony is established.
-------------
&lt;Pan&gt; 
In crew groups over 30 or 40, I think you are right. There are some
strange problems that happen only with very small groups that are driven by subliminal psychosexual motivators. Honestly, it seems counter-intuitive, but the best solution for a really small crew if you want one is a stud male and a batch of lesbians.
-------------

*To avoid health problems, the ship will consist of three big containers. The central one has the drive and fuel tank, which don't rotate. The other two are connected to the central hub by cables, and spin around the hub for gravity, counterweighting each other. One has the crew and everything they need on the trip. The other has everything they don't need on the trip but will need when they establish the colony. If you try to keep humans in zero gravity for years on end, they won't be much good to you when they arrive at the destination. The interplanetary drive doesn't have thrust high enough to produce noticeable gravity.
--------------
&lt;pan&gt; I had the same three containers but had a fourth container
for the drive apparatus including nuclear power system, and put the
two rotating cylinders right next to each other instead of seperating them.
-------------


All of these points pretty much _have_ to be the case for a successful colonization project. Otherwise you end up needing a ship far more massive than you can build, or far more complicated than you can build, and probably far more expensive than you can build given either of those two, and one that takes long enough to reach its destination (any destination) that it's very unlikely to arrive with the crew alive and ship intact. I hope you see why I made each of the specifications I did above. --[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Christopher_Thomas Christopher Thomas] 22:50, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

&lt;Pan&gt; 
Yes, it is a very serious and dangerous game to design spaceships,
and I think we both have a pretty good handle on the main problems and obstacles. Thanks so much for your input.

Addendum:
*I found you by checking the edit history for the &quot;ThinkStarship&quot; project. You're the main one working on it.

Kewl, I guess then that you found ThinkStarship by some amount of
personal interest.
:)
--------------



*Airless worlds give you everything you'd get in an oxidizing atmosphere, _except_ hydrogen, for inner-system bodies like the moon and asteroids in the belt (almost no water).

&lt;Pan&gt;
I still think we should hope for the best but see what we find when we get there and plan for the worst.

==Second response to brain dump commentary==
-----------------
I hope you will forgive me for being brief. I spent about a half hour or so on this and your edit conflict deleted it all.
----------------

Regarding space drives, you seem to have some odd ideas, 
---------------
I'm feeling pretty sensitive to &quot;odd&quot; ideas lately.
I have some good ideas and some mediocre ideas. All of my ideas
are pretty well covered by science on the one hand and my willingness
to allow process to be what it is, not what i assume on the other.
Please forgive me if this sounds annoyed, but all i am doing here
is trying to get the experts together to get them to solve the 
problems, not pretend that i allready have the answers.
-------------


and to be grouping several different ideas together. Specifics of the different drive options are:

*Chemical rockets. The best delta-v you can get for reasonable fuel amounts is about 5 km/sec. Maximum acceleration is several gravities (say about 30 m/s^2). These are used for your shuttles only, and probably for launching equipment from Earth.

*Nuclear-thermal. This involves making a pebble-bed reactor core (a bunch of marble-sized spheres of uranium clad with graphite and coated with tungsten), letting it heat up to about 2500 degrees C, and running hydrogen through it. The hydrogen heats up and sprays out the end of the rocket. Because hydrogen has a much lower molecular weight than the products of rocket fuel combustion, it's moving much faster at any given temperature. This gives you a delta-v of around 10-15 km/sec, at most, with a reasonable amount of fuel. Maximum acceleration is probably in the 0.01 to 0.1 gravity range (about 0.1 to 1 m/s^2). If you're willing to accept a travel time on the order of 5-10 years, you can use this kind of engine for your ships, and use gravity assists to get you where you're going. You don't have enough delta-v to get anywhere else (other than the moon) in a shorter period of time. Outer solar system could take more than 10 years.
----------------------
This is all very interesting and i hope that you will consider making a presentation of this kind of information in the actual document. Otherwise, I'll have to find somebody like you and beg
them to do it, and i am not likely to find somebody who is as sympathetic for the most part as you seem to be.
----------------




*Nuclear-electric or solar-electric. This involves using either a nuclear plant or a solar panel array as an energy source, and using an electric drive to move a working fluid (usually a heavy noble gas like xenon, for ease of handling and ionization, but it can be almost anything else you can turn into a gas). Options like ion drives and older-style plasma drives have problems with the electrodes eroding, but a Hall effect drive will work quite well. The downside is that thrust is very low. This is an unavoidable problem, because the thrust per unit power goes down inversely as your specific impulse (and so delta-v per weight of fuel) goes up. You'd need a power plant with a very high power to weight ratio (lightweight, high power) for this drive to be useful. It's probably still the only option for outer solar system colonization, but trips could take decades.

*The &quot;nuclear drives for small craft&quot; you'd heard about were probably radiothermal electric generators powering electric drives. These aren't reactors; they're subcritical amounts of material that decay fast enough to get warm. Thermocouples draw power off of the heat gradient that results. They're fine for extremely light probes that are allowed to take decades to get anywhere, but aren't useful for small craft. A &quot;reactor&quot; is an assembly of nuclear fuel that catalyzes its own decay, producing much higher heat output for a given amount of weight. They're useful, as noted above, but have a certain minimum size (a few tons for anything shielded).

These drive designs are well-studied enough that we could build them right now, with off-the-shelf parts, if we wanted to. More exotic options you seem to have been made aware of are:

*Nuclear pulse propulsion with bombs.
-----------------
I think that this is the primary form of &quot;nuclear powered&quot;
rocket which i had been exposed to, but it was described very differently from what you have here.
The bombs were going off almost inside the engine.
------------



 This involves building a ship weighing hundreds of thousands of tonnes with a big shock-absorber under it, flinging nuclear warheads in front of the shock absorber, and setting them off. The design (Orion) was studied extensively in the 1950s and 1960s, but is outright impossible to implement for political reasons. You need to amass a _really huge_ stockpile of warheads, and the ship itself is a mobile bomb-thrower with immense destructive potential, so nobody will let anyone else build one, and the radioactive plume out the back prevents it from being used for ground-to-orbit work, which is what it's mostly useful for.

*Nuclear pulse propulsion with inertial confinement fusion. This involves building a small ship with a magnetic field acting as a rocket nozzle, firing pellets of frozen deuterium into the field pinch, and zapping the pellets with lasers or particle beams to initiate fusion. The problem is that we've been trying to build inertial confinement fusion systems for decades, and still don't have one that produces a beneficial amount of power. The pellets are also extremely difficult to make and handle, due to symmetry requirements, and the laser installation is the size of a large building, not counting power plant for the lasers. So, this isn't happening any time soon.

*Bussard ramscoops. You keep mentioning these, but you don't seem to realize where they were intended to function. 
--------------
Thats not true, my one claim to reasonable knowledge is that i found
out 20 years ago basically what you are saying and was so heartbroken than i tinkered the idea up a lot to make it work in 
any case. My ramscoops aren't used for much in most cases other than
to get more speed once allready moving, and they are nuclear powered
magnetic/plasma driven, which means that they double as a magnetic
thrust system.
--------------


Even in Bussard's original models, you have to be travelling extremely quickly for them to work (delta-v of hundreds of km/sec needed to boost to that speed before ignition). They were meant as interstellar craft (launched, expensively, at the speeds required, and then boosting to much higher speeds). The problem is that this type of drive doesn't actually work at all. First, you're trying to fuse the trace amounts of deuterium in the already-very-tenuous amounts of hydrogen in the interstellar medium. This means most of the hydrogen that passes through your drive is inert, causing problems but giving no benefit. Second, the magnetic field ends up deflecting far, far more hydrogen than it pinches to fusion density. This means that even if you built a ramscoop and launched it at the required speeds, instead of igniting and speeding up, it actually just plows into the interstellar medium and slows _down_ without igniting. The drive was popularized in fiction dating from the middle of the 20th century, but will never actually be possible in practice for this reason. Even if it did magically work, it wouldn't be useful for colony work, for the reason mentioned above (you have to be going fast enough to use it that you don't need it if you have the means to get that fast in the first place).

Additional points:

*Regarding moving out in &quot;waves&quot;, you don't seem to realize
----------------
This isn't true, i do know how big space is, and, this is why i
am talking about asteroid colonization, you see, a key component of the plan is to piggyback onto objects that are allready traveling
around the solar system. Cruithnes closest pass is only abit farther
out than the moon.
-----------



 exactly how empty space is, and how far apart useful sites are. The moon is the only thing we can reach quickly from Earth. Getting anywhere else, at all, means changing radius by 0.5 AU going in to Venus (which we don't want to, for reasons mentioned previously), or 1 AU out to Mars. Large bodies in the solar system are more or less set up in a geometric progression, so getting from anywhere else to anywhere else involves travelling at least 2 AU and usually more. Any of these trips takes years or longer, depending on delta-v available (you probably don't have the delta-v to do a straight transfer orbit for objects in the inner solar system, so you have to use an Earth or Moon flyby after one complete orbit at Earth's distance from the sun before going anywhere). Any of these trips also takes large amounts of delta-v to do at all, as noted in my first post.

*Think of the Earth/Moon system as a double planet, for this reason. It's one location, and travel from Earth orbit to Lunar orbit is easy (though surface launches from Earth are prohibitively expensive, and soft-landing on the moon or lifting off from it takes quite a bit of fuel).

*It's not just human health that's affected by microgravity. Microgravity mucks up just about any industrial process developed on Earth (i.e., that we have significant experience with and understanding of). If you're building any kind of machinery, including your airmakers and watermakers and refinery/smelter, you want it to operate in gravity if at all possible, even if it's low gravity. This is why you'd colonize the moon to mine material for large projects, and colonize moons of Jupiter, and Mars, and only the really big asteroids before even thinking about doing anything with the small rocks in the belt. In the outer solar system, where water can exist as ice in vacuum, you might break off chunks of small icy bodies to tow back to refineries on moons, but you'd only do this if you didn't have material already available, and just about all of the outer solar system moons have ices already.
------------------------
Been here also. An old proffessor freind of mine ran me through a thought experiment which demonstrated how problematic things could be. The stuff i had designed up blew up, fell apart, launched away
from the asteroid, the asteroids dust created by mining, etc etc etc
i have contemplated these problems and still consider going after small rocks to be the best early tactic. I am not alone in this,
a lot of other people have similar ideas.
-----------------
*For pack psychology vs. tribal psychology, remember that you're only dealing with a small group for as long as it takes to establish the colony infrastructure. Each subsequent ship, or subsequent ferry run if it's one ship moving back and forth, brings around 30 more people, because you're not hauling colony infrastructure equipment. As long as the small group only has to last 5 years or so, you're fine. This is why a fast transport is desirable (though not necessarily _possible_).
------------------
I'm only betting on a 15 year flight time from earth to pluto.
I think thats conservative and fair, and if it doesn't work out that
way, i will be fine with it.
--------------
*You also seem to be overlooking exactly how nasty small-town politics gets. 
------------------
untrue, i am actually an expert in Sociology, so, even tho i am only a hobbyist in physics, i have knowledge at deep levels for the humanities, those are the bases i do have covered as well as anybody is going to.
------------


As long as the group is small enough that everyone knows most of the others, or a large fraction of the others, social structures freeze in place. The threshold for this seems to my uneducated guess to be around a thousand people. This also determines how unusual someone can be and still find like-minded people (if your hobby or mindset is 1 in 100, then you can find like minds in a 1000-person town, but not if you're at 0.1% or less). Large towns of 10,000 or more would be required to reduce these effects. Either way, you're not going to haul that many colonists over, so in practice you're starting with 50-100 people, and hoping they sort themselves out after a few generations of large families.
---------------
i have info posted on group sizes and will add more as the occasion and time permit.
-------------
*This is another reason why communication with Earth is a good thing. It gives anyone alienated on the colony a support network of like-minded individuals (for better or for worse).
--------------
I think broad band communication with earth is a good idea and am sorry you seem to think that my comments indicated otehrwise. All I am saying is that theres a balance here, and that we don't want our people fixated on earth.
------------



*Growing food by hydroponics has just as many problems as making a biological airmaker: it takes a lot of power (plants are inefficient), and is suceptible to infection and other maintenance problems. The weight in dried food lasts quite a while and can be stored for years. You'd only start growing things when you could get light for free (a greenhouse on an inner-system world). Outer-system colonies would either need large concentrator mirrors, or would need to spend a very large amount of power, or would just have supplies shipped in periodically. On a spaceship, it's not volume that's a problem (for things that don't need shielding), but weight of the apparatus, and amount of power needed (which means weight in the power plant).
------------------
Again, I am not a physicist and i don't do algebra. I have on the other hand studied ecology sciences in pretty good depth, and I think
i know what is possible. I'd be going for a garden as soon as the ships got into space because i know thats the best way to do it.
-----------



*You'd only use a maglev launch system on a body with an escape velocity of about 1-2 km/s or more. This means the moon. Mars (like Earth) would _benefit_ from one but can't build one because of the atmosphere. Smaller bodies don't have an incentive to build one, because chemical shuttles work fine. Very small bodies, with escape velocities on the range of 100-200 m/s, would use short launch tracks of the type found on aircraft carriers on Earth, but that's a very different type of system (much cheaper to build).
------------
Never even thought of that kind of launch system. The space elevators
are the product of a visitor who hasn't returned. If he does return,
I'll be asking him to justify some of his ideas, more or less
------------------
*The only worlds where a space elevator makes sense are Earth and Mars, because they're rotating quickly, have atmospheres preventing magnetic launches, and are massive enough that chemical rockets are very expensive to use. They're very big, very expensive to make, and very annoying to maintain, so if other options are usable, other options would get used. In practice, Mars is the only place I'd expect to see one, because an elevator for Earth requires materials we don't know how to make yet.

*A rotating base colony-side is an interesting idea, but you'd avoid it due to mechanical annoyance if possible. 
--------------
It solves more problems than it generates.
--------
Any world with 0.1 gravities or more would keep humans adequately healthy, though they'd have trouble if they went down to Earth. 
-------------
Muscles atrophy probably in less than .4 G.
--------


Ceres is 1000 km wide. I'd be reluctant to colonize anything smaller than 500 km, due to the difficulties microgravity causes industry. Typical outer solar system moons are thousands of km wide.
---------------
Centripetal force makes smaller rocks a lot more interesting to start
with.
---------------



*You want rotating parts of the ship to be on as long a baseline as possible. This makes the rotation rate as low as possible. Quickly rotating ships cause motion sickness problems, and sometimes mechanical nastiness due to the coroilis effect. This is why I specced the crew compartment to be at the end of a long cable. You only need one other rotating module, as a counterweight. You don't want the drive module to move relative to the ship's centre of mass, so it can't rotate. This gives you three modules, per my previous outline.
-----------------
I think we more or less agree, just minor variations in implementation. 
------------
*We're going to have to agree to disagree on the &quot;armies of robot workers&quot; thing. 
----------------
I think that you are missing the point. I am a realist and a pragmatist. I know that there are serious problems to be solved. I am anxious for us to start working to solve them. If we don't have operational robots in time to lanch the first ships, then we will have other things to do wha they might have. The main thing is
I am just trying to get the problem solving process going. If we assume it won't work and don't try to solve the problems, then of course, it won't work, and thats one way we won't solve any problems.
If we assume it will work, and find out as we work on it that it won't, at least we will be working on the problem, and maybe in a generation or two it will be useful. I am not stupid nor am i a crackpot. I just want to get people working on solving the problems
in a realistic way. Short term, I just want to use the basic premise
to write a whole hoarde of themed textbooks. I'm not pretending to have any answers i don't have, I am just stringing things together as best as i can figure and hoping that will suffice until physics
folks like yourself string them together even better. I'm not ego attached here, I am seriously and honestly seeking a group effort
based on reason, science, logic, and what is real.
----------------


They'd be far, far more complex than any system we've designed to date, and the expense and difficulty of designing a system goes up extremely quickly as complexity is increased. The chance of it actually working goes down very quickly as complexity is increased. This is why I'm not optimistic about the technology for fully autonomous, self-replicating factories and robots being developed within any useful planning horizon. You're correct about it radically changing how you'd implement projects, but there are lots of technologies that would have effects like that. None look like they're happening in the near future.

I hope this explains why I made some of the statements I did previously. --[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Christopher_Thomas Christopher Thomas] [[User:130.63.92.157|130.63.92.157]] 23:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

I am sorry, the second response isn't as good as the first. I truly appreciate you and your input. I hope that you will come over and
make these presentations to the areas that need it. If not, I will have to find somebody with your knowledge who will.</text>

== Re: Tutorial ==

The &quot;elementary tutorial&quot; section seems unnecessary.  It is covered in more detail, in a better format, under &quot;Your First Document&quot;.
At the very least, the tutorial is not version specific, so the &quot;2.3&quot; should be removed from the title.</text>

      <comment>/* Hello World XSLT Tranform */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Apache Ant has a task called &lt;xslt&gt; (or its synonym &lt;style&gt;) that performs an XML transform on a file or group of files.

Here is an example XML transformation target:

 &lt;target name=&quot;MyXSLT&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xslt in=&quot;MyInput.xml&quot; 
       out=&quot;MyOutput.xml&quot;
       style=&quot;MyTransform.xslt&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/xslt&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;

In the ant target there are three files you must specify:
* '''in''' The name of the source XML input file
* '''out''' The name of the XML output file
* '''style''' The name of the XSLT file

To test this you can create a &quot;dummy&quot; input file:
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;root&gt;
    &lt;Input&gt;Hi&lt;/Input&gt;
 &lt;/root&gt;

==Hello World XSLT Transform==
To get started, here is a small &quot;hello world&quot; transform file.  The transform looks for the root data element of the input file but does not actually process any of the input file data elements:

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;xml&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
         &lt;MyMessage&gt;Hello World!&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

You can now execute this from a command line.  The following is an example run from a Microsoft Windows command shell:

  C:\XMLClass\XSLT\Lab1&gt;ant
  Buildfile: build.xml
  
  MyXSLT:
       [xslt] Processing C:\XMLClass\XSLT\Lab1\MyInput.xml to C:\XMLClass\XSLT\Lab
  1\MyOutput.xml
       [xslt] Loading stylesheet C:\XMLClass\XSLT\Lab1\MyTransform.xslt
  
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL
  Total time: 1 second

The output will appear in a file called MyOutput.xml

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;MyMessage&gt;Hello World!&lt;/MyMessage&gt;

===Transforming Files containing external References===
Sometimes you may need to transform XML files containing external references, like URLs in DTDs or Schema definitions.

Quite often, parsing or validating against such external files can not be totally disabled. Saxon for example will want to read DTDs even if parsing them is disabled (parameter &quot;-dtd:off&quot; or equivalent).

In such cases it may also occur, that the development workstation is connected to a company intranet that is protected by a firewall from the internet, and needs some sort of proxy or socks configuration. 

In these cases, the only solution to successfully execute the transformation is by adding this connection configuration to the ant script.

Example (taken from a bigger build.xml file):

    &lt;target name=&quot;xdoclet-merge-top&quot; depends=&quot;init, proxy-set&quot; &gt;
      &lt;xslt style=&quot;${XDocletDescDir}/merge.xslt&quot; 
        in=&quot;${XDocletDescDir}/merge1.xml&quot; 
        out=&quot;${XDocletDescDir}/jboss-2.xml&quot; force=&quot;true&quot; &gt;			
        &lt;classpath location=&quot;${ZubehoerDir}/SaxonHE9-4-0-1J/saxon9he.jar&quot; /&gt;	
      &lt;/xslt&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;
    &lt;target name=&quot;proxy-set&quot;&gt;
      &lt;setproxy proxyhost=&quot;proxy.mynet.de&quot; proxyport=&quot;8080&quot; proxyuser=&quot;&quot; proxypassword=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;

==Passing Parameters from Ant into an XSLT script==
You can also pass parameters from an ant build file into an XSLT.  This is handy if you need to run the same transform with small variations.  You can do this by simply adding the &lt;/code&gt;param&lt;/code&gt; tag the &lt;xslt&gt; target:

 &lt;param name=&quot;MyParameter&quot; expression=&quot;ANT AND XSLT ROCK&quot;/&gt;

The ant task now looks like the following:

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;project default=&quot;MyXSLT&quot;&gt;
     &lt;target name=&quot;MyXSLT&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xslt
           in=&quot;MyInput.xml&quot;
           out=&quot;MyOutput.xml&quot;
           style=&quot;MyTransform.xslt&quot;&gt;
           &lt;param name=&quot;MyParameter&quot; expression=&quot;ANT AND XSLT ROCK&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/xslt&gt;
     &lt;/target&gt;
 &lt;/project&gt;

Here is a sample transform that takes a single input parameter:

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;xml&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;MyParameter&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;MyMessages&gt;
            &lt;MyMessage&gt;Hello From XSLT&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
            &lt;MyMessage&gt;From input: &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;/root/Input&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/MyMessage&gt;
            &lt;MyMessage&gt;
                &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$MyParameter&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/MyMessage&gt;
        &lt;/MyMessages&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;


This will create the following output:

 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;MyMessages&gt;
     &lt;MyMessage&gt;Hello From XSLT&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
     &lt;MyMessage&gt;From input: Hi&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
     &lt;MyMessage&gt;ANT AND XSLT ROCK&lt;/MyMessage&gt;
 &lt;/MyMessages&gt;

Note that there are three different lines.  One came from the transform file, one came from the input XML file and one was passed directly in from the ant file.

== Other ways to use XSLT within Apache Ant ==

=== Checking dependencies ===
By default, the XSLT task will check the file time stamps to see if the output file is newer than the input file.  If the outputs are newer the task should not have to re-run the transform.  But sometimes a transform will import other transforms files and Ant does not check the timestamps of imported files.  (Perhaps they will add that as an option in the future.)  But all is not lost.  We can achieve the same results by using the &lt;dependset&gt; tag.  Here is an example:

 &lt;dependset&gt;
    &lt;srcfilelist dir=&quot;${XSLTDir}&quot;
       files=&quot;Content2HTML.xsl, HTMLHeader.xsl,PageHeader.xsl,LeftNav.xsl,PageFooter.xsl&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;targetfileset
       dir=&quot;${BuildDir}&quot;
       includes=&quot;*.htm&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/dependset&gt;

In the above example the source transform (Content2HTML.xsl) imported the other four page fragment transforms located in the XSLTDir (HTMLHeader.xsl, PageHeader.xsl, LeftNav.xsl and PageFooter.xsl).  It created the files in the BuildDir directory.  If any of the inputs files change, the outputs will be regenerated.

This is a handy way to build a little ant-based web content management system.  You just put the HTML content in a directory and the transform can wrap the HTML headers, navigation bars and footers around your content.  The HTML for each page can just be a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; section that is copied into the output using the &lt;xsl:copy-of&gt; command.

Put simply, a subspace is analogous to a subset of a topological space. Subspaces have powerful applications in topology.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;( X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, and let &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; be a subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Define the open sets as follows:

A set &lt;math&gt;U_1 \subseteq X_1&lt;/math&gt; is '''open''' in &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a a set &lt;math&gt;U\in\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;U_1=U\bigcap X_1&lt;/math&gt;

An important idea to note from the above definitions is that a set not being open or closed does not prevent it from being open or closed within a subspace. For example, &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; as a subspace of itself is both open and closed.

== Introduction ==
This is a collection of '[[w:False friend|false friends]]' (shared words having different meanings) between Slavonic languages, e.g. Russian–Polish, Macedonian–Upper Sorbian, Belarusian–Serbian, etc. For an idea about 'false friends' with respect to the English language, please see [[w:List of words having different meanings in British and American English|List of British American False Friends]]

The [[w:Hypertext|hypertext]] navigation in this book is simple. Use the [[#navtab|navigation table]] at the top of this page and click at an '''X''' at the crossing of two languages to find an alphabetical list of false friends between these languages. A click at the abbreviation of a language itself leads you to a ''monolingual'' page giving an overview over the 'false friends' of the respective language in all other Slavonic languages.

The [[/Maps|semasiological maps]] give you an overview over the different meanings a word has in different Slavonic languages.

Alternatively, you can also use the alphabetical list of all existing pages at [[:Category:False Friends of the Slavist]].

== Conversion from a personal project ==

The concept and the first 2447 'false friends' pairs entered into this wikibook come from an internet project by [[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]], which has now been converted into a Wikibook. It was started in October 1999, when the author was writing his [http://www.uni-bonn.de/~dbuncic/staatsarb/ master thesis] about 'false friends'. (At first it was located at www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/slavistik/fauxamis and from September 2001 until February 2006 at www.uni-bonn.de/~dbuncic/fauxamis.) In September 2003, unfortunately all further development had to be stopped due to lack of time. Now at last it can be developed further, with ''everyone'' interested in Slavonic false friends (and there are lots of people who are, see [[#Pre-Wikibook contributors|below]]) being able to contribute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just edited the section on closed circuits; here's what it said before:

''A closed circuit, or a &quot;Short circuit&quot; is simply another name for a wire. A closed circuit is a section of       the circuit that has no significant resistance. If the theoretical resistance goes to zero, ohms law states that any voltage will cause the current flow to approach infinity.''

''Any time this wikibook mentions that voltage or current go to infinity, the reader should keep in mind that the physical circuit will fail long before the value actually reaches infinity. Such failure can cause damage to the circuit, and possibly even harm to people nearby. In colloquial use, it is not unheard of to say that the circuit &quot;explodes&quot; at this point.''

Now, how I understand it, any completed circuit with a flowing charge is &quot;closed&quot; but you wouldn't call any working circuit a &quot;short circuit&quot;. Also, I've been told despite what most books say, current doesn't flow, charge does; this makes a lot more sense, as current is charge/time which is a speed measurement, not an object quantity.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">GoGui is a graphical user interface to Go engines supporting GTP.

GoGui is written in Java and runs on all major platforms.
GoGui is especially useful for Go programmers.
It allows to display the output of engine-specific extension commands (&quot;analyze commands&quot;) by using a configuration file.
The Go engine can be written in any language, as long as it is able to communicate using GTP through the standard input/output streams.
This allows to keep the engine free of non-portable GUI code.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ejsp. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ejsp~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr”&gt;
This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

Hello, we have a naming convention here in Wikibooks. Basically, we do &quot;Future/Prologue&quot; and not &quot;Future:Prologue&quot;. I have taken the liberty to correct your page, but please follow naming conventions in the future. Good luck with your project. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:24, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== Links on [[Future/Totalitarian State]] ==
Could I ask you to review these.  There really are a large number on this page - many only go to a graphic or photo.  The idea of Wikibooks is that the reader will find all they need on the page concerned and links, certainly in this quantity, are rarely necessary.  Thank you  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:40, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

==Attribution of other wikis==

Here's the way I do it for most wikis:

Go to the page you're copying, copy it, and add it to the new page you're creating.

Then go back to the page you copied, click on &quot;history&quot;, then click on the '''date stamp''' of the most current revision. Copy the URL address, then go back to the new page here on wikibooks.

Edit the talk page, and put in the following (for example):

:Copied from the page &quot;Category:Yunzhong Hou (Futurologist)&quot; on [http://future.wikia.com/ future.wikia], using [http://future.wikia.com/index.php?title=Category:Yunzhong_Hou_%28Futurologist%29&amp;oldid=7977 this revision]. 

If you're using a page from wikipedia, you can do even better by requesting an import on [[WB:RFI]], which brings over all versions of the page history. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:38, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== Rewriting? ==

You asked about this on the vfd discussion, and I've answered there. I think there's certainly promise in your approach for a good wikibook, but not the way you're doing it. 

I think the best way foreward would be to just take '''one''' scenario (whichever one you prefer: &quot;Matriarchy&quot; would actually be my vote), and go into detail about the reasons for making such a prediction. You could certainly use some empirical trends (i.e., the historical collapse of patriarchy), and any number of psychohistorical factors (will to power, will to belong, philanthropic drive, instinctive drives (sex, need for food, attraction to the path of least resistance), and gender differences (how different drives are expressed and/or interpreted differently by man and women). 

BUT: just laying out a bunch of hypotheticals without discussions of the method just won't fly. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:25, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The problem of space==

The problem of Relationalism and Substantivalism has been discussed earlier. In this section the concept of space will be explored in more depth.

Space is apparent to us all. It is the existence of many simultaneous things at an instant. If we see a ship and hear a dog barking on our left there is space. If we look at a checkerboard there is space.  This occurrence of space in phenomenal experience is similar to the measurement of space in the world: things that are simultaneously at the ends of a metre rule are a metre apart; if there is more than one object at a given instant the objects are separated by space.  

Physicists have found that the mathematics of '''vector spaces''' describes much of the arrangement of things in the world. In a vector space the independent directions for arranging things are called '''dimensions'''.  At any instant physical space has three clearly observable dimensions.  

It has been known for millennia that the three dimensions observable at an instant are interrelated by '''Pythagoras' Theorem''':

Pythagoras' theorem on a plane shows that the length of any displacement is related to the sum of the squares of the displacements in the independent directions (x and y):

&lt;math&gt;h^2 = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;

Pythagoras' theorem in three dimensions is:

&lt;math&gt;h^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2&lt;/math&gt;

The advances in geometry in the nineteenth century showed that Pythagoras' theorem was a special case of a '''metric''', an equation that describes displacements in terms of the dimensions available.  In the twentieth century it was realised that time was another independent direction for arranging things that was interrelated to the other three dimensions. The world is now described as a '''four dimensional manifold'''.

The illustration below shows how different numbers of dimensions affect the arrangement of things.  

[[Image:constudspace2.gif]]

It is sometimes suggested that our idea of space is due to some sort of memory that is read out sequentially. This is unlikely because, at any instant a one dimensional form cannot be made to overlie a two dimensional form and a two dimensional form cannot overlie a three dimensional form etc.  One dimensional forms are not ''congruent'' with two dimensional forms. This means that a one dimensional form such as ''virtual memory'' cannot, at any instant, overlie two dimensional forms such as occur in phenomenal experience and hence experience does not supervene on the idea of virtual memory (See section on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:The_philosophical_problem_-_machine_consciousness#The_Computability_Problem_and_Halting_of_Turing_Machines functionalism as a one dimensional Turing Machine]).

Curiously the idea of ''mental space'' is often denied.  McGinn(1995) gives such a denial:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;We perceive, by our various sense organs, a variety of material objects laid out in space, taking up certain volumes and separated by certain distances. We thus conceive of these perceptual objects as spatial entities; perception informs us directly of their spatiality. But conscious subjects and their mental states are not in this way perceptual objects. We do not see or hear or smell or touch them, and a fortiori do not perceive them as spatially individuated.(2) This holds both for the first- and third-person perspectives. Since we do not observe our own states of consciousness, nor those of others, we do not apprehend these states as spatial. &lt;/font&gt; McGinn(1995).

This denial is strange because it begins by describing phenomenal experience as clearly spatial and then proceeds to argue that there is some other thing, the &quot;mental state&quot;, which is non-spatial. This seems to contradict our everday life where our experience is our experience, there is no other experience.  The issue is whether this experience is things in themselves (Direct Realism) or some other form in the brain (Indirect Realism). The illustration below shows how space occurs in phenomenal experience; it sidesteps the issue of the location of the contents of phenomenal consciousness.

[[Image:constudspace.gif]]

McGinn (1995) gives a description of how phenomenal experience cannot be overlaid by a 3D model of events in the brain:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Consider a visual experience, E, as of a yellow flash. Associated with E in the cortex is a complex of neural structures and events, N, which does admit of spatial description. N occurs, say, an inch from the back of the head; it extends over some specific area of the cortex; it has some kind of configuration or contour; it is composed of spatial parts that aggregate into a structured whole; it exists in three spatial dimensions; it excludes other neural complexes from its spatial location. N is a regular denizen of space, as much as any other physical entity. But E seems not to have any of these spatial characteristics: it is not located at any specific place; it takes up no particular volume of space; it has no shape; it is not made up of spatially distributed parts; it has no spatial dimensionality; it is not solid. Even to ask for its spatial properties is to commit some sort of category mistake, analogous to asking for the spatial properties of numbers. E seems not to be the kind of thing that falls under spatial predicates. It falls under temporal predicates... &lt;/font&gt;McGinn(1995)

He concludes that a 3D form can only be rearranged into the form of the things in experience over a succession of instants (&quot;It falls under temporal predicates&quot;). This is highly suggestive of phenomenal experience having more than three dimensions in the same way as an ordinary physical thing or field has more than three dimensions.

==The problem of qualia==

A quality of an object such as its colour, roughness, temperature etc. is known as a '''quale''', the plural of quale is '''qualia'''.  Qualia are the contents of phenomenal consciousness. The term &quot;qualia&quot; is sometimes extended to all mental aspects of an object such as roundness, size and even relative position. 

===The physics of qualia===

According to physicalism qualia must be things in the universe. But what are &quot;things in the universe&quot; and which of these are qualia?

If we wish to explain phenomenal experience we must first decide whether experience is a measurement or things themselves.  Measurement begins with a quantum mechanical interaction between an instrument and a set of particles, this then creates a ''signal'' which is a change in the state of the instrument. As an example, a mercury thermometer interacts with the fluid around it which results in a signal in the form of a moving column of mercury in the thermometer.  As another example, a measuring rule is aligned with the two ends of an object by a servomechanism that interacts with photons from the rule and the object, the signal being the markings that align with the end of the object.

The signal can be a flow of charge or photons or a chemical change etc.  Sensory experience begins with the interaction between an object that acts as a measuring instrument and a set of particles such as photons or scent molecules etc. In the Direct Realist case the signal would be the change at the interface between the bulk of a material (a crude measuring device) and a set of particles such as photons, in the Indirect Realist case it would be some signal in the brain derived from the initial signal.  In either case phenomenal consciousness would be some form, an arrangement of the set of signals themselves. 

The signals in measuring events arise as a result of interactions between QM phenomena and a measuring apparatus composed of relatively large structures. These structures (called ''the environment'') produce signals at definite locations.  This chain of fixing positions is known as '''decoherence''' (see Zurek (2003)  or Bacciagaluppi (2004) for a review).  This means that measuring events fix the positions of signals and these represent the positions of QM events. (Some physical particles such as photons are subject to little decoherence during propagation, even in water (cf: Anglin &amp; Zurek (1996)).) 

So signals in measuring devices usually have highly restrained positions. Now consider the final signals, the one's in phenomenal consciousness.  To an observer of the brain they should be, very nearly, in their classical positions within the brain unless they consist of photons or are subject to some special effect such as has been proposed for microtubules. The brain acts as a measuring device causing decoherence. But despite this even signals composed of sodium ions, which should decohere rapidly in water, have a tiny, but finite, probability of remaining in a coherent state.

If your conscious experience is the signals and not the fabric of the brain are you the set of signals that interacts with the brain fabric almost immediately, the set that interacts after a minute or the set that almost never interacts?  To an outside observer you must be the main chance, the rapidly interacting signals, but to the signals themselves all possibilities exist. Which one are you?  Certainly any interaction between the signals and the mutually observed world must involve decoherence but the external observer would find it difficult to determine whether a particular interaction was due to signals that had interacted immediately or ones that were delayed (or delayed in an alternate QM reality). This problem is part of the ''preferred basis problem'' that will be discussed later.

Zurek (2003)assumes that phenomenal experience is identical to measurements.  The observer is then both the signal and the apparatus that encloses the signal. He summarises the resultant idea of the completely determined observer who is fully integrated into the measured world:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;The ‘higher functions’ of observers - e.g., consciousness, etc. - may be at present poorly understood, but it is safe to assume that they reflect physical processes in the information processing hardware of the brain. Hence, mental processes are in effect objective, as they leave an indelible imprint on the environment: The observer has no chance of perceiving either his memory, or any other
macroscopic part of the Universe in some arbitrary superposition. &quot;&lt;/font&gt; Zurek (2003)

Notice the phrase &quot;perceiving .. his memory&quot; - as neuroscientists we must ask &quot;how&quot;? By more measurements?  There are no more measurements when things are arranged in phenomenal consciousness, the information has nowhere else to go. However, according to the empiricist philosophers the arrangements of the signals in phenomenal consciousness do extend through time in a definite order at any instant. Is it this order that determines the positions of signals in the brain or is it the brain that determines this order?

Physicalism leads us to an idea of the content of consciousness as an arrangement of quantum fields like the content of the brain or the content of the world.  The arrangement of the quantum fields at an instant in experience is probably related to the arrangement of measured events at a succession of instants in the world.

According to the account given above, the contents of conscious experience, the qualia, are signals derived from the world that compose conscious experience with the interesting problem that they are themselves the experience and are not fixed in space and time by further measurement.

===The philosophy of qualia===

The term &quot;qualia&quot; was introduced by C.I. Lewis in 1929:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;This given element in a single experience of an object is what will be meant by &quot;a presentation.&quot; Such a presentation is, obviously, an event and historically unique. But for most of the purposes of analyzing knowledge one presentation of a half-dollar held at right angles to the line of vision, etc., will be as good as another. If, then, I speak of &quot; the presentation&quot; of this or that, it will be on the supposition that the reader can provide his own illustration. No identification of the event itself with the repeatable content of it is intended.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;In any presentation, this content is either a specific quale (such as the immediacy of redness or loudness) or something analyzable into a complex of such. The presentation as an event is, of course, unique, but the qualia which make it up are not. They are recognizable from one to another experience.(CI Lewis, ''Mind and the World Order'', 1941 edition Chapter 2)&lt;/font&gt;

Tye (2003) gives the following definition of qualia:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Experiences vary widely. For example, I run my fingers over sandpaper, smell a skunk, feel a sharp pain in my finger, seem to see bright purple, become extremely angry. In each of these cases, I am the subject of a mental state with a very distinctive subjective character. There is something it is like for me to undergo each state, some phenomenology that it has. Philosophers often use the term 'qualia' to refer to the introspectively accessible properties of experiences that characterize what it is like to have them. In this standard, broad sense of the term, it is very difficult to deny that there are qualia.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; Tye(2003).

In philosophy objects are considered to have perceived features such as shape and colour, weight and texture which are called sensible qualities.  Sensible qualities are divided into intrinsic, or primary, qualities that are properties of the object itself and extrinsic, or secondary, qualities which are related to the sensations produced in the observer.  Shape is generally considered to be a primary quality whereas colour is often considered to be a secondary quality. It is generally considered that secondary qualities correspond to qualia (Smith 1990, Shoemaker 1990) and the two terms are often used synonymously. Although secondary qualities may be qualia, the term &quot;qualia&quot; may include things other than perceptions such as pain etc. that are, arguably, not secondary qualities. Primary qualities might also give rise to experience that is distinct from, say, the shape of an object itself. 

Although &quot;qualia&quot; is a recent term, the philosophical debate about the nature of secondary qualities, such as colours, and the nature of conscious experience itself has been around for millennia.

It seems that the visual system gives rise to experience even in the absence of previous visual stimulation. For example, when someone recovers from blindness they have an experience that contains shapes and colours even though these have little meaning:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;When he first saw, he was so far from making any judgement of distances, that he thought all object whatever touched his eyes.... he knew not the shape of anything, nor any one thing from another, however different in shape and magnitude.. We thought he soon knew what pictures represented, which were shewed to him, but we found afterwards we were mistaken; for about two months after he was couched, he discovered at once they represented solid bodiess, when to that time he considered them only as party-coloured panes, or surfaces diversified with variety of paint.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; William Cheselden (1728)

Qualia are the components of experience, whatever the mode of input to that experience. Strawson (1994) includes content such as accompanies suddenly remembering or thinking of something as examples of qualia.

There is thought to be an ''explanatory gap'' associated with qualia (Levine 1983), as an example it is hard to imagine how the experience called pain could be a set of impulses in the brain.  

Some philosophers have attempted to bridge this gap by invoking Direct Realism, proposing that our experience is in some way 'transparent' so that we experience the world or the injured limb directly (i.e.: there is an assumption that things flow within phenomenal experience into a centre point and we see right through this flow!).  This idea has led to a deduction that phenomenal experience is a set of things and qualities are these things, not deductions about or experiences based on these things. As Tye (2003) puts it:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;These observations suggest that qualia, conceived of as the immediately 'felt' qualities of experiences of which we are cognizant when we attend to them introspectively, do not really exist. The qualities of which we are aware are not qualities of experiences at all, but rather qualities that, if they are qualities of anything, are qualities of things in the world (as in the case of perceptual experiences) or of regions of our bodies (as in the case of bodily sensations). This is not to say that experiences do not have qualia. The point is that qualia are not qualities of experiences. &lt;/font&gt;

However, the outstanding issue for Tye's analysis is where in the world the thing that is called a quale exists - on a thing in the world beyond the body, on the retina, in the cortex, in the thalamus? Tye seems to be suggesting that &quot;in the world&quot; can only be beyond the retina but given that a television can have a colour and a retina can have a colour why should we insist that the colour in conscious experience is always ''of'' the thing being represented via the DVD or videotape?  That colour should always be a property of an original coloured object seems strange, why is it not a property of the pigment in a photo of the object, a property of an led in a computer screen displaying an image of the photo, a property of the pigments in the retina viewing the computer, the impulses in the visual cortex etc.?

As was seen in the previous section, only signals are available in the classical world of conscious observation. The &quot;reality&quot; of the things that generate signals is not available. So whether experience is a signal at the position of what we call an &quot;oak tree&quot; or a signal in the eye due to photons reflected from the tree or a signal in the brain the same sort of phenomena would apply.  Qualia would be a field, an arrangement of signals, not processes based on these signals. 

Some philosophers hold that qualia are a field of signals derived from the original signals that are next to the quantum phenomena that compose an object. In other words they propose that qualia are not the first signals in the chain from whatever composes an object to the observer. These philosophers are known as Representationalists and the emphasis on secondary signals allows a contribution from the brain etc. to the field of signals that is conscious experience.  Modern representationalists such as Tye (1995), Lehar(2003) and Dretske(2003) emphasise the idea that qualia are actual things that represent objects rather than concepts or experiences of things. As Dretske puts it:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;..the features that define what it is like to have an experience are properties that the objects we experience (not our experience of them) have.&lt;/font&gt;(Dretske 2003).

Lehar(2003) uses modern language to express the empiricist notion that the signals that comprise qualia are more likely to be in our brains than elsewhere, according to Lehar the objects we experience must be informational replicas in our heads:
  
&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The central message of Gestalt theory therefore is that the primary function of perceptual processing is the generation of a miniature, virtual-reality replica of the external world inside our head, and that the world we see around us is not the real external world, but is exactly that miniature internal replica&quot; (Lehar 2003).&lt;/font&gt; 

Direct Realists and Representationalists share the same view that qualia are an actual, physical field of things somewhere in the world.  Some functionalists and eliminativists take a different view, believing that qualia do not exist except as judgements of properties that are used in interactions (i.e.: as disembodied information - see the section on Direct Realism).

== Overview ==
Perl modules (Files that end with the pm extension) are files of perl code that can be reused from program to program. There is an online repository of perl modules called CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) at http://cpan.org. Many of these modules come standard with Perl, but others must be installed as needed.

There are thousands of perl modules that do everything from creating a temporary file to calling Amazon web services. These modules can make it easy to quickly write your application if you know how to find, install, and use the appropriate Perl modules.  If you are thinking of writing your own Perl module, the best thing to do is to first search at http://Search.cpan.org to make sure you are not about to reinvent the wheel.

There are two major styles of Perl modules:

# Object-Oriented
# Functional

Some perl modules use both approaches. 

To use an object-oriented Perl module you would do something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
use Foo;
my $foo = Foo-&gt;new();
print $foo-&gt;bar;  #call Foo's bar method and print the output.
&lt;/pre&gt;

A functional perl module might get used like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
use Foo qw/bar/; # Import the name of the subroutine you want to use.
print bar();
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== How to install a Perl module ===

Find the perl module you want at http://cpan.org, and download the gzipped file.
Untar and unzip the file:

&lt;pre&gt;
tar -zxvf MyModule.tgz
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then cd into the directory, and follow the instructions in the README or INSTALL file.

You can also use a command-line program called cpan, if you have it installed:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo cpan -imt Module::I::Want
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== To Write your own Perl Module ===
Perl modules differ from perl scripts in two key and simple ways.
Instead of starting the module with &quot;#!/path/to/perl&quot;, you start the file with the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
package My::Module::Name;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You need to end the module with a true value, so the common practice is to do this at the end of the file:
&lt;pre&gt;
1;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following is a valid perl module:
&lt;pre&gt;
package My::Module::Name;

1;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Example ====

We create a new file called ExampleModule.pm, and in it have the following code:

&lt;pre&gt;
package ExampleModule;
use strict;
use base &quot;Exporter&quot;;
our @EXPORT = qw/hello_world/;

sub hello_world
{
   print &quot;hello, world!\n&quot;;
}

1;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can test to see if the syntax is valid by running:
&lt;pre&gt;
perl -c ExampleModule.pm
&lt;/pre&gt;

It will print out &quot;ExampleModule.pm syntax OK&quot; if all is well. Otherwise, you can debug using the messages that are printed out.

Now we can use it in a script to see if it works:
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

use ExampleModule;

hello_world();

exit;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Voilá! You have made a perl module.

=== Create a CPAN-style Perl module ===
CPAN-style modules have test suites and a way to build the module into the perl library. 

Download and install: Module::Starter from CPAN. Once this is installed, there will be a program called module-starter in your path.
To create a new module, do the following from the command line:
&lt;pre&gt;
module-starter --module=My::Module::Name, My::Other::Module::Name, --author=&quot;My Name&quot; --email=&quot;myemail@gmail.com&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

It will then create a set of directories for you, including some shell module files with starter POD documentation.
The perl modules will be inside the lib directory inside the directory that is created. These are the files to edit. You can put your tests for the modules into the &quot;t&quot; directory.
To install and build the module, you do the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;perl Makefile.PL
&gt;make
&gt;make test
&gt;sudo make install
&lt;/pre&gt;

==An Introduction==
Pixel art is anything drawn in the medium of computer pixels, usually created one pixel at a time.  Because of this, pixel drawings are usually done on a small scale to save time.

Isometric pixel art is the use of pixel art in an isometric viewpoint.  Alternate or exaggerated perspective is rarely used in isometric pixel art, as it complicates the drawing process.

[[Image:Ispa_b_4.jpg|frame|right|A cube in an isometric viewpoint]]

==Drawing Programs==
The are numerous computer graphic programs available today.  Because of the relatively simple process of creating pixel art, one need not be picky about what they use to create it.
*MS Paint will generally work well, though it lacks several features (translucency, layers) that more complex programs may provide
*Photoshop or other programs of the sort (Paintshop Pro, The Gimp) work well, though their line tools may use vectors or otherwise complicated methods of drawing. Many features (such as automatic anti-aliasing) must be turned off in order to pixel with these programs.
*Programs designed specifically for creating pixel art are also available, such as mtPaint, GrafX2, and ASEPRITE.
*Pixen is a great free app for Mac users.
*Pixelesque is a good pixel art editor for Android and Android-compatible systems(CyanogenMOD, Replicant). It is limited to art of 64x64 pixels or smaller.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two of the basic principles of combinatory logic in discrete mathematics are the Sum principle and the Multiplication principle.

The sum principle holds true in a given partitioned set X where partition Xi intersected with Xj is the empty set unless i is equal to j. The principle states that in such a partitioned set, the sum of the elements of each partition is equal to the number of elements in the set X.

The Purpose of this Wikibook is to create a cohesive fantasy world for use in the d20 role playing system. 

Eolian is an epic world of vast unending sky. Small floating islands are all that remain of a once whole planet, saved from total destruction by the last of man's magic. 

Ingenuity rather then magical will now rule. The sky is filled with the fruits of that ingenuity. Great clockwork flying machines and dirigibles connect the sundered, floating  land masses. Rope &amp; wood bridges stretching across expanses of endless sky are a part of daily life. Engineers create ever more wondrous clockwork devices.</text>

The word η γραβάτα (the tie) although it is Greek, it is not from a Greek root, but a loan from Italian. Perhaps by mentioning the cognate, a misconception may be created that there is a Greek root to cravat --[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 07:19, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
:I'll change the → symbols to ~, which hopefully will do a better job of suggesting the possible relationships (Greek from English, English from Greek, or both Greek and English from a different language such as Italian).--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 16:44, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

==χτενίζω==
Is χτενίζω the normal way to express the idea of combing the hair? It doesn't seem to be prominently featured in dictionaries, and a google search turned up a relatively low number of hits. Is there some other wasy of expressing this that's more idiomatic? The vocabulary is neeed in lesson 6 for the reading about the battle of Thermopylae.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 03:28, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

:Yes χτενίζω is the correct verb. However, the '''passive''' voice is used. Nobody will say ''χτενίζω τα μαλλιά μου'', they will always say ''χτενίζομαι''. The expression (''χτενίζω τα μαλλιά μου'') is lyrical and is used in cases when lyricism is needed. The passage from the Battle of Thermopylae is one of those cases because it describes an epic event and a little lyricism is fine. Although one could still say ''χτενίζονται'' instead of ''χτενίζουν τα μαλλιά τους'', it sounds a bit mundane when referring to their battle preparations.

:In common speech the verb χτενίζω in the active voice is used when combing someone else's hair. In most cases τα μαλλιά (the hair) is not mentioned at all and the actual expression is: ''Η μητέρα χτενίζει το παιδί'', the mother combs the child('s hair).

:A common expression between women is ''Πού χτενίζεσαι;'' which doesn't mean &quot;where do you comb your hair&quot; but &quot;where you're having your hair done&quot;.¨

==take off==
How do you say &quot;I take off my coat?&quot; Do you use εκβάλλω? --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 21:12, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
:Βγάζω το παλτό μου [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 23:03, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

==Prepositions used as suffixes==
I don't like the hyphens in this section. Is it OK if I take them back out? In my opinion, they make the words harder to read, not easier, and the reader might get the impression that the words were really written that way.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 00:09, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
:Changed it :-) You are right of course.--[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 00:32, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

==cognates for body parts==
Am I just confused about ζωή? My English dictionary says &quot;zoo&quot; is derived from a Greek word meaning both &quot;life,&quot; and &quot;animal.&quot; Is αυτί not actually cognate with &quot;audio?&quot;--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 01:15, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:Ζωή = Life, Ζώο(ν) = Animal.
Audio (lat.)= I hear, αφτί or αυτί (ear) &lt; ωτίον. I don't know if these are cognates, you will have to ask a linguist. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 01:59, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:The word meaning animal is ''ζώο'' not ''ζωή'', but since the root is the same I guess it can be used as cognate. ''Audio'' is Latin, but the Latin word is derived from Greek. Same with ''decapitate'' (from Latin:''capita''), which again is derived from Greek. I don't know though if the reader can make an immediate connection between ''decapitate'' and ''κεφάλι'', this is why I put a medical term using the exact Greek root. --[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 01:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
:It is a fallacy to believe that ''caput'' (not *''capita'') comes from κεφαλή, they are cousins. English ''two'', Greek ''δύο'', latin ''duo'' Russian ''dva'' etc. are all derived from a proto-Indoeuropean word dwo, etc. Only the father in ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'' thinks that everything is derived from Greek ;)  [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 01:59, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

::Ah, thanks for the info! I'm only using the ~ symbol in the book to mean that the words are related, not that one is derived from the other. Hm, &quot;cephalalgia&quot; isn't even in my dictionary. I'll just put the entries for brain and head together, so they'll relate it to &quot;encaphalitis,&quot; which I think it probably the most common English word that more closely resembles kefali.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 04:24, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

::: About cephalalgia see http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cephalalgia. By the way I have never claimed Greek is the proto-language, of course it came from the Indo-European mould just like Latin, far from me these things! Perhaps you've heard of a guy named [[w: Liakopoulos|Liakopoulos]]? :-)) --[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 07:21, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
:::: I'm not saying cephalalgia isn't a word, I'm just saying it's so obscure that it's not likely to be helpful to the reader.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 16:38, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

== Reading ==

The use of ''you'' as an indeterminate pronoun is not common in Greek. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 03:48, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Prepositions used with the genitive ==

This does not belong here because it is archaic and formal. In spite of the legalization of Dimotiki the actual language used today in Greece is a mixture of both. We should avoid teaching katharevousa features early on in this tutorial because they are only confusing and rarely used except for fixed expressions like εν τάξει, προς το παρόν, etc. Modern Greek is a language difficult to master because there is no standard. Every concept introduced has to be considered carefully. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 04:03, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
:I've cut out some of the material. I'm not completely clear on how εν τάξει and προς το παρόν fit in here, though, so it may be that this needs to be edited more. Do people today use the accusative with these pronouns? Only in speech?--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 05:58, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Dozen ==

Although the word ντουζίνα (=dozen) exists in Greek, it is very rarely used (it was actually incorporated in the Greek language from Greek immigrants to the US). Most Greeks will use δεκάδα (=ten).

e.g. Έχω δεκάδες άσπρα πουκάμισα (&quot;I have tens of white shirts&quot;, but actually the meaning is similar to &quot;I have dozens of white shirts&quot;)

Also very common is the expression &quot;καμιά δεκαριά&quot; which means &quot;about/around ten&quot; and its meaning is approximately that of &quot;a dozen&quot;. So regarding the example at the reading section, a Greek person would say ''Απ' το ίδιο κατάστημα θα αγοράσω και καμιά δεκαριά άσπρα πουκάμισα'' (&quot;From the same store I'll buy about ten white shirts&quot; but actually meaning &quot;From the same store I'll buy a dozen white shirts&quot;).

== Nouns in -έας ==

There are some masculine nouns ending in '''-έας''' which follow a bit different endings than the ones ending in '''-ας''', because the ancient greek equivalent original subject case had the ending '''-εύς'''. Direct transliteration into latin alphabet, especially on names of mythical names, produces the ending '''-eus''', e.g. Odyss'''eus'''. These words follow in Modern Greek more or less the same plural endings as in Ancient Greek.

Some examples are: ιερέας (priest), κουρέας (barber), Αχιλλέας (Achilles), Οδυσσέας (Odysseus)

ο ιερέας, του ιερέα, τον ιερέα

οι ιερείς, των ιερέων, τους ιερείς

Therefore the plural subject case (nominative) &quot;οι ιερέες&quot; is wrong, and also does not sound so well. I propose to mention this difference somewhere and change the legend of the priests' image. [[User:Christos|Christos]] 17:15, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== 1) Movie collection ==
Use the following data model:

[[Image:Xml5moviedm.png]]

:a. Using the IDREF method, create an XML schema to describe the illustrated data model. Include all of the attributes listed in the data model.
:b. Create an XML document that includes at least two movies and two cast members per movie. 
:c. Create a simple XML style sheet to present the information in HTML format. No tables or CSS are necessary.


== 2) Student/Class Directory ==

:a. Every class at a school can have many students, and each student can be registered to more than one class at a time.  Create an XML schema to capture this many-to-many relationship.  Be sure to include the class name, capacity, building number, building name, and room number.  Also include the student first/last name separately  and his or her grade for the class.
:b. Using the XML schema created in part a, create an XML document and an XML stylesheet.  You can make up your own data, but be sure to use at least three students for each class.

See dublincore for a set of standard metadata tags appliciable to anything :
  http://dublincore.org/

The w3c defines metadata here :
http://www.w3.org/Metadata/
 &quot;&quot;Metadata is machine understandable information for the web. The W3C Metadata Activity addressed the combined needs of several groups for a common framework to express assertions about information on the Web, and was superceded by the W3C Semantic Web Activity.&quot;

see 
http://www.w3.org/Metadata/Activity.html
&quot;&quot; Missing is a part of the Web which contains information about information - labeling, cataloging and descriptive information structured in such a way that allows Web pages to be properly searched and processed in particular by computer. In other words, what is now very much needed on the Web is  metadata. W3C's Metadata Activity is concerned with ways to model and encode metadata. A particular priority of W3C is to use the Web to document the meaning of the metadata. Our strong interest in metadata has prompted development of the Resource Description Framework (RDF ™) and its relative PICS ™ (Platform for Internet Content Selection). PICS is now complete; work on RDF continues.&quot;&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Abstract Syntax Trees are basically collections of facts in a program.
a set of statements that cantain declarations, types, values, onstants.

They can be compared to graphs of data in RDF.

Trees basically are an intermediate representation of the program facts.

I hope to create a better tree representation for compilers using RDF.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You've been making a lot of contributions to the Maple Story guide. No offense, but you make several major changes in many subjects, and it would be nice if you could check your sources a little. For example: it has been proven on many levels that Double Shot consistantly does more damage than AB, not only is DS more consistant, but it does more damage. (contrary to what Wizet puts on their homepage)

All in all, I thank you for your contributions however. I am glad that you are interested in the guide and are contributing to it :) I hope you don't take this as an offense, because I really don't mean it in that way.

Wikibooks in general also has a policy on no original research: you cannot really add your own opinion to a subject. While this is a bit touchy on video games (as most research is not published), if you see something &quot;incorrect&quot; in the subject make sure it is incorrect, and say something on the discussion page about it. Maybe I was wrong when I put something up, so yeah, change it to a &quot;correct&quot; form, but at least talk in the discussion page about it.

This was planned to  be done via Parrakeet and ParrotLanguage

http://parrakeet.joeysmith.com/ is gone,
http://pirate.versionhost.com/viewcvs.cgi/parrakeet/#dirlist

Obviously via Parrot it will be Possible to introspect better

Welcome to the wikibooks free text &quot;introductory physical science&quot;! This free text is built as a year-long course in 7th-9th grade basic physical science. This book is a resource and a basis for the course, which is meant to be taught in a laboratory setting. This text centers on student hands-on work as well as answering questions using critical thinking. This book encourages students to write their own methods for each piece of work before they are simply given the proper procedure. Making mistakes is part of all learning, and in the context of science, it is no less important. Therefore, this book will place more emphasis on the procedure, process, and the quality of performance rather that the actual answer.

===Resources===
Student resources for this book are located within the next several pages, and teacher resources are in the back. Student resources include websites, common methods, a basic glossary, and conversion tables. Teacher resources include materials lists, procedures, detailed charts of results found oupon completion of experiments, and much more.
===Use and Copyright===
This textbook is free and available for every person to use. The book can be used in any method described under the GNU free documentation licence. Distribution is unlimited, and is very much encouraged.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter One==
This Chapter is built to guide you through the most direct basics of what is contained in this course. To continue beyond this point you will need a &quot;lab notebook.&quot; This can be any type of small notebook that can contain all the parts of the experiments done in this course. In the first section you will learn all about the different methods used to record lab data and procedures. This knowledge can then be used to record all future experiments in your lab notebook. You will also need the following materials for this chapter

===Material List===
Notebook
Pencil
Graduated Cylinder (100 ml)
Balance (Equal arm, Tri Arm, not Electronic)
Mass Standards (If Using an Equal-Arm Balance)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Writing Laboratory Reports=
When a scientific experiment is performed, all its parts are carefully recorded, and all data gathered is diligently organized. In this section, we will discuss the basic elements of a laboratory report and how to effectively write for a scientific report.

==Title==
All labs must be named, and therefore the first part of a lab is its title and the number of the section.

==Purpose==
It is important to ask the question: why is this lab important? The purpose of a lab is a question to be answered.

Example: In a lab about the density of copper the purpose might read: what is the density of copper?

==Hypothesis==
If it is at all possible, it is important to record a hypothesis prior to performing the experiment. A hypothesis is an educated &quot;guess&quot; as to the outcome of the experiment. Creating a hypothesis allows us to see how far away from the truth our original ideas where (if anything but the truth).

==Materials==
Keep a detailed list of all materials used in the experiment. This will allow you to make sure nothing is missing when you actually construct and perform the experiment. Keeping a list such as this would allow another person to repeat your experiment in order to test your results. The ability of an experiment to be repeated is considered a good quality in science.

==Diagram==
It is important to sketch a small diagram of all materials used in the experiment to demonstrate how they will be set up when the experiment is performed.

==Procedure==
This is possibly the most important section of all. The procedure is a list of numbered instructions that tell how an experiment is done. The procedure should be clear, concise, and very easy to read. The procedure steps should be simple. Each step should be about a sentence in length. The procedure in each experiment should be written so that a person who has little or no knowledge of science or of the experiment you are performing could do it with no preparation.

==Data==
Data is the product of following an experiment's procedure. Data is most frequently collected in tables at first because they are easy to use and they present data in an easily recognizable format. A data table has several parts. In lesson 1.2 we will talk about the use of data tables and the collection of data.

==Graphs and Charts==
Graphs and charts are a more visual way of representing data. We will talk about different types of Charts and Graphs in chapter 1.4.

==Conclusion==
The conclusion is a short paragraph that discusses the outcome of the lab, what was gained from the lab, and what could be done differently and/or changed. The conclusion reviews the procedure and attempts to answer the purpose question. If no answer can be reached, then explain why the purpose question was not answered and explain what further work might answer it.

=Vocabulary and Questions=
* '''Labs''' are experiments done in a laboratory environment.
* '''Data''' is the information gained from an experiment.
* '''Tables''' are a graphic way of organizing data, also known as a '''chart'''.
* '''Graphs''' are another way of representing data, but instead of using words it uses pictures.
* '''Hypothesis''' is an educated guess as to what may happen when the experiment is performed.

==Covering The Reading==
# What part of the experiment would you suggest changes to the procedure?
# Which section would you collect data in?
# What does the word '''lab''' denote?
# When writing a lab procedure what should be remembered about the instructions?
# If you have a lab that is about the solubility of citric acid what would be a valid purpose?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The SI System==
&quot;SI&quot; or &quot;System International&quot; is the worldwide (excepting the US and Liberia) system of measurement. This system includes units of each dimension, but its defining feature is its basis on the number 10. Old english units (also known as the customary system) where based on units of 12 which, although the system stood for centuries, where not as effective as the current SI measurements. The SI system is sometimes also known as the &quot;Metric&quot; system. Below are the common units within the SI system.

==Units==
===Length, Width, Height===
mm - millimetre: equal to .001 metres

cm - centimetre: equal to .01 metres

m - metre: one metre

hm - hectometre: equal to 100 metres

km - kilometre: equal to 1000 metres

===Area===
cm^2 - square centimetres: equal to a square with length and width of 1cm

km^2 - square kilometres: equal to a square with length and width of 1km

===Volume===
cm^3 - cubic cetimetres: equal to a cube with length, width, and height of 1cm

mL - millilitre: .001 liters

cL - centilitre: .01 liters

dL - decilitre

L - litre: one liter: equal to one cubic decimetre

daL - decaliter: 10 liters

hL - hecto litres: 100 liters

===Mass===
mg - miligram .001 gram

cg - centigram .01 gram

g- gram: one gram

dag - decagram: 10 grams

hg - hecto gram: 100 grams

kg - kilo gram: 1000 grams

==The Common Conversions==
The common system has much different values and uses different terminology for different measurements. Below are the differences between the two systems discussed in depth. Only measurements representing the same physical quantities con be &quot;converted&quot;.  

===Mass vs. Weight===
Where the SI system uses Mass, the Common System uses Weight. The two words mean different things. Weight is the effect of the force of gravity on an object's mass. Although weight depends on mass, it is not the same thing as mass. Mass is the amount of matter (material) that exists within an object (we will discuss matter in depth in chapter 1.6). Mass cannot be &quot;converted&quot; to weight, but rather a calculation involving Newton's Second Law of Motion must be used. It is, however, common practice to use the conversions listed below based on the standard acceleration due to gravity here on the earth. This should be further explored when studying motion and forces. 

===Volume===
Volume is very different between the common and SI systems. In the common system the standard units for volume were the flow ounce and the pint. The two have no basis in the SI system and are only converted by sheer mathematical terms. The conversion factors can be found below.

===Conversions===
====Mass====
1 kilogram = 2.2 pound

1 pound =  0.45 kilograms

====Volume====
1 Liter = 33.81 fluid ounces
1 fluid ounce = .029 liters

1 Liter = 2.11 pints

=Vocabulary and Questions=
* '''Length''' is the distance from a given point A to a given point B
* '''Weight''' is the measure of the effect that gravity has on an object
* '''Mass''' is the amount of matter in a given object
* '''Volume''' is the amount of space an object takes up
* '''Conversion''' is the method by which units in one system are measured against those in another

==Covering The Reading==
# Based on your observations, what do the following prefixes mean? kilo, deca, deci, milli, centi, hecto
# What does SI stand for?
# What country did the metric system originate in?
# How many pints are in a liter?
# What number are SI sytem units based on?

==Critical Thinking==
# Using the 

==Exploration==
# Collect containers from around your house check the units on their labels, construct a table that shows the conversions between the customary and metric units.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Matter And Energy=
Matter and Energy are the two components of our universe. This means that everything is either matter or energy. Matter is percived as physical objects, while energy is the forces that act upon and in conjunction with the matter in the universe.

=Matter=
'''Noun'''

'''matter''' (uncountable and countable; plural: matters)

# The basic structural component of the universe. Matter always consists of a mass and a volume, and contains its mass times the speed of light squared in total energy stored.
# A kind of substance.


Matter represents the physical objects in the universe. Matter, although it appears and acts in ways that are far different from energy, is actually captured energy itself. This can be proven when one looks very closely at the structure of matter that begins with a very, very small component.
==Atoms==
Matter begins with atoms. Atoms are the '''Building Blocks''' of everything. An atom is made up of several even smaller parts. What makes atoms matter, and every piece below it energy is that the electrons and nucleus are held together by both the &quot;electromagnetic force&quot; and '''nuclear force'''. Nuclear force is the force that holds all the pieces of the atom together, it works because of the opposite properties of the different pieces of an atom.

==Pieces of an Atom==

===Protons===
'''Protons''' are very small particles that have a positive electric charge. The protons within an atom reside within the '''nucleus'''. The number of protons is always equal to the number of '''electrons''' within an atom. Proton count cannot be changed excepting when the atom is placed under very special conditions within a special scientific apparatus called a '''supercollider''' or an '''atom smasher'''.

===Neutrons===
'''Neutrons''' are tiny particles that have a neutral electric charge. These particles reside inside the '''nucleus'''. '''Neutrons''' do not effect the '''element''' of the atom, but they may affect the '''isotope''' of the element

===Electrons===
'''Electrons''' are particles that are hundreds of times smaller than '''protons''' and '''neutrons'''. The electrons reside within the '''electron cloud''' which surrounds the '''nucleus''' . The '''electrons''' within the '''electron cloud''' travel at different distances from the '''atomic wall''' these levels are called shells. The number of electrons within a shell can be determined with the formula 2n^2 or 2 times the number of the shell to the second power. Therefore the first shell holds 2 electrons, the second holds 8, and the third holds 18.

===Nucleus===
The '''Nucleus''' of an atom is the center, where the '''protons''' and '''neutrons''' exist. The '''nucleus''' contains 99% of the mass of the atom.

==Mass==
Mass is the Standard SI system measurement of how much '''matter''' an object contains. The standard unit for mass in general terms is the '''gram'''.

=Energy=


'''Noun'''
'''energy''' (plural energies)

# The impetus behind all motion and all activity.
# The capacity of an entity to do work.
# (physics) A quantity that denotes the ability to do work and is measured in a unit dimensioned in mass × distance²/time² (ML²/T²) or the equivalent.

Energy is the ability to cause change or to do work. Energy comes in many, many forms; some of the most common forms we experience on earth are: heat, light, and movement. Energy is separated into two different categories: Potential and Kinetic.

==Types of Energy==
===Potential===
Potential energy is energy that is &quot;stored&quot; i.e. not being used. This can mean any type of energy that is not being spent. For example, a book that is carried to the top of a tower has potential energy; which was put into the object when it was carried to the top of the tower. It has potential energy because it is acting against gravity. In physics, every action has an equal and opposite re-action. The action wAS the book being elevated to the top of the tower. And the re-action would be the book falling or otherwise descending to the ground. This is only one type of potential energy, potential energy can exist in many states such as:
* Food (broken down into simple components and expended by respiration)
* Electric Current (stored in batteries, or generators)
* A Spring (mechanical devices, when expanded or contracted too far)

===Kinetic===
Kinetic energy is energy that is in use. Kinetic energy is the energy that radiates, moves, shines, and heats. This type of energy is very common in our universe. Kinetic energy is very, very changeable; all its forms are interchangeable. As shown below
* Motion ----&gt; Heat (through conduction)
* Heat ----&gt; Motion (through convection)
* Light ----&gt; Heat (through radiation)

====Types of Kinetic Energy====
* '''Motion''' is the type of kinetic energy that moves physical objects through space

* '''Heat''' is the type of kinetic energy that moves the molecules of a physical object. This causes the objects temperature to rise.

* '''Light''' is the type of energy that radiates through space in waves and beams. Light is categorized into a spectrum. Visible light is the light we can see reflected off of objects, while other types of light such as x-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves cause radiation.

=Vocabulary and Questions=
* '''Temperature''' is the average amount of kinetic energy that a group of molecules or atoms has because of random movement of the molecules.

* '''Heat''' is the total amount of kinetic energy that a group of molecules has because of the random movement of the molecules.

* '''Thermodynamics''' is the branch of science dealing with energy in the universe and the interaction of that energy with physical objects. We will talk more about '''Thermodynamics''' later.

* '''Conduction''' is the transfer of kinetic energy from one object to another through direct contact.

* '''Convection''' is the transfer of kinetic energy by currents within a fluid.

* '''Radiation''' is the transfer of kinetic energy through space.

=Section Review=
====Covering The Reading====
# Describe matter and energy in your own words
# Define the parts of an atom and their purpose in the atom
# What is an Element?
# How are matter and energy related?
# Which is the smallest piece of an atom?
# Which part of the atom determines the atomic number?
# Which type of energy can cause motion?
# Which type of energy transfer moves kinetic energy through liquids?

====Critical Thinking====
# Suppose that you are using a heat lamp in your bathroom, what is the method by which the kinetic energy it generates is transferred through space?
# If a proton has a weight of 1unit and an electron has a weight of .007 units than how much does an atom of hydrogen with 3 neutrons weigh?

====Exploration====
1) Look at the periodic table of the elements
* What element has atomic number one
* What elements fall into the noble gas set? 

2) Draw a diagram of an atom include the following
* Nucleus with
** Protons
** Neutrons
* Electron shell With
** The correct number of electrons
** The electrons in their appropriate shells

      <text xml:space="preserve">SilverScheme is a Scheme like OO language that uses introspection heavily. The rather unedited doc is here: [[Introspector/LanguageTools/SilverScheme/Doc]]. The ontology used is here: [[Introspector/LanguageTools/SilverScheme/Ontology]].


In Silverscheme the class system is implemented on top of the prototype system. The prototype system is pretty easy: every object is a (changed) copy of another object. The object that it's a copy of is it's prototype.

A few important concepts:

    * Extending: copying an object and entering the scope of the new object to add/change/delete some stuff. Usually done with (define new-obj (old-obj.extend)).
    * Inheriting: if object A extends object B and the field C in A is the same as the field C in B then A is said to have inherited C from B. 


SilverScheme will have a built-in KnowledgeInterchangeFormat reasoner for logic programming.

Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a way of representing knowledge in computers. It's also a quite simple logic language that's useful for reasoning about knowledge. At the moment KIF resources are rather spread across the web, here are a few links:

    * http://www.csee.umbc.edu/kse/kif/
    * http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/

[[Introspector/KifTutorial]]

Ideas for libraries and tools go at [[Introspector/LanguageTools/SilverScheme/Projects]].



A list of projects that will be needed to support SilverScheme and/or make it more fun.

Needed:

    * A simple make system.
    * Interface to a GUI toolkit (preferably FOX, good test for the C++ invocation mechanism)
Fun:
    * SilverSchemeSourcery 


Usually languages have small examples that aren't really fun. SilverScheme has a big fun example however, a full blown board/card game named Sourcery. Sourcery will be a good example of the logic capabilities of SilverScheme since it will use KIF to determine what is allowed and what not in a dynamic way.

==1. Draw the food pyramid guide. List the number of servings required from each group per day. Why is it important to eat a balanced diet?==
The food pyramid guide is updated and published by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  They replaced the food pyramid with &quot;MyPlate&quot; in 2011.  The food pyramid is no longer promulgated by the U.S. government.
If you wish to continue teaching the food pyramid concept, you could use the Loma Linda University Vegetarian Food Pyramid instead.  Both are shown below:
{|border=0
|-
|[[File:USDA MyPlate green.svg|thumb|left|400px|2011 Version of the USDA nutrition guide]]
|[[File:Loma Linda University Vegetarian Food Pyramid.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Loma Linda University Vegetarian Food Pyramid]]
|}
{{clear}}

==2. Explain the difference between the following:==
The prefix ''lacto'' means ''milk'', and can be found in words such as ''lactose'' (a chemical found in milk).

The prefix ''ovo'' means ''egg'', and can be found in words such as ''oval'' (which means ''egg-shaped'').

These prefixes are used to describe the exceptions to a vegetarian diet as follows:

===a. Lacto-ovo vegetarian===
A lacto-ovo vegetarian is a person who eats no animal products (such as meat) except for milk (and milk products such as cheese, ice cream, and yogurt), and eggs.
===b. Ovo vegetarian===
An ovo vegetarian is a person who eats no animal products (not meat and not milk) except for eggs.
===c. Vegan vegetarian===
A vegan is a vegetarian who eats no animal products at all.

==3. Plan a two-day menu, containing a balanced lacto-ovo vegetarian diet utilizing the food pyramid guide.==
To do this using the current version of the USDA food pyramid, you must first go to [http://choosemyplate.gov ChooseMyPlate.gov] and enter the Pathfinder's profile (age, sex, and physical activity).  This will tell you how much of each food category the Pathfinder should eat.

The values in the table below are for children who are physically active for 60 minutes or more per day.  Use the USDA website for adults and less active children.

==4. What is another name for Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?==
'''Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also known as '''thiamine.'''  Beriberi is disease cause by a vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.

'''Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also known as '''riboflavin.'''  It is required for red blood cell formation.

==5. List at least three significant food sources of the following nutrients:==
*'''a. Vitamin C:''' Citrus fruits (lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit), tomatoes, and potatoes are good common sources of vitamin C. Other foods that are good sources of vitamin C include papaya, broccoli, brussels sprouts, black currants, strawberries, cauliflower, spinach, cantaloupe, and kiwifruit. Also, cranberries and red peppers are good sources of the vitamin.

*'''b. Vitamin A:''' Milk and eggs are both animal sources of vitamin A.  Carrots and spinach are both good plant sources of vitamin A.

*'''c. Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:'''  Good sources of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; include whole grains (wheat, oats, rice, etc.), apricots, pineapples, legumes, turnip greens, and pistachio nuts.

*'''d. Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''' Milk, cheese, leafy green vegetables, liver, yeast, almonds and mature soybeans are good sources of Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but exposure to light will destroy the riboflavin in these natural sources. 

*'''e. Iron:''' Good sources of dietary iron include meat, fish, poultry, lentils, beans, leaf vegetables, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed pea, strawberries and farina.

*'''f. Calcium:''' Dairy products, such as milk and cheese, are a well known source of calcium. However, some individuals are allergic to dairy and even more people, particularly those of non-European descent, are lactose-intolerant, leaving them unable to consume dairy. Fortunately, many other good sources of calcium exist. This includes nuts and seeds (like almonds and sesame), beans; whole wheat; collard greens; okra; rutabaga; broccoli; and fortified products such as orange juice and bread.

==6. Why is it important to drink plenty of water every day? How much water should you drink every day?==
It is important to drink plenty of water so that you do not get dehydrated.  Your body needs water to help eliminate waste and to keep the cells in the body hydrated.

Here are some ways to increase your water intake:

* Drink a glass of water when you first get up in the morning, in the evening when you get home, and again before you go to bed at night.
* Keep a bottle of water beside your desk at work. Drink often throughout the day.
* Drink before, during, and after any physical activity, such as walking, hiking, or biking.
* Carry water with you when you travel. Drink often when flying, as the cabin air is very dry.
* If your water doesn’t taste good, add a lemon or lime slice to improve the flavor. You can filter your water and keep a pitcher in the fridge. Or, buy bottled water if the improved taste helps you drink more.

You should drink water whenever you are thirsty.  A persistent myth is that a person needs to drink 8 eight ounce glasses of water every day.  While following this rule will cause no harm, it is completely unsupported by scientific evidence {{ref|snopes}} {{ref|intelihealth}}.  A person should replace the same amount of water he or she loses in a day.  Water is lost through urination, bowel elimination, sweating, and breathing.  Remember that drinking is not the only way to replace lost water: food contains a lot of water, and your body can absorb water through the skin.  Again, the general rule is to drink water whenever you are thirsty or whenever you want some.

==7. Name three common diseases that can be controlled by diet.==
'''Diabetes:''' The most important forms of diabetes are due to decreased or the complete absence of the production of insulin (type 1 diabetes), or decreased sensitivity of body tissues to insulin (type 2 diabetes, the more common form). The former requires insulin injections for survival; the latter is generally managed with diet, weight reduction and exercise in about 20% of cases, though the majority require these strategies plus oral medication (insulin is used if the tablets are ineffective).

'''Cardiovascular Disease:''' Attempts to prevent cardiovascular disease take the form of modifying risk factors. Some, such as gender, age, and family history, cannot be modified. Smoking cessation (or abstinence) is one of the most effective and easily modifiable changes. Also important is a low-fat, low-calorie diet, which helps one to maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI) and preventing obesity. Regular cardiovascular exercise (aerobic exercise) complements the healthful eating habits. Sometimes, the combination of diet and exercise will improve lipoprotein (cholesterol) levels; if not, a physician may prescribe &quot;cholesterol-lowering&quot; drugs, such as the statins.  Treatment of cardiovascular disease depends on the specific form of the disease in each patient, but effective treatment always includes preventative lifestyle changes discussed above. Medications, such as blood pressure reducing medications, aspirin and other treatments may be involved.

'''Cancer:''' The consensus on diet and cancer is that obesity increases the risk of developing cancer. Particular dietary practices often explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries (e.g. gastric cancer is more common in Japan, while colon cancer is more common in the United States). Studies have shown that immigrants develop the risk of their new country, suggesting a link between diet and cancer rather than a genetic basis.

==8. What is the difference between whole wheat flour and white flour, and which one has the higher nutritive value?==

The two biggest differences between white flour and whole wheat are the processing and the nutritional value. Whole wheat flour has the higher nutritive value.

Flour is made from wheat berries. The wheat berry is made up of the bran, the germ and the endosperm. All parts are filled with nutrients and are used in whole wheat flour. 

White flour on the other hand, uses only the endosperm - the starchy inner layer. There are a total of 30 nutrients present in whole wheat flour that are missing in white flour. The nutritional difference is immense and has measurable impact on our health. 

The fiber content of whole wheat bread has several health benefits. 

Fiber helps the digestive system. It also creates a 'full' 
sensation and thus can help with weight control. Research has 
been conducted by Harvard and other organizations that shows men 
and women who eat high-fiber foods are less likely to have heart attacks and 
strokes as compared to those who don't. 

There is also an increased risk of diabetes in children who eat 
refined white flour - a risk that has been proven by the increase 
in cases of childhood diabetes.

==9. What does RDA stand for? What does it mean?==
'''Recommended Dietary Allowance''' (RDA) is the daily dietary intake level of a nutrient that is considered sufficient to meet the requirements of nearly all (97-98%) healthy individuals in each life-stage and gender group. The RDAs are established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the (US) National Academy of Sciences.

==10. Why is it important not to take excessive amounts of some vitamins and minerals?==

Fat-soluble vitamins may be stored in the body and can cause toxicity when taken in excess.  Water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body, with the exception of Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, which is stored in the liver.

Some of the most common causes of vitamin poisoning are vitamins A, B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, certain vitamins do not produce toxicity in excess levels: vitamin C has been used in clinical trials in dosages over 100,000 mg — over 1000 times the daily recommended intake — without ill effects.

Excess doses of mineral supplements can also lead to poisoning. Either or both of vitamin poisoning and mineral supplement poisoning can occur due to excessive intake of multivitamin supplements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Data=
Data is information gathered from experimentation. Data can be any type of info that relates to the experiment. Data is usually classified as one of the following types.
==Qualitative==
Qualitative data is data that deals with the qualities of the things obseved. Qualitative data records such things as:
* Color
* Shape
* Texture
* Opacity
* Odor
* Sound

==Quantitative==
Quantitative data is data that records a number that represents a measurement. Quantitative data is usually a number followed by a label that describes which type of measurement it is. Quantitative data includes measurements such as:
* Length
* Mass
* Volume
* Density
* Concentration
* Solubility

=Organizing Data=
Data is most useful in science when it is organized into a reconizable format. Formatting allows very fast reading and easy use in drawing conclusion.

==Tables and Charts==
Tables are graphical ways of representing data.  Data represented in tables can be organized to allow ease of access and to permit faster reading.  For example, if one was testing tab water contamination, you would have columns of various contaminants and rows for the location from which the water was obtained.  Below is an example of a table:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!width=&quot;50&quot;|Object
!width=&quot;90&quot;|Color
!width=&quot;90&quot;|Material
|-
|Bar
|Mettallic
|Iron
|-
|Stick
|Brown
|Wood
|}
As can be seen from the table, it is possible to organize data in such a way as to allow fast reading with minimal work.  Tables are more useful for larger sets of data and this was just an example.

== I love the name ==

I should have dropped a line to you earlier.  This is a cool user name, and throws convention and common preconceptions about new users to the wind.  I love to see some fresh blood come in here and stir the pot up, so to say, and it will make for some interesting discussions.

BTW, Welcome to Wikibooks.  I hope you have better success in the future than what apparently your book [[How To Ride The Bus]].  When you copied the content over to the new title, I ended up turning the old title into a redirect.  This is nothing personal against you, but simply a way to inform everybody where the content ended up at.  I tried to preserve all of the changes that you made after the page move.  Moving pages to avoid deletion is generally frowned upon and is more likely to increase the potential of getting deleted.

I should have removed the VfD right after it started.  I've done that two a couple other books, but I've also had quite a bit of flack from other Wikibooks regulars because of that.  Apprarently Derbeth doesn't believe in waiting to see a Wikibook get started to see just where it might go.  He has done a lot of good for Wikibooks, however, so don't consider him to be the spawn of the Devil.  And his is just one opinion out of many as well anyway, and no permanent damage has been done to your book (yet).

It is too bad that you want to assert non-GFDL copyright status on the book.  While from a strictly legal standpoint I don't think you can do that, if you don't want the content on Wikibooks I can understand, particularly given the hostile reaction to the book.  There is no reason to keep the content here if you don't want it on Wikibooks.  It is an interesting reaction to the community BTW, and one that I support as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:25, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

:My meandering thoughts: Thank You Mr. Rob. The alias started out with me wondering, perhaps I could register my static IP address as a user; I tried [[user:72.57.8.215X]] but didn't like the X. You hit did however hit the spot. I tend, as you may have observed from the title of my first article, to rock the boat a little and add controversial material. I am an artist after all. Anyway I took 72.57.8.2I5 because so I could remember my close link and try to get credit for my previous edits as IP:72.57.8.215  To be perfectly honest, I like the idea of wikibooks. I wish however that it would be all fun and fun! Where people could come along and say... hmm.. I don't really know what I can add to that but that's interesting. Maybe I should look into it. Instead of saying... I don't really know what I can add into that. Let's delete it! I also didn't want to remove the VfD from fear that wikibookians would be mad. But I couldn't really stand waiting letting this issue go on. I have so many idea for building the book. When I'm on wikibooks, it just seems so much easier write an article then if I did it in my word editor. It seems easier to make references, footnotes, etc... I actually want the book to be out there. But you know what. Once it's out there I'm probably going to bang myself on the head and say &quot;I should have just wrote it in word.&quot; I keep it in the dark files, encrypted, as one of those never to publish idea from fear of being put into jail, labeled crazy, and having people shoot the messenger. Well, I think I should have expected some sort of protest. But I didn't expect this big of a pot stir. Perhaps this is an issue that we should discuss at the deletion policy page. Interesting enough, I'm sure there will be more similar nominations. I have a lot more documentation and scribbles here at home of the original book concept. I also wonder about the GFDL licence?  If I could claim that? No matter the case. I have plenty of ideas. The problem with this one article is that I've taken it personal. This policy stuff, well until your pep talk, Isn't really motivating. As soon as you add rules you restrict creativity. The Art of writing! At the moment, to contribute anymore to this book as I would do on my regular word editor. 

b.t.w.: I would have thought that after changing the name we would have a better leg to stand on!! But... well anyway! This is such a mess, with red-tap, I feel like I'm in an episode of watching the [[w:OJ Simpson]] trial. I just hope this case is fairly judged.  

p.s: I'm at the point where I'm obviously becoming indifferent if the article is deleted or not. But rest assure, the world is watching... I will remember.. And for some reason I'm feeling a little bitter now. The reason being that this nomination is still there and that I'm evaluating my self existence right now and the meaning of wikibooks within this thing of mine called life! Thank you for the kind words. And I'm sure Derbeth did not intend to do this entire process as an evil act. But that fact that no is doing anything about it doesn't seems send happy feelings into my consciousness. We'll just have to see what happens and if I start fixing up the article again or not. Thank you again for listening. Perhaps it would be wise to further this dicussion into some sort of proposed rule? (as I've noticed you've done already with some issues, elaborated into a nice article in a sub-page within your user page) ;) --[[User:72.57.8.2I5|72.57.8.2I5]] 00:58, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

:As an addeed thought... I hope you continue to stay active.  I am trying to encourage new users on Wikibooks, particuarly those who have come here just because they like the idea of Wikibooks and havn't necessarily started out on Wikipedia.  Discussion like this have happened before, and I even had a Wikibook that was slapped with a VfD only 18 hours after I started the content.  This killed the early momentum in getting it going, and squashed even my own contributions to instead have to deal with the stupid VfD (that was rejected by the community on top of the whole thing).  I've become somewhat of a Wikimedia lawyer, as long as a court of opinion can be maintained and not changed through executive decrees.  See the Wikimania discussion for what IMHO is an abuse of power by those &quot;in charge&quot; at the Wikimedia Foundation.  My attitude is to give as much support to the new users, and have mild contempt for the veterans... especially if they are throwing their weight around.  To be a Wikimedia veteran you need to have a fairly thick skin anyway, so a litle heated verbage usually goes off each other's backs.

I don't think your rewording will be enough. It's still too similar to the original work and will probably be just as much a copyvio as it is now. [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 02:32, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

Thank you for your honest reply. I trust your judgement. It would however be nice to have a second opinion. Hence... My reply can also be found on the delete discusion...

I guess you read through my first 4 translations?  You obviously have a copy of the original work somewhere. Is this a book that looks like this,ie. similar format? If we reword it shouldn't it be okay?  The only trouble I see is if the entire article is base on one source... I'm guessing that's what you mean right. We would need more sources to diversify and less chances of a general format copyvio? --[[User:72.57.8.2I5|72.57.8.2I5]] 02:43, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called 72.57.8.2I5. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name 72.57.8.2I5~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">JavaBeansIntrospector? http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/beans/Introspector.html

    The Introspector class provides a standard way for tools to learn about 
    the properties, events, and methods supported by a target Java Bean.

    For each of those three kinds of information, the Introspector will separately
    analyze the bean's class and superclasses looking for either explicit or 
    implicit information and use that information to build a BeanInfo object 
    that comprehensively describes the target bean.

    For each class &quot;Foo&quot;, explicit information may be available if 
    there exists a corresponding &quot;FooBeanInfo&quot; class that provides 
    a non-null value when queried for the information. We first look 
    for the BeanInfo class by taking the full package-qualified name 
    of the target bean class and appending &quot;BeanInfo&quot; to form a new 
    class name. If this fails, then we take the final classname 
    component of this name, and look for that class in each of 
    the packages specified in the BeanInfo package search path.

    Thus for a class such as &quot;sun.xyz.OurButton&quot; we would first look for 
    a BeanInfo class called &quot;sun.xyz.OurButtonBeanInfo&quot; and if that failed 
    we'd look in each package in the BeanInfo search path for an 
    OurButtonBeanInfo class. With the default search path, 
    this would mean looking for &quot;sun.beans.infos.OurButtonBeanInfo&quot;.

    If a class provides explicit BeanInfo about itself then 
    we add that to the BeanInfo information we obtained from
    analyzing any derived classes, but we regard the explicit
    information as being definitive for the current class and
    its base classes, and do not proceed any further up the 
    superclass chain.

    If we don't find explicit BeanInfo on a class, 
    we use low-level reflection to study the methods of the class 
    and apply standard design patterns to identify 
    property accessors, event sources, or public methods. 
    We then proceed to analyze the class's superclass 
    and add in the information from it 
    (and possibly on up the superclass chain).

    For more information about introspection and design patterns, 
    please consult the JavaBeans specification.

-- Objects --

Everything in SilverScheme is an object. An object consists of two parts: a code
section and an field list. The code section may contain a lambda expression.
The field list is basically a hash with unique keys, the values refer to
other objects.

-- Scope --

Scope is complicated. SilverScheme, like any modern LISP has lexical scope (block
scope). To understand scope in SilverScheme a little knowledge of the syntax is
required.

Every definition is basically a (define), lambda list is (name value . forms).
The forms are evaluated in the scope of the (newly created) object. For example
(define a 10 (define b 20)) will create a new object a with value 10 and with an
attribute b with value 20. Thus a.b = 20 .

When you say (define a.b 30) you define in the current scope a new binding for
symbol b as field of object a. An example demonstrates some things:
(define a 10
 (define b 20))
(define-ref c a) ;c is an alias for a
(define d a) ;d is a copy of a
(define a.b 30)
a.b = 30
c.b = 30
d.b = 20

Thus (define a.b value) doesn't set a.b, but it sets the binding of symbol b to
object a.

Wow, I've finally managed to get scope working decently :-).

For your understanding here are a few simple facts:
* An object is in a box, a memory location.
* A field points to a box.
* The object id is actually the box id.
* The set! function changes the object in a box.
* The define function makes a field point to a different box.

-- Pass-by-reference, pass-by-value --

The general rule of SilverScheme is that function arguments are passed by
reference. However two basic functions are an exception on this. Arguments to
(define) are passed by value, (define-ref) is the normal reference one, thus
(define) can be seens as (define-ref), but with arg.copy done for each argument.

The let construct also needs pass-by-value to keep consistent with define (and
to avoid easily maked hard to find bugs). To indicate reference one must put
:ref before the clause. For example:
(let ((a 10) ;a is by-value
      :ref (b 20)) ;b is by-ref
      __some_code__)

Granted, assigning by reference to a literal is stupid (literals are constant),
but this demonstrates the principle.

Copies in SilverScheme (pass-by-value creates copies) use copy-on-write. I guess
you already know how copy-on-write works.

-- Metadata --

SilverScheme is designed around the concept that: a) code should be free, in all
it's forms and b) that if you don't do that somebody else will ;-). All
information about an object is accessible through it's metadata interface. The
metadata interface consists of roughly two parts: documentation contributed by
the user and information gathered by the interpreter.

The meta field is also where all attributes are stored. An attribute in
SilverScheme is simply an object. The user can thus easily define attributes.

There are thus roughly three types of objects of metadata: the documentation,
the reflection info and custom attributes. The documentation is placed into the
obj.documentation field in hash form. Both reflection and custom attributes go
into obj.meta in normal object form.

SilverScheme supports documentation through the Argentum [1]
scheme. Argentum is the POD of SilverScheme. Documentation can be put in
doc comments of the form ;...\n and #!! ... !# (multi-line). Doc
comments use a syntax similar to YAML.

Attributes can be easily created using (define meta.attrname value).

-- Classes --

SilverScheme has a weird way of implementing classes. The instance of a class is
defined as a field of that class named 'prototype'. The constructor then does
(create-instance), (create-instance) adds the needed class information to a copy
of the prototype.

Note that classes can access private members of their prototypes and vice versa.

To access the class of an object you can use the obj.class field (or the
obj.meta.class field).

An example of a simple class:
(define-class Foo (Object Bar) ;;Foo inherits from Object
                               ;;and promises to implement
                               ;;the public interface of Bar
  (define-prototype ;;(define prototype) doesn't work!
    (define baz 10)))

-- Inheritance --

SilverScheme does not support multiple inheritance. Instead it has interface
inheritance and mixins (later more about that). Every class after the first is
interface inherited. Interface inheritance means that a class only inherits from
the parent in name, not in code (aka no code is copied).

Note that it's not possible to inherit from a non-class. This is to keep the
class mechanism simple.

-- Mixins --

SilverScheme uses mixins to do what other languages do with multiple inheritance. A
mixin is an object that has fields marked with the (mixin) attribute. The object
can also be marked with the (full-mixin) attribute, essentially giving all it's
fields the mixin attributes.

When an object has the (use-mixin __mixin_name__) attribute it copies the source
code of the mixin fields in the mixin and evaluates them in the current scope.
Kinda like how Ruby does it. This is used for example to give objects the &lt;, &lt;=,
=, etc functions for free if they have the &lt;=&gt; function and say (use-mixin
Comparable).

-- Domains --

SilverScheme provides some powerful tools to make programming without bugs easier.
The most important one is domains. A domain is a function that takes one
argument, and checks if that argument is in the domain. If so nothing happens,
if not an Domain-Violation-Error is thrown. Domains have three main uses:
checking variables, enforcing preconditions, enforcing postconditions.

To check a variable against a domain one simply uses the (domain) self-applying
attribute (most attributes are self-applying btw). For example:
(define a 5 ;domain: 0 &lt; a &lt; 5
  (domain (\ (value) (and (&gt; value 0)
                          (&lt; value 11)))))

The domain function accepts a few keywords after the lambda expression:
:read -- Check the domain whenever the variable contents are read.
:write -- Check the domain whenever the variable contents are written.

The keywords may be used both.

By default only :write is on. The domain-default-operation environment variable
is used to set the default to a different value.

To check a preconditions replace the argument name with (argument-name domain):
(\ ((a (\ (value) ;domain: a &gt; 0
        (&gt; a 0))))
    ...)

The domain may be in a variable (useful for often used domains).

Another way to do preconditions is to use the (pre-condition __arg_name__
__domain__) attribute. The advantage of the attribute is that you can use it
conditionally (for example in a testing situation, but not in production use)

To check a postcondition use the (post-condition) attribute. For example:
(define simple-add
 (\ (a b)
  (+ a b))
 (post-domain (\ (value) (&gt; value 0))))

The Argentum documentation extractor (agdoc) also extracts domains, so using
them is a good way to show what the pre- and postconditions are.

-- owner, parent, super --

In a.b object defined as (define a 10 (define b 20)) a owns object b since b was
defined by object a. Object b has full access to the private members of object
a. For object b object a is known by as 'owner'. The variable 'owner' always
points to the owner of an object.

The parent of an object is the prototype of the superclass.

The super variable refers to parent.__name_of_this_function__ .

-- call/cc, call/tf, call/rf --

SilverScheme call/cc (call-with-current-continuation) is pretty much like the
standard Scheme call/cc. However it has some more argument passing power. When
you do (call/cc (\ (b) (b 10 20))) then the resulting continuation has a field
values which contains a list of the values passed to it. When you invoke the
continuation with the arguments the arguments are given as the result of the
break function, always as a list.

The call/tf (call-with-throw-function) function is like the Guile catch
function. It takes one argument, a lambda list with one parameter, the throw
function. When the throw function is invoked a non-local exit is done to the
call/tf, like with call/cc, however there is no return. The arguments passed to
the throw function are returned by (call/tf) as a list in the second element of
a list (the first element if #t if no non-local exit occurred and #f otherwise).

The call/rf function is similar. However it doesn't signal success or failure
and returns the list directly (not as a sublist).

-- Exceptions --

Exceptions are build upon call/tf and work roughly like this:

(try
 (begin
  __code_to_be_tried__)
 (catch
  (__exception_class__
   __code_to_be_executed_on_that_exception__)
  (__exception_class__
   __code_to_be_executed_on_that_exception__)
  ...)
 (finally
  __code_that_should_always_be_executed))

Pretty simple isn't it? The (throw) function is rigged to go to the nearest
exception handler at all times. It's not quite schemisch, but it looks pretty
good :-).

-- conditional evaluation of parameters --

Normally parameters are evaluated left to right. SilverScheme has an easy way to
create an exception on that however. For example:
(\ (`a b `(c (\ (val) (&gt; val 10)))
  (if (b)
   a
   c))

Right, stupid example, but it demonstrates my point. If you put a backquote
before the argument in the lambda list the argument will not be evaluated until
needed.

-- macros --

A macro is a function that returns a list that is evaluated in the scope of the
caller. A macro is also an ideal way to get a virus in a SilverScheme system. A
macro is made by simply creating a function and then attaching the (macro)
attribute to it.

Macros can be dangerous, they can be helpful too however. It depends on the
situation what they are. That's why I'm introducing set-macro-safe. The
set-macro-safe function takes one argument which is either a number or a symbol
and sets the macro-safe level to that argument. The possible arguments are:
0 'allow-all -- Allow normal macro behaviour for all macros.
1 'explicit-deny -- Allow normal macro behaviour for all macro's except when
explicitly told not to do that.
2 'allow-base -- Allow normal macro behaviour for all macro's in the Base
hierarchy (the baselib). Disallow normal macro behaviour for all other macros
unless explicitly told otherwise.
3 'explicit-allow -- The same as 'allow-base, except that the Base macro's
aren't automatically allowed anymore.
4 'deny-all -- Deny all macro's.

Some primitive macro's are allowed regardless of what the macro-safe level says.

Macro's that can't be called with normal macro behaviour can still be called,
but they only take a single argument (a list) and produce a list that must be
explicitly evaluated (using '(eval list)').

The standard macro level is 0. Note that that's not a safe level for any
production code.

At the first deny command the macro level automatically gets set to 1, if it's
not already at that or a lower level. Thus level 0 can be regarded as level 1,
however it's faster since the macro deny checks are off.

-- Dynamic binding and environment variables --

Sometimes it's handy to pass arguments to functions without putting them in the
argument list but by defining a variable and having the function read that
variable. In the case (begin (define a 10) (foo)) foo can't read a, and it
shouldn't. For environment variables like macro-safe it's another situation
however. That's why I'm introducing environment variables.

Environment variables are dynamically bound. They can't leave the scope in which
they are defined however (like any other variable). To define an environment
variable you need a special function (define-environment-variable) aka (defenv).
This function simply behaves like a normal define, except that the variable is
automatically set read-only (you can override, but normally it's what you want).
The variable can then be accessed using env.variable-name, note that 'env' is a
special variable.

Almost all the special variables can be accessed using env too (env.super,
env.owner, etc), they only have names without env in them because they are used
so much that it's reasonable to shorten them. The macro-safe variable is however
only accessible with env.macro-safe (it's a read-write variable btw).

A word of warning is due here, don't define environment variables unless you
really need them, it's bad style to depend on them for stuff you should pass in
a parameter list.

-- compilation --

SilverScheme is like any Scheme compilable. However SilverScheme has multiple
compiling modes.

The standard mode is keep-all, which basically creates a resource section in the
executable and puts the literal code files in it. The keep-all mode has the
advantage that the result (obj.source) will have the same markup and comments as
the original. Since the data is put in resource files the actual code can be
executed pretty fast. Needless to say this actually increases file size.

A second mode is keep-source, this mode only keeps the actual source code, not
comments. It helps keep the file size down.

A third mode is keep-minimum, removing all the comments and sources except those
referred to in the program. Good for really small files, bad for readability.
Note that since documentation is put into the objects it can't be removed by
this mode.

The fourth and most drastic mode is keep-minimum-remove-docs, this mode also
kicks out the documentation. Only useful if you really really want a small program.

An implementation may compress resource files with tar and gzip at any
compression level. I recommend not or very weakly compressing the actual sources
but strongly compressing the documentation.

The extension of a SilverScheme source file is .dgs, the extension of a SilverScheme
compiled file is .dgsb (SilverScheme Bytecode).

Note that the SilverScheme bytecode is not IL, Parrot or machinecode though
compiling to these is allowed as an optional feature. The SilverScheme bytecode is
a special bytecode designed for SilverScheme (probably looking like other LISP
bytecodes).

-- Permissions --

The permission system is aimed at providing flexible authorization for certain
objects to do certain things. Permissions are given with tokens. Access tokens
give an object A the power to get/set/invoke object B even if this is forbidden
by the access system (access system: public SUBSET-OF {'read 'write 'invoke},
private SUBSET-OF {'read 'write 'invoke}). Here's an example of access tokens:

(define a 10
  (read-only) ;;(public 'read 'invoke) (private 'read 'write 'invoke)
  (define giver
    (\ ()
      (a.give-token-to-caller 'a.write))
    (a.give-bag-access)))

In this example 'a is first declared read-only (that's the default actually),
then a function a.giver is declared and made read-only implicitly. The giver
function is given bag-access by 'a. Any object can give bag access during it's
definition or at any time through it's code. The giver function now gives write
permission for a to any object that calls it. There is no caller object by the way
since I consider it a bad idea if code can manipulate things up the stack except
in such special cases.

There is a second kind of tokens called custom tokens. Basically a custom token
is a token that doesn't have an implicit action associated with it. An example
of a custom token system:

(define nice 0
  (define set ;accessor
    (\ (value)
      (if (&lt; value 0)
        (if (caller-has-token? 'system.root-access)
          (set! nice value)
          (throw (Invalid-Rights-Exception &quot;You don't have root permissions&quot;))
        (set! nice value))))

Without the root-access token you can't use it.

To be honest, custom tokens don't feel right yet. I'd rather leave them out of
the language for now, letting them mature first, I included them only for
completeness sake.

-- Static --

The fields of an object can be divided into two parts: static and non-static.
Static fields are conceptually bound to the storage box of the object and stick
around when set! is used. However static and non-static fields are in the same
namespace, so if a non-static field is in the new value during set! it will
override the old value. Here's an example:

(define a 10
 (define set
  (\ ((value (\ (val) (&gt; val 10))))
   (set! owner value))
  (static)))
(set! a 20) ;set! obj -&gt; obj.set
(a.set.source) =&gt; (\ ((value (\ (val) (&gt; val 10)))) (set! owner value))

-- Overload and override --

When defining a subclass and overloading a field one often easily uses define.
This is a bad idea however since define creates a whole new field that doesn't
share any of the attributes and stuff like that with the old field. Instead
SilverScheme has a method called (overload) which is used like this:
(define-class Foo ()
  (define bar
    (\ () __some_code__)
    (private)))

(define-class Fred (Foo)
  (overload bar
    ((\ () __some_other_code__))))

And voila, bar is copied. Here's a template for overload: (overload __name__
(__new_value__) __attributes__). If the new value part is empty the value isn't
changed (that's why I have it between parenthesises).

The (define) function will do an override. In some cases it might be helpful to
warn or throw an error when define is used. In such cases the (override)
function (which is simply define with another name) is useful.

The override error checking can be turned on and off using the environment
variable check-override-errors.

-- Temporary environment variables --

It's possible to create temporary environment variables that only exist in a
certain scope. One can use the (let-environment-variable) function for this, it
takes the same kinds of arguments as let, but puts them under env. The advantage
over a set..body..unset construction is that let-environment-variable
automatically unsets on error.

-- Primitives --

SilverScheme's version of intercalls are called primitives. Primitives are always
functions (RPC functions to be exact), but they are not objects. Primitives can
only be called from Base (baselib). Any attempt to do weird things with
primitives may be punished with unexpected behaviour (rationale: it's internal
stuff, only a few core hackers will touch it and they will know what to do).
There is one primitive handler which is defined as (call-primitive name . args)
and is private in the top level of the Base module. The primitive handler can
take and return complex objects, however mostly it will operate on simple things.

The advantage of a single primitive handler over for example a primitive
attribute is that there is just one entry point that's easily documented. After
all the accepted function names will probably be visible in a switch statement.

-- Relative modification --

The basic idea behind serialization in SilverScheme is 'relative modification'.
Instead of saying &quot;send this object&quot; the serialization mechanism says &quot;I've got
an object with this identity, do you need it&quot;. Obviously you don't need the same
object twice, so the amount of data send over the network is decreased.

Another possibility with the serialization mechanism is sending in patches to
serialized libraries. This has a huge advantage, namely that you only need to
send the actual changes, instead of the textual changes (diff sometimes sends
over half the file for one line changed, SilverScheme would never do that).

The trick in serialization is the basic SilverScheme object itself. This is how
an object looks like:

    object                     field
+------------+              +-----------+
|  identity  |        +---&gt; |  subject  |
+------------+        |     +-----------+
|  prototype |        |     |  name     |
+------------+        |     +---------+-+
|  changed   |        |     |  object |C|
+----------+-+        |     +---------+-+
|  ivalue  |C|        |
+----------+-+        |
|  code    |C|        |
+----------+-+        |
|  scope     | -------+
+------------+

The C subfields are change flags.

The identity of an object is to the outside world an uri like
'http://myproject/1003', internally it's a number. The identity of an object is
unique, no two different objects with the same identity can exist at any time.

The prototype of an object is the object that this object is a copy of. Often
this is the prototype of the class of the object, in case the object is copied
using for example define it's the original (the second arg to define). Objects
can have prototypes that are not in the current session (like a prototype from
the web).

The changed flag of an object is set on whenever the object is no longer a
perfect copy of the prototype. The changed flag is a kind of warning flag, it
doesn't tell what has changed only that something has changed.

The ivalue is the internal value of an object. It's were for example the value
of a String object is stored in the native representation of the string (or more
likely a pointer to the native representation of the string). It has a changed
flag to signal when the internal value has changed.

The code property is the code section of an object. It has a changed flag to
signal when the code has changed.

For each field in the scope there is a name, a subject reference and an object 
reference with a changed flag. If the field is bound to a new object (with a 
different identity) the change flag goes on.

To send over an object one first needs to ask the other party if he has the
prototype. If not the whole object is send over. If he has the prototype one
must look at the object's change flag, if it's off one can suffice with saying
&quot;it's a perfect copy of the prototype&quot;, otherwise one has to look up which
change flags are on and send over the information in those properties.

-- The library system --

SilverScheme has two types of libraries: source libraries and static
state libraries (I'll call them state libraries from now on). A source
library is simply a bunch of SilverScheme source files. A state
library is a serialized library. Typically a state library is a
relative serialization patch against it's dependencies (to keep lib
size down) and some extra files (like pictures, should it be needed).

State libraries are usually published on the WWW with an URI like
this: 'http://domain/prefix/name/build/', for example
'http://somedomain/home/peter/myproject/12/'. The prefix is just the
path to the project directory. The build is a number that increases
when you create a new build of the state files, it runs independent of
the version number and is the primary means of identifying a version
of the library. Additionally there may be something like
'http://somedomain/home/peter/myproject/0.0.1/' where the version
number is just an alias for a certain build number.

-- Introspection --

Static state files in SilverScheme are similar to the output of the
introspector, indeed they are the output of the build-in SilverScheme
introspector. Thus they contain all information about a program (at
the time of serialization), except the stack and some other
information needed for running (non-static state files contain these,
but that stuff is out of scope here (I'm not even sure if there will
ever be non-static state files)). Thus the (static) state files
contain all the information needed for analyzation of the library.
I'll create an ontology for the state files similar to the
introspector ontology for the introspected IL files so that the state
files will be processable with the introspector toolchain, given a few
small adaptions to cope with the language differences. Unfortunately I
can't use the introspector ontology due to the differences between
SilverScheme and IL.

-- The SilverScheme Repository --

This is really wishful dreaming, but a nice dream :-). The
SilverScheme Repository will be something like CPAN, but more extended
toward introspection.  It will keep libraries as both compressed
source and as state files, it will keep programs (executable programs)
as compressed source (you can't really serialize those to static state
files since there is no natural idle point where the program is loaded
but not executing). Due to an intelligent toolchain coupled to a
webservice and web interface it's possible to see the structure of
libraries, the documentation of libraries, etc, generated on demand
out of the state files.
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a short example based tutorial of Knowledge Interchange Format. It's not complete nor very correct, but it should give you an idea about what you can do with KIF.

The knowledge base I'm using here is a simple representation of human relations. Basically two types of relation exist: family and friends. There are three kinds of family: father, mother, child. There is only one kind of friend. For our purposes partners are also friends. Let's start by entering some data:

    (male Fred)
    (male John)
    (female Martha)
    (female Joan)
    (female Betty)
    (female Alice)

Fred and John are males, Martha, Joan, Betty and Alice are females.

    (father Fred John)

John is the father of Fred

    (mother Fred Martha)

Martha is the mother of Fred

    (father Pete Fred)

Fred is the father of Pete

    (mother Pete Joan)

Joan is the mother of Pete

    (friend Pete Betty)

Betty is a friend of Pete

    (mother Alice Martha)

Martha is the mother of Alice

    (mother Betty Alice)

Alice is the mother of Betty


Now it's nice if we could get some information from these relations. For example _we_ know Fred is the child of Pete, but the computer doesn't. Let's tell him that.

    (defrelation child (?p ?c) :=
      (or (mother ?c ?p) (father ?c ?p)))

Know we say that somebody, called ?c for now, is a child of somebody, called ?p for now, if ?p is the mother of ?c or if ?p is the father of ?c.

Let's define some other relations:

    (defrelation son (?p ?c) :=
      (and (male ?c) (child ?p ?c)))
    
    (defrelation daughter (?p ?c) :=
      (and (female ?c) (child ?p ?c)))

A son is a male child. A daughter is a female child.

Now to querying, getting information from the knowledge base. Here are a few queries with their result behind the =&gt;.

    (male Fred) =&gt; true
    (female John) =&gt; false

That were simple queries that only return true or false. Note that your implementation may display the results in a different way (since I'm not using an interpreter at all (except my brains) while writing this it's kinda logical actually).

    (male ?x) =&gt; ?x = Fred, ?x = John

Here we ask the system: for each object (known as ?x for now) in the universe of discourse the set which contains every object that exists) that is a male ((male ?x) =&gt; true) tell me what the value of ?w is. 

Next example, querying with two variables:

    (daughter (?x ?y)) =&gt; (?x = Alice, ?y = Martha), (?x = Betty, ?y = Alice)

As you can see using two variables also yields the correct result.

Now let's select in queries. Say we want the sister of Fred.

    (and (daughter (?x ?y)) (son (?x Fred))) =&gt; (?x = Martha, ?y = Alice)

As you can imagine we can program relations out of this:

    (defrelation sister (?s ?o) :=
      (and (daughter ?x ?y) (child ?y ?o)))

Now to 'bottom'. Sometimes you want to say: this can be anything, but I don't care what it is. KIF supports this through bottom. If you write bottom you're saying: this can be anything, but you will not be informed of what it is. For example:
    
    (son bottom ?x) =&gt; ?x = Fred, ?x = Pete

In this query we asked for all sons, but not about their parents.


More to follow, when I update this wiki :-).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are all statements that are under one line

== Interfaces ==
Introspector interfaces are Import and export routines that allow RDF statements to be extracted from InternalDataStructures? of programs.

We will build interfaces to the following projects for data extraction

[CLanG C]
[CPlusPlus C++], ObjectiveC and JavaLang support from the GccProject
http://gcc.gnu.org/

[CsharpLang C#], [MicrosoftIntermediateLang MSIL] and other language support via the DotGnuProject
http://www.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu/

GnuMake

PerlInternals

ParrotMetaData

M4Language

AutoMake

AutoConf

BashDb


=== PerlDesignPatterns ===

http://search.cpan.org/src/SWALTERS/Object-PerlDesignPatterns-0.03/PerlDesignPatterns.html#SingletonPattern

=== Glade ===
Glade is just one of the many forms that can be imported into Luxor http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net/

== DataRepository ==
The data repository will be a distributed RDFServer that stored and indexes the RDFFiles.

The Representation of the knowledge extracted by the introspector is simple :
It is a list of identifiers, labels, ids.
Things that have a semantic assigned to them, or that may be assigned to semantics.
These things are nodes, items, blocks. Basically they are the foundation of knowledge.
http://www.burningchrome.com/archives/unrev-ii/msg01818.html 

== Declaration management ==
the user should be able to declare new identifiers, replace them, and import and export them from the system 

We need ways for users to declare new data structures. The data declarations of the introspector provide a common naming system for all related tools

== DataExtraction ==
we need new tools to extract RDF metdata out of various other systems.
We support many different file formats for the introspector.
more to come here, TODO : add a table of file formats 
We need to be able to dump out tabular text files of various names and types in the system. Depends on the QuerySystem?
Doxygen like HTML output is important.
We will support various XML format inputs and outputs. The main focus is moving towards RDF, because of the power of the rdf notation. But Using RDF to annotate XML trees make sense for representing the object structure.

=== NTriples ===
NTriples are even simpler than n3. http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/

=== N3 ===
n3 is a simple rdf alternative notation
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html
See also http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer.html 

== Used Projects ==
I would like to use the BootLib? http://www.boost.org/

=== BASHDB ===
The introspector needs to be acessable from the bash command line.

=== EMACS ===
The emacs interface promises many integration tools

== RDF == 
Rdf is a data format that is best described here http://www.w3.org/RDF/
What is Rdf? http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/01/24/rdf.html
Many people ask, why do you use Rdf instead of Xml.

 * Rdf is appropiate for the introspector because of its simple syntax. 

 * The nodes of the compiler are naturally graphs.

 * Rdf allows for information about resources to be added in when it is needed.

 * MetaData is naturally stored in RDF.

 * Rdf allows for the Ontology and Structure of the data to be added in after the fact.


=== Redland ===
I use Redland http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/ 
Redland is a RDF application framework with many SwigLanguageBindings?.
http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/
We use redland to interface with C modules. 

I use Perl http://www.useperl.com/
I use EulerSharp? http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/ 

== Ontology ==

I have posted the first version of the introspector ontology here
http://introspector.sourceforge.net/2003/08/16/introspector.n3
please review

== Used On Projects ==

On this node, you can find examples of introspected projects :

=== Parrot ===
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/14717?show_headers=1

=== M4 ===
http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/m4-discuss/2003-01/msg00001.html

== Vizualization ==
The visualization tools will be Built upon the following ToolChain :

   * Data Extraction of statements from the subject

   * Data filtering of only relevant information from the program

   * Breaking down the data set into pages and subgraphs

   * Conversion of the statements to nodes and arcs

   * emitting of the graph to the graph layout language 
   
   * invoking of the layout engine

   * importing the results of the layout

   * creation of a planar graph

   * drawing of that graph

   * allowing the editing of the graph by the user

   * exporting of the graph to other systems.

   * saving of the graph data as a resource in the introspector


== OUTPUT ==

=== Code Generators ===
It should be easy for a user to create new code generators

=== Graph layout ===
Graph Layout Tools
vcg graphvis tulip
xvpodb and more 

=== Dia Interface ===
Petal2Dia : see this http://mail.gnome.org/archives/dia-list/2002-November/msg00111.html
AutoDia is a great module from Arron
http://droogs.org/autodia/

The module currently prints out the ntriples for every statement made. More info will be forthcoming, as I'm planning to put it on CPAN.

&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; you mentioned a version &quot;1.0&quot; which I misinterpretated as a typo, but
&gt; we discoverd a very old 1.0 package. As far as I can see it contains
&gt; not obfuscated source code and a GPL license, i.e. it is a proper GPL
&gt; release. As the version number indicates it has more bugs and fewer
&gt; features than the obfuscated version 1.3.
&gt;
&gt; Hence you can use the not obfuscated version 1.0 and the obfuscated
&gt; version 1.3 as base for a GPL project. I can also send you a copy of
&gt; the package if you do not have it already.

 == Abstract GUI Client ==

The [&quot;Abstract GUI Client&quot;] is a proposed API that will isolate you, the user
from a particular GUI toolkit. 


It is based on the [&quot;MVC Concept&quot;] which splits things into Model [&quot;MVC/Model&quot;], View [&quot;MVC/View&quot;] and Controller [&quot;MVC/Controller&quot;].

The user looks at the view, and enters data into the controller.

The [&quot;GUI User&quot;] provides events to the [&quot;MVC/Controller Elements&quot;].

The controller is basically a producer of events that are sent to the model.
A stream of updates are sent from the controller to to model, and that updates all the views that are watching a particular object.

The [&quot;GUI Application Server&quot;] serves [&quot;MVC/View&quot;] to the [&quot;GUI Client Application&quot;].
The [&quot;GUI Client Application&quot;] displays [&quot;MVC/View&quot;] to the [&quot;GUI User&quot;], and it offers multiple [&quot;MVC/Controller&quot;].

The [&quot;GUI Application Server&quot;] uses [&quot;MVC/Model&quot;] to store [&quot;Application Data&quot;].

The [&quot;Application Data&quot;] is able to be processed by any backend module.

 === RDF Data Architecture ===

The [&quot;MVC/Model&quot;] can be a [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Model&quot;].

The [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Model&quot;] can be composed of [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Graphs&quot;].

The [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Graph&quot;] can be managed on [&quot;DotGNU/RDF Storage Server&quot;].

== TaskProposal DotGNU RDF Gui ==

Implement a [&quot;DotGNU&quot;] [&quot;RDF&quot;] [&quot;Gui&quot;] using [&quot;Abstract GUI Client&quot;].

 0. Make a GUI that can read one n3 file and find the following things out.

 1. Graphical User Interface
 1. 1. Find relations between objects
 1. 2. Find domains of relations between objects
 1. 3. Find types of relations between objects

 2. Select Subject/Object
 2. 1.   Select Attributes
 2. 2.   Select Components
 2. 3.   Select Contained Objects
 2. 4.   Select Relations

 3. Save the relations found as hypothesis in an Ontology

      <text xml:space="preserve">The definition of introspection : 

the Introspector is a ModeofMind, a StateOfAwareness. 
the IntrospectorModeOfMind has a LearningAndInteractiveNature.

The Introspective mind is a read only mode at first, 
it allows you to see into yourself.

The issues of OntologicalStructure and SymbolicDefinition come ito play when
you are Introspecting.

To introspect  means literaly to look inside. To spect is to spy, to watch. 
To externalized your internal ideas into *more* internal forms, but for you mind to see. 

This is the ExpansionPredicate, you expand on a symbol, and visualize it.

** To project internal thoughts onto your visual imagination.

To project images inside the mind.

It is a result of adding one InfQuant to an InternalMentalEvent in the VisualSphere. 

an InfQuant is a Quantity of Information

The InternalMentalSymbols, the SymbolDecls, the IconDecls, the GraphDecls 
that are visualized to the outside world are at first meaningless to a third party.

First via the assignment to a Meaning does a Symbol become valuable.
First when they are assigned a meaning via semantics can the value of them be understood.

This process is a stepwise process that involves an human partner that takes part in the introspector use case.
Via interfacing with a human, we are able, to extract &quot;meaning&quot; from them.

This meaning is into sentences, an human encoding, an understandable textual form. 
Sentences allow easy understanding, via direct expression of subject, predicate and object we can indicate the meaning.


Let us look to quotes 

http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html

    When Descartes set about the reconstruction of philosophy, his first step was to 
    (theoretically) permit scepticism and to    
    discard the practice of the schoolmen of looking to authority as the ultimate 
    source of truth. That done, he sought a
    more natural fountain of true principles, and thought he found it in the human mind; 
    thus passing, in the directest way,
    from the method of authority to that of apriority, as described in my first paper. :

    * Self-consciousness was to furnish us with our fundamental truths, 
    and to decide what was agreeable to reason. 

    But since, evidently, not all ideas are true, he was led to note, as the 
    first condition of infallibility, that they must be clear. 
    The distinction between an idea seeming clear and really being so, 
    never occurred to him. 

    Trusting to introspection, as he did, even for a knowledge of external things, 
    why should he question its testimony in respect to the contents of our own minds? 

    But then, I suppose, seeing men, who seemed to be quite clear and positive, 
    holding opposite opinions upon fundamental principles, he was further led 
    to say that clearness of ideas is not sufficient, but that they need also 
    to be distinct, i.e., to have nothing unclear about them. 

    What he probably meant by this (for he did not explain himself with precision) was, 
    that they must sustain the test of dialectical examination; that they must not only 
    seem clear at the outset, but that discussion must never be able to bring to light points 
    of obscurity connected with them.



Here is an interesting api that I found into the introspector,it externalizes an model, allowing it to be inspected. 
http://jade.cselt.it/doc/api/jade/content/onto/Introspector.html#method_detail
http://jade.cselt.it/doc/api/jade/content/schema/ObjectSchema.html

    Here in the jade object schema, you see that we can add slots
    to the objects, some manditory, some not, some with cardinality.

Quote from : http://www.quebecoislibre.org/030510-9.htm

    For Mises, economic behavior is a special case of human action.
    He contends that it is through the analysis of the idea
    of action that the principles of economics can be deduced. 
    Economic theorems are seen as connected to the foundation of 
    real human purposes. Economics is based on true and evident axioms, 
    arrived at by introspection, concerning the essence 
    of human action. 
    From these axioms, Mises derives logical implications or the truths of economics.


Quote from  http://www.gazettenet.com/04222003/entertai/5279.htm

    While the spontaneity of these pieces - and others on view at Hampden Gallery 
    - links them to the abstract art created half a century ago, 
    they also are good examples of the lyrical introspection 
    that today's artists bring to their work.
    
Quote from http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20030507/CASUCC/TPBusiness/General

    But in his recent book Growing People, Growing Companies 
    he warns that individual career &quot;pathfinding&quot; isn't easy.
    &quot;Pursuing personal success requires reflection, self-awareness and courage.
    The path is difficult to identify, as it is unique to each individual 
    and has never been found or taken before,&quot; 
    he writes. 
    &quot;You are constantly picking your way through virgin forest to create the 
    route with only the vague feeling that you are 
    heading in the right direction . . . [it] means 
    taking risks and experimenting with yourself.&quot;


From : http://electroniciraq.net/news/737.shtml

    This war (which never really ended – and perhaps has no solidly fixed 
    beginnings – as is the ephemeral nature of 
    slow-drip genocide) has shattered communities and served as 
    a grand example of a massive setback for humanity. 

    It has also highlighted a whole plethora of issues that the West tries 
    to ignore as we rush into condemnation of the more      
    blatantly visible players. 

    We – the alternative – in our finger pointing, our doling out of blame 
    to the figureheads, the passing array of
    politicians &quot;responsible&quot; for how far astray the human race has gone, 
    have somehow missed one of the lessons 
    so blatantly obvious in all of this: 

    that introspection and reflection, and admission of our own 
    complicity within this, is vitally important if we are to   
    move forward with any sort of cohesion as a movement. 

    That in the &quot;shaming,&quot; in the blaming of the other 
    (who really aren’t like us at all, because we care), perhaps we should
    be saying shame, too, on us – for twelve years of not managing to 
    break the sound barrier; shame for the suffocating 
    silence surrounding genocidal sanctions; shame for every victim of Israeli 
    apartheid in occupied Palestine;shame for the 
    slow and painful or quick deaths and the lives never given voice, never 
    fought for, never honored; shame for every victim
    of state-sponsored terrorism; and shame for the memory of 
    every Iraqi man, woman and child who lived with a virtual gun 
    to their heads for far too long.


Quote from http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith//articles/mach/mach.html

    But there is another, one might almost say phenomenological, aspect to his thinking. 
    All Mach's arguments, however they
    are to be classified, are rigorously subordinated by him to a single goal: the goal  
    of increasing knowledge.(19) He is
    quite prepared to renounce any claim to the epithets 'physicist' or 'philosopher' if  
    this contributes to the advancement 
    of our understanding of the world ((1910), p. 11). He thereby stands in marked  
    contrast to those philosophers and 
    scientists who are all too ready to impose in advance requirements that  
    enquiry has to satisfy if it is to be 
    'scientific', for example by foisting abstract 'criteria of rationality' 
     on live traditions of research.

    He shares with Husserl and others in the Brentano tradition the conviction that 
     theoretical enquiry cannot afford to lose
    sight of the origins of our ideas (scientific and otherwise). Scientific ideas, 
     as Mach conceives them, must have their 
    origins in concepts - called by him 'inaugurating concepts' - derived directly  
    from experience (and, like the 
    phenomenologists, Mach was prepared to acknowledge the role played by introspection  
    in the foundations of scientific 
    enquiry). The science of heat, he argues, is derived from the concept of felt 
     warmth, the science of light from the 
    concept of intensity of illumination, the science of acoustics from the  
    concept of frequency, and so on.(20)

    Mach shares with members of the phenomenological tradition a conception of the philosophy 
     of science as something that 
    must be tied to the actual practice of science. As Husserl puts it: 'A fruitful theory  
    of concept formation in the 
    natural sciences can...only be a theory &quot;from below&quot;, a theory that has grown out of  
    the work of the natural sciences 
    themselves.' The passage occurs in the context of a discussion by Husserl of a  
    monograph by the Neo-Kantian Rickert in 
    which a conception of the philosophy of science is manifested 'which deals so 
     much in general constructions, is so much a
    theory &quot;from above&quot;, that not a single example is to be found in the entire 
    monograph and nor does this absence make 
    itself felt' (1979, p. 147).
 
    It is a recurring feature of Mach's deservedly famous conceptual analyses of the  
    ontological commitments of scientists 
    e.g. to space and time, that he proceeds by gradually stripping away from these  
    all purely conceptual baggage, all 
    metaphysical free play not directly related to sense experience - and thereby arrives,  
    step by step, at certain (as Mach 
    conceives things) unambiguous and precise components, such as the inaugurating concepts  
    mentioned above:
    
    I see the expression of... economy clearly in the gradual reduction of the  
    statical laws of machines to a single one, 
    viz., the principle of virtual work: in the replacement of Kepler's laws by 
     Newton's single law... and in the 
    [subsequent] reduction, simplification and clarification of the laws of dynamics. 
     I see clearly the biologico-economical 
    adaptation of ideas, which takes place by the principles of continuity (permanence) 
     and of adequate definition and splits
    the concept 'heat' into the two concepts of 'temperature' and 'quantity of heat'; 
     and I see how the concept 'quantity of
    heat' leads on to 'latent heat', and to the concepts of 'energy' and 'entropy'. ((1910), p. 6f.)

Quote from http://www.acooke.org/andrew/writing/lang.html

    In many OO languages it is possible to find out what class an object is  
    (run time type information) and even what
    functions are connected with it (introspection / reflection). Others, 
     like C++ have little run time information 
    available (at least in the standard language - individual libraries  
    of objects can support RTTI  with their own
    conventions).

from : http://www.singinst.org/LOGI/seedAI.html

    Better support for introspective perception and manipulation.  
    The comparatively poor support of the human architecture for 
    low-level introspection is most apparent in the extreme case of modifying code; 
    we can think thoughts about thoughts, but not thoughts about individual neurons.  
    However, other cross-level introspections are also closed to us. 
    We lack the ability to introspect on :
     * concept kernels, 
     * focus-of-attention allocation, 
     * sequiturs in the thought process, 
     * memory formation, 
     * skill reinforcement, et cetera; 
    We lack the ability to :
     * introspectively notice, 
     * induce beliefs about, 
     * or take deliberate actions in these domains.

==1. Have the Nutrition Honor.==
Answers to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts/Nutrition|Nutrition]] Honor can be found in the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts|Household Arts]] chapter of this book.

==2. Read a book about Nutrition.==
Suggested books include:
* '''Foods for Thought: Nutrition's Link to Mood, Memory, Learning and Behavior''' ''Bernell Baldwin, Vicki Griffin, Evelyn Kissinger'', Review and Herald, 152 pages.
* '''An Ounce of Prevention: Your Pathway to Abundant Health''', Review and Herald, 64 pages.
* '''Counsels on Diet and Foods''' ''Ellen G. White'', Review and Herald, 512 pages.
* '''Dynamic Living''' ''Hans Diehl, Dr.H.Sc., Aileen Ludington, M.D.'', Review and Herald, 208 pages.
* '''Foods that Heal''' ''George D. Pamplona-Roger, M.D.'', Review and Herald, 94 pages.

==3. Keep a food diary on yourself for one week.==
This can be done with pencil and paper or with an online tool such as the one provided by the USDA at [http://choosemyplate.gov ChooseMyPlate.gov].

==4. Calculate the total nutrients of the following in your diet each day:==
*'''a. Calories'''
*'''b. Protein'''
*'''c. Iron'''
*'''d. Calcium'''
*'''e. Vitamin A'''
*'''f. Thiamine'''
*'''g. Riboflavin'''
*'''h. Niacin'''
*'''i. Vitamin C or ascorbic acid'''

If you have access to the Internet, you can visit the USDA's [http://choosemyplate.gov ChooseMyPlate.gov] web site.  Once you register, you can enter all the foods you eat in a day, and it will analyze your nutrient intake (among other things) based on this information.  ChooseMyPlate can retain the information you enter for up to a year, so tracking it for a week will be easy.

If your Pathfinders do not have access to the Internet, have them record their diets on paper.  You can then use the website to extract the necessary data by entering each food individually, or you can find a cookbook that has nutrient values of various foods in an appendix.  Another option would be to meet in a place that has public Internet access, such as a library or Internet cafe.  Then your Pathfinders can enter the data they have collected for a week and analyze it there.

==5. How do the number of nutrients in your diet compare with the Recommended Daily Allowance chart?==
The USDA's [http://choosemyplate.gov ChooseMyPlate.gov] web site will compare your nutrient intake with the RDA chart.

==6. Explain why a high fiber diet is important, and tell how this can be obtained.==
Fiber promotes the wavelike contractions that keep food moving through the intestine. Also, high-fiber foods expand the inside walls of the colon. This eases the passage of waste. Fibrous substances pass through the intestine undigested. They also absorb many times their weight in water, resulting in softer, bulkier stools. Insoluble fiber is found in wheat, rye, bran, and other grains. It is also the fiber found in most vegetables. See [http://www.gicare.com/pated/edtgs01.htm]

==7. Name three diseases due to malnutrition, and describe the symptoms of each.==
===Scurvy===
Scurvy is a disease that results from insufficient intake of vitamin C and leads to the formation of livid spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding from almost all mucous membranes. The spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized. Scurvy was at one time common among sailors whose ships were out to sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored and by soldiers who were similarly separated from these foods for extended periods.

===Beriberi===
Beriberi is a nervous system ailment caused by a deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine), the symptoms of which may include weight loss, emotional disturbances, impaired sensory perception, weakness and pain in the limbs, and periods of irregular heartbeat. Swelling of bodily tissues  is common. In advanced cases, the disease may cause heart failure and death. The origin of the word is from the Sinhalese (Sri Lankan) language meaning &quot;I cannot, I cannot&quot;.

Beriberi occurs in people whose staple diet consists mainly of polished white rice, which contains little or no thiamine. Therefore the disease has been seen traditionally in people in Asian countries (especially in the nineteenth century and before) and in chronic alcoholics with impaired liver function. If a baby is fed the milk of a mother who suffers from a deficiency in thiamine, the child may develop beriberi.

===Rickets===
Rickets is a disorder which most commonly relates directly to Vitamin D deficiency, which causes a lack of calcium being absorbed. It can also arise, however, from other causes such as certain types of rare tumors or any phosphate-wasting disease. Because calcium is an essential nutrient which aids bone rigidity, the lack of it being absorbed into the body causes fragile or malformed bones, which are unable to support the weight of a growing body.  Rickets causes bone pain, slowed growth in children, dental problems, muscle loss and increased risk of fractures (easily broken bones).

===Pellagra===
Pellagra is a vitamin deficiency disease caused by dietary lack of niacin and protein, especially the essential amino acid tryptophan.  Symptoms of pellagra are red skin lesions, diarrhea, dermatitis, weakness, mental confusion, and eventually dementia. This disease can be common for persons who obtain most of their food energy from corn, as corn is a poor source of tryptophan. Therefore this disease can be common amongst people who live in rural South America where — during winter — they live on corn. Usually the symptoms show during spring, and disappear over summer, to return the next spring, after another long winter.

==8. What are the symptoms of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency?==
Early, noticeable symptoms of Overt B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; Deficiency: Unusual fatigue, faulty digestion, no appetite, nausea, loss of menstruation. Also numbness and tingling of the hands and feet, nervousness, diarrhea, mild depression,etc. See [http://www.veganhealth.org/b12/sympt]

==9. What advice would you give a person who decided to be a total vegetarian?==
http://philipngcc.homestead.com/

http://www.dietobio.com/dossiers/en/vegetarism/index.html

http://www.giveusahome.co.uk/articles/vegetarianism.htm

Because Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be obtained through plant sources, total vegetarians are advised to eat foods with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; added (such as fortified soy milk, fortified margarines, or many commercial breakfast cereals), certain brands of nutritional yeast, or take dietary supplements (a good multivitamin will likely include B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; in sufficient quantities).

==10. What is the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats? Which is the most healthful, and why?==
Saturated fats and trans fatty acids are the kinds of fats most likely to cause heart disease. Saturated fats are found mainly in animal products (eggs, butter, cheese, whole milk, and whole milk products), and in coconut, palm, and palm kernel oil. Trans fatty acids appear in foods containing hydrogenated fats like margarine and crackers. To reduce the risk of heart disease, replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats like canola oil, olive oil, flax seed oil, nuts, avocado, soy products, and nut butters. Choose margarine, cookies, crackers, and snack foods that do not contain hydro-genated fats (read the label). See [http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/heart.htm]

==11. Why is it advisable to use less sugar in the diet? List several ways in which this may be accomplished.==
There are a several reasons why sugar is ruining your health: Sugar can suppress the immune system;  Sugar leads to cancer of the ovaries; Sugar can cause heart disease; Sugar can cause appendicitis; Sugar can cause multiple sclerosis; Sugar can increase cholesterol; Sugar can increase the systolic blood pressure; Sugar can cause drowsiness and decreased activity in children; Sugar can contribute to Alzheimer’s disease; Sugar can lead to prostrate cancer; Sugar can cause liver tumors; etc. [http://www.rheumatic.org/sugar.htm] 

Several ways to use less sugar: Cut down slowly; go half and half; establish rules about dessert; If you must eat sweets, eat them with meals; Choose the right breakfast cereal; Don't skip meals; Don't add sugar to foods; ot for a walk when you crave sweetness; Go fat-free if you must have sweets.

==12. What are amino acids? How many are needed to make all the proteins in the body? What is meant by essential amino acids? How many of them are essential? Where can you get all the essential amino acids?==
;Definition of Essential Amino acids: the nine a-amino acids required for protein synthesis that cannot be synthesized by humans and must be obtained in the diet: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. 
Note: http://www.google.com enter definition essential amino acids to get this and other related definitions! [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-28,GGLG:en&amp;q=definition+amino+acids]

Of the 28 amino acids needed by humans, 9 of them cannot be manufactured by the body and are thus termed &quot;essential.&quot;

Only some foods contain all the essential amino acids. These are: 
milk and dairy products, eggs, fish, meat and poultry. If you don't eat animal products, the only way you can get all the essential amino acids is by combining plant foods. For example: corn plus peas or beans, rice plus beans, lentils plus bread. [http://www.dietitian.com/protein.html] Google results:[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2005-28%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=amino+acids+needs+to+make+proteins]

Another term that comes up when we talk about protein nutrition is the term essential amino acid. Our bodies can make quite a number of amino acids from other chemicals that are contained in the body and can convert some amino acids into other amino acids. However, there are some amino acids we are not able to synthesize ourselves. Those particular amino acids and they must be provided to us in our diet. Those amino acids are referred to as the essential amino acids. It's not to say that the non-essential amino acids are not necessary, it's just that it is not necessary for them to be in our diet because other things in the diet can be used to make them.

==13. Know the difference between water and fat soluble vitamins. What are two common vitamins that are fat soluble? What are two vitamins that are water soluble?==
The fat soluble vitamins are soluble in lipids (fats). These vitamins are usually absorbed in fat globules (called chylomicrons) that travel through the lymphatic system of the small intestines and into the general blood circulation within the body. These fat soluble vitamins, especially vitamins A and E, are then stored in body tissues. Two common vitamins that are fat soluble (A, D, E, and K). Two vitamins that are water soluble (B and C). It determines how each vitamin acts within the body.
[http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10736]

==14. Using the book Counsels on Diet and Foods by Ellen G. White, write a paragraph on the benefits of a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet.==
Use the &quot;search the writings&quot; feature on http://www.egwestate.org

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic prinicple of most automatic winding systems is simple.  The rotor is a relatively large unbalanced weight mounted in a way that it can turn around a pivot.  As the watch moves, the rotor will shift around the pivot.  The rotor is indirectly connected to the mainspring arbor in a way that causes the mainspring to be wound slightly when the rotor moves.  In some watches, only movement in one direction will wind, with bidirectional winding every motion of the rotor helps wind. 

==Auto Winding Systems==

Seiko most often uses the Magic Lever system, an extremely simple yet effective system, requiring only 3 or 4 more parts than a manual wind watch.  A gear with ratchet teeth is placed so it's pinion meshes with the mainspring winding gear.  The magic lever is a V shaped metal lever with flexible legs.   The open end of the V is placed around the ratchet gear--one end has a hook, the other an angled point.  When the magic lever moves away from the ratchet wheel, the hook pulls the wheel in the winding direction.  When the magic lever moves towards the ratchet wheel, the point pushes the wheel in the winding direction.  The base of the V is attached to an eccentric post, either part of the rotor or a secondary wheel driven by the rotor.  

Timex used a more complex version of this system in their automatics.  In the Timex system the equivalent to the Magic Lever was made of several pieces with pivots and springs, and the ratchet wheel had planetary reduction gears to increase leverage enough to wind the spring.    In both of these systems, the ratchet wheel can turn without turning the rotor, allowing handwinding with no decoupling wheel needed, although many Seiko automatics do not provide handwinding capability.  

Many ETA movements use reversing wheels.  In this system, there are two sets of gears, each with a top and bottom gear connected by a one-way clutch.  One top gear will be driven by the rotor and will in turn drive the other top gear.  Both bottom gears are connected (directly or indirectly) to the mainspring arbor.  When the first gear is turning in the direction that it can wind the watch, it's associated bottom gear will also turn with it, winding it.  The first gear will also turn the second gear in the opposite direction.  The second gear's one-way clutch will allow the bottom gear to disconnect.  When the first gear moves in the wrong direction for it to wind, it's bottom gear will be allowed to disconnect, but it will be turning the second gear in the opposite direction, allowing it to wind the watch.  

The rocker bar system has two gears (usually called wheels)  meshed together on a pivoting rocker bar, and will be driven by a gear when the rotor turns.  In this description, assume that the rocker bar is to the right of the driving gear, and the driven gear is above the rocker.  When the driving wheel turns counterclockwise, the rocker will rock slightly clockwise, so that the rocker gear meshing with the driving gear will also mesh with the driven gear, turning the driven gear counterclockwise.  When the driving wheel turns clockwise, it will cause the rocker to pivot slightly.  The rocker gear meshed with the driving gear will move down and away from the driven gear, while the opposite rocker gear will move upwards and mesh with the driven gear, again causing the driven wheel to turn clockwise. 

Most rocker-bar systems have handwinding capability, this requires a decoupling wheel so the rotor is not forced to turn with handwinding.  

All of the above watches have 360 degree rotating rotors.  An earlier form of automatic wind is the bumper-wind. In these, the rotor could not make a full rotation--Instead, at the ends of its allowed travel it would hit springs.   These were produced until the patents for the 360 degree rotor expired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This title speaks volumes: Christianity and the world's religions, the suggestion that Christianity is different from World Religions. It is. Fundamentally different, in its focus. The focus is on the person of Christ. This Jesus Christ who came to Earth to offer man salvation. A salvation not based on goodness, moral teaching or good behaviour. It is based not on Jesus's great teaching, which most acknowledge as sound, but on his work on the cross. 

No religion offers the believer perfect salvation. Others offer good codes, practices, rituals, teachings and wisdom. But none offer God himself, present in the believer's life through the Holy Spirit of God. Some offer an approach to God, through prophets or good teachers. However the eternal concept of Christ in me the hope of glory, is alien, to other religions. 

There is much to write on the differences between the religions of this world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I AM THE LORD AND I DO NOT CHANGE

God is bold enough to declare this simple statement, I AM. Together with this statement that ''&quot;I do not change&quot;''. This declaration is a majestic proclamation that God, whoever he is, does not change. If he is good, then that goodness never changes. Whatever his attributes, like mercy and justice, those do not change. Ever. This is the Doctrine of Immutability. God is Lord and he does not change.

If one is to believe in a God, it is essential that he is immutable. Faith is based on the trust that God says who he is. God must therefore be immutable for the Bible to be true. For the prophecies and the promises to be of any value, God must be the ultimate being. He must be who he has always been. Otherwise everything that faith calls for needs to change. 

If God makes a promise then he must be capable of fulfilling his word. Also he must be trusted to deliver on his promise. Trusting God is by definition believing in his unchanging nature. 

Changing is something humans have to do to regain their status before the fall of man. God is perfect, therefore does not need to change. Immutability and perfection are connected. If one is perfect then change is not required. The Bible teaches that God never changes. The promises are unchanging. God boldly declared in Malachi 3:6 that he is unchanging. The immutability of God is thus certain and an essential part of the doctrine of Christianity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Quantile Regression as introduced by Koenker and Bassett (1978) seeks to complement classical linear regression analysis. Central hereby is the extension of &quot;ordinary quantiles from a location model to a more general class of linear models in which the conditional quantiles have a linear form&quot; (Buchinsky (1998), p. 89). In Ordinary Least Squares ([[w:en:OLS|OLS]]) the primary goal is to determine the conditional mean of random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, given some explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, reaching the expected value &lt;math&gt;E[Y|x_i]&lt;/math&gt;. Quantile Regression goes beyond this and enables one to pose such a question at any quantile of the conditional distribution function. The following seeks to introduce the reader to the ideas behind Quantile Regression. First, the issue of [[w:en:quantiles|quantiles]] is addressed, followed by a brief outline of least squares estimators focusing on Ordinary Least Squares. Finally, Quantile Regression is presented, along with an example utilizing the Boston Housing data set.

==Preparing the Grounds for Quantile Regression==

===What are Quantiles===
Gilchrist (2001, p.1) describes a quantile as &quot;simply the value that corresponds to a specified proportion of an  (ordered) sample of a population&quot;.  For instance a very commonly used quantile is the [[w:en:median|median]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, which is equal to a proportion of 0.5 of the ordered data. This corresponds to a quantile with a probability of 0.5 of occurrence. Quantiles hereby mark the boundaries of equally sized, consecutive subsets. (Gilchrist, 2001)  

More formally stated, let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous random variable with a distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt; (1)  F_Y(y) = P (Y\leq {y}) = \tau&lt;/math&gt;

which states that for the distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; one can determine for a given value &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; the probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of occurrence. Now if one is dealing with quantiles, one wants to do the opposite, that is one wants to determine for a given probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of the sample data set the corresponding value &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. A &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt;-quantile refers in a sample data to the probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; for a value &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; (2) F_Y(y_\tau) = \tau&lt;/math&gt;

Another form of expressing the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt;-quantile mathematically is following:

&lt;math&gt; (3) y_\tau = F_{Y}^{-1}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y_\tau&lt;/math&gt; is such that it constitutes the inverse of the function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; for a probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that there are two possible scenarios. On the one hand, if the distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing, quantiles are well defined for every &lt;math&gt;\tau \in (0;1)&lt;/math&gt;. However, if a distribution function  &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; is not strictly monotonically increasing , there are some &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;s for which a unique quantile can not be defined. In this case one uses the smallest value that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can take on for a given probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. 

Both cases, with and without a strictly monotonically increasing function, can be described as follows:

&lt;math&gt; (4) y_\tau = F_Y^{-1}(\tau) = inf \left\{ y | F_Y(y) \geq \tau \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

That is &lt;math&gt;y_\tau&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the inverse of the function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; which in turn is equal to the infimum of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that the distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; is greater or equal to a given probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}-&lt;/math&gt;quantile. (Handl (2000))

However, a problem that frequently occurs is that an empirical distribution function is a step function. Handl (2000) describes a solution to this problem. As a first step, one reformulates equation 4 in such a way that one replaces the continuous random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the observations, in the distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the empirical distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_n(y)&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; (5) \hat{y}_\tau = inf \left\{ y | F_n(y) \geq \tau \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The empirical distribution function can be separated into equally sized, consecutive subsets via the the number of observations &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Which then leads one to the following step:

&lt;math&gt; (6) \hat{y}_\tau = y_{(i)} &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;i=1,...,n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{(1)},...,y_{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; as the sorted observations. Hereby, of course, the range of values that &lt;math&gt;y_\tau&lt;/math&gt; can take on is limited simply by the observations &lt;math&gt;y_{(i)}&lt;/math&gt; and their nature. However, what if one wants to implement a different subset, i.e. different quantiles but those that can be derived from the number of observations &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;? 

Therefore a further step necessary to solving the problem of a step function is to smooth the empirical distribution function through replacing it a with continuous linear function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{F}(y)&lt;/math&gt;. In order to do this there are several algorithms available which are well described in Handl (2000) and more in detail with an evaluation of the different algorithms and their efficiency in computer packages in Hyndman and Fan (1996). Only then one can apply any division into quantiles of the data set as suitable for the purpose of the analysis. (Handl (2000))

===Ordinary Least Squares===
In regression analysis the researcher is interested in analyzing the behavior of a dependent variable &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; given the information contained in a set of explanatory variables &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. Ordinary Least Squares is a standard approach to specify a linear regression model and estimate its unknown parameters by minimizing the sum of squared errors. This leads to an approximation of the mean function of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable.  OLS achieves the property of BLUE, it is the best, linear, and unbiased estimator, if following four assumptions hold:

1. The explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is non-stochastic

2. The expectations of the error term &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; are zero, i.e. &lt;math&gt;E[\epsilon_i]=0&lt;/math&gt;

3. Homoscedasticity - the variance of the error terms &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; is constant, i.e. &lt;math&gt;var(\epsilon_i)=\sigma^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

4. No autocorrelation, i.e. &lt;math&gt;cov(\epsilon_i , \epsilon_j )=0&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;i\neq j&lt;/math&gt;

However, frequently one or more of these assumptions are violated, resulting in that OLS is not anymore the best, linear, unbiased estimator. Hereby Quantile Regression can tackle following issues: (i), frequently the error terms are not necessarily constant across a distribution thereby violating the axiom of homoscedasticity. (ii) by focusing on the mean as a measure of location, information about the tails of a distribution are lost. (iii) OLS is sensitive to extreme outliers that can distort the results significantly. (Montenegro (2001))

==Quantile Regression==

===The Method===
Quantile Regression essentially transforms a conditional distribution function into a conditional quantile function by slicing it into segments. These segments describe the cumulative distribution of a conditional dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given the explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; with the use of quantiles as defined in equation 4. 

For a dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given the explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;X=x&lt;/math&gt; and fixed &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\tau&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the conditional quantile function is defined as the &lt;math&gt;\tau-th&lt;/math&gt; quantile &lt;math&gt;Q_{Y|X}(\tau|x)&lt;/math&gt; of the conditional distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_{Y|X}(y|x)&lt;/math&gt;. For the estimation of the location of the conditional distribution function, the conditional median &lt;math&gt;Q_{Y|X}(0,5|x)&lt;/math&gt; can be used as  an alternative to the conditional mean. (Lee (2005))

One can nicely illustrate Quantile Regression when comparing it with OLS. In OLS, modeling a conditional distribution function of a random sample (&lt;math&gt;{y_1,...,y_n}&lt;/math&gt;) with a parametric function &lt;math&gt;\mu(x_i,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the independent variables, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding estimates and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; the conditional mean, one gets following minimization problem:

&lt;math&gt; (7) min_{\beta\in\Re}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\mu(x_i,\beta))^{2} &lt;/math&gt;

One thereby obtains the conditional expectation function &lt;math&gt;E[Y|x_i]&lt;/math&gt;. Now, in a similar fashion one can proceed in Quantile Regression. Central feature thereby becomes &lt;math&gt;\rho_\tau&lt;/math&gt;, which serves as a check function.
 
&lt;math&gt; (8)
\rho_{\tau}(x)=\begin{cases}\tau*x &amp; \mbox{if } x \ge 0 
\\ (\tau-1)*x &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \end{cases} 	
&lt;/math&gt;

This check-function ensures that

1. all &lt;math&gt;\rho_\tau&lt;/math&gt; are positive

2. the scale is according to the probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Such a function with two supports is a must if dealing with L1 distances, which can become negative.

In Quantile Regression one minimizes now following function:

&lt;math&gt; (9) min_{\beta\in\Re}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{\tau}(y_i-\xi(x_i,\beta)) &lt;/math&gt;

Here, as opposed to OLS, the minimization is done for each subsection defined by &lt;math&gt;\rho_\tau&lt;/math&gt;, where the estimate of the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt;-quantile function is achieved with the parametric function &lt;math&gt;\xi(x_i, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;. (Koenker and Hallock (2001))

Features that characterize Quantile Regression and  differentiate it from other regression methods are following:

1. The entire conditional distribution of the dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; can be characterized through different values of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;

2. Heteroscedasticity can be detected

3. If the data is heteroscedastic, median regression estimators can be more efficient than mean regression estimators

4. The minimization problem as illustrated in equation 9 can be solved efficiently by linear programming methods, making estimation easy

5. Quantile functions are also equivariant to monotone transformations. That is &lt;math&gt;Q_{h(Y|X)}(x_\tau)=h(Q_{(Y|X)}(x_{\tau}))&lt;/math&gt;, for any function

6. Quantiles are robust in regards to outliers ( Lee (2005) )

===A graphical illustration of Quantile Regression===
Before proceeding to a numerical example, the following subsection seeks to graphically illustrate the concept of Quantile Regression. First, as a starting point for this illustration, consider figure 1. For a given explanatory value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; the density for a conditional dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is indicated by the size of the balloon. The bigger the balloon, the higher is the density, with the  [[w:en:mode|mode]], i.e. where the density is the highest, for a given &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; being the biggest balloon. Quantile Regression essentially connects the equally sized balloons, i.e. probabilities, across the different values of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, thereby allowing one to focus on the interrelationship between the explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and the dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; for the different quantiles, as can be seen in figure 2. These subsets, marked by the quantile lines, reflect the probability density of the dependent variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image: Prob.jpg |center|thumb|550px| Figure 1: Probabilities of occurrence for individual explanatory variables]]

The example used in figure 2 is originally from Koenker and Hallock (2000), and illustrates a classical empirical application, Ernst Engel's (1857) investigation into the relationship of household food expenditure, being the dependent variable, and household income as the explanatory variable. In Quantile Regression the conditional function of &lt;math&gt;Q_{Y|X}(\tau|x)&lt;/math&gt; is segmented by the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt;-quantile. In the analysis, the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt;-quantiles &lt;math&gt;\tau \in\left\{0,05; 0,1; 0,25; 0,5; 0,75; 0,9; 0,95\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, indicated by the thin blue lines that separate the different color sections, are superimposed on the data points. The conditional median (&lt;math&gt;\tau=0,5&lt;/math&gt;) is indicated by a thick dark blue line, the conditional mean by a light yellow line. The color sections thereby represent the subsections of the data as generated by the quantiles. 

[[Image: Engel_Curve.jpg |center|thumb|550px| Figure 2: Engels Curve, with the median highlighted in dark blue and the mean in yellow]]

Figure 2 can be understood as a contour plot representing a 3-D graph, with food expenditure and income on the respective y and x axis. The third dimension arises from the probability density of the respective values. The density of a value is thereby indicated by the darkness of the shade of blue, the darker the color, the higher is the probability of occurrence. For instance, on the outer bounds, where the blue is very light, the probability density for the given data set is relatively low, as they are marked by the quantiles 0,05 to 0,1 and 0,9 to 0,95. It is important to notice that figure 2 represents for each subsections the individual probability of occurrence, however, quantiles utilize the cumulative probability of a conditional function. For example, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of 0,05 means that 5&lt;math&gt;\%&lt;/math&gt; of observations are expected to fall below this line, a &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of 0,25 for instance means that 25&lt;math&gt;\%&lt;/math&gt; of the observations are expected to fall below this and the 0,1 line.

The graph in figure 2, suggests that the error variance is not constant across the distribution. The dispersion of food expenditure increases as household income goes up. Also the data is skewed to the left, indicated by the spacing of the quantile lines that decreases above the median and also by the relative position of the median which lies above the mean. This suggests that the axiom of homoscedasticity is violated, which OLS relies on. The statistician is therefore well advised to engage in an alternative method of analysis such as Quantile Regression, which is actually able to deal with heteroscedasticity.

===A Quantile Regression Analysis===
In order to give a numerical example of the analytical power of Quantile Regression and to compare it within the boundaries of a statistical application with OLS the following section will be analyzing some selected variables of the Boston Housing dataset which is available at the md-base website. The data was first analyzed by Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (1980). The original data comprised 506 observations for 14 variables stemming from the census of the Boston metropolitan area. 

This analysis utilizes as the dependent variable the median value of owner occupied homes (a metric variable, abbreviated with H) and investigates the effects of 4 independent variables as shown in table 1. These variables were selected as they best illustrate the difference between OLS and Quantile Regression. For the sake of simplicity of the analysis, it was neglected for now to deal with potential difficulties related to finding the correct specification of a parametric model. A simple linear regression model therefore was assumed. For the estimation of asymptotic standard errors see for example Buchinsky (1998), which illustrates the design-matrix bootstrap estimator or alternatively Powell (1986) for kernel based estimation of asymptotic standard errors.

In the following firstly an OLS model was estimated. Three digits after the comma were indicated in the tables as some of the estimates turned out to be very small.

&lt;math&gt; (10) E [H_i | T_i, O_i, A_i, P_i] = \alpha + \beta T_i + \delta O_i + \gamma A_i + \lambda P_i  &lt;/math&gt;

Computing this via XploRe one obtains the results as shown in the table below.

Analyzing this data set via Quantile Regression, utilizing the &lt;math&gt;\tau^{th}&lt;/math&gt; quantiles &lt;math&gt;\tau \in \left(0,1; 0,3; 0,5; 0,7; 0,9\right)&lt;/math&gt; the model is characterized as follows:

&lt;math&gt; (11) Q_H [\tau| T_i, O_i, A_i, P_i] = \alpha_\tau + \beta_\tau T_i  + \delta_\tau O_i  + \gamma_\tau A_i  + \lambda_\tau P_i   &lt;/math&gt;

Just for illustrative purposes and to further foster the understanding of the reader for Quantile Regression, the equation for the &lt;math&gt;0,1^{th}&lt;/math&gt; quantile  is briefly illustrated, all others follow analogous:

&lt;math&gt; (12) min\left[\rho_{0,1}(y_1-x_1\beta)+\rho_{0,1}(y_2-x_2\beta)+ ...+\rho_{0,1}(y_n-x_n\beta)\right]  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mbox{ equation 12 with } 
\rho_{0,1}(y_i-x_i\beta)=\begin{cases}0,1(y_i-x_i\beta) &amp; \mbox{if }(y_i-x_i\beta)&gt;0
\\-0,9(y_i-x_i\beta) &amp; \mbox{if }(y_i-x_i\beta)&lt;0 \end{cases} 	
&lt;/math&gt;

Now if one compares the results for the estimates of OLS from table 2 and Quantile Regression, table 3, one finds that the latter method can make much more subtle inferences of the effect of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable.  Of particular interest are thereby quantile estimates that are relatively different as compared to other quantiles for the same estimate.

Probably the most interesting result and most illustrative in regards to an understanding of the functioning of Quantile Regression and pointing to the differences with OLS are the results for the independent variable of the proportion of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt;. OLS indicates that this variable has a positive influence on the dependent variable, the value of homes, with an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}=0,021&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the value of houses increases as the proportion of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; increases in regards to the Boston Housing data. 

Looking at the output that Quantile Regression provides us with, one finds a more differentiated picture. For the 0,1 quantile, we find an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_{0,1}= 0,087&lt;/math&gt; which would suggest that for this low quantile the effect seems to be even stronger than is suggested by OLS. Here house prices go up when the proportion of non-retail businesses &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; goes up, too. However, considering the other quantiles, this effect is not quite as strong anymore, for the 0,7th and 0,9th  quantile this effect seems to be even reversed indicated by the parameter &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_{0,7}= -0,021&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_{0,9}= -0,062&lt;/math&gt;. These values indicate that in these quantiles the house price is negatively influenced by an increase of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt;. The influence of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; seems to be obviously very ambiguous on the dependent variable of housing price, depending on which quantile one is looking at. The general recommendation from OLS that if the proportion of non-retail business acres &lt;math&gt;(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; increases, the house prices would increase can obviously not be generalized. A policy recommendation on the OLS estimate could therefore be grossly misleading.

One would intuitively find the statement that the average number of rooms of a property &lt;math&gt;(O_i)&lt;/math&gt; positively influences the value of a house, to be true. This is also suggested by OLS with an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}=38,099&lt;/math&gt;. Now Quantile Regression also confirms this statement, however, it also allows for much subtler conclusions. There seems to be a significant difference between the 0,1 quantile as opposed to the rest of the quantiles, in particular the 0,9th quantile. For the lowest quantile the estimate is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,1}= 29,606&lt;/math&gt;, whereas for the 0,9th quantile it is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,9}=51,353&lt;/math&gt;. Looking at the other quantiles one can find similar values for the Boston housing data set as for the 0,9th, with estimates of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,3}=45,281&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,5}=53,252&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta}_{0,7}=50,999&lt;/math&gt; respectively. So for the lowest quantile the influence of additional number of rooms &lt;math&gt;(O_i)&lt;/math&gt; on the house price seems to be considerably smaller then for all the other quantiles.

Another illustrative example is provided analyzing the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 &lt;math&gt;(A_i)&lt;/math&gt; and its effect on the value of homes. Whereas OLS would indicate this variable has hardly any influence with an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\gamma}=0,001&lt;/math&gt;, looking at Quantile Regression one gets a different impression. For the  0,1th quantile, the age has got a negative influence on the value of the home with &lt;math&gt;\hat{\gamma}_{0,1}=-0,022&lt;/math&gt;. Comparing this with the highest quantile where the estimate is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\gamma}_{0,9}=0,004&lt;/math&gt;, one finds that the value of the house is suddenly now positively influenced by its age. Thus, the negative influence is confirmed by all other quantiles besides the highest, the  0,9th quantile.

Last but not least, looking at the pupil-teacher ratio &lt;math&gt;(P_i)&lt;/math&gt; and its influence on the value of houses, one finds that the tendency that OLS indicates with a value of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}=-0,953&lt;/math&gt; to be also reflected in the Quantile Regression analysis. However, in Quantile Regression one can see that the influence on the housing price of the pupils-teacher ratio &lt;math&gt;(P_i)&lt;/math&gt; gradually increases over the different quantiles, from the 0,1th quantile with an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}_{0,1}=-0,443&lt;/math&gt; to the 0,9th quantile with a value of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}_{0,9}=-1,257&lt;/math&gt;. 

This analysis makes clear, that Quantile Regression allows one to make much more differentiated statements when using Quantile Regression as opposed to OLS. Sometimes OLS estimates can even be misleading what the true relationship between an explanatory and a dependent variable is as the effects can be very different for different subsection of the sample.

==Conclusion==

For a distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_Y (y)&lt;/math&gt; one can determine for a given value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; the probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of occurrence. Now quantiles do exactly the opposite. That is, one wants to determine for a given probability &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of the sample data set the corresponding value &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. In OLS, one has the primary goal of determining the conditional mean of random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, given some explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;E[Y|x_i]&lt;/math&gt;. Quantile Regression goes beyond this and enables us to pose such a question at any quantile of the conditional distribution function. It focuses on the interrelationship between a dependent variable and its explanatory variables for a given quantile. Quantile Regression overcomes thereby various problems that OLS is confronted with. Frequently, error terms are not constant across a distribution, thereby violating the axiom of homoscedasticity. Also, by focusing on the mean as a measure of location, information about the tails of a distribution are lost. And last but not least, OLS is sensitive to extreme outliers, which can distort the results significantly. As has been indicated in the small example of the Boston Housing data, sometimes a policy based upon an OLS analysis might not yield the desired result as a certain subsection of the population does not react as strongly to this policy or even worse, responds in a negative way, which was not indicated by OLS.

'''Potato Skins''' is a dish made with Potato halves with cheese and sometimes bacon, green onions, and sour cream sprinkled on top.

==Ingredients==
*8 small baking [[Cookbook:potato|potatoes]]
*Vegetable oil
*Garlic salt
*2 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s (8 oz.) shredded [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Cheddar cheese]]
*12 slices [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]], cooked &amp; crumbled (optional)
*2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoons]] chopped fresh [[Cookbook:chive|chives]], divided

==Procedure==
Scrub potatoes and rub skins with oil. Prick each potato several times with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees for 30-45 minutes or until potatoes are done.
Allow potatoes to cool to touch. Cut top third off each potato; discard tops. Carefully scoop out pulp, leaving about 1/8 inch thick shells. (Reserve potato pulp for other uses.)

Fry potato skins in hot oil (375 degrees) for 3-4 minutes or until browned. Invert and drain on paper towels. Place potato skins, cut side up, on an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle with garlic salt and Cheddar cheese. Broil 6 inches from heat for 30 seconds or until cheese melts. Top potato skins with bacon if using them and 1 tablespoon chives.

Press green chiles between paper towels to remove excess moisture. Combine chilies, sour cream and red pepper in a small bowl; stir well. Top with remaining 1 tablespoon chives. Serve with potato skins.

Yield: 8 servings.

==Notes==
*You don't have to make the chili sour cream.  You can just put a spoonful of sour cream right onto of the potato skin.
*You can also bake these off in the oven to melt the cheese if you didn't want to fry them in oil.

Library and Information Science (LIS) is the academic and professional study of how information and information carriers are produced, disseminated, discovered, evaluated, selected, acquired, used, organized, maintained, and managed. This book intends to introduce the reader to fundamental concerns and emerging conversations in the field of library and information science.

A secondary goal of this book is to introduce readers to prominent writers, articles, and books within the field of library science.  The book originated as a collection of annotations of important LIS articles.  Though these citations are being developed into a fuller text, we hope that this book remains firmly rooted in the literature of LIS and related fields, and helps direct readers toward important resources when a particular topic strikes their fancy.

This book is primarily intended to support introductory courses in graduate-level LIS programs, but it can also be used in Library Technician programs.  When complete, this text will be [[/LSSC alignment/|aligned with the ''Foundations of library services'' competency set]] from the ALA-APA Library Support Staff Certification. Laypeople interested in the practical and theoretical considerations that information workers face will also enjoy this book.

--[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

I've seen all three of the following in books or in Google searches:

* Aρέσω το αυτοκίνητο. I like the car. 
:''This is plain wrong!'' 
:[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

:''This is regional variation (Nothern Greece, especially Salonica)''
:[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

:[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

Are all three of these correct? Do they all mean the same thing? Am I confused? In the third example, why would the genitive be used?--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 18:25, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

:''No, only the third is correct.

:It is not ''μου'', it is ''μού''. When ''μού'' is accented, it means &quot;to me&quot; &quot;σε μένα&quot;. When it is not accented it means &quot;of me&quot;.

:Here is an example in order to differentiate: 

:''Μού'' έδωσε ένα αυτοκίνητο και τώρα το αυτοκίνητο είναι δικό ''μου''.

:He gave me a car and now the car is mine''

:[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 02:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)


:The genitive is in reallity a dative, that is used mostly with pronouns:

:''I would say the dative (which is not used anymore) means &quot;to/at something/someone&quot;, while the genitive means &quot;of something/someone&quot;. It's like &quot;give&quot; and &quot;take&quot;.

:''Example:

:Δόξα τω Θεώ = Glory to God (dative)
:Δόξα του Θεού = Glory of God (genitive)''

=formatting, cognates=
Hi 83.146.62.97 - I didn't do a very good job of explaining in the text what I meant by stuff like ο λογαριασμός the bill (lit. the account, =&quot;logarithm&quot;). What I was trying to indicate with the equals signs was that the word was cognate with the English word after the equals sign. I've changed all the = to →, which I hope will lead to less confusion. I'll also add a note to the text the first time the → appears. The English word logarithm does come from the same roots as λογαριασμός (logos+arithmos).--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 04:56, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

:Bcrowell λογαριασμός does not derive from λογος + αριθμός. The word that derives from these two words is λογάριθμος (which indeed is logarithm). It is a false cognate. --[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 05:27, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

::Oops! Sorry about that. It was my favorite false cognate, too :-) --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 05:37, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

:::No worries, keep up the good work! You pave the road to all of us :-) --[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 05:42, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

=fruit=
Can someone help me understand the difference between ο καρπός and το φρούτο? A Greek speaker wrote this:
:ο καρπός (also το φρούτο in the general sense of fruits, not as products of trees)
Is το φρούτο more general than ο καρπός? Is an orange both a φρούτο and a καρπός? I deleted the explanation from the list, because it was making the format of the table hard to read by separating the two columns from each other by a wide space. Maybe we could have a note below the vocabulary list about this?--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 03:30, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

:: The word καρπός is used only to indicate something that derives from something else therefore &quot;''Το μήλο είναι ο καρπός της μηλιάς''&quot; (&quot;The apple is the fruit of the appletree&quot;). There is also the famous religious phrase &quot;''Ο καρπός της κοιλίας της''&quot; (&quot;The fruit of her womb&quot;).

:: But if we just want to categorize the apple we say &quot;''Το μήλο είναι φρούτο''&quot; (&quot;The apple is a fruit&quot;). For our purpose the word φρούτο is the correct one.--[[User:83.146.62.97|83.146.62.97]] 05:45, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

=Socrates drank the conium=
Just to say that the name of the band was not translated to that in English, it WAS that. They had an English name, this is why I put it there. See http://www.athensguide.com/socrates/

== Verb forms ==

A table of verb forms is not complete without the present of the perfective aspect. Note that the imperfect is mostly formed regularly, whereas the derivation of the ; from the perfective present often shows slight variations:
πέρνω - έπερνα
να πάρω - πήρα

One exception is έχω that has no aorist stem but an irregular imperfect είχα. Similar for είμαι. Some verbs that have dropped an initial vowel have irregular augments in the imperfect, like ήθελα, ήξερα. [[User:Andreas|Andreas]] 02:30, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for participating on [[Computer programming]]. But I must tell you that your Prolog entry does not anwer the two important questions:

# Why should I learn Prolog?
# What paradims will Prolog it teach me?

Entries which do not answer these questions will be deleted :-( . Not imediatly - we only trim down the page once a year or so ;-).

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:42, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

: A lot better - but could do with some fine tuning. I don't mean content, I mean presentation. i.E. You in one place you begin a sentence with ''Prolog was designed to help''. However, the book is centered around learning so it would be better to begin the sentence with ''Learning Prolog will help you to''. Sadly most entries make that mistake, beeing to much like a litte wikipedia - and most changes are made my anonymous users so I can't discuss the entry with them :-( . --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:03, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prepayments, also called deferrals, result from cash payment proceeds an expense or revenue recognition.  The most common example of a prepaid expense is unearned revenue.
 
Often, businesses pay for services from which they have not yet benefited e.g. rent is often paid in advance.

The double entry for a prepayment is:

{{bookkeeping journal
| page = 1
| entry =
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2005&lt;br/&gt;Feb | day = 1 | description = Prepaid Rent (Asset) | dr = 50 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Cash (Asset) | cr = 50 }}
}}


Later when the rent is actually due the entry is:

{{bookkeeping journal
| page = 1
| entry =
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2005&lt;br/&gt;Mar | day = 1 | description = Rent (Expense) | dr = 50 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Prepaid Rent (Asset) | cr = 50 }}
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">An accrual is the effect of receiving goods or services before cash payment. This will most often result in a liability on the company's books, usually as a payable.  Another type of accrual results from recognizing revenues before payment.  Note this does not include unearned revenue, which is a deferral.
 
Sometimes a business uses a service (e.g. electricity) which it has not yet been invoiced for.  The double entry for this is:
{{Drcr| date=2005&lt;br&gt;Feb | day=28 | dr = Electricity (Expense)| cr = Unpaid electricity (Liability) | amount = 130 }}

Later when this bill gets paid
{{Drcr| date=2005&lt;br&gt;Mar | day=12 | dr = Unpaid electricity (Liability)| cr = Cash (Asset) | amount = 130 }}

It is possible for an accrual to be made for telephone call charges in the period while the line rental (paid in advance) is a prepayment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definitions==
An '''economy''' consists of a set of people or individuals and their environment. Each individual in an economy has an '''economic problem'''.

An '''economic problem''' arises because each individual has unique desires (defined as experiences he or she would like to have) and a limited set of assets (consisting of human capital, possessions, and time). This limitation prevents the individual from ever satisfying all his desires and dictates his behavior.

'''Human Capital''' includes physical attributes, mental capabilities, skill, personality, associates (people she knows or know her), creativity, influence, and a philosophy of life.

'''Possessions''' are the physical objects the individual posses or, more properly, has a claim on.

'''Time''' is limited to 24 hours each day for the remainder of an individual's life.

==Economics== 
The economic problem we face forces us to ''economize'', that is, to decide which desires to satisfy and which ones to leave unsatisfied. This behavior is both economically rational and the rationale behind economics.

It is important to note that the process of economizing occurs entirely in the context of uncertainty because the consequences of our actions happen in the future (of which we know nothing), and our decisions are made while being unaware of all things which exist in the present. 

'''Economics''' then is the study of the consequences of economizing in the context of uncertainty. 
Economics is relevant as an internal model against which we can compare our present situation and make better decisions about our behavior. It does not give a set of tools to use, but rather an understanding of the world in which we live.

Blender's user interface is very flexible and often provides more than one way to do something.  Many operations that can be done by clicking on buttons and menus can also be done with keyboard shortcuts called &quot;hotkeys&quot;.  The hotkey is usually much faster than the corresponding mouse action, so it's a good idea to learn them as soon as possible.

An entire WikiBook (titled ''[[Blender 3D: HotKeys]]'') is devoted to Blender hotkeys.  We encourage you to refer to it as often as necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you arrive at your house, there will probably already be a set docket of bills that you will be debating.

The Parliamentarian (Parli) or Points Recorder (PR) asks for all representatives (or senators) that wish to run for Presiding Officer (PO).

Each PO candidate will then have a trial time of x amount of minutes (set by the Parli/PR).  The first PO candidate takes the chair, and then the floor is opened up for motions.  When a PO candidate takes the chair, it is customary for them to introduce themselves and establish the time signals that they will be using.

PO candidates will all have tryouts during the regular cycle of debate.  When all candidates have had their turn, the house will vote a PO in, and that PO will take over for the remainder of the congress.

At this point a few motions might be made, these include:
* Suspending the rules (motions allowed under this category vary by region)
** Direct Questioning (allows speakers to call on people asking questions instead of the PO)
** Open Chambers (Eliminates usage of the motion &quot;Rise to a point of personal privilege&quot;)
* Main Motion (begin debate)

After Main motion is called and seconded, the vote will most likely be unanimous.

From here, debate proceeds into the docket of bills and/or resolutions.

The PO will say something similar to this:
 We will now proceed to &quot;A Bill Concerning the Issue&quot;  If there are no objections, I will not read this bill. (brief pause)
 Seeing no objections, is there a speech in authorship?

(TODO) add details of authorship/sponsorship vs. affirmative speech

If there is no Authorship speech, then PO asks if there is a Sponsorship speech, and then a First Affirmative speech.

After the first speech (authorship/sponsorship/first affirmation), then the PO calls for a speech in Negation.

After the negation speech, the PO asks if there are any motions.

Debate then falls into a loop that is similar to this pattern:
* Aff Speech
* Neg Speech
* Motions

This loop is followed until previous question is passed, or the bill is tabled.

Debate on other bills follows the same pattern as above.

At the end of the day, the PR and Parli will have a list of nominated members that the chamber ranks in order.

This ranking is combined with rankings by the PR and Parli to determine placing.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Kyriakos. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Kyriakos~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

== Different Methods ==
Before we start, let's discuss the different methods of making this box. There are a couple different ways of putting it together:

*The Puzzle Piece Method (Recommended for this Tutorial): Make the separate lines (the x, y, and z axis) and put them together like a puzzle using copy and paste to duplicate the lines. Good for uniformity and if you aren't making different length of your lines. 
*The Line by Line Method: Create each line individually. Good if you don't like using copy and paste or if your shape is not uniform (like a person or animal) but is extremely easy to mess up. 
*(Not Recommended for this Tutorial)Pixel by Pixel Method: Pros: Makes for really good quality pictures with unparallel uniformity, if done right. Cons: Takes a extremely LONG TIME.  

== Math? IN ART? ==
That's right! We are going to do a quickly lesson in geometry. For your pixel line lengths, I suggest them being multiples of each other (ex: 2 x 2 = 4; 2 x 3 = 6). This makes it look more like a real cube. Also, we must remember that the lines must be of equal length for it to be a real cube. Isometric lengths make this really hard to do, because each axis has a different scale (ex: The X axis (up and down)compared to the Y axis (left to right)are equal, but they are both different from the Z axis (forward and backward)). Eyeball it and find out what looks right to you. 

*The &quot;Golden Rule&quot; of Isometric Pixel Art is that for every 2 pixels in the Z axis (front to back) there is one pixel for the X or Y axis (up and down, left and right). Although this may not always work for every single thing you draw isometrically, it is the general rule so remember it!

== Let's Begin! ==


[[File:Ispa_b_0.jpg|left|frame|I highly suggest drawing the X axis and Z axis first. Make one corner like this.]]
[[File:Ispa_b_1.jpg|left|frame|Then flip that vertically, to make this.  Mind the corner- it should be three pixels wide, as opposed to two like the rest of the box!]]
[[File:Ispa_b_2.jpg|frame|left|Duplicate what you have and move it down the X axis a bit]]
[[File:Ispa_b_3.jpg|frame|left|Now connect]]
[[File:Ispa_b_4.jpg|frame|left|Erase a few lines and fill in different shades for a nice, completed box]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: left&quot;/&gt;



Congratulations! You've just made your first isometric drawing!

==Is pixel art out-dated?==
Technology is used to create art, but once art exists, it transcends technology. Pixel art exists as a technique, and it remains infinite in potential. Pixel art is not replaced by any other newer art forms but rather exists alongside them and offers unique stylistic properties. It also allows for distinct individual artists' styles.Well-loved video game art from the pixel art era will remain celebrated and rediscovered indefinitely.In addition, with the rise in popularity of mobile phone games, pixel art has resumed its practical status. Thriving enthusiast and hobbyist communities also exist online.

==Do I have to buy a special program?==
By all means, NO! Do not go out and buy a program just for this Wikibook. Most Operating Systems come with a pixel-based art program and it is easy to obtain one for free if you do not have one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Multiple Document Interface''' (MDI) applications are a very common and popular type of application. MDI applications allow a single program window to contain multiple open workspaces simultaneously. Creating them isn't particularly tricky, and this chapter will attempt to explain the process in detail.

== Steps to Making an MDI ==

These are the steps to making an MDI application. We will explain each of them.

#Register the Frame and Child window classes.
#Modify the message loop.
#Create the frame window.
#Create the MDI Client
#Create MDI child windows with the client.

== Register the Window Classes ==

Like any other windows application, we need to register the window classes. The main window (the frame, or the &quot;parent&quot; window) needs to be created. Frame windows are just like any other window, but they generally have a background color of COLOR_APPWORKSPACE. Also, the child windows in an MDI application are not allowed to have their own menus, so the Frame window must manage the application menu. Remember, that different child windows usually require different menu choices (or different menus all together), so the Frame window needs to maintain a current record of the active child window, and set the menu accordingly.

The child window class (all of them) needs to be created with WS_CHILD class. An MDI application may have any number of different types of child windows (a famous example is the use of spreadsheets and charts in Microsoft Excel), and they all need to be registered before use.

== Modify the Message Loop ==

MDI applications use an almost-normal message loop, but if you want to use accelerators in your program, you need to add a new step:

 while(GetMessage(&amp;msg, hwndFrame, 0, 0))
 {
    if(!TranslateMDISysAccel(hwndClient, &amp;msg) &amp;&amp;
       !TranslateAccelerator(hwndFrame, hAccel, &amp;msg))
    {
        TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
        DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
    }
 }

This way the accelerators get routed to the correct destination among all the different child windows. If you are not using accelerators, you don't need to worry about this step.

== The Frame Window ==

Frame Windows get created like any other windows. Remember, however, that frame windows are just a backdrop for the action that is happening in the child windows, so you shouldn't get to crazy or fancy with your background artwork.

== The Client Window ==

You need to create a window of type &quot;MDICLIENT&quot;. MDICLIENT windows are defined internally in Windows, so you don't need to worry about what it is or what it does. When you create an MDI client window, you first need to fill out the fields in the CLIENTCREATESTRUCT structure. You pass a pointer to this structure as the LPARAM data field in the CreateWindow function.

== MDI Child Windows ==

Creating MDI child windows is a little bit different from creating normal windows. To create an MDI child window, you must fill out the MDICREATESTRUCT data structure. The MDICREATESTRUCT is very similar to the WNDCLASS structure, except it is more limited. After creating this structure, you must send it as a message to the MDICLIENT window:

 hwndChild = (HWND)SendMessage(hwndClient, WM_MDICREATE, 0, (LPARAM)mdicreatestruct);

The message function will return a handle to the newly created child window.

== The &quot;Window&quot; Menu ==

Many MDI applications will offer a &quot;Window&quot; popup menu on the menu bar, to manage the MDI child windows. This menu frequently has options to &quot;Tile&quot; or &quot;Cascade&quot; the child windows, and it frequently maintains a listing of the currently available child windows in the application. It turns out that the MDI Client window will manage this menu for you, if you just pass it the correct handle to the menu.

I like this idea, but I think it would be best if we had a template for it so it does not seem thrown together!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Role of Resource Analysis in Strategy Formulation ==

Intangible assets are often overlooked, but they are many times the only source of sustainable competitive advantage (ie. brand, technology, information, culture, etc).

Taking the lead from military campaigns in which the goal is to pitch &quot;strength against weakness&quot;(1), business strategy should be defined by resource analysis rather than the inverse.  Firms that base their strategy on the development of specific capabilities have shown better adaptability than those that base their strategy on their customers or on how to serve them. One can take Merrill Lynch, American Express and Sears as having examples of failed strategies (being too broad and having an emphasis on customer needs), and Honda and 3M Corporation as having examples of successful strategies (with a focus on the capability of making engines and adhesives respectively).

Basically, any element that is traditionally considered to support competitive advantage can be seen as stemming from the correct acquisition and use of resources. For example, barriers to entry can be created by owning a strong brand, patents, or retaliatory capacity. A monopoly is nothing more than ownership of market share. Cost advantages come from process technology, size of plants, and access to low-cost inputs. Finally, Differentiation advantage comes from a brand, product technology, or marketing, distribution, and service capabilities.

|Human technology, reputation, skills
|}

=== Tangible Resources ===
Tangible resources are the easiest to evaluate since they are visible and quantifiable. Two key questions underlie this procedure(2): 
*What opportunities exist for economizing on finance, inventories, and fixed assets?
*What are the possibilities for employing existing assets more profitable?

=== Intangible Resources ===
Much of a company's worth comes from less defined assets such as '''reputation''', '''technology''', or '''a particular set of cultural attributes within the company'''. Intel and American Express have successfully protected their intangibles, while Xerox has repeatedly over-looked its core assets. Brand is everything for Coca-Cola, and Gillette, while software and pharmaceutical companies depend mosty on their technology and patents. 

=== Human Resources ===
People in companies provide skills, knowledge, intuition, and reasoning (known as [[Managerial Economics/Introduction|human capital]]). Additionally, the culture inside an organization consists of relationships, values, and routines, and companies that have a strong set of managerial values have a strategic advantage over those that don't- through employees increased identity with corporation, increased stability and consistency as well as a guide for appropriate behaviour.

== Core Competences ==
Hamel and Prahalad introduced the term &quot;core competences&quot; (3) in 1990 to describe those competences that a) &quot;make a disproportionate contribution to ultimate customer value or to the efficiency with which that value is delivered,&quot; and b) &quot;provide a basis for entering new markets.&quot;

So the question to ask in this case is &quot;What can such and such firm do better than others?&quot;

The process of identifying core capabilities can begin in many ways; the two more common ones are through a classification of all capabilities according to function, or through a ''value chain'' analysis that separates a firm into small ''sequential'' activities.

Example of a value chain:

Technology (patents) &gt;&gt; Product Design (quality) &gt;&gt; Manufacturing (assembly) &gt;&gt; Marketing (brand) &gt;&gt; Distribution (warehousing) &gt;&gt; Service (warranty)

=== Benchmarking ===
Benchmarking is important because it brings objectivity into the process of identifying competences. It also brings vain imaginations down to the ground. 
To create a benchmark, one must identify areas of potential improvement; identify world-leading companies in each area; contact the companies (visit, talk to managers, discuss with workers); and define goals based on the learning done at those companies.

=== Integration mechanisms ===

== Appraising competitive advantage ==
A source of competitive advantage must be ''scarce'', ''relevant'', ''durable'', ''immobile'', and ''unreplicable''. 

== Appraising Resources and Capabilities ==
Resources and capabilities need to be appraised against two key criteria. First is their importance: which resources and capabilities are most important in conferring sustainable competitive advantage? Second, where are our strengths and weaknesses as compared with competitors?

Wondering what you can do with that silly old box? Here's some examples.

== Skyscraper! ==

Make the Y axis lines longer and check it out! It's now a skyscraper! 

[[Image:ISO_Skyscraper.GIF]]

== Chessboard! ==
Make the boxes black and white and make a chessboard!

[[Image:ISO_ChessBoard.GIF]]

== Table! ==
Make a rectangle composed out of boxes (2 x 3 should do)


Make a &quot;flattened&quot; box (less X axis)to make the table top.

[[Image:ISO_Table_Step_2.GIF]]

Then erase the middle lines in the front of the rectangle.

[[Image:ISO_Table_Step_3.GIF]]

Turn the three lines on the outside into legs and erase all the lines on the bottom.

[[Image:ISO_Table_Step_4.GIF]]

A table! Yay! Perfect for fancy dinner parties. Well, maybe not yet.

[[Image:ISO_Table_Step_5.GIF]]

First we have to talk about detailing.

A group of stones that are all connected along the lines of the board (vertically or horizontally). All stones in one chain share their [[#Liberty|liberties]]. Also &quot;block&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, or &quot;[[#Group|group]]&quot;.

==Group==
Either a synonym for [[#Chain|chain]] or used to refer to several chains considered together that co-operate or that could be trivially connected.

==Liberty==
An empty point adjacent to a single stone or [[#Chain|chain]] of stones.

==Point==
Either the scoring unit or an intersection on the board. In [[Computer Go/Tromp-Taylor Rules|Tromp-Taylor]] terminology, a point may be colored black, white, or empty. Using boards, coloring a point black or white means placing a stone of that color on the point. Coloring a point empty, i.e. emptying a point, means removing the stone from it.

==Suicide==
Self-capture; a move that does not capture any stones and in which the stone just placed has no [[#Liberty|liberties]].

==Superko==
The rule that no move can repeat an earlier board position. In [[Computer Go/Tromp-Taylor Rules|Tromp-Taylor]] terminology, a move that repeats an earlier grid coloring violates the superko rule. Variants of the rule exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Representing the Board==

One of the first problems that all Go programs must solve is how to store the
current state of the game. The simplest representation needs to at least
implement:

* a way to determine whether a given [[Computer Go/Glossary#Point|point]] contains a black piece, a white piece, or is empty
* a way to place a piece, or remove a piece from a given point
* a way to store which point (if any) is illegal due to the Ko rule&lt;sup&gt;[[#Footnotes|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Sample Code===
&lt;pre&gt;
public class Board {
	public Point koPoint;

	private int boardSize;
	private Color[][] board;

	public Color getColor(Point p) {
		board[p.x][p.y];
	}

	public void setColor(Point p, Color color) {
		board[p.x][p.y] = color;
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some programs, like [[Computer Go/GNU Go|GNU Go]], use a one-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional array. This has several advantages:
* a point on the board can be represented by a single integer
* one computation is often sufficient for a 1D-coordinate where two would be required for 2D-coordinates

For more information on this strategy, see [[Representing the board as a one-dimensional array]].

Most programs also store additional information that makes it easier to evaluate board positions; we will cover these strategies in a later section.

==Footnotes==
&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; For simplicity's sake, our program will assume the [[Computer Go/Tromp-Taylor Rules|Tromp-Taylor Rules]], ignoring [[Computer Go/Glossary#Superko|superko]], with the additional stipulation that [[Computer Go/Glossary#Suicide|suicide]] is illegal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Recognizing Illegal Moves==

A non-passing move is legal if the point is unoccupied, the point is not illegal due to the Ko rule, and the move is not suicide. A move is not suicide if any of the following conditions holds true:
* any neighboring point is empty
* any neighboring point is the same color and has more than one liberty
* any neighboring point is a different color and has only one liberty

From the code we currently have, we can determine if a point is unoccupied and if a point is illegal due to the Ko rule. What we need now is code to loop through the neighbors of a particular point, as well as code that will determine the number of liberties of a given group.

The first is trivial:

&lt;pre&gt;
private List&lt;Point&gt; getNeighbors(Point p) {
	List&lt;Point&gt; neighbors = new ArrayList&lt;Point&gt;();

	if (p.x &gt; 0) neighbors.add(new Point(p.x - 1, p.y));
	if (p.x &lt; boardSize - 1) neighbors.add(new Point(p.x + 1, p.y));
	if (p.y &gt; 0) neighbors.add(new Point(p.x, p.y - 1));
	if (p.y &lt; boardSize - 1) neighbors.add(new Point(p.x, p.y + 1));

	return neighbors;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Determining the number of liberties of a given group is a little more difficult. Because the number of liberties of any given group is important information that is accessed frequently, most programs store a list of all groups on the board (and their liberties) and update it incrementally, rather than calculate it every time it is needed. We'll start out using a much simpler method: [[w:Flood fill|flood fill]].

This algorithm starts at the point in question, changes it to the opposite color, and then recursively performs the algorithm on every neighboring point of the original color. By remembering all neighboring empty points, we can determine the number of liberties of the group.

&lt;pre&gt;
private Set&lt;Point&gt; getLiberties(Point p) {
	Set&lt;Point&gt; liberties = new HashSet&lt;Point&gt;();

	Color myColor = getColor(p);
	Color floodfillColor = myColor.opposite();
	setColor(p, floodfillColor);

	List&lt;Point&gt; neighbors = getNeighbors(p);
	for (Point neighbor : neighbors) {
		if (getColor(neighbor) == myColor) {
			liberties.addAll(getLiberties(neighbor));
		} else if (getColor(neighbor) == EMPTY) {
			liberties.add(neighbor);
		}
	}

	return liberties;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Unfortunately this algorithm changes the board, so we need to make sure that we only ever perform it on a copy of the board.

&lt;pre&gt;
private boolean inAtari(Point p) {
	return clone().getLiberties(p).size() == 1;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we have all the resources required to determine if a given move is legal.

&lt;pre&gt;
public boolean isLegal(Point p, Color c) {
	 // Is the point already occupied?
	if (getColor(p) != EMPTY) {
		return false;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most movements have a caliber number-In most cases this will be below the balance wheel.  In some cases it will be on one of the bridges, and occasionally it will be on the dial side, only visible by removing the dial.  There may be several designations--It is common for the visible indications to mention the brand of the watch company, while the semi-hidden marks will tell who actually made the movement.  Bulova has its own movement codes, and generally have this code on a bridge.  Often however this Bulova movement was made by someone else and only minorly updated, this will usually have the maker's marks in their usual place under the balance.  [http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&amp;ranfft&amp;&amp;2uswk Ranftt.de] has a very good online database of movements, searchable by number, with pictures and a varying amount of info.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Scene Breakdown Page may be useful information if your play is structured in a series of formal Scenes in changing locations and time periods. It's also a good way to make a complicated Time Structure clear to a reader. But if you have fewer than 6 Scenes, it works as well to list them under each Act on the Setting &amp; Time Page. 
And it's a clear way to indicate what kind of demands you're really putting on the Scene and Lighting Designers. If what you're doing with design is out of the ordinary, it's also a good idea to add a brief statement about this to your description on the Setting &amp; Time page. 

Here's one way of doing it . .

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page contains general maintanence information applicable to most tractor models.

This page is part of the Chinese Tractor Maintenance book. Go to the [[Chinese Tractor Maintenance]] book.

== Fluids== 

This section is a summary of the recommendations of Chinese tractor owners for changing fluids in their tractors. The fluids of concern here are cooling, hydraulic fluid, engine oil and gear oil. Recommendations for fluids to change and the fluids to use when you first get your tractor are given. General procedures for changing fluids are described that are applicable to most tractors. Procedures for specific tractor models can be found in sections for the tractor model.

=== Changing Fluids After Delivery ===

Tractors are delivered in two likely conditions:
* Crate
* Assembled

If your tractor arrives disassembled in a crate (a crate tractor) then it is highly recommended that you change all of your fluids before running the tractor. Although fluids shipped with crate tractors are improving, there is a long history of these fluids being of substandard quality and causing mechanical problems long before the factory recommended first fluid change.

Another issue with the Chinese tractors is the metal shavings, chips, flakes, dust and dropped parts that the manufacturing process leaves in the fluid pathways that have not been cleaned out. By removing the original fluids, flushing, replacing filters and replacing the fluids you will remove most of the offending material. This will reduce clogging, premature wear and breakdown of your tractor.

If you are buying/have bought an assembled tractor from a dealer, ask the dealer if the fluids have been changed. If the dealer has changed the fluids you may want to ask some details about how it was done. If no flushing was done during the fluid change then you may still want to do your own fluid change.

Regardless of whether you change the fluids when you first receive your tractor you should replace them after you have run the tractor for a few hours (5-10 hours). During the first few hours of operation many mill marks on mating metal surfaces of moving parts will wear off and be suspended in the working fluid, caught in a filter or settled on the bottom of a pan. Any metal fragments that remain suspended in the fluid will cause additional wear on the tractor's working parts. These metal flakes should be removed after a few hours by flushing and replacing the fluids to prevent unneeded wear.

=== General Fluid Change/Flushing Procedure ===

This section contains general instructions for flushing out the fluids the first time you change the fluids in your tractor. Subsequent fluid replacement should not require flushing unless you detect excessive metal particles in the drained fluid.

Kerosene can be used as the flushing agent. It has sufficient lubrication that it can be used for a short time for running in your tractor for the engine oil, hydraulic oil and gear oil. It is thin enough to work as a solvent to break loose metal particles in pans and on the walls of fluid passageways.

Kerosene can be reused if it is filtered between uses. About 10 gallons will be sufficient for most Subcompact and Compact Chinese tractors if it is reused. It can be run through an oil filter for filtering.

Since gear oil is the heaviest oil in your tractor, if you are reusing the kerosene for flushing all of the oil based fluids, perform the gear oil flush last.

==== Engine Oil

The main function of engine oil is to keep the engine cool and maintain its temperature in cold weather too and to dissolve the dirt particle in it and set them down.The additive in engine oil work as a detergent and mix the dirt particles in it and keep away from the engine from friction.The good engine oil will always in its natural colour that is golden.The best engine oil does not contains any colour additives,it will be in pure golden colour.
The shell rimula and helix are the best engine oil of the world.

==== Injector Pump Fluid Change ====

(TBS)

==== Hydraulic Fluid Change/Flush ====

(Intro TBS)

The following is the procedure for replacing the hydraulic fluid:

* Drain the hydraulic fluid:
** Start tractor.
** Allow the engine to run a few minutes to warm up the hydraulic fluid and pump.
** Cycle the 3 Point Hitch (3PH) a few times. Leave the 3 Point Hitch fully raised.
** If you have a Front End Loader (FEL) cycle the lift and bucket on the Front End Loader a few times. Leave in the up position.
** Turn off engine.
** Place bucket under hydraulic fluid reservoir drain.
** Open drain on hydraulic fluid reservoir.
** Lower the 3PH.
** Lower the FEL.
** At this point for tractor owners with a single pump for both Hydraulics and power steering the following is done:
*** Follow the procedure in [[#Power Steering Fluid Change/Flush]]
** Close the reservoir drain.
** If there is fluid remaining in the reservoir then you can remove it with a suction device like a turkey baster.
** Locate the hydraulic fluid screen if you have one. Clean the screen and put it back in. If you have a hydraulic fluid filter then leave it in place for now.
* If you which to flush the hydraulic system (see [[#Changing Fluids After Delivery]]) then do the following:
** Fill the hydraulic reservior with kerosene.
** Follow the procedures to drain the hydraulic fluid.
* If you have a hydraulic fluid filter then replace it.
* Fill the hydraulic fluid reservoir.
* Start the engine and cycle the 3PH and/or FEL.
* If the hydraulics do not work then follow the procedure here [[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/Trouble Shooting#Replacing/Flushing Hydraulic Fluid Caused 3 Point Hitch/FEL/Power Steering To Quit Working]]

==== Power Steering Fluid Change/Flush ====

* Drain Power Steering:
** Raise front end of tractor (allows wheels to be turned).
** Remove the hydraulic hoses from steering cylidner.
** Turn steering wheel left and right.
** Reattach hydraulic hoses to power steering cylinder.
** Lower front end of tractor.

==== Gear Oil Change/Flush ====

The oil used in the transmission and rear axle is normally the same as in  is used in the 4x4 front axle. Also use the same procedure for flushing.

===== Transmission/Rear Axle Fluid Change Flush =====

* Drain out the old gear oil. See the section for your specific tractor for the location of the drain plugs.
* Fill the transmission and axle to the  normal level with kerosene.
* Start up the engine (you didn't drain the engine oil and forget to put it back in did you?) and drive the tractor. Use both forward and reverse gears so that the faces of the gears get flushed. This should only require a few minutes.
* Stop the tractor and park on a level surface.
* Drain the kerosene from the transmission and axle.
* Refill the transmission and axle with your choice of gear oil. 
** Fill until the dip stick shows full or oil drips out of the unscrewed weep hole in the housing (whichever is applicable). 
** Since gear oil can be thick it can take time for it to level out throughout its housing. When you think you have it full wait for 10 minutes and then check again. It may require several iterations of filling and waiting to completely fill the gear case.

===== 4x4 Front Axle Fluid Change Flush =====

Do the front axle flush at the same time as the transmission if you have sufficient kerosene. Follow the same procedure as with the transmission.

==== Fuel ====

Another &quot;fluid&quot; to change is the fuel. Just to be on the safe side it is a good idea to drain the fuel from the fuel system. You don't know how long the fuel has been in the tank or what its quality is. Replacing the fuel might prevent you from having to clean/replace your fuel injectors.


* Drain fuel tank.
* Drain sediment bowl.
* Replace the fuel filter.
* Fill fuel tank.

If there seems to be significant sediment or &quot;chunks&quot; in your drained fuel you may have algae in your tank. When you put new fuel in the tank obtain some biocide and add the recommended amount.

=== Replacement Fluids ===

There are a great variety of brands and types of fluids that can be successfully used in your Chinese tractor. Many of the fluids have been found by owners at Walmart and Napa.

==== Engine Oil ====

(Intro TBS)

In cold weather climates a lighter weight engine oil should be used to aid in cold cranking and to reduce the work load on the engine.

Engine oils used successfully by Chinese tractor owners include:
* Shell Rotella or Delo 400 15W/40
* shell Rimula 20w/40 is a multigrade oil and best for tractors

==== Injector Pump Fluid ====

Use non-detergent oil. Use a weight appropriate for your air temperature. 30wt is a good all-around choice.

==== Hydraulinc Fluid / Power Steering  ====

In cold weather climates a lighter weight fluid should be used to aid increase the operating speed of the equipment.

Hydraulic fuild that has been successfully used by Chinese tractor owners include:
* AW32  (for cold country). (will speed up operation).
* Walmart Super Tech Transmission/Hydraulic oil (not all walmarts have it).

==== Coolant ====

(TBS)

==== Gear Oil ====

Gear oil is used in the tractor transmission/rear axle and if the tractor has 4 wheel drive it us used in the front axle. 

Since Chinese tractors use &quot;yellow metal&quot; for some parts the gear oil must be yellow metal safe. Yellow metal is copper, brass, bronze etc. The gear oil that you buy should say on the label that it is &quot;yellow metal safe&quot;. Gear oil that does not say that it is &quot;yellow metal safe&quot; may have added agents to aid in its performance in high heat and/or high pressure environments. These additives will cause oxidation of the yellow metal. The oxidation will cause pits in the surface of the metal and eventually the part will fail. One sign that your yellow metal has oxidized is a black color on the surface.

Gear oil should show that it is low/anti foaming on the label.

Gear oils that have been successfully used by Chinese tractor owners include:
* Rotella GL-4 - walmart
* GL-5 80W/90
* Super Tech 85W/140
* Kubota Super UDT (true synthetic for winter).

==== Fuel ====

Diesel fuel obtained from your local filling station as well as truck stops can be used in your tractor.

== Cooling System ==

=== Radiator Fin Cleaning ===

The radiator fins, over time, accumulate dust and debri between the fins reducing the cooling efficiency of the radiator. This causes the engine to run hotter.

When dust and/or debri builds up between the fins the fins must be cleaned. One method of cleaning
is to use compressed air.
* Remove the radiator screen
* Blow the compressed air into the BACK of the radiator so that the debri goes back out the front of the radiator. Trying to blow air into the front of the raditor may cause debri to become lodged tigher into the radiator fins.
* Replace the radiator screen.

High pressure water is NOT recommended for cleaning the radiator. This can easily damage the radiator fins.

To reduce the amount of debri entering the radiator the radiator screen can be replaced by a filter or agugmented. See [[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/Modified Cooling System#Radiator Screen]]

'''Visible light''' (commonly referred to simply as '''light''') is electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye, and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light has a wavelength in the range of about 380 nanometres to about 740&amp;nbsp;nm – between the invisible infrared, with longer wavelengths and the invisible ultraviolet, with shorter wavelengths.

Primary properties of visible light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarisation, while its speed in a vacuum, 299,792,458 meters per second (about 300,000 kilometers per second), is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found to always move at this speed in vacuum.

In common with all types of EMR, visible light is emitted and absorbed in tiny &quot;packets&quot; called photons, and exhibits properties of both waves and particles. This property is referred to as the wave–particle duality. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.

In physics, the term ''light'' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello fellow reader and welcome to this tutorial on the [[w:Tagalog language|Tagalog language]].  As a major [[w:Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]] and, as [[w:Filipino language|Filipino]], the national language of the Philippines, Tagalog can help you get by in the Philippines better.

==Why Study Tagalog?==
* The next time you visit the Philippines, you don't need to take your ''Tagalog-English'' ''English-Tagalog'' dictionary when asking where the toilet is.

* Speaking Tagalog helps you to gain more Filipino friends.

* You hate the Western Cold weather and finding some beaches to sunbathe in and communicating in Tagalog the next time you visit the country will help you to NOT-GET-LOST when touring around.  (The Philippines might have a large population of English speakers but this doesn't mean that everyone in the country understands English fluently.)

* You might get pissed when some of the Filipino people start talking in Tagalog and you might think they're talking about you, learning Tagalog will help you understand what they're talking about and the next time you see some talking in Tagalog you won't get misinterpretation of what they're talking about.

* You're obsessed of eating Filipino foods but you don't understand the menu because it's written in pure Tagalog.  After learning some Tagalog you will understand what the menu says and you'll know what you're consuming.

* You might also love reading literature, [[w:Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]] and [[w:El Filibusterismo|El Filibusterismo]] by [[w:José Rizal|José Rizal]] are mostly translated into Tagalog however its main form was in Spanish, you might not understand Spanish nor Tagalog, but after studying Tagalog the books will catch your heart.

==Demographics==
Tagalog is the native language of 22 million [[w:Filipino people|Filipinos]] and is the largest of all the [[w:Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]].  More than 65 million people, roughly about three-fourths of the Philippine population, have learned Tagalog as their second language to varying degrees of comprehension.

Tagalog is one of the keys to Philippine culture.  By studying it, you unlock an amalgamation of Malay, Arab, Indian, Latin and European cultures.

However, there are catches to learning Tagalog.  For example, accentation can differentiate different forms of a word with the same spelling (as in ''hapon'', which can mean either &quot;afternoon&quot; or as a reference to Japan), as in [[Spanish]], but accents are usually not written.  This can create confusion at first.

Also, Tagalog can use different word orders but that mean the same thing: an example is the Wikipedia slogan, which can be translated as ''Ang Malayang Ensiklopedya'' (the English word order) or ''Ang Ensiklopedyang Malaya'' (the Spanish word order).

Learning Tagalog, however, can be made easier if one knows how to speak Spanish or languages such as [[w:Malay language|Malay]] or [[Indonesian]], which Tagalog either has cognates or has borrowed words from.  It helps create a better learning experience.

==Redundancy==

I notice a systematic occurence of redundancy. ...

''Yes. When I see it, I try to follow the advice in [[Help:Pages#Merging|Wikibooks:Duplicate_modules]]. (moved text to [[Help talk:Pages|Wikibooks talk:Duplicate modules]].) --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:09, 2 January 2006 (UTC)''

==Can I advertise a Wiki site on Wikipedia?==
Hello! I'm currently working on a website that is part Wiki, but will also present non-editable information (a compilation of experts' opinions) in HTML help format. Naturally it will be free to all visitors, but because I have to eat, I hope to sell advertising on it. 
When it's ready, I'd like to make current Wiki users aware of it -- what is the best way to do this? Can I buy an ad? If so, how much would it cost?

Many thanks!

*While this question would be better suited for Wikipedia (since that is what you are asking about), I think I can answer it. Wikipedia does not sell ad space. If your wiki is a valid source or resource, you can just add it to the bottom of the article on the topic that your wiki covers. WP does not allow too many vanity links, so make sure it is germane to the article. But, no, there is no rule stopping sites with ads from being placed on Wikipedia. Hope this helps. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:40, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

* I see that several other wiki already sell advertising. The biggest one I know of is http://wikicities.com/ . Wikicities sells advertising in the form of Google ads. To get an ad posted there, I think (?) you buy them from Google http://www.google.com/ads/ .

== Permission error &quot;deletedhistory&quot; ==

In the past, I could read edit histories of deleted pages, but now, I am being blocked from such pages with message like:

:''The action you have requested is limited to users with the &quot;deletedhistory&quot; permission assigned. See [[Wikibooks:Administrators]].'' [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/366_Photographs_on_the_Beach]

I cannot find anything at en.wikibooks.org, meta.wikimedia.org, www.mediawiki.org, bugs.wikipedia.org, or foundation-l that mentions &quot;deletedhistory&quot; permission. Thus I assume that this is a bug, and that I should be able to read histories of deleted pages.

Has anyone noticed this problem on wikis other than English Wikibooks? Also, is bugs.wikipedia.org the correct place for me to complain about this? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:37, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

:I know that the developers are experimenting with a few ideas, but I thought that was supposed to be on test wikis before it went &quot;live&quot; on major Wikimedia projects.  I havn't heard about this on Foundation-l, and yes, the MediaWiki bugzilla is an appropriate place to complain about this and other similar kinds of problems... or Foundation-l if it is really annoying changes.  I just tried it with my admin status and I'm able to get the history with sysop status, but when I'm logged in anonymously I get the same message you just listed above.  In the past I have had only the edit history show up without sysop status (you still can't undelete), and this may be a new &quot;permission&quot; the developers are experimenting with.  Let's see what else is going to happen with this in the near future, and bureaucrats ought to be able to &quot;grant&quot; this permission to individual users. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:24, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

::After some review, you should [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2005-December/033283.html read this e-mail message] on Wikitech-l that discusses this very issue.  I guess it is a new permission for now. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:28, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

I created '''[[Bugzilla:4414]]'''. While I was there, I voted for [[Bugzilla:939]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:12, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
----
Well we had this same issue just this morning. After trawling the Internet and the MediaWiki Forums with no answers, a Google search pointed us to this link http://dimer.tamu.edu/simplog/archive.php?blogid=7&amp;cid=0 
You have to edit LocalSetting.php and add this: $wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['deletedhistory'] = true; 


All of the lists on the category pages are empty! '''[[Bugzilla:4443]]''' --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:12, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

== Navigation Bar Thoughts ==

I've considered trying to update/change the navigation bar that appears at the left (or whereever on the skin you are using) that appears on all page views of Wikibooks.  What I'd like to get is some input from the community as to what should go there.

Some thoughts on the subject would be to add a link to this page ([[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]]) as well as possibly [[Wikiversity]] as well.  I'd also like to get rid of the Random Module link as it seems silly and not really useful for new users (although a cute play toy to put on the Community Portal page perhaps).  It is easier for us as admins to replace existing links with something else, but if we come up with a solid plan we can also get some developer support, including reording the links as well.

*Yeah, the random article is nice to have on 'pedia, when you just want to look up something random, but not as useful here(especially since a lot of modules by themselves aren't too useful or interesting, and a lot of individual articles don't have navigation links back to the whole book), so I don't really see any use for it. Maybe a link to [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves|All Bookshelves]] would be more useful there, although you can get to that from the front page. (My entry point is on Recent Changes, since I tend to look at that more than any other page, and the front page doesn't change too often--perhaps something else that could be taken into consideration.) [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 17:50, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

*A link to [[Project:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]] is a good idea. Many MediaWikis already have links like this.&lt;p&gt;Adding a link to [[Wikiversity]] is also a good idea.

I occasionally use it to find random broken pages to fix or delete. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:09, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

I've made the changes to the sidebar.  It is really easier than I thought, and this is a feature that is not used too often on other projects as well as it could be.

== [[How to Certify a Passport]] ==
&lt;s&gt;Erm, I stumbled upon this page, and I don't believe it is to be deleted, but what are we supposed to do with stubs like these? I doubt it would be turned into a complete book, and there are no books (to my knowledge) that this could be merged into. 

Another thing that scares me is tha we are becomming Wikipedia's dumping ground. [[Wikipedia:How-to]] How-to may fit here, but they should go into a book of some sort, and not just be dumped unorganized into wikibooks. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:02, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

:Wikipedia is getting better, but any transfers to Wikibooks should be through the transwiki namespace first, unless the location for the new Wikibook is clear.  We need to simply hold the line on this issue and make sure that the editors on Wikipedia know what qualifies as Wikibooks material.  I guess they are trying to do some &quot;house cleaning&quot; on Wikipedia by a bunch of deletionists, and Wikibooks openly proclaims that we are a home to &quot;How-to&quot; books.  There is a lot of random junk all over Wikibooks unfortunately at the moment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

== Main pages in books should display their bookshelf ==

Is there any policy on this? If there isn't, could we create it? At least as a guideline? I think it'd be very helpful to have a link back to a book's bookshelf. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:32, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

: I've created two templates in my user space that can help with this.  Both are intended to be used at the bottom of the page.

To specify, for example, the Humanities bookshelf, the Bookshelf_name parameter should be &quot;Humanities&quot;, not &quot;Wikibooks:Humanities&quot; or &quot;Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf&quot;.
:* [[User:JMRyan/Shelf2]] presumes that it will be used on every of a book.  It is called with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:JMRyan/Shelf2|Bookshelf_name|Book_name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; where the second parameter is optional.
: The idea here is to create a [[Template:Shelf]] page by copying one of these two templates.  If we want recommend that the bookshelf be linked from every page of a book, then copy from [[User:JMRyan/Shelf2]]; if we want to recommend that the bookshelf be linked only from the main page of a book, then copy from [[User:JMRyan/Shelf1]].

== References to books? ==

I figured out that if you type &quot;ISBN&quot; followed by a number, a link is displayed that enables your readers to buy the book from Amazon (or three other stores). I presume that Amazon then pays the 5% referral fee to Wiki. OK, so how do I format it so that &quot;ISBN&quot; and the number are hidden, and the title of book appears as a link? Here's the link I'm working on: ISBN 1573240648 &quot;The Open Mind&quot; by Dawna Markova. I tried various brackets, curly brackets, pipes, etc.

:http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:ISBN_links doesn't offer too much help. I don't believe it can be done due to the way pages are rendered. Your best bet may be to create a template for special use like the help suggests. Also, I don't think Wikimedia is getting any money out of those links. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 05:10, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

The wikibooks resources for a given ISBN seems to be a lot more sparse than the wikipedia equivalent, eg ISBN 0949853054 vs [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Booksources&amp;isbn=0949853054] . Is there any particular reason for this? Andjam 07:33, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

There's another danger. Let's say there's a standard way to reference books, and every time a book is referenced, the link goes to Amazon, and Wikimedia earns 5%. Sounds good, right? It won't be long until someone writes a script to spider every Wikimedia page looking for those standardized book references, and changes the account name that Amazon pays the 5% to. I.e., steals money from Wikimedia, and it could be a lot of money.

:That's certainly a likely thing... however if the referrer ID was automatically assigned it wouldn't. For example [http://www.hrwiki.org Homestar Runner Wiki] recognises when a homestarrunner.com URL has been entered (it has a different external link icon from everything else). Imagine if MediaWiki could automatically append--or, if one's already there, replace--the referrer ID with our own? That would bypass any and all attempts to divert it. And ''any'' way to make more money for us would be a Good Thing, [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Personal_Appeal especially considering Jimbo's just gone down on bended knee].

== Substantially finished books ==

I think there really is a need for books that are substantially finished to be in a list at the beginning of the Wikibooks main page.

This has been discussed as &quot;100% finished books&quot;.
See discussion:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Archive_8#.22100.25_finished.22_list

Some books are substantially complete and extremely useful even though they are not 100% complete. A recent review of electronic publishing says:

&quot;I recently carried out a non-scientific attempt to survey the best books on Wikibooks. My sample, taken from the adult English-language site, consisted of all the books whose level of development was listed as &quot;comprehensive text&quot; (the highest level), plus all those that had been voted book of the month at some point, plus a list of four books suggested by a Wikibooks user with whom I happened to start up a dialog on Slashdot. This made a total of 20 books.[19] Of these: 

* 11 were not really books, ranging in length from 6 to 50 pages. 
* One was marked with a copyright violation banner. 
* Four or five were books that seemed to have been written entirely outside of Wikibooks, dumped into Wikibooks wholesale, and never really edited much by Wikibooks users. 
* Only three or four were complete books that appeared to have been created and written through Wikibooks itself. &quot; http://www.lightandmatter.com/article/infrastructure.html

I think the situation is a bit better than this and even if there are only about 6 books that are substantially complete they should be advertised to encourage other authors and demonstrate what is meant by a &quot;substantially complete&quot; textbook.

I like the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook cookbook] it is not complete and doesn't even have a green square but its certainly ready &quot;to go&quot;. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 19:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

: Yes, I read this article. I agree that we don't have much books we can show to the public and be really proud of them. Other problem is lack of print versions, author of this article also wrote that problem of Wikibooks is that books are hard to print. IMO the solution is to support [[Help:Print versions]] project. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:13, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks for the link. I have just had a look at a few sample printed pages from Python. The font is good and the auto format worked well. Its being &quot;picky&quot; but I would like to see a one inch left margin (at least, for binders etc.) and right justification with a half inch right margin. {&quot;font-family:verdana; margin-left='8%'; margin-right='8%'; text-align: justify; font-weight:normal; font-size:12pt} with perhaps a touch of blue in the text TEXT=&quot;#00000C&quot;? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:29, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

::I have just been playing with this facility. Although automatically created printed versions are OK you cant beat PDF. Unfortunately.

== RSS Feed for &quot;my watchlist&quot; ? ==

Would it be possible to get an RSS feed for &quot;my watchlist&quot;?  This would be very nice and would make keeping tabs on a book a breeze.

Also, I had a difficult time figuring out if this question had ever been asked before.  I ''did'' look at the Table of Contents, but I did not look at the archives - there are a lot of them.  I looked for a &quot;search archives&quot; option, and didn't see that either.  That means one of the following: a) There isn't one; b) It's not in an obvious place; or c) I'm a dolt.

[[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 21:05, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

:This is an [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=471 oft-requested] feature, but one that hasn't been implemented. This is because many users would consider their watchlist to be private, and RSS feeds don't support logins as such, therefore allowing you to access the watchlist of any given user. Googling &quot;Watchlist RSS feed&quot; or the like will come up with endless discussion and some possible solutions.
:Using the live bookmark (or similar) feature of your web browser is probably the easiest way, although it means bookmarking every page you add to your watchlist. Doubtless someone will come up with a Firefox extension to do this quicker, but for now there is no ideal solution. :(
:I'm not sure if it's been asked ''here'' before, but certainly it's made its way onto Wikipedia's &quot;perennial proposals&quot; page.
:EDIT: as for a search archives function there isn't one, but Googling &quot;site:en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_Lounge &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;keyword&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; works just as well.

==Suspicious-looking groups of new non-contributing users==
The Maori [mi] Wikibooks (which is basically not progressing, though a few of us keep an eye on it for the sake of the reputation of our country's indigenous language) has recently had new users adding themselves, suspiciously close together, not doing anything yet. A week ago we got Bulban; Fiuyhfkurty; Pigmey; Pisuar over the space of a few hours. Earlier ones were even more jumbled words. Any other wikibooks got this happening? Is it a precursor to a massive spam attack?  [[User:Robin Patterson|Robin Patterson]] 06:19, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

I would suggest that some users create accounts to read Wikibooks (and set their preferences), not contribute. However [[:mi:Main Page|Maori Wikibooks]] seems to have almost nothing to read. &quot;Random page&quot; links me to the Main Page, which is in English.

I suggest that maybe these users are creating accounts so they can make interwiki links. (For example, if en:x linked to de:x and de:x linked to mi:x, you might want to add a link from mi:x to en:x.) They might have done this in expectation that someday mi will actually have books. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:08, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

Hello,

I have reviewed your listing for Corset:Bibliography:Old English.
How can I access the old Periodicals on the list ?

Such as:

Anonymous. &quot;Death from Tight Lacing.&quot; The Lancet, May 23, 1869, 675.

: Hello Christine. If you're not already associated with an academic institution, how about enquiring at a large public library in the first instance? &amp;nbsp;Otherwise you might try contacting the kind of institutions that might carry the material you're after, or seeing if there's an affordable pay-to-view internet option or the like. Re ''The Lancet'', for instance, I'd hope any university offering biochemistry or physiology (if not medicine itself) would carry it, otherwise I'd look for a publisher's website &amp;ndash; all this assuming it's not possible / too expensive / too lengthy to obtain via a public library. Hope something in all that helps. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 21:06, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

::I might add here that any contributions of this sort to our sister project, [[s:|Wikisource]], would be significantly appreciated.  Another perhaps even better place to turn for help in digitizing text of older periodicals such as a 150 year old medical journal would be to enlist the support of [http://www.pgdp.net/ Distributed Proofreaders], where a number of older scientific journals have been scanned and are being proofread and reviewed for mistakes.  Distributed Proofreading is a sister project to [http://www.gutenberg.org/ Project Gutenberg], which has a collection of over 7,000 books and periodicals from a wide variety of interests.  All of these places are free for viewing, and are run by volunteers.  A major problem at the moment is trying to index all of this content, but most of it has been indexed by Google and you can do serches on all of it by using the '''''site:''''' tag to narrow the search to one domain (I've done that to search for stuff on Wikipedia, for instance).  Unfortunately most works that have been published after 1923 are copyrighted, so you are going to have to use a commercial service to access most of the scientific literature that was recorded in the 20th Century.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

== Questions from the New Guy ==

I've recently taken an interest in cleaning up the [[Astronomy]] Wikibook and making some contributions. This has been a real learning experience for me as well as a source of frustration. As a Wikibooks newbie, I'm kind of at a loss as to how things run around here

One user has been contributing material that I think is obviously inappropriate for an astronomy textbook. The contributions are very long tables of very obscure astronomical data. The material is the sort of thing you'd find in an astronomical almanac, not a basic astronomy textbook. 

While it makes sense for the Astronomy Wikibook to have some basic reference tables as an appendix, I don't see that the tables approach anywhere near this level of complexity or depth. Accordingly, I removed the tables from most of the sections. (The original contributor has now moved the tables to Wikisource and linked to them from the Wikibook. I'm not sure whether this is appropriate.)

There was also material that I haven't deleted. I didn't clean this out because I thought it better to delete the modules entirely, as these modules had no other content on them. Instead, I nominated them for speedy deletion. The articles ''did'' seem to qualify for this.

About two weeks have passed since then, and the material is still there. I would assume that the articles in fact ''didn't'' qualify for speedy deletion except that other articles that were nominated for speedy deletion at the same time also remain. Should I continue to wait for someone to delete the articles or should I go through the formal process for deletion?

Another concern I have is with the [[Wikiversity:School of Astronomy]]. Recently some off-the-wall material has been added. A lot of it makes only vague sense to me. I don't mean any disrespect to the contributor, but I just can't see where he/she is coming from with this. My inclination is to revert the edit, but I'm slow to do that -- the new material doesn't have the flavor of vandalism, after all. In all honesty, 

I'm not really so interested in this page, and I'm willing to ignore it. I regard it as an entirely separate project. At the same time, I'd like to see ''all'' the material on Wikibooks reflect the highest quality, and I don't feel like the new additions do that. I could use the wisdom of some more experienced users on this. --[[User:Brian Brondel|Brian Brondel]] 03:54, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

:First, you look like you're doing good things here. A lot of books at Wikibooks are in a terrible state and need extensive cleanup. Try looking over [[WB:PAG|policy pages ]]to make sure you've got the right idea of how to edit books, but your listed actions seem valid. Wikibooks is much slower-paced than Wikipedia in most areas. An admin ''should'' check the speedy delete category every once in a while but I guess no one has. It'll get done in time. My advice would be to work on one thing for now, then address other problem pages as you get more experience with how people write pages around here. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 05:24, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

::I actually put the Astronomy Wikibook up for a VfD because I felt it was in such a bad state that it would be better to simply restart the whole concept from scratch.  The VfD was voted down, but it still does need help.  In this case, feel free to do some massive editing and rearranging of the contents there.  Much of the contents of that Wikibook are copies from other websites, including some NASA content and very stale forks of Wikipedia from almost two years ago.  While this is technically legal, it does diminish the value of such content here when it could be so much better.  [[Wikijunior Solar System]] is put together with much better content, and I would dare say that the content that was culled from Wikijunior due to being too verbose and above grade level (Wikijunior is aiming for grade school aged kids) would be a good candidate for inclusion into the Astronomy Wikibook, for instance.  The astronomy articles on Wikipedia are also maturing and often exceeding their 32K article limit, which is one instance where Wikibooks could do a much better job of expanding information about specific astronomical objects like Jupiter or Mars, where quite a bit of information is now available.  That is a specific reason for my trying to advertise this Wikibook on the Astronomy Wikiproject, and I hope that other individuals with interest in this area will help contribute to this major branch of science.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:22, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

== Capitalisation problems with watchlist ==

It appears that article capitalisation has changed, and that [[Cookbook:sugar]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar]] both resolve to the same page (without redirects).  This is, imho, a Very Good Thing.  However, I now have several entries in my watchlist, e.g. Cookbook:sugar, which exist in a kind of limbo.  The links go to the capitalised version of the pages, but these pages are not marked as being watched.    If I try and remove these items from my watchlist, I get the error '''Couldn't remove item 'Cookbook:sugar'''' and the page is not removed.  Can this be fixed here, or is it a MediaWiki bug that needs to go into Mediazilla? --[[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 22:02, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

== Subproject namespace problem ==

In the wikibook subproject &quot;Movie Making Manual&quot;, there are several articles about scriptwriting, all included in the category [[:Category:Writing movies|Writing movies]]. Reading this category page is a difficult affair, however: All the articles start with &quot;Movie Making Manual-&quot;, so it's difficult to scan through the list. Now we could move all those articles to a title without those words in the beginning, but this is a question of general policy: articles like &quot;Movie Manual-Main page&quot; and &quot;Biology-Main page&quot; would then suddenly collide. Has somebody a solution for this problem - by implementing something else, or by using the available tools creatively? How about if &quot;Movie Making Manual&quot;-articles would be named with &quot;(mmm)&quot; '''at the end''' (instead of the beginning, plus shortened)? And how about if we would use this way of naming article generally? [[User:Cramer|Cramer]] 22:14, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

== Of Mice, Men, and Annotated Texts ==
Forgive me if this has been discussed, but I've looked and don't see a lot of guidance just yet.

I'm working on the ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' module and notice that it is categorized under Category:Annotated Texts.  The problem is that ''Of Mice and Men'' is still protected by copyright, and this study guide (for that's what it will be) will never really be an annotated text until the copyright expires.  If we want people who need this module (and granted, nobody needs it in its current state, but I have high hopes for it) to be able to find it, should it not be categorized differently?  The same can be asked about ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' and ''[[Angels and Demons]]'', if anyone ever finishes that.  --[[User:Mitchell K Dwyer|Mitchell K Dwyer]] 01:17, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

== BOTM voting rules ==

I suggest changing BOTM voting rules - it's odd that COTM rules require at least 20 edits and BOTM rules don't require any. This leave space for voting from multiple accounts.

== The management of book publishing - a policy suggestion ==

Whilst Wikibooks textbooks are being written they are actually &quot;manuscripts&quot;. A textbook that is a manuscript is a rather dubious source. I would like to propose the following policy for '''publishing''' these manuscripts:

1. That the Wikibooks main page begins with substantially finished books.
:These would be books that a '''final editorial board''' for each book has read, reviewed and checked and preferrably where external comment has been sought.
:The substantially finished books would be in PDF or printable format.
:The editorial board for each book would be composed of those contributors who make themselves available for the board plus a subject area chairman who is also an administrator to mediate and arbitrate.

2. The existing editing framework is left in place for manuscript development.
:This would also be linkable from each substantially finished book.

3. Substantially finished books would be updated at a maximum rate of monthly but preferrably no more than twice a year. If the edition frequency is kept low the books will be more stable and become more highly rated as reference sources. It would also limit the work load on the final editorial board. Each update would be given an &quot;edition&quot; number that can be used as a reference in other publications and the world at large. These controls might raise the status of the books and make them into reliable sources for academic work.

The main page for Wikibooks would need to be amended to contain new general headings. I have provided a '''crude''' conceptual mockup at: (now removed - clogged up my talk page).

The following books are probably ready for an all-out effort to get them into a fit state to be published:

----

My own thoughts on this matter:

We already have a crude beginning of something at [[Wikibooks:Wikibook Press]] that was started about the same time this whole project was started and IMHO is substantially underused for what it could be in theory.  In terms of bringing books up in quality and not content quantity, such as what is happening right now at [[Wikijunior Solar System]], you indeed need to get an editorial group going and doing fact checking and other forms of verification.

One thing we need to stay away from is a hardcore formalism such as killed Nupedia (and is creeping back into Wikipedia in some forms).  One of the problems with Nupedia was forgetting that it was a volunteer project and insisting on not quality standards but arbitrary standards of formalism that normally would only be met by a paid professional staff... and that only because they are willing to slug it out with the bureaucracy because it is just another day, another paycheck.  Volunteers will drop like flies in heat if this sort of expectation occurs.

This is not to suggest that quality can't be achieved.  A very successful on-line volunteer editorial project can be found with [http://www.pgdp.net/ Distributed Proofreaders], and I would suggest that if we want to be serious about processing Wikibooks in terms of editorial content, it would be preferable to follow this sort of model to some extent at least.  This would, however, take on a unique Wikibooks quality and perhaps be even less formal.

As far as the front page of Wikibooks is concerned, I would encourage the work to be performed on a bookshelf basis and perhaps some standards of content to be applied in terms of what appears.  Up until now it has been encouraged to put brand-new Wikibooks on the front page as a sort of mission statement to show what kinds of content ought to be on Wikibooks.  We are now beyond the stage of doing a demonstration project to show what Wikibooks (at least on the en.wikibooks side) could be capable of, and the front page lists a huge variety of potential content, but for the most part that is all it is.  That can and must change simply due to the fact that Wikibooks is becomming an major player in the e-text market and people are now coming to Wikibooks to see finished content.

I would propose that some formal standards be established for the stages icons, with perhaps a slight expansion of the concept to include beyond the 0% to 100% icon range, but include editorial icons as well to document manuscript proofing and &quot;publication&quot; such as a PDF file.  There would be several stages of editorial review as well.  In addition, only those manuscripts (read individual Wikibooks here) that are near the &quot;best&quot; stage of review should be listed on each bookshelf that appears on the front page.  Obviously some bookshelves are going to be weaker than others, and on the Bookshelf pages themselves you can still list all of the books, including brand-new Wikibooks that are a mere stub.  This would likely result in about 80% of the current listings of Wikibooks to be culled from the front page.

The whole point here is that we need to make especially the front page more user-friendly to those who are not necessarily here to edit and contribute, but simply want to take a glance at what we've written.  By doing this, Wikibooks will have a larger impact in the electronic publishing world and may begin to have a real impact doing what the founders of this project intended:  To provide an alternative publishing forum for textbooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:12, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

:Your mention of Wikibook press is very relevant. What I am suggesting is an effort to get the 10 or so nearly complete books into a print format such as Wikibooks press offers and to put these prominently on the main page.  Perhaps the contributors for the nearly complete books could be contacted and asked to get these ready for publishing.

:Staying &quot;away from hard core formalism&quot; is indeed essential. This is a good point and might be answered by always forming the final editorial board from the contributors plus one admin person to resolve disputes etc..

:I agree that we need to keep the active bookshelves in a prominent position. To avoid &quot;about 80% of the current listings of Wikibooks to be culled from the front page&quot; we would need to have a small table of &quot;published books&quot; at the top of the main page and keep the rest of the main page as it is.  The issue of crowding out the manuscripts with published works would only occur when, say, 30 or 40 published books are available. The published books would remain on the bookshelves so that their manuscripts can be improved for the next edition. 

:The current bookshelves would certainly need at least one more icon to indicate &quot;published&quot;. 

:I agree entirely with your last paragraph: &quot;The whole point here is that we need to make especially the front page more user-friendly to those who are not necessarily here to edit and contribute, but simply want to take a glance at what we've written&quot;. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:50, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

It has just occurred to me that the change in the main page so that it lists published books &quot;up front&quot; would be an interim solution. Once 30 books have been published the density of published books in the bookshelves would be high enough for the bookshelves to be sufficient. Books that have been published could be listed in a different colour on the bookshelf.

By publishing the books in definitive editions we will also forestall the problems of vandalism and anonymous IPs found on Wikipedia. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:29, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

Nice idea, in theory, but most books suffer from a lack of content and a lack of active contributors.  Of course if someone wants to take on the job of 'publishing' a book to [[Wikibooks:Wikibook Press]] then they should be encouraged.  I also agree that the front page needs to be made more reader friendly but let's not forget that [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not paper|Wikibooks is not paper]] so hand in hand with layout improvements we really, desperately, need tools to assist in the searching and indexing of books.  Remember that you don't know who the reader is or what he or she wants to find. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 08:12, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

::BTW, I don't think that you need to completely rule out the potential of a paper version of Wikibooks either.  While I would agree that not all Wikibooks have to be written with the intention that they eventually be published on paper, there is a reason why physical books are still being used and published... even by and for computer users themselves.  Not all knowledge can be obtained easily through a computer terminal, and books have a number of other advantages as well, not the least of which is that you never lose power and for archival purposes it can last thousands of years with no need to provide decryption services directly or is at least easily obtained.  You can't say the same thing about 9-inch Floppy disks or Hollerith punch cards at the moment.  I would dare you to easily find a Zip-disc reader if you want an example of a slightly more recent storage technology that has become obsolete.  Paper books are here to stay, and we certainly need to be able to translate some of these Wikibooks we are working on to physcial paper books if this project is going to be something more than Wikipedia articles in depth.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:10, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

:::I didn't intend to give the impression that I think that paper copies have no potential, sorry if it looked like that.  After all my personal library contains over 2000 of them (no I'm not boasting, I'm sure lots of you can easily trump that).  Also I absolutely agree that for longevity and future accessibility there is nothing to beat paper.  I do think though that what most books need is more content rather than more rules.  Some indication as to which books are alive and which are dying from neglect might be useful so that readers could avoid looking at books that consist just of stubs.  The front page as it stands is pretty much useless because most of the books it lists are barely started never mind completed and thus of interest only to prospective contributors not readers.  By the way do we actually have any readers, or is Wikibooks just the worlds best vanity publisher? :-)) --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 19:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

::::As far as Wikibooks readership, we are listed in the Alexa rankings as one of the largest e-text websites in terms of a place that people go to actually download an e-text.  I would suspect that Gutenberg is more active, but there is a lot of interwiki links between Wikipedia and Wikibooks.  A developer for the Wikimedia Foundation has suggested that Wikipedia has something like over 50 page reads for each edit.  The numbers are not quite as good for Wikibooks, but I do see some of the projects I'm working on that only get a brief comment from a reader, usually a thanks or a minor question about the book.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:59, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:::::So, 

1. If I were to contact editors of the books singled out above and ask them to get them into a final draft.

2. If an admin could volunteer to be editor in chief for each book.

3. I and other volunteers(?) were to get the text into PDF format.

4. The main page were to have an extra table listing 12 substantially complete books.

Would everyone agree? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:15, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:If you can do all that go for it.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 14:27, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:I don't see any reason for having a person with MediaWiki Sysop privileges to be required in order to be &quot;editor in chief&quot; of each book.  It just takes an individual who is willing to take on a leadership role to help pull things together, and try to deal with organizational tasks like page formatting, setting up a table of contents, working on templates to &quot;pretty up&quot; the Wikibook dealing with navigation issues as well, and to search commons for some images that may relate to the book content.  None of those tasks require any special privileges.&lt;p&gt;As far as volunteering to help get text into a basic PDF format, I am willing to also help accomplish that task, and have done so on a number of Wikibooks already.  A forum does need to be established to help coordinate that effort, especially as making the PDF file is not a completely trivial task at the moment and does take some reformatting of the content to make it work better as a PDF takes some artistic flair.&lt;p&gt;Where an admin is going to be needed is to help do the actual work on the main page.  This is currently protected... for a good reason.  I support changing over the look of the front page, with perhaps the current full list of book titles being moved to another page and only a few select books being displayed on the main page.  For now, I would say to restrict this only to Book of the Month winners... including Wikijunior.  Are there any other metrics that can be used to help decide what would go on the front page?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:39, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

I have just had a go at print versions of Botany and Special relativity. Botany turned out to be difficult and a bit empty SR looks good though see:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special_relativity/Print_version

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Botany/Print_version

On the subject of Wikipedia content, both books have some content &quot;snaffled&quot; from Wikipedia - a note to this effect will be added.

[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 20:59, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

=== [[GNU Free Documentation License]] ===
I noticed that some of the books suggested for publication copied content from Wikipedia. As you make the published versions, you should remember to credit &quot;Wikipedia&quot; as an author of such books. See [[GFDL]], section 4, letters I and J.

Consider [[English]]... its [[English:Grammar]] page took material from [[Wikipedia:English grammar]]. The user who first created that page at Wikibooks included an obligatory credit to Wikipedia. However, on 15 September 2004, a user removed this credit. I (23 January 2006) recently restored it. I had previously edited some credits to Wikipedia to [[Introduction to Sociology]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:04, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

:This is a mistaken notion.  Wikipedia is not the &quot;author&quot; of the book, nor is Wikibooks here.  Correctly you can say Wikipedia contributors or Wikibooks contributors if you want to do it at all.  Or simply name the principle authors by looking into the history, such as I've done with some of the PDF versions of Wikibooks.  As for citing sources of the text, especially if it is modified GFDL text, you should credit the source and potentially include the full edit history if it is available and put that into the talk page of the module.  This is precisely what should be done on a transwiki, such as what you are describing for the English Grammar Wikibook module.  That way the actual authors can be cited as appropriate.

:In theory MediaWiki software could go through and determine percentage of content that an individual author has contributed, which would be a better metric for determining authorship.  This would be done through a page diff and you could even assign authorship to each individual word in that manner.  If through this you could say that you must list all authors that have contributed more than 1% of the module or book, that might be a reasonable way to describe authorship.  The same is done for collaboratively written scientific papers, where you see sometimes a list of over 50 authors for a single publication.  Often the citation is simply something like &quot;Jones, D.E.; Franklin, J.R.; et. al&quot;, and sometimes some politicking for whom gets the lead citation.  The same can and should be done for Wikipedia articles and IMHO should be done for Wikibooks as well.  The U.S. Copyright and Trademark Office suggests you list the three or four principle authors when registering trademark, to use a benchmark.  The MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) will only let you list two people for credits like authorship or production of a screenplay, or under some exceptional circumstances four people.  If more that that are involved, the group submitting the credits to the MPAA must simply decide who are the principle authors.

:Also note that the Wikimedia Foundation nor any of the projects claim copyright on anything produced in these projects.  If copyright isn't even being claimed, why should it be even listed as an author?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:47, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

== How to label and number figures, tables, etc. for citation? ==

Most paper text books number their figures, tables, etc.
How does one do the equivalent for wikibooks? In particular,
I'd like to have the figures numbered uniquely in a book,
and the tables labeled, so that I could refer to them
symbolically in wiki markup. Is there a preferred way to
do this with templates (or perhaps with a Special: page)
so that I can cite a figure by its name and MediaWiki
insert a link that works even if the figure is moved
from one page to another? If I do this with templates,
is there a convention to follow so that I can define templates
in a book-specific manner so that I don't step on someone
else's template names? I.e. something like namespaces,
but within the Template: namespace. --[[User:Djb|djb]] 03:47, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

:Take a look at [[w:Wikipedia:Citing sources]] and [[w:Wikipedia:Footnotes]], you're bound to find a method you like. If the template in question doesn't exist here yet just copy it over. I'm assuming you're wanting something for referencing ''between'' pages rather than within the same page; therefore you should find a template you like that allows a custom label to be defined (e.g. &quot;venusorbit&quot;), which then allows you to link to it from elsewhere using that same tag (e.g. [[Astronomy/The Planets/Venus#venusorbit]]). However this linking technique won't track the target to any page other than that specified, so any time it gets moved all links to it will have to be manually fixed.
:If you think a particular figure is going to be moving relatively frequently you could always put it on a &quot;hidden&quot; page that doesn't appear on the Table of Contents (e.g. [[Astronomy/venusorbit]]) and then transclude it in like a template (using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ }} instead of [[ ]], like this: {{Astronomy/venusorbit}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;). That way you could link straight to it ([[Astronomy/venusorbit]]) but this would mean that it would be seen out of context of any pages it has appeared on.

* This auto message box on all new pages is '''premature''', because the [[WB:NP|naming policy]] has not been accepted as policy, and the box refers users over to the proposal page which is not clearly written.  This does not give a good impression for new users.  Recommend removing the new page notice (message box on new pages) until the use of a message for this purpose has been discussed and until the naming policy has been actually approved (it appears to have lost an earlier vote, so more reason not to force books to adopt it before another vote).  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 20:37, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
** While [[WB:NP]] may not be formal policy, it is a good guideline and new Wikibooks ought to follow this suggestion closely.  One of the problems we are facing right now on Wikibooks is a little timidity to actually set policy down, and the lack of a good forum to ratify new policies.  The naming policy has been worked on for many months, and represents the best of current conventions that have worked out well for many Wikibooks.  While not a reason to delete content, it is still a good suggestion to try and link all of the modules for a particular Wikibook together through some sort of standardized naming convention '''within''' that collection of documents.  The arguments are over formalizing what sort of standard or standards should be considered acceptable here on Wikibooks, not that you shouldn't have a consistant naming pattern.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:26, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

== WikiProjects ==

Shouldn't we implement WikiProjects here? I work on two wikibooks, [[Mac OS X Tiger]] and [[iLife 06]], and am thinking about starting [[iWork 06]]. It would be great to bring these together under one roof and have them organized by a Macintosh &quot;Wikiproject&quot;. There are other Mac books that could be added as well.

I'd be happy to do this myself, but I thought everyone should vote on it or something first. [[User:Hyperpasta|Hyperpasta]] 20:57, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

:We already do have Wikibooks themselves, which is a sort of Wikiproject unto itself in many ways.  There is also the potential to work together under a common interest through the Bookshelf system, and I for one would like to see that utilized more for organizational purposes in a manner similar to how Wikiprojects are run on Wikipedia.  Keep in mind that there aren't nearly as many people here on Wikibooks as there are on Wikipedia, and it may be harder to find a group of like minded people working toward the same goals... especially for collaborative writing purposes.

:At the same time, there is nothing really stopping you from starting anything like a Wikiproject group or even forming them here.  It just hasn't been done before mainly because of the numbers of people involved.  There have been some things like Wikiversity and Wikijunior that are run kinda like a Wikiproject as well, mainly due to the huge scale of the goals for what they want to accomplish.  Wikiversity is a big enough idea that the people involved with that are now seeking full sister-project status with the Wikimedia Foundation.  I don't think you want something that ambitious, but you can try to put something together.  If you want to put something about Wikiproject groups or something like that on [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]], all you really need to do is contact an admin to help make the changes on that page.  I would however suggest that you start by trying to put something into [[Wikibooks:Information technology bookshelf|the Information Technology Bookshelf]] first with a Macintosh-specific equipment subsection, or perhaps into [[Wikibooks:Computer software bookshelf]] where these books current are listed under.  I don't even see a seperate Macintosh software section on that bookshelf right now.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:50, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

== in praise of the snippit ==

I have looked around here and I am a little worried that this site could be a little too book orientated. There seems to be a tendency towards devaluing the snippit the small piece of information that sits alone waiting to be retrieved and added to. Technical references are very much like a big collection of snippits really usually you need some specific information and the rest of the information isn't needed at that time. I've just contributed to a book that last saw an entry in 2003 its a very small book now and may never be  complete but its holding useful snippits of information. what has been written is useful and self contained and accessable. maybe this is all thats needed.

Second point does there need to be one book for a subject I know some information gets duplicated especially foundation material but surely thats good too different approaches to the same subject help greatly, one explanation may not click and the other illuminates.

it shouldnt be a problem for a started project to be abandoned and then retrieved years later. unless theres a chronic shortage of space. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Blackest knight|Blackest knight]] ([[User talk:Blackest knight|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Blackest knight|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

== Request for Bureaucrat etiquette ==

*Etiquette.  Most of you are kind and helpful, and do use etiquette.  For a few who don't: in future, please provide some advance notice, allow time for discussion and consensus, before implementing automatic message boxes on hundredss of pages, especially if the message boxes are potentially embarassing to book editors.  The discussion and consensus should include book editors, not just primarily computer experts, to improve understanding.  That means the notice of the proposed widespread change on Wikibooks pages should be posted where book editors look (Staff Lounge, for example), not just on pages viewed by mainly computer experts. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 18:51, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
*Don't bite book editors.  Please remove widespread message boxes, which were applied unilaterally without observing etiquette or prior discussion or consensus.  The message boxes could be put back after they have observed Wikibooks etiquette.  For example, the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#New article notice]] here had already implemented the widespread message box before posting the notice, before discussion and consensus.  The widespread and automatic message box, which has suddenly appeared on existing books' talk pages, is potentially embarassing to book editors.  
::As an example of how to embarass a book editor, suppose that the main editor of this book, [[Wikiversity:School of Law]] has invited his colleagues to contribute articles for the book, and then an accusing message box appears on the book pages, along with a category box marking the page as a problem.  
:::The message box here is misleading and it could have been improved by discussion.  It trys to force book editors to conform to a proposed policy [[WB:NP]] which has not been approved, and which appears to have lost a previous vote, and which is presently unclear and not well written even as a proposal. 
::The spirit of Wikibooks is that many minds working together with goodwill make a better result.  We need that spirit in policy making as well.

:* I'm afraid I don't fully understand the your complaint.  As far as I know, the message box you refer to, namely [[MediaWiki:Newarticletext]], appears on edit pages only.  It does not appear on the module itself or on the talk page.  I can't see how the notice counts as an accusation or an embarassment to any author or editor.   (I do understand that you disagree with the content and with the lack of notice before the change was made&amp;mdash;but that is a separate issue) in particular, I am unaware of any other messages automatically being placed on on hundreds of pages.  Could you give a few (maybe 2 or 3) examples where an automatic message was placed on a module page or a talk page so I can get a better idea of what you are talking about?  Thank you.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:16, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
::* The example of a way to embarrass an author was given as [[Wikiversity:School of Law]].  The current message box at [[MediaWiki:Newarticletext]] is not embarrassing but is only cluttering for books which do not need any reminder about page naming.  It was also put on without discussion, and with a POV purpose. However, last week the message box on edit page for my book module had a different message which was not only embarassing, it was also incorrect.  The message from Wikibooks said that the page needed cleanup because it was in violation of the Wikibooks naming policy.  That incorrect message is now gone without leaving trace in the page history.  Wikibooks does not presently have an accepted page naming policy, so not possible to be in violation.  Anyway, I don't like the message box clutter on my book edit pages or the intention of the message box to induce newbie editors to change the page naming scheme because they have been mislead into believing that the naming scheme is incorrect (the message box points readers to [[WB:NP|page naming polciy]] which was, before last night, written in a misleading way to imply that only one type of page naming scheme is permitted).  I think that the message box at [[MediaWiki:Newarticletext]] was just a more subtle attempt to implement the bureaucrat writer's policy POV, without discussion, than the cleanup message that appeared last week.  I don't like this sneaky method and would like to know that such things won't happen again. Also see [[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy#Bad tactics]] -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 12:10, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

*Fair Treatment of book editors.  Please let book editors have as much freedom of choice as possible about how to set up the books.  Please do not create an enforceable policy (law) which unnecessarily limits other people's freedom of choice just to please your preference.  Sometimes consistency and standards are needed, but since these limit freedom of choice (and sometimes these limitations are justified), please do have a discussion first about the real need for the proposed limitation.  Why is the consistency needed?  Diversity is often a good thing; it allows creativity and new methods to evolve.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 18:51, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I think we should talk about concrete problems. I suppose that when you write about &quot;bureaucrats&quot; you mean generally all the people having sysop/bureaucrat permissions. Nonetheless, most of your objections seem to be addressed to myself, so I will try to explain few things.
:: You write about &quot;bureaucrat etiquette&quot; - does it mean that my behaviour was rude or aggressive?
:: Most of your objections concentrate on naming policy and actions connected with it. We can make philosophical discussions about spirit of Wikibooks, but the fact is that this project faces big problems with maintaining quality. We (I mean people doing maintenance tasks generally) are understaffed and can't take care of everything. Lots of new modules get orphaned because their author haven't linked them properly. There are plenty of pages that got lost because someone changed TOC of parent book. Modules which are not linked properly are less likely to be corrected by users and are good target for vandals. Reality is that Wikibooks has lots of rubbish in the database: pages in other languages (already transwikied in most cases), simply vandalism, gibberish, unused files, ultra-stubs, orphaned pages etc. Risk of such problems is reduced if a module is properly named (so you can reach its parent book), book is placed in a bookshelf and new books appear on list on main page. Unfortunately, most of our contributors either forget or don't know about these simply rules. We cannot correct every editor manually. Small box appearing in new pages reminding about neccessary actions will hopefully make contributors take care about their work without our assistance.
:: Now naming convention notice. Many books are written in way that makes reading them hard (because of lack of navigation). Sometimes parts of books are orphaned and not linked to main TOC. And there is a plenty of such modules, we can't cope with everything. That's why special template was created, it's fast in use. If I read discussion page of every book needing cleanup I see, checked if it is active or dead, I wouldn't have time to do anything. I can give my full attention to only a few books when I do cleanup.
:: You write about fair treatment of contributors. Firstly, you are exaggerating size of naming convention cleanup action. Look at the [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Cleanup-NC|page list]] - there are only a few books, it's completely microscopic scope. There were not bot actions, no massive template inserting you are suggesting here. We leave contributors freedom but contributors don't seem to be interested with the project standards. In many cases it's not contributors' fault that a book does not conform our polices - hence the book might be older than the policy. But there are some books that have illogical structure or contain serious meritorical or markup errors. Cleanup messages are not ment to &quot;punish&quot; book authors, yet they show what needs to be corrected clearly and invite other contributors to help.
:: Later, you write that decisions should be made after discussion and consensus. In my opinion, this is a wiki and philosophy of wiki is to be bold. There aren't many active contributors here and every discussion is usually quite long. When it comes to serious decisions, yes, we ought to sit and talk and we do it. I haven't invented things I have done. New article notice idea is taken from English Wikinews and naming policy isn't something new, I haven't written it and I even haven't worked on it at all. Similar cleanup messages are common at Wikipedia and noone screams that they are vandalisms or violate his/her freedom as an author there.
:: Finally: &quot;Bureaucrats should be helpful and courteous, and not use their powers to obtain their own preferences.&quot; It's not pleasant to hear such words after everyday peace of work. I'm not using my powers to force naming convention or other standards, because I haven't blocked or reverted anyone for such reasons. I always answer if someone asks me for help and I help newcomers if only I have enough time. I admit I can sometimes loose faith in &quot;Assume Good Faith&quot; rule after recent changes patrol, but why do you assume bad faith on &quot;bureaucrats&quot;? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:41, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

I would like to point out that generally I support most of Derbeth's actions here on Wikibooks.  We do need to be a little bit more casual with the cleanup notices, but the point being made here is that there are some (unfortunately few) people that are monitoring what is happening on Wikibooks.  Most of this effort is to raise the standards for content here, and turn Wikibooks into something more than just a random collection of textual thoughts.  There is a mission to Wikibooks, and I hope that new contributors cna take a look at what we've done here and the intentions of where we are going.

The most important thing anybody who is new to Wikibooks can do is to understand that one person's opinion on something is just that:  One single opinion.  There are places you can complain if you need to bring others into the discussion, and most changes on Wikibooks are generally reversable as well, including page deletion and user blocks.  If you disagree with a page markup tag, you can make a comment on the discussion page for that module and perhaps even remove the tag if you strongly disagree.  Try to find out why it was put there in the first place and understand we are mostly trying to help you as an author out with the content of Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:23, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

== CVG is Dewey 794 ==

Computer and video game books were filed under Dewey 794 in every library I've been any in. Hence I think [[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]] should be placed under [[Dewey 700]]. (It would get cluttered if we put each individual title there — one of the big differences between Wikibooks and a traditional library, IMO — unless we managed to break it down into further decimal places.) &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:Seahen|Seahen]] ([[User talk:Seahen|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Seahen|contribs]]) 00:00, 29 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Feedback sought: Building a book TOC, sections, and navigational aid ==

I would like some comments about the way I've structures the [[Java Programming]]
book. My goals were to create a book table of contents which you see
on the main page and also have a navigational aid which we can include
via a template on all pages in the book. That nav aid will appear at
the bottom of each page. It links to the each of the main sections of the book,
as well as to the book's main table of contents and the [[:Category:Java Programming]].

To implement this, I created templates for each of the sections,
such as [[Template:Java Programming/Getting Started]] and [[Template:Java Programming/Language Fundamentals]]. The template
includes the outline for the section and perhaps a very brief introduction.
I then include the template in the main TOC and also include the template
in the pages I created for each of the main sections. For example,
see [[Java Programming/Getting Started]] and [[Java Programming/Language Fundamentals]]
which includes the aforementioned templates.
Finally, I also created a
template [[Template:Java Programming]] to put at the bottom of each page;
it puts the page in the [[:Category:Java Programming]] and also
includes the book's navigational aid: [[Template:Java Programming Nav]].

What do you all think? Is there a better way?

:Well, you need to fix [[Template:Java Programming/Overview]].  It has red links to blue-link pages.  (The main TOC gets it right.)  One other detail.  According to [[WB:NP]], templates are susposed to follow the false namespace (colon) convention.  The book pages are supposed to follow the slash convention (as you have done), but the book-specific templates are supposed to use the colon convention. &lt;small&gt;''- unsigned''&lt;/small&gt;
::''Thanks for noticing the broken links; I've fixed them. I'll try to migrate to the [[WB:NP]] recommendation (I had followed the pattern of the  [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=Ada%2F&amp;namespace=10 Ada book's templates]) --[[User:Djb|djb]] 23:18, 29 January 2006 (UTC)''
: Most people put there navigational templates at the top or floating to the side&amp;mdash;so I suppose they think that works better.  Your navigational template sees too large for that, so maybe bottom is best for you.  Otherwise, looks fine. &lt;small&gt;''- unsigned''&lt;/small&gt;

:: There seems to no consensus on whether to use colon-slash ([[Template:Java Programming/Overview]]) or colon-colon (Template:Java Programming:Overview) convention. I used colon-colon in the past, but am switching to colon slash because &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Java Programming:Overview}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; looks like the namespace is &quot;Java Programming:&quot; instead of &quot;Template:&quot;. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:45, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:I can't find any sign that you've uploaded it (see [[Special:Contributions/GRAHAMUK]] for all your contributions thus far). What filename did you give it, and are you sure you didn't get an error message? One of our other programming projects ([[C++ Programming|C Plus Plus]] I think) set up a Sourceforge project for their source code. I'm not sure if zips can be uploaded here, but if not then that might be a good solution. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:01, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

::I get a warning &quot;.zip is not a recommended image format&quot;. Well, duh. I assumed that was just a warning and it had uploaded the file, but it appears as though it hasn't. Is there a a special upload for files other than images? [[User:GRAHAMUK|GRAHAMUK]] 23:05, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Yeah, I thought as much. Unfortunately file types are determined via PHP changes, which requires asking the devs, who in turn say they're too busy and/or it's too dangerous a filetype to enable. Hmpf. I guess Sourceforge is still the most probable option. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:41, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

==Variable Slope Curves==

The solutions to this are either, use the Multi-BP envelope Macro which provides a very flexible graphic breakpoint tool a bit like those in Absynth and FM7.  (Under no circumstances attempt to understand how the internals of this module work without a packet of asprin).

===Alternative Solutions===

Or take a regular envelope and raise the output to the power of something (numbers between 0 and 1 will make the envelope start more dramatically, numbers greater than 1 will produce a curve that starts gently then accelerates).

If you're working on a Mac, there's a very handy Grapher tool in the Utilities folder that you can plug equations into to experiment with.

Tagalog is the largest of the [[w:Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and, as Filipino, the national language of the Philippines.  It is a member of the Austronesian languages and is a relative to other languages such as Malay and Indonesian, to which it shares similarities to, like stops and sentence structure.

The language is natively spoken by 22 million Filipinos throughout the Philippines and as a second language by more than 65 million Filipinos nationwide.  It is the sixth-largest language in the United States and is the language of the large Filipino diaspora, totaling some 11 million Filipinos.

Tagalog also has a vocabulary enriched by its pre-colonial and colonial history.  Spanish is the single largest contributor to the Filipino vocabulary and as such Filipino seems to the foreign ear to sound somewhat like Spanish.  Other contributors include Arabic, Sanskrit, Min Nan Chinese, Malay, Nahuatl, Tamil, Persian and other Philippine languages such as Kapampangan and Ilocano.

As Filipino, the Philippines' national language, Tagalog is the language of the media, public and some private education, conversation, the clergy and even in adminstration.  It is a co-official language along with English and is the lingua franca of the Philippines.  As such, Filipino is one of the many symbols of nationhood that binds the Philippine nation together.

Tagalog was once written using Baybayin, more commonly known as Alibata, a script based on the Kavi script of Java.  The script enjoyed a high literacy rate until the Spanish arrival, which led to its extinction.  Today, Tagalog is written in the Latin alphabet, but with two different letter sets: the older Abakada (with 20 letters) and the newer Alpabetong Filipino (Filipino alphabet, with 28 letters).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) inserts [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 13AB of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 13AB of ICTA]], which is the legislation covering the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Non-corporate distribution rate|non-corporate distribution rate]].&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) inserts [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Schedule A2 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A2 to ICTA]], which contains the detailed rules for the non-corporate distribution rate. Subsection (3) makes a consequential amendment to the introduction of the non-corporate distribution rate.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) provides that the inserted provisions apply to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Distribution|distributions]] made on or after 1 April 2004. Subsection (5) deems there, where necessary, to be two separate [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Accounting period|accounting periods]], one ending on 31 March 2004, the other beginning on 1 April 2004, for the purposes of this rule, with profits being allocated to the deemed accounting periods on a time basis unless that basis is unreasonable or unjust.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (5) sets the non-corporate distribution rate for the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Financial year|financial year]] beginning 1 April 2004 at 19%.

At the moment, one of the best documentation for Blender Stride features can be found here:
[http://www.telusplanet.net/public/kugyelka/blender/tutorials/stride/stride.html Blender Stride Tutorial], which takes on where the [http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Advanced_Stride_suppor.720.0.html Official Blender Stride Page] takes off.  Good luck!  A simpler and shorter, but still very good tutorial can be found here: [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/NLA_Editor_and_Stride_Path#Stride_Support Blender wiki: NLA Editor and Stride Path].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Small companies' rate==

Where a company, which is not a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Close investment-holding company|close investment-holding company]] has [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Basic profits|basic profits]] (ie profits chargeable to corporation tax) below £300,000 divided by one plus the number of its [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Associate|associates]] it may claim to be taxed at the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Small companies' rate|'''small companies' rate''']]. 

==Marginal relief==

Where such a company has basic profits between £300,000 divided by one plus the number of its associates and £1,500,000 divided by one plus the number of its associates, it may reduce its profits by such fraction as Parliament may from time to time decide multiplied by:

::&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;(M-P)xI/P&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Where:

:M is £1,500,000 divided by one plus the number of associates
:P is the amount of profits (see definition below)
:I is the amount of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Defintions/Basic profits/basic profits|basic profits]], ie profits chargeable to corporation tax

The figures of £1,500,000 and £300,000 referred to above are proportionately reduced when applied to an [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Accounting period|accounting period]] shorter than 12 months.

==Associated companies==

An associated company which has no trade or business during the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Accounting period|accounting period]] (or part whereof that it is associated) is ignored in the above calculation. Companies are '''associated''' if at a given time one has [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Control|control]] of the other, or both are under common control. '''Control''' is construed here in accordance with [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 416 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 416 of ICTA]].

A company is treated as associated with another for the whole accounting period, even if it is associated for only part of an accounting period.

==Profits==

'''Profits''' for the purposes of this section (except for basic profits) is taken as having a special meaning. It is:

:Profits chargeable to corporation tax; '''plus'''

:[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Franked investment income|franked investment income]] (&quot;FII&quot;) (ie dividends from UK companies multiplied by 10/9), except for FII received from a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|UK-resident]] [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Company|company]] which is:

::a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Subsidiary|51% subsidiary]] of the receiving company, or a 51% subsidiary og a company of which the receiving company is a 51% subsidiary; or

::a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Trade|trading]] or [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Holding company|holding company]] not taken out of this definition (see below) and which is owned by a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Defintions/Consortium|consortium]] the members of which include the receiving company.

[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 13ZA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 13ZA]] of ICTA has further interpretative provisions in respect of this.

The bit taken out of this definition referred to above applies where the company distributing the FII is a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Subsidiary|75% subsidiary]] of another company or when arrangements are in place whereby the paying company could become a 75% subsidiary.

==FII received in trust, etc==

Subsection (8AB) provides that FII received by a company includes FII received by another person on behalf of or on trust for the company, but not to any FII received by the company on behalf of or on trust for another person.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Section gives some interpretative provisions for [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 13 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 13(7) of ICTA]].

Subsection (1) provides that in determining whether a body corporate is a 51% subsidiary of another, the other isn't treated as being the owner of any share capital which is owned indirectly and is part of the trading portfolio of the body corporate directly owning it.

Subsection (2) provides that you only consider something to be a 51% subsidiary if the parent company is beneficially entiled to more than 50% of profits on a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Distribution|distribution]] and more than 50% of assets on a winding-up.

Subsection (3) makes a number of definitions for the purposes of Section 13(7) and this Section:

'''Trading or holding company''' is a trading company or a company whose business is wholly or mainly the holding of shares in 90% subsidiaries which are trading companies.&lt;br&gt;

'''Trading company''' is a company whose business is wholly or mainl the carrying on of a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Trade|trade]] or trades.&lt;br&gt;

A company is owned by a consortium if 75% or more of the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Ordinary share capital|ordinary share capital]] is beneficially owned by that company together with companies that beneficially own at least 5% of the ordinary share capital, that would be beneficially entitled to at least 5% of profits on a distribution, or would be beneficially entitled to at least 5% of assets on a winding up. In that instance, those companies are called the members of the consortium.

Subsection (4) provides that [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Schedule 18 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule 18 to ICTA]] applies for the purposes of Subsection (2) and the provisions relating to the definition of a consortium in Subsection (3) as it applies for the purposes of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 413 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 413(7) of ICTA]] (ie for the purposes of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Group relief|group relief]].

Although Artists quality paint is more expensive, the pigment is much stronger and it is easier to obtain satisfactory results. Also, Artists quality paints are available in a larger range of colours.

The paint is supplied in either tubes or cakes which are called pans, either whole or half pans.

There are many colours to choose from, but a typical palette of twelve colours would look like this.

Greens can be made from mixing the blues and yellows.

Purples can be made from mixing the blues and reds.

Greys can be made from browns and blues.

Black can be made from a rich mix of Burnt Umber and Ultramarine Blue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The two main types of brush for watercolour are sable and synthetic. They come in shapes of round or flat brushes. 

Others brushes include the rigger brush, chiesel brush, mop brush, and fan brush.


== Tips: ==
If you can, buy the best quality of brushes. The hairs of the cheaper brushes tend to fall out quicker.
&lt;br&gt;Don't leave your brush in the water for a long time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Where should the &lt;script&gt; tags go?  What are the implications/differences between having it in &lt;head&gt; vs. &lt;body&gt;?

----

You can define functions, global variables, etc. in the head. You would use it in the body if you would want, for example, to use document.write to insert a custom blurb in the body of the page. If you used document.write in the head, it would replace the whole body with the string passed to it.

It may also be worth noting that officially Javascript is supposed to be used with '''application/x-javascript''' as opposed to '''text/javascript''', however this is unsupported in some browsers. Not surprisingly, IE is one of those browsers.

== Both of one CDATA ==

The text refers to &quot;... both CDATA tags&quot; being commented out, but there is only one in the code snippet above that. I am just now learning JavaScript myself, so I can't be sure if the error is in the code snipped or the explanatory text.

'''''Impedimenta ''''' is a jinx that causes the victim to trip, get blasted backwards, etc. The power of the jinx is affected by how much you concentrate when saying the incantation.

== Overview ==

'''''Stupefy''''' is the Stunning Spell. The Stupefy jinx produces a jet of red light from the wand tip which renders its target unconscious, if it hits.

== Extended Description ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Stunning Spell or Stunner is used many times in later parts of the series, once it is first shown to us. The jinx is, for obvious reasons, used whenever the author needs to completely incapacitate someone without killing them. There are other jinxes, such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|the full body-bind jinx]], that serve the same purpose; however, those jinxes will leave the victim conscious, able to recall what is passing while he is disabled.

The effects of the spell seem somewhat inconsistent over the course of the series. It is alternatively described as sending people flying, knocking them out, or freezing them in place. The common factor, however, is that the target ends up knocked out. To wake up a stunned person, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Enervate|Enervate]] charm is used.

We see the Stupefy spell used in a number of places, but most notably in an attempt to capture the caster of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], to control [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragons]] later in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 19|that same book]], and in an attempt to subdue [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 31|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] attempts to use this spell in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle at the Ministry]] later in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 35|that book]], but his broken nose prevents him speaking the spell correctly and renders it ineffective. Harry also uses this spell in the duel at the all-night cafeteria in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|Tottenham Court Road]].

== Analysis ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Giant|Giants]] are mentioned as being largely immune to this spell, which apparently ricochets off them with no real effect. Hagrid, who we find out [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 23|in the fourth book]] is half-Giant, seems to have inherited this immunity.

It is mentioned that dragons are also relatively immune to this jinx. When it is used on dragons in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', we see four wizards teaming up to cast simultaneous Stun spells on one dragon.

On the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic#Spells|Magic overview page]], it is noted that there is a distinction between Charms, which do not modify the inherent nature of that against which they are cast, and Spells, which do. The Stunning spell is actually more properly a charm, because if you cast it on a person, he remains the same person, albeit now asleep. However, we assume that the term &quot;stunning spell&quot; is retained for the alliteration. It can also be referred to as a jinx, and is in many places, or as a hex, because it has an unwanted effect on the subject; very few people want to be rendered unconscious. It is not a curse, because the effect can be reversed without ill effect. It is uncertain where this spell would be taught, though it seems to be in very wide use; as Harry seems to be teaching it to his schoolmates in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], it is most likely one of the &quot;defensive&quot; spells normally taught in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]].

== Overview ==

'''''Reducto''''', also known as the '''''Reductor curse''''', is a destruction spell, used to reduce objects to dust.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While its main purpose is to reduce an object to dust, it can also cause that dust to spread violently, making a small explosion. More powerful spellcasters can, of course, cast this spell on larger objects, making larger explosions if they care to.&lt;!-- It also can destroy terraform, the ground, giving a fissure-like effect. !! Need a reference from the books, please --&gt;

== Analysis ==

We first see this spell when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is preparing for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Triwizard Tournament's third task]].  During the task, he tries (and fails) to use it to destroy a patch of magical golden mist, and later, successfully, to burn a hole through the hedges making up the maze.

We next see this spell when Harry is reflecting on the progress of his students in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. Harry recalls that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]] had performed this curse so well that she had reduced the entire table under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sneakoscope|sneakoscopes]] to dust.  Later, during the battle at the Ministry of Magic, Harry's companions use this spell to destroy the shelves in the Department of Mysteries, creating a diversion that allows them to escape the Death Eaters pursuing them.

We believe this spell may be similar in effect to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deprimo|Deprimo]] spell.

== Overview ==

'''''Finite Incantatem''''' is a spell that causes easier ongoing spells and jinxes to stop.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Many charms, hexes, and jinxes have ongoing effects; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Rictusempra|Rictusempra]], for instance, causes endless tickling, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tarantallegra|Tarantallegra]] causes endless &quot;dancing&quot; (uncontrollable leg movement). The Finite Incantatem spell can be used to stop all these ongoing effects.

== Analysis ==

Presumably, the wizard casting Finite Incantatem must be more powerful, possibly significantly more powerful, than the wizard casting the original spell, or Finite Incantatem would be taught as a defensive spell and would be much more widely used in dueling. As it is, we only see this spell used twice: in the Dueling Club, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] uses it to stop all of the jinxes that have been fired by the students, and after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle in the Ministry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] uses it to stop the Tarantallegra curse that is affecting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]].

Some jinxes have more of a one-shot effect; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stupefy]], for instance, which renders someone unconscious. Finite Incantatem would have no effect on jinxes of that nature.

== Overview ==

'''''Morsmordre''''' is a spell that conjures the Dark Mark.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] symbolizes very black magic. When cast, this spell produces a large, luminous green skull that hangs in the air. This is Lord Voldemort's sign, which the Death Eaters used to leave as a calling card over a site where they had worked their evil.

== Analysis ==

The Dark Mark is actually the name of the sigil: a skull with a snake twisting through it. Death Eaters are tattooed with this mark on their left forearm. Morsmordre is a spell that produces a form of the Dark Mark, made of glowing green particles, that hovers in the air.

''Morsmordre'' is a spell known only to Death Eaters, and the appearance of the Dark Mark in the air over the Quidditch World Cup is a clear indication that there is at least one Death Eater still at large and still willing to be identified as such. This causes immediate panic on the part of the crowd, who all remember times when that mark was left floating above a house that had been destroyed.

After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord_Voldemort|Voldemort's]] return, we would expect to see it more often; however, it does not reappear in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. During this time, Voldemort is secretly rebuilding his power, aided by the Ministry policy of denying his return. Having the Dark Mark appear would, of course, decrease the chance of remaining undetected – though it is likely the Ministry would simply try to spin things to avoid saying Voldemort had returned.

The Dark Mark reappears several times in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], where, as before, it is used to mark areas where Death Eaters have been working their evil. It is specifically noted as floating over the hut where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] was found murdered, and over [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] during the invasion by the Death Eaters.

Morsmordre is actually (intentionally or not) Norwegian. Directly translated it means &quot;''motherkillers''&quot;. This symbolizes the kinds of persons the Death Eaters are, they could kill their own mothers for the sake of Voldemort and purity of the race.

In addition to the Norwegian derivation, a Latin etymology is possible: mors, meaning death, and mordre, from the vulgar Latin mordere, &quot;to bite.&quot; This presumably refers either to the snake present in the image, or was more euphonic than the verb &quot;to eat&quot;; mors mordre - a Latin approximation of Death Eater.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page contains information on the modifications that Chinese tractor owners have made to their
tractors to improve the cooling system.

This page is part of the Chinese Tractor Maintenance book.
Go to the [[Chinese_Tractor_Maintenance]] book.

== Radiator Screen ==

On some Chinese tractors the radiator screen that is supposed to protect the radiator fins has holes that are too large, allowing small debri to fill the radiator fins.

* Several tractor owners have replaced their screens with inexpensive carboard framed furnace filters. Buy a filter that is larger than the original screen and cut it to size to fit inside the metal screen rails. These filters are easier to replace then try to clean when they get dirty. They can be removed and reinstall 2 or 3 times before they begin to deteriorate.

* Another option is to buy a stiffer and hardier furnace filter that is biodegradable. It is moister resistance and be clean and resinstalled more than 3 times before deterioration.

* You can keep your original screen a wrap it with aluminum window screen that can be obtained at hardware store. This has the advantage of keepin the original screen to protect the radiator from being damaged by objects, etc.

Regardless of the method used to reduce the size of debri entering the raditor fins, it is still
necessory from time to time to remove dust from the radiator fins.

== Thermostat == 
The thermostat need not be adjusted but just going to the supplier for a new one.

I now teach all my classes at NAU online and since no one was doing anything in geography, I though I would move a book that I have online over here.  I actually first posted this over a year ago, but never did anything more with it.  I plan to do that now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">McInerney, Claire.  &quot;Knowledge Management and the Dynamic Nature of Knowledge.&quot;  Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 53 (2002): 1009:1018.

Knowledge Management (KM), once the sole domain of the corporate world, is now necessary to many information disciplines.  Information professionals need an understanding of what makes KM effective.  This understanding begins with knowledge as an ever-changing entity, made up of human experiences, emotions, and senses.  Scholars have identified knowledge to include the tacit (internal) and the explicit (manifestations of the internal).  Organizations have developed KM systems to facilitate both tacit and explicit knowledge, and the sharing of the two, through discussion, training, team-building, etc.  The author contends that (despite critics’ assessment that KM is incapable of a process so subjective and human) examples abound from the corporate world where KM has maximized profitability, innovation, etc.  Based on these examples, the author stresses principles to guide effective KM.  These include an environment dedicated to valuing individual experience and open communication as a means to share and learn; using technology to accommodate knowledge (emphasizing currency, accessibility, etc.); and an understanding that KM requires a rooting in both the tacit and explicit forms of knowledge.  The fluidity of knowledge is well-developed.  However, how this evolving knowledge affects KM is illustrated by examples solely from the realm of corporate organizations.  If KM is increasing in scope beyond the traditional organizations, there is a surprising lack of even anecdotal evidence in new, information-based environments.  The implications given for information professionals are a rehashing of the models that have served corporations.  It is unclear how KM, armed with a sense of the dynamic and human nature of knowledge, will look different in an information-based environment.  This article would be better served if it distinguished how effective KM would look, feel, and operate under the expanding information professions versus the traditional corporate model.

NOTES—PP. 1-20
THE RISE OF AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURAL CIVILIZAITONS
FROM HUMAN PREHISTORY TO EARLY CIVILIZATIONS

	In today’s society, communication is steadily improving. People worldwide may now fully interact (i.e. telephone, internet, radio, television). – International interaction has positives and negatives in various ways. Societies greatly influenced by one another. To fully understand world history, time periods are used to understand the subject. Properties of civilizations: state organization, family values, technological advance/change, social structure. Civilizations never truly isolated – International trade, migrations, disease, missionary religions. It may seem as though the earth is growing “smaller”, but in actuality, it is growing more complex.  
	Humans have existed for roughly 2-2.5 million years (1/4000 of time). Human drawbacks: aggressiveness, violence, babies’ dependency for long periods (limits activities of women), awareness of death concept. Positives: opposable thumbs, relatively high sexual drive, omnivores (don’t depend on certain types of food for survival), facial expressions (enhance communication skills), elaborate speech. 
*Paleolithic Age: (until 14, 000 years ago)
*simple tool use (rocks, sticks)
*fire tamed for usage (750,000 years ago)
*Erect stature, growing brain capacity
*Hunters-gatherers
*Slow population growth
*Significant equality between the sexes
*Speech developed with Homo Erectus (limited use)
*Cave paintings to explain and communicate
*Religious beliefs/burial customs emerged (goddesses)
*Spread of humans throughout the world – fueled by pressure to find food
*Animal skins for clothing
*Bans, tribes, clans

Mesolithic Age:
*Improved tool usage
*Pots and baskets for storage
*Domestication of more animals – Transition phase (i.e. cows)

Neolithic Age:
*Invention of agriculture
*Creation of cities
*Continued domestication
*Pottery, jewels, knives crafted
*Famine/disease spread
*Permanent communities
*Advanced tools
*Specialization of labor

Neolithic Revolution: Population increases and climate improves – Search for new and reliable sources of food. Big game animals lessen in numbers and smaller animals can’t sustain larger populations.
9,000 B.C.E. – People becoming dependent on regular harvests. New animals domesticated in Middle East and Asia – pigs, sheep, goats, cattle. 
Farming first developed in Fertile Crescent region – barley and wheat are abundant. Knowledge of agriculture spread to India, north Africa, and Europe. Agriculture developed independently in China (cultivation of rice).  

Neolithic Revolution: misleading – agriculture was not a sudden shift from Hunting-gathering. Although, the term is relevant to the magnitude of importance. 

Early agriculture supported more people than hunting – People could settle permanently in some areas. Agriculture required more work than hunting. People could afford to build homes/villages - Disease suffering because of higher population density. 

Areas isolated from agriculture ideals include: South Africa, Australia, islands of Southeast Asia, and northern Japan. 

Agriculture initiated in the Americas around 5,000 B.C.E. Agriculture set the basis for rapid change in societies. Specialization of labor (i.e. basket weaving, pottery, bronze work). Farmers’ economic center was agriculture while many herders relied on farmers.

4,000 B.C.E. – First metal tools – common in the Middle East – Useful to agricultural and herding societies – metal hoes helped to farm the land effectively. Agricultural peoples had toolmakers that specialized in exchange for food.

Woodworking = more elaborate – metal replaced stone, bone, and fire in cutting/joining wood. Iron introduced by herders that invaded the Middle East in 1,500 B.C.E. 

Agriculture encouraged civilization – hunting peoples lived in small band (40-60 individuals) and couldn’t settle. 

Slash and burn agriculture: people would burn off trees, farm intensely for a few years until the soil depleted, and move on. Houses could be well built, wells dug for water, ‘luxuries’.

== Wikiversity ==

Heya! Im new to the whole concept of editing wikis so I hope this is the proper way of contacting you!

I ran across Wikiversity just a few days ago and was very interested in getting involved. Seeing as you're the most active person in my favorite field on the site, I thought I would drop a line and say hello. I was wondering what your take on wikiversity is at the moment. Briefly fill me in and let me know if I can help in the history department if you get a few minutes! I'm currently a university student studying both computer science and history. Like I say I would be very interested in getting involved somehow. 

Feel free to write back via talk or even email me at tyson@myhres.net
